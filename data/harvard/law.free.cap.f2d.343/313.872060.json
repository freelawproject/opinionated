At sentencing, on June 19,1964, appellant asked the court to admit him to bail pending appeal. This exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-25\">\u201cThe Court : What was the previous bail ? Do you have the file ? Before it was set at $10,000. I see no reason for reducing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-26\">\u201cMr. Garber [Defense counsel]: He was unable to make it. In other words, the bail will be set at $10,-000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-27\">\u201cThe Court: What is your idea about that, Mr. Blackwell [Prosecuting attorney] ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-28\">\u201cMr. Blackwell: If Your Honor please, as I have indicated at the beginning, I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-29\">\u201cThe Court: Now, if you do not know about it, I can wait for somebody\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-30\">\u201cMr. Blackwell: I don\u2019t know about it, Your Honor. However, I agree with Your Honor that if the bond is a certain bond, after conviction- and sentence, I don\u2019t know of any reason why it should be lowered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-31\">\u201cThe Court : I think I will leave it at $10,000 then.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-32\">Not being able to provide bond in the amount set, appellant moved for reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>tion of bond in this court on December 5, 1964. We requested the District Court to \u201cadvise [this court] as to the considerations and reasons which led the District Court, (1) to seem to find that appellant was a fit subject to be released on bail pending appeal and (2) notwithstanding to set bail in the amount of $10,000 in order to \u2018insure the presence of the defendant,\u2019 Rule 46(c), Fed.R. Grim.P., when it appeared from the record that appellant was unable to furnish bail in that amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The court replied to our request, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax2\">\u201cAppellant is now 23, has been in and out of correctional institutions since he was 12. He has a history of sexual misconduct involving violence. On a prior occasion he was charged with the commission of the offense of having carnal knowledge of a female under 16 years of age (\u00a7 22-2801, D.C.Code, 1951 ed.). Although from the papers he appears to have committed this offense and with force and violence, he was permitted to plead guilty to assault with intent to commit carnal knowledge and sentenced under the Youth Corrections Act. He apparently received no benefit from the procedures imposed under that Act. Indeed he became a serious disciplinary problem on account of sexual acts while incarcerated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">\u201cIn view of this history of sexual misconduct and the serious nature of the crime of which he was convicted, it was my judgment that appellant was not a proper subject for enlargement on bail pending appeal and that the public interest dictated that his motion for such bail be denied. However, the recent trend of judicial decisions has been toward liberalization of allowance of bail</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">pending appeal and some members of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia have expressed the view that with the exception of certain capital cases, enlargement on bail pending appeal should be the rule. Because of this trend and these expressions, this court yielded to that view, and allowed bail, fixing the amount at $10,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">\u201c * * * So far as appellant\u2019s financial ability to give bail in the amount fixed is concerned, I assume that he is an indigent because he filed an oath setting forth his in-digency. It does not always follow, however, that such indigency results in a failure to give bond, as the records of this court will show. But, be that as it. may, his apparent inability to furnish bail in the <em>amount </em>fixed, is not the sole criterion, but * * * there are three other criteria set forth in Rule 46(c) to be weighed in fixing the <em>amount. </em>Weighing them, it was my judgment that the amount fixed was reasonable and proper and was necessary to insure appellant\u2019s presence if and when required, and that any amount less would be inadequate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">The \u201cthree other\u201d criteria to which the court refers are (1) \u201cThe nature and circumstances of the offense charged, [(2)] the weight of the evidence against [the defendant] * * * and [(3)] the character of the defendant.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> High' monetary bail is not justified simply because the defendant\u2019s character is \u201cbad\u201d or because the evidence is heavily against him. It is justified only if the defendant\u2019s character reveals a propensity to flee, or if the evidence is so strong against him that he would be thus induced to flee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And because release on bail pending appeal is \u201cheavily favored,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> there is no automatic presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>that \u201cbad character\u201d or strong evidence of guilt will induce flight. Each case requires individual determination. \u201cSince the function of bail is limited, the fixing of bail for any individual defendant must be based upon standards relevant to the purpose of assuring the presence of <em>that </em>defendant.\u201d Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5, 72 S.Ct. 1, 4, 96 L.Ed. 3, (1951) (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">There is little information on the record before us to establish that appellant is likely to flee if released on bail. He has considerable family ties in the District of Columbia and has lived here since 1950. The District Court gives no factual basis for its apparent conclusion that appellant is likely to flee, beyond stating that the evidence established guilt \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and that appellant had previously been imprisoned for a similar offense. The Government\u2019s brief in this court states that appellant was a \u201cfugitive * * * for four months in 1960-61.\u201d The record before us does not support this statement. The Government\u2019s brief gives no details of appellant\u2019s alleged fugitivity, and an investigation report by the District of Columbia Bail Project indicates only that \u201cappellant has previously been admitted to bail in 1959 in the sum of $500 * * * on charges of assault and carrying a deadly weapon. There is no indication from the records that bond was forfeited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">But, beyond the inadequacy of the factual basis for the court\u2019s apparent determination that appellant was likely to flee if released, there is a more serious lack of information. Appellant could furnish the required bond, if at all, only through a professional bondsman. The trial court\u2019s failure to inquire into the conditions on which a bondsman would provide bond casts doubt on whether bail was fixed \u201cupon standards relevant to the purpose of assuring the presence of that [appellant].\u201d Stack v. Boyle, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">The court should have determined, for example, whether a bondsman would be willing to furnish appellant $10,000 bond without requiring any collateral.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If no collateral were required, then the threat of forfeiture would be less likely to deter appellant\u2019s flight than if he had a personal stake in forfeiture. Because the court did not inquire into this question, it must be assumed that the amount of bond was- set, not to deter appellant\u2019s flight through threat of personal forfeiture, but' only to give the bondsman an incentive to pursue appellant if he flees. It is, however, questionable whether $10,000 forfeiture is the lowest sum for that purpose. Moreover, the court made no inquiry regarding bondsmen\u2019s practices in this regard. The court should have determined whether the bondsman would rely on his own resources, or the police, in pursuing appellant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If he relied on police, then financial bond would serve no purpose in deterring appellant from flight.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>out the foregoing inquiry the court could not reasonably conclude that $10,000 bond was necessary, or adequate, to \u201cinsure the presence\u201d of appellant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Inquiry might have revealed that no bondsman would be willing to provide bond in any amount,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or that the bondsman would require collateral which was not available to appellant. In that event, bond in any amount would in effect constitute a denial of bail pending appeal. It may be that the District'Court intended to deny bail because there was no adequate assurance of appellant\u2019s presence \u2014 either by way of financial assurances,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or ties in the community, or such devices as release subject to supervision of the United States Probation Office.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If so, it should have specified the reason. To deny the reality of bail while maintaining the fiction, perverts and distorts the administration of bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">It would appear from the District Court\u2019s reply to our inquiry that bond was set high enough to deny release</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">pending appeal because the court thought appellant\u2019s release would endanger the community. The court said: \u201c[A]pellant was 'not a proper subject for enlargement on. bail pending appeal and * * * the public interest dictated that his motion for such bail be denied.\u201d Appellant had a \u201chistory of sexual misconduct involving violence\u201d and was also convicted of an assault with intent to rape which allegedly occurred only one month after he had been released on parole from imprisonment for a previous conviction on a similar charge. Although danger to the community is not a consideration for denying bail pending trial in non-capital cases,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it may be a consideration for denying bail pending appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> I submit, however, that it is not a proper consideration in setting the <em>amount </em>of bail. Setting high bail to deny release \u201cdiscriminate [s] between the dangerous rich and the dangerous poor\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and masks the difficult problems of predicting future behavior which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>is, in itself, \u201cfraught with danger of excesses and injustice \"* * <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Familiar principles should make courts reluctant to deny bail pending appeal on the ground that release would endanger the community. And denial must be supported by a scrupulous inquiry into appellant\u2019s past history and all other relevant circumstances. No such inquiry is revealed by the record here. I would not, however, remand the case for further inquiry at this time since the appeal is scheduled to be heard very shortly and the circumstances affecting the issue of bail may be mooted or altered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">.
