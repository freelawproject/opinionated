A direct action was then instituted against Travelers Insurance Company, the liability insurer of Crescent. Appellant\u2019s theory of recovery was that he was injured by the negligence of one Charles Davis who allegedly was an \u201cexecutive officer\u201d of Crescent within the terms of the insurance policy in question. Davis served somewhat as the general manager of Crescent but was not an elected officer and had no authority to sign checks. The appellees, contending that appellant\u2019s sole remedy was under the Louisiana workmen\u2019s compensation statute, moved for summary judgment on the ground that Davis was not an \u201cexecutive officer\u201d within the terms of the policy. The trial court granted the motion and appellant brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">The appellant contends that the question of whether or not Davis was an \u201cexecutive officer\u201d is factual in nature and should have been submitted to a jury for determination. This same contention was thoroughly discussed and rejected in Bruce v. Travelers Ins. Co., 266 F.2d 781 (5th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">We are convinced that the ruling complained of was correct and we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
