Appellant\u2019s counsel now moves for disclosure of certain Juvenile Court records as essential in presenting this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">District of Columbia Code \u00a7 11-1586(b) (Supp. Ill, 1964) provides that Juvenile Court social records<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cshall be made available * * * to any court before which the child may appear.\u201d Pursuant to this provision, we ordered the Juvenile Court to transmit to this court appellant\u2019s social records for <em>in camera </em>inspection. Compare Kent v. Reid, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 330, 334-335, 316 F.2d 331, 335-336 (1963). We also requested from the Juvenile Court \u201ca statement of its views as to what parts of appellant\u2019s social records are so confidential that appellant\u2019s counsel should be denied access.\u201d Order entered Sept. 10, 1964. Chief Judge Miller of the Juvenile Court responded in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">\u201cOur statute covering this subject does not use the word \u201cconfidential.\u201d I am c(uite aware that there have been frequent references to the necessity for preserving the confidentiality of <em>all </em>social records. This represents, in my opinion, an institutional position which is so broad as to be unrealistic and impractical. On the other hand, turning over of the entire social file to an attorney would encourage \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d and litigation of matters of a quasi-privileged nature elicited from juveniles, their parents and other interested parties. What should be applied in any individual case as to the documents in a social file which may be made available to an attorney for the juvenile and the government is a set of standards against which to measure the particular request of the juvenile\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-14\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-15\">\u201cIn the light of the foregoing and consistent with the spirit of Section 11-1586(b), as well as our experiences with such records, any set of standards to be applied should, in my opinion, be confined to these two:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-16\">\u201c1. The document must bear on the purpose for which the juvenile\u2019s counsel has requested examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-17\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The document should not be one where secrecy must be preserved as to the source of information supplied to the Juvenile Court in confidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-18\">In the present case, appellant filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the Juvenile Court did not waive jurisdiction until eleven months after appellant had been arrested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>for the alleged offense and that this delay between arrest and waiver deprived appellant of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. Based upon its examination of appellant\u2019s Juvenile Court social records, the court ruled that the Juvenile Court\u2019s delay'in waiving jurisdiction was not -improper. Although the court refused to disclose the social records upon which it relied, it did briefly summarize entries made in the social records during the eleven months between the present arrest and waiver. But the court did not summarize any of the social records concerning appellant\u2019s Juvenile Court history during the four years prior to his arrest on the present charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The trial court found that the Juvenile Court delayed waiver because it sought to exhaust treatment possibilities in its own facilities, and waived jurisdiction only after these resources proved inadequate. For this purpose consideration by the Juvenile Court of appellant\u2019s entire past history would have been necessary in deciding between treatment and waiver, and by the District Court in reviewing the propriety of the eleven month delay. Because the request involves all appellant\u2019s social records and because appellant necessarily challenges the propriety of the Juvenile Court\u2019s waiver, the present request for disclosure is governed by the principles which apply generally to disclosure of social records when waiver of jurisdiction is in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">District of Columbia Code \u00a7 11-1586(b) (Supp. Ill, 1964) provides that Juvenile Court social records</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">\u201cshall be withheld from indiscriminate public inspection, except that they shall be made available by rule or special order of court to such persons, governmental and private agencies, and institutions as have a legitimate interest in the protection, welfare, treatment, and rehabilitation of the child under 18 years of age * * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Appellant\u2019s counsel says that a \u201clegitimate interest in the protection * * * of the child\u201d exists here. But the Government argues that \u00a7 11-1586(a), which allows inspection of certain Juvenile Court records by \u201cduly authorized attorneys,\u201d specifically excludes \u201csocial records\u201d and that the absence of any reference to attorneys in subsection (b) reveals a statutory scheme to bar attorneys from access to social records.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">We disagree with the Government\u2019s reading of the statute. Under the express terms of \u00a7 11-1586 (a) attorneys may see, <em>as of rights </em>all Juvenile Court legal records;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we think it clear that subsection (b) allows an attorney to inspect social records <em>in limited circumstances.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>These circumstances are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>not specified; they must be determined in individual cases according to the purposes of the Juvenile Court Act for the \u201cprotection, welfare, treatment, and rehabilitation of the child.\u201d Because waiver by the Juvenile Court may be set aside by this court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or by the District Court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> either court, in aid of its jurisdiction, may order disclosure of Juvenile Court social records to an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In this court or the District Court, the attorney\u2019s constitutionally sanctioned adversarial role gives him a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d generally in seeing his client\u2019s Juvenile Court social records.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But even if the attorney has such interest, disclosure may not be required in all cireumstances. Confidentiality may be justified, for example, where there is genuine need to conceal the identity of informants or where the information would disrupt family relationships or where disclosure would unduly interfere with the treatment or rehabilitation of the child.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Whether disclosure should be granted in spite of competing considerations will depend upon (a) the importance of the issue, for which disclosure is sought, to the welfare or freedom of the child; and (b) the relevance, generously construed, of the requested records to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-19\">Where, as here, the child\u2019s attorney challenges waiver by the Juvenile Court, the need for confidentiality of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>parts of the social record must be compelling in order to bar disclosure. In effect, waiver is a judicial determination that the child is beyond the rehabilitative philosophy of the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such determination may well discourage adult authorities from expending scarce resources in rehabilitative efforts. And the disabilities resulting from conviction in the District Court are in sharp contrast with the effects of a Juvenile Court commitment which \u201cdoes not operate to impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by conviction, and a child is not deemed a criminal by reason of an adjudication.\u201d D.C.CODE \u00a7 16-2308 (Supp. Ill, 1964). Waiver is critically important for the child who may be abandoned as \u201cincorrigible\u201d and for the society which has thus abandoned the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">All of the social records concerning the child are usually relevant to waiver since the Juvenile Court must be deemed to consider the entire history of the child in determining waiver. The relevance of particular items must be construed generously. Since an attorney has no certain knowledge of what the social records contain, he cannot be expected to demonstrate the relevance of particular items in his request.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">The child\u2019s attorney must be advised of the information upon which the Juvenile Court relied in order to assist effectively in the determination of the waiver question, by insisting upon the statutory command that waiver can be ordered only after \u201cfull investigation,\u201d and by guarding against action of the Juvenile Court beyond its discretionary authority.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">We remand the record in this case to the District Court for supplemental proceedings to determine, pursuant to the standards discussed, the extent to which the social records may be disclosed to appellant\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-10\">. \u201cSocial records\u201d primarily are reports of investigations concerning the child, including an \u201cinvestigation of the home and environmental situation of the child, his previous history, and the circumstances [which brought him before the court] * * * \u201d and reports about his \u201cconduct and condition\u201d while under supervision if he had been confined or placed on probation.

Where waiver of jurisdiction is in issue before the Juvenile Court, it would appear that an attorney has a \u201clegitimate interest in the protection, welfare, treatment, and rehabilitation of the child\u201d which supports disclosure of social records. The informal, non-adversarial nature of the Juvenile Court proceedings, which is often cited to limit the measure of attorney interest and participation required for the \u201cprotection of the child,\u201d rests on the premise that no criminal sanctions are threatened. Compare Shioutakon v. District of Columbia, 98 U.S. App.D.C. 371, 236 F.2d 666, 60 A.L.R. 2d 686 (1956); McDaniel v. Shea, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 15, 278 F.2d 460 (1960); Pee v.

But since waiver of jurisdiction directly invokes a threat of criminal sanctions the ground for limitation of the attorney\u2019s role disappears.

We recently held in Kent v. United States, No. 17935, decided Oct. 26, 1964, that the Juvenile Court was justified in refusing disclosure of social records \u201cin advance of waiver\u201d on the narrow ground that the requested records were not relevant to the attorney\u2019s essential purpose in requesting disclosure. The attorney\u2019s \u201ccentral purpose was to have [the social records] examined by [the child\u2019s own] psychiatric experts. There is no claim that these experts needed the records in arriving at their diagnosis.\u201d 119 U.S. App.D.C. at -, 343 F.2d at 247. We held that the attorney did not need the records for the only purpose for which he sought them in the Juvenile Court. Later, in the District Court, Kent\u2019s attorney was granted disclosure of all social records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b330-9\">. We note that disclosure of social- records to the child\u2019s attorney does not permit indiscriminate public knowledge of those records.
