The present appeal is from the Tax Court\u2019s determination that the stock was worth $50.00 per share. Our review of the record and a consideration of the briefs and oral arguments convince us that this determination is well supported and should not be disturbed, for we are far from prepared to say that it is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
