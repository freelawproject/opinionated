We affirm, adopting the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-27\">The excellent services which led to the award in question were just those which the husband had been instructed to perform in the course of his employment. The statute under which the award to him was made does not authorize awards for \u201creligious, charitable, scientific, educational, artistic, literary, or civic achievement\u201d (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 74(b)) ; rather, it authorizes discretionary awards by department heads to those Government employees who \u201ccontribute to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of Government operations or who perform special acts or services in the public interest in connection with or related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>their official employment' (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2123(a)). The awards are thus made for performance as an employee; that the achievement rewarded might in some contexts be classifiable as \u201ccivic\u201d or another of the statutory categories of \u00a7 74 (b) is not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">FAHY, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
