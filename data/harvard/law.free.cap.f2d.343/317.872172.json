This claim, it is further alleged was not argued on appeal because it was not supported by then-existing law, and was not argued in the earlier petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>because counsel was not then aware of the Supreme Court decisions in Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1964); and Muschette v. United States, 378 U.S. 569, 84 S.Ct. 1927, 12 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1964). Petitioner\u2019s claim appears to have substantial merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, I consider that the pendency of the application for certiorari does not divest us of jurisdiction. I therefore vote to grant leave to file this petition and to grant rehearing <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-27\">. See Remmer v.
