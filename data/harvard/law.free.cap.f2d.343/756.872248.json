The Bankruptcy court refused to recognize any lien; the District Court affirmed, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-22\">This is not a case, as appellant argues, of a right to perfect, after bankruptcy, a lien previously initiated or created, cf. Bankr.Act, \u00a7 67, sub. b, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107, sub. b, but is merely an attempt to impose a special order of distribution upon the Bankruptcy court after the rights of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>parties had already been fixed by the filing of the petition. That this construction is not due to inadvertence of the draftsman is emphasized by the further provision to the effect that the so-called lien, is subordinate to all liens otherwise created whether before or after the furnishing of the materials. In other words, it is the filing of the bankruptcy proceedings which, supposedly, creates the lien. Whatever may be the purpose of this statute, or its effect in other circumstances, it is plainly not within the exceptions permitted to a state to control the distribution oif assets in the hands of the Bankruptcy court. Cf. Commercial Credit Co. v. Davidson, 5 Cir., 1940, 112 F.2d 54, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
