Defendants by answer denied all allegations of the complaint relevant to plaintiff\u2019s claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-22\">Following a lengthy trial, the Distict Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law and a judgment order in favor of plaintiff, from which defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-23\">While numerous contested issues are argued in this Court, we think the principal ones arise from plaintiff\u2019s contention (1) that defendants by reason of a license agreement entered into between plaintiff and Royal are estopped to deny the validity of the trademarks, and (2) that defendants by reason of a consent decree to which plaintiff and Royal were parties are bound under the doctrine of res judi-cata to recognize their validity. Only if issues (1) and (2) are decided adversely to plaintiff do we reach defendants\u2019 contention that plaintiff\u2019s trademark \u201cYo-Yo\u201d is invalid as a generic and descriptive name.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-24\">On July 23, 1948, plaintiff\u2019s predecessor (a co-partnership) entered into an agreement with Louis Marx &amp; Company, Inc. and Charmore Company, whereby the licensor granted them a license to use the trademark \u201cYo-Yo.\u201d The agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>provided that \u201cshould Marx abandon the manufacture or/and sale of the bandalore types of toy spinning tops, manufactured and sold by it, then Duncan shall have the right to cancel the license granted herein upon thirty (30) days\u2019 notice in writing given to Marx.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">In 1951, Royal\u2019s predecessor brought an action for declaratory judgment in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, by which it sought a cancellation of plaintiff\u2019s registration, \u201cYo-Yo,\u201d on the ground that it was the generic or a descriptive name of the article upon which it was used. Brown was not a party to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">On September 14, 1955, plaintiff entered into a license agreement with Royal by which it granted to Royal \u201can exclusive and non-transferable right to use Licen-sor\u2019s trade-mark, \u2018Yo-Yo,\u2019 on or upon or in association with bandalore tops.\u201d This agreement provided, \u201cThe parties hereto agree that they will enter into appropriate papers in the United States District Court in the aforesaid litigation [referring to the action for declaratory judgment] wherein said trade-marks- shall be held to be valid and existing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">On November 21, 1955, a consent judgment was entered which found plaintiff to be the owner of the trademark registrations for \u201cYo-Yo\u201d and for \u201cGenuine Duncan Yo-Yo.\u201d The judgment recited, \u201cEach of the above trademarks is applied and used in connection with a disc-shaped top manipulated up and down on a string, more commonly known as a banda-lore top or quiz.\u201d The judgment determined that the trademarks \u201care valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">On September 6, 1961, plaintiff\u2019s attorney directed a letter of cancellation to the Marx and Charmore Companies, the licensees named in the 1948 license agreement stating, \u201cPlease consider this letter as the thirty-days\u2019 written notice.\u201d This notice was given as required by a provision contained in that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">We need not cite or discuss cases which support the general rule that a trademark licensee is estopped to dispute validity or that a consent decree, the same as any other decree, is binding on the parties. Royal contends that these rules are not applicable because plaintiff, as an inducement for the 1955 license agreement, fraudulently represented that there was no outstanding license agreement when as a matter of fact it knew or should have known the 1948 agreement with Louis Marx &amp; Company, Inc. and Charmore Company was in force and effect. In any event, Royal argues that the license agreement was invalid because of a mutual mistake as to a material fact and that the consent decree was entered as a result of and as provided for in the license agreement and was, therefore, tainted with the same fraud or mutual mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s response to these contentions is based upon a finding by the District Court, \u201cThis license [referring to the 1948 license to Marx and Charmore] was cancelled by mutual agreement in 1952,\u201d and \u201cCorrespondence between Marx and plaintiff indicates an acknowledgment of the cancellation of 1952.\u201d In our judgment, these findings as well as the argument predicated thereon are clearly erroneous and must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">Plaintiff in support of its cancellation theory relies upon the testimony of Donald Duncan, Sr., that the license was can-celled in 1952 by mutual agreement in a conversation with Marx. Admittedly he gave no thirty-day written notice of c\u00e1n-cellation as required by the Duncan-Marx agreement. Nor was such a notice given until 1961, when it was given by plaintiff\u2019s attorney. Plaintiff attempts to bolster its contention on this score by inferences drawn from correspondence between Duncan and Marx following the alleged oral cancellation. An examination of this correspondence as a whole completely negates the inferences which plaintiff professes to discern. For instance, on July 14, 1961, the attorneys for Marx wrote plaintiff, stating, \u201cOur client is licensed by you to use the name \u2018Yo-Yo\u2019 as provided in the 1948 agreement.\u201d On July 26, 1961, Marx wrote plaintiff, \u201cWe have an agreement to that effect (our right to use the name \u2018Yo-Yo\u2019) giving us full permission to use it.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>(This is the same Marx with whom Duncan claimed to have had the oral agreement of cancellation in 1952.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Even after plaintiff\u2019s counsel gave written notice of cancellation in his letter of September 6,1961, Marx was still contending that its 1948 agreement with plaintiff was in effect. In response to the written notice of cancellation, the attorneys for Marx wrote that they \u201c * * * consider this attempted- cancellation to be without validity or effect.\u201d It may be that when plaintiff\u2019s counsel gave written notice of cancellation in 1961, he was without knowledge of the alleged oral cancellation in 1952, or if he had such knowledge, recognized it as futile. In, this connection it is pertinent to note that Donald F. Duncan, Jr., plaintiff\u2019s president, testified that to his knowledge the 1948 agreement with Marx and Charmore had not been cancelled and was still in full force and effect in 1955, when the license agreement was entered into between plaintiff and Royal.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Thus, the conclusion is inescapable that the 1948 license agreement between plaintiff and Marx and Charmore was in full force and effect at the time plaintiff entered into a license agreement with Royal and granted to it \u201can exclusive\u201d right. Royal\u2019s president, Joseph T. Radovan, testified that he would not have settled Royal\u2019s suit against plaintiff for declaratory judgment if he had known there was an outstanding license agreement with some other company. The most charitable characterization which can be made of plaintiff\u2019s misrepresentation is that it was a mutual mistake, relied upon by Royal to its prejudice. The license agreement relied on is, therefore, invalid. General Finance Corp. et al. v. Keystone Credit Corp. et al., 50 F.2d 872, 878 (4th Cir.); Almon Heath v. A. B. Dick Co., 253 F.2d 30, 35 (7th Cir.); Foster v. Carlin, 218 F.2d 795, 801 (4th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Furthermore, -plaintiff, on June 28,1961, gave Royal formal notice of cancellation of the license agre\u00e9ment, and it has been held that an estoppel by a licensee to deny the validity of licensor\u2019s trademark expires with the license. Bucky et al. v. Sebo et al., 208 F.2d 304, 305; Eskimo Pie Corp. v. National Ice Cream Co., 6 Cir., 26 F.2d 901, 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention relative to res judicata is based on the fallacious contention, as stated on brief, that \u201cas a result of that decree \u2014 1955 consent decree \u2014 an agreement \u2014 license agreement between plaintiff and Royal \u2014 was entered into.\u201d The Court embraced this error by finding, \u201cPursuant to that decree [1955 consent decree] a license agreement was entered into in which Royal Tops\u2019 predecessor was given the right to use the trademark \u2018Yo-Yo\u2019 * * Both the contention and the finding are manifestly erroneous. The consent decree was entered into as a result of and pursuant to the license agreement rather than vice versa. The latter was entered into September 14, 1955, and the former November 21, 1955, more than two months later. Moreover, the license agreement, as previously shown, expressly provided for the entry of the consent decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">During the pendency of the action for declaratory judgment and after the parties had expended much time and effort in preparation for trial, plaintiff proposed to Royal that it would grant an exclusive license on the condition that Royal recognize the validity of plaintiff\u2019s trademark, which was done by the license agreement, later embodied in the consent decree. Thus, the consent decree inherited all the infirmities of the license agreement. In our judgment, it furnishes no legal basis for an application of the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">Our discussion so far relative to license estoppel and res judicata has pertained to defendant Royal. What we have said applies with even greater cogency to defendant Brown, who was not a party to the 1955 license agreement between plaintiff and Royal or to the action between those parties which culminated in the declaratory judgment. In fact, at the time of the entry of the judgment, as well as the execution of the license agreement, Brown was an employee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>plaintiff and did not become associated with Royal until some five years later. Plaintiff on brief states, <em>\u201cIn </em>the instant case, Brown, as an agent of Royal Tops, derived his right to sell return tops under the trademark \u2018Yo-Yo\u2019 through the license which plaintiff has granted to Royal Tops. Thus, like defendant Royal, he is subject to licensee estoppel. Furthermore, Brown and Royal Tops have an identity of interest in the validity of the trademark \u2018Yo-Yo.\u2019 Since this question was previously litigated by Royal Tops, it precludes Brown from attacking the validity through the doctrine of res judicata.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"> Whether Brown subsequently became an agent and therefore in privity with Royal is a much controverted issue which need not be resolved at this point. Assuming for our present purpose that such relationship existed, it is not discernible how licensee estoppel could be invoked against him by reason of a license to which he was not a party and which was entered into with Royal some five years previously. It is even more far-fetched to conclude that he was bound by the consent decree entered in an action to which he was not a party, in which he had no interest and no right to be heard, even had he so desired. None of the cases cited on the controverted issue as to whether Brown became the agent of Royal supports the contention that he is estopped by reason of the license with Royal or by the consent judgment to raise the question as to the validity of the trademark \u201cYo-Yo.\u201d Particularly is this so in view of our conclusion that the doctrines of estoppel and res judicata are not applicable to Royal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">This brings us to the crucial issue of defendants\u2019 alleged infringement of plaintiff\u2019s trademarks. In support of their contention on this issue, defendants argue that the trademarks were improperly issued and, therefore, invalid on the ground that \u201cYo-Yo\u201d was and is a generic term, not amenable to valid registration. This argument embodies a twofold theory: first, that \u201cYo-Yo\u201d was the name of a toy in the Philippines prior to the manufacture of the toy in 1929 by plaintiff\u2019s predecessor, and that when introduced in this country it was adopted into the American language as descriptive; and second, that the word \u201cYo-Yo\u201d at the time of the trademark registrations was generic or has subsequently become so.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">An exhaustive study of the record and the cases leads us to the firm conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s trademarks were improperly registered and, therefore, invalid, or in any event that they have subsequently become such by reason of the general acceptance by the public of \u201cyo-yo\u201d as a descriptive name for the toy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">Obviously, it would unduly burden this opinion to review this voluminous record in detail, but we feel obliged to state the basic reasons for our conclusion. As noted, plaintiff commenced the manufacture of its toy in 1929. On November 1, 1932, Donald F. Duncan, Sr. obtained registration for his trademark \u201cGenuine Duncan Yo-Yo,\u201d which was shortly thereafter assigned to plaintiff, and on January 24, 1933, plaintiff obtained registration for its trademark \u201cYo-Yo.\u201d Each of these trademarks was for a toy of the bandalore type. Royal Tops Manufacturing Company, a predecessor of defendant Royal, commenced the manufacture of the same type of toy in the United States in 1937, applying at that time the word \u201cyo-yo\u201d to the packages containing the toys.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">Plaintiff in meeting the issue of invalidity places great stress upon two universally recognized principles for which we need cite no authority: (1) that the findings of the trial court are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>be accepted unless clearly erroneous, and (2) that trademarks are presumed to be valid. In this connection plaintiff also places much reliance upon a contention that \u201cYo-Yo\u201d is an arbitrary mark, a word which originated with Donald F. Duncan, Sr., and coined by him. No finding was made by the trial court on this point and, for reasons subsequently shown, we think the contention is fallacious.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Joseph Radovan, president of defendant Royal, an American of Philippine extraction, testified that he was born in the Philippines in 1909, resided there until after his graduation from high school, when he came to this country; that \u201cyo-yo\u201d was a Filipino game, a major children\u2019s pastime as early as he could remember; that the toy was never called by any name other than \u201cyo-yo\u201d in the Philippines; that \u201cyo-yo\u201d is a Filipino word in all dialects; that after he came to this country in 1931, he and other Filipinos worked for plaintiff\u2019s predecessor as \u201cyo-yo\u201d demonstrators until 1937, when he quit to form defendant Royal\u2019s predecessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We recognize that this witness was an interested party and that it is not our function to weigh the evidence but, as we shall, show, his testimony is so thoroughly and completely corroborated that in our view there is no sound basis for its rejection. In the first place, it is convincingly corroborated by a statement made by Donald F. Duncan, Sr., during the pendency of the proceeding in the Patent Office for registration of the trademark \u201cYo-Yo.\u201d On July 22, 1930, Flores Yo-Yo Corporation obtained registration of the trademark \u201cFlores Yo-Yo.\u201d The first application of Duncan, Sr. was rejected by the Patent Office examiner because of the trademark \u201cFlores Yo-Yo.\u201d In response to this rejection, on December 19, 1931, Duncan, Sr. argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\u201c * * * the applicant understands the term \u2018Yo-Yo\u2019 is used in the Philippine Islands to mean \u2018come back\u2019 or \u2018springy\u2019, and as the term was applied to the bandalore type of toy because it appears to be springy and. comes back, there is a question as to whether or not this term alone, if presented for registration, would not be held descriptive. Under this reasoning, it is assumed that the only feature common to the two marks embodying registrable matter is the term \u2018Yo-Yo\u2019 which, if descriptive, is incapable of exclusive appropriation and use by either the applicant or the registrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">**\u2022*\u00ab\u25a0** \u201cThe reference cited has been noted, but it is believed that the mark therein disclosed is merely \u2018Flores Yo-Yo', as distinguished from \u2018Duncan\u2019s Yo-Yo\u2019 or \u2018Genuine Duncan\u2019s Yo-Yo\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Thus, not only did the applicant recognize that \u201cYo-Yo\u201d was then in use in the Philippines as the name applied to a toy, but also the probability that it was a generic term incapable of exclusive appropriation. It is of more than ordinary significance that Duncan, Sr., while a witness for the plaintiff in the instant proceeding, was not asked to explain this statement, and he did not deny that at the time his applications were being processed he had the information which he then represented to have. This statement to the Patent Office, together with the previous registration of \u201cFlores Yo-Yo,\u201d in itself dispels any idea that \u201cyo-yo\u201d was a word coined by or originating with Duncan, Sr. It is pertinent to note that after the rejection of the first application of Duncan, Sr., he (or plaintiff\u2019s predecessor) acquired by assignment, presumably by purchase, the Flores registered trademark. It was after this that plaintiff\u2019s predecessor succeeded in obtaining its \u201cYo-Yo\u201d registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Defendants introduced the testimony of Dr. Henry Lee Smith, Jr., since 1956 Chairman of the Department of Anthropology and Linguistics and Professor of Linguistic English, State University of New York at Buffalo, who qualified as an expert linguist and etymologist, particularly in the Polynesian languages. No question was raised as to the qualifications or integrity of this witness. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>testified that at the request of counsel for defendants, he made a special study of the word \u201cyo-yo,\u201d and that in connection with that study he consulted, in addition to the documents introduced by plaintiff, major unabridged encyclopedias, current unabridged dictionaries, various bibliographical references, and with colleagues and children. As a result of his study, he expressed the definite opinion that the word \u201cyo-yo\u201d is a Malayo-Polynesian word of Philippine origin; that the toy itself is of Oriental origin, and that the word \"yo-yo\u201d was tied together with the toy in the Philippines and was introduced into the American language from that country. His testimony was buttressed by numerous documentary references, one of which was an article appearing in The Sunday Tribune Magazine of March 5, 1933, entitled, \u201cIs Yo-Yo from the Philippines,\u201d which quotes the assistant director of the Philippine National Library as saying that the word \u201cyo-yo\u201d is descriptive of the movement and sound of the toy and hence the toy is characteristically so called in Filipino Ianguag\u00e9s. Further, the article states that \u201cYo-Yo\u201d is a game known throughout the entire archipelago, where it is consistently used in a generic sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Another document introduced by defendants and discussed by Dr. Smith is an article appearing July 1, 1916, in the Scientific American Supplement, entitled, \u201cFilipino Toys.\u201d One of the toys shown is a \u201cyo-yo,\" which the article illustrates and describes in detail. It states, \u201c * * yo yo, however, are names very generally used throughout the islands.\u201d This article was published some fifteen years prior to registration of plaintiff\u2019s trademarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Patent No. 1,806,485, issued May 19, 1931, on a \u201cmusical toy,\u201d in its specifications describes \u201cYo-Yo\u201d as a top in ten different places.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Plaintiff argues that the proof fails to establish that \u201cYo-Yo\u201d is a word of foreign origin, used in the Philippine Islands as the generic name of the toy, relying chiefly upon the presumption of validity which attached to the allowance of the trademarks. With this contention we do not agree. In our judgment, the proof shows that the toy, long before it was introduced in this country, was in use in the Philippines and that its generic name was \u201cyo-yo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Defendants, in support of their contention that a word adopted from a foreign language and descriptive in that language cannot be legally appropriated as a trademark, rely upon Selchow &amp; Righter Co. v. Western Printing &amp; Lithographing Co. et al., D.C., 47 F.Supp. 322, 325, affirmed 7 Cir., 142 F.2d 707, cert. den. 323 U.S. 735, 65 S.Ct. 75, 89 L.Ed. 589; Holland et al. v. C. &amp; A. Import Corp. et al., 8 F.Supp. 259, 261, and Dadirrian v. Yacu-bian, 1 Cir., 98 F. 872, 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">In Selchow, this Court held that the owner of the trademark \u201cParcheesi\u201d was not entitled to an injunction against the use by others of the word \u201cPachisi\u201d since the latter was the Indian name of the Indian game. The District Court in that case quoted with approval the language of the Court in Selchow et al. v. Chaffee &amp; Selchow Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 132 F. 996, 1000, as follows (47 F.Supp. page 325):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE7\">\u201cThe one who first introduces a foreign game or article under its true name cannot monopolize either the game or the article or the name thereof * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">Plaintiff seeks without avail to distinguish Selchow on the basis that it was an agreed fact that the word used to describe the game in this country was the phonetic equivalent of the name of the game in India. The case here is even more in point because the name given the toy in this country was the same as that proven to have been used in the Philippines.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">In Holland, citing Dadirrian, the Court stated (8 F.Supp. page 261):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-12\">\u201cBy the weight of authority, a word commonly used in other countries to identify a kind of product and there in the public domain as a descriptive or generic name may not be appropriated here as a trade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>mark on that product, even though the person claiming the word was the one who introduced the product here and the word then had no significance to our people generally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">While we conclude that \u201cYo-Yo\u201d is a word which originated and was used in the Philippine Islands as the generic name of the toy and that the registration of such descriptive term was improper, we think we should not rest our decision solely on that basis. Assuming, therefore, contrary to what we think, that the marks were properly registered, there remains the issue as to whether \u201cYo-Yo\u201d in use became known to members of the public as the descriptive name of the toy.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Evidently in recognition of the fact that the term \u201cyo-yo\u201d had long since passed into the public domain, plaintiff in 1955, more than twenty years after the trademark registrations, commenced a widespread campaign to. characterize the toy with the generic term, \u201creturn top.\u201d Thus, the issue as made and tried was whether the generic name of the toy was \u201cYo-Yo,\u201d as claimed by defendants, or \u201creturn top,\u201d as claimed by plaintiff. Plaintiff has made a herculean effort to fasten upon the toy the generic term, \u201creturn top,\u201d as is evidenced by the many \u2014 perhaps hundreds \u2014 of times which the term is employed in its pleadings and in the Court\u2019s findings which were submitted by plaintiff. We shall refer to two findings as typical.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">\u201cPlaintiff has been engaged in the manufacture and sale of toys, including <em>return tops, </em>since at least January 1929 and is the owner of United States trademark registration No. 300,504 for the trademark Yo-Yo for <em>return tops </em>(renewed on January 24, 1953 under the Trademark Act of 1946), United States Trademark Registration No. 298,697, Genuine Duncan Yo-Yo, for <em>return tops </em>(renewed November 1, 1952 under the Trademark Act of 1946) and United States Trademark Registration No. 685,842, Butterfly, for <em>return tops, </em>issued on September 29, 1959. [Italics supplied.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">Another -finding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">\u201cThe <em>return top </em>has been known for so many hundreds of years that its real origin is lost in antiquity. Through these years this toy has been known by a variety of generic terms such as bandalore, emigrette, quiz. [Italics supplied.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">The misleading nature of these and other findings is that plaintiff\u2019s trademarks were not for \u201creturn tops\u201d and its toys were not manufactured and sold under that name, at least until subsequent to 1955. If there is any proof, and we find none, that the return top has been known for hundreds of years, the point is that the term was not employed by plaintiff as descriptive of its product until recently.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">The documentary proof we think is conclusive on this point. The trademark, \u201cFlores Yo-Yo,\u201d which plaintiff acquired by assignment, was for \u201cToys Of The Bandalore Type And Strings As Replacement Parts For The Same.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s trademarks, \u201cGenuine Duncan Yo-Yo\u201d and \u201cYo-Yo\u201d were for \u201cBandalore Type Spinning Tops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">The 1945 license agreement between plaintiff and the Marx and Charmore Companies (heretofore discussed) recites, \u201cDuncan is the owner of the Trade Mark \u2018Yo-Yo\u2019 for Bandalore Toy Spinning Tops,\u201d and grants to the licensees the right to use plaintiff\u2019s trademarks \u201cin connection with bandalore toy spinning tops.\u201d The pleadings in the action for declaratory judgment instituted by Royal against Duncan in 1951 are not before us, but a finding entered in that case, upon which the consent judgment was entered on November 21, 1955, referring to Duncan\u2019s trademarks states, \u201cEach of the above trade marks is applied and used in connection with a disc-shaped top manipulated up and down on a string, more commonly known as a bandalore top or quiz.\u201d The license agreement between plaintiff and defendant Royal (heretofore discussed), entered September 14, 1955, granted to the latter \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>exclusive and non-transferable right to use licensor\u2019s trade-mark, \u2018Yo-Yo,\u2019 on or upon or in association with bandalore tops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">It is strange indeed that the return top so long known, as the Court found, was never mentioned in any of these documents as the name for plaintiff\u2019s toy.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Donald F. Duncan, Jr., plaintiff\u2019s president, as a witness in effect admitted that \u201cyo-yo\u201d was a descriptive term for its toy. On cross-examination he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u201cQ. In your literature, you call it a yo-yo; do you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">\u201cA. I suppose at times we have, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201cQ. You have. In other words, the article that you described to us is also known as a yo-yo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">\u201cA. I wouldn\u2019t say that, exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">\u201cQ. What would you say exactly ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-11\">\u201cA. The article we call a return top or yo-yo describes, I would say our product.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">Duncan also admitted that plaintiff distributed order sheets which listed items under the description, \u201cJunior Yo-Yo, Beginner\u2019s Yo-Yo, Tournament Yo-Yo, Satellite Yo-Yo, Butterfly Yo-Yo and Imperial Yo-Yo.\u201d This was done without any indication that \u201cYo-Yo\u201d was a registered trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">There is much documentary proof, the authenticity of which is not in dispute, that plaintiff for more than twenty years employed the term \u201cYo-Yo\u201d in its descriptive and generic sense. Its most publicized slogan used in trade magazines, on the radio, television and otherwise, was \u201cIf It Isn\u2019t a Duncan, It Isn\u2019t a Yo-Yo.\u201d \u201cYo-Yo\u201d as thus used was generic and descriptive of plaintiff\u2019s toy. A similar use of \u201cYo-Yo\u201d in its generic sense in communicating with large numbers of the consumer public was the recording of a song exhorting children to \u201cSpin a Yo-Yo.\u201d This recording was plaintiff's theme song, used by plaintiff on a television program which was carried weekly.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">In plaintiff\u2019s promotional material a \u201cYo-Yo\u201d was described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-15\">\u201cIn case you do not know what a yo-yo is, it\u2019s that gaily colored little spool on a string, that in the hands of almost any youngster becomes a thing alive and performs hundreds of fascinating tricks. According to little Joe Radovan, present holder of World\u2019s Champion title, yo-yo had its origin in the Philippine Islands over 300 years ago and was used at that time as a weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-16\">Order forms furnished by plaintiff to its jobbers stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-17\">\u201c * * * the undersigned do hereby agree not to handle, sell or cause to be sold any yo-yo tops and yo-yo strings of any other make or manufacture than those of Donald F. Duncan, Inc., during the period extending from * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-18\">Defendant Brown testified that he had demonstrated, promoted and sold yo-yos and other toys continuously since 1930, when he was twelve years old, with an interruption only for military service, and that this long career carried him to almost every part of the United States and into Canada. He further testified that when he first started playing with yo-yos in 1930, he called the toys yo-yos, as did his grammar school classmates in Atlanta, Georgia; that over his years of experience as a demonstrator, promoter, campaign manager, buyer and seller of yo-yos, he came into contact with thousands of children, and that none of them ever referred to the toy, described or called it by any word other than yo-yo; that he has come into contact with thousands of people in the trade of buying and selling yo-yos or promoting the sale of yo-yos or running campaigns for yo-yo sales during his career, and that he has never heard any of these people refer to or describe the toy as anything but a yo-yo, \u201ceveryone says it is a yo-yo. They order yo-yos.\u201d The testimony of this witness is strongly supported by documents which he identified and discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-19\">Tony Malcak, a disinterested witness, testified that he had served as Program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Director for the Catholic Youth Organization in the Chicago area for the past eight and one-half years; that during that period, four yo-yo contests, in each of which approximately 5000 children participated, were programmed; that he personally had come into contact with several thousands of children as Program Director for the CYO, from six years old to adult age; and that of these thousands of children with whom he had talked about the toy in question, none ever referred to it as anything but a yo-yo, and none ever called it a \u201creturn top.\u201d He further testified that his adult associates in the CYO, supervisors and secretaries, referred to the toy only as a yo-yo.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Testimony of witnesses offered by plaintiff bears little relevancy to the crucial issue for decision. James Clancy, engaged as a food manufacturer, after the commencement of the trial entered into a license agreement with plaintiff for use of the trademark \u201cYo-Yo\u201d in connection with a new type of dog food. He testified that the trademark was a \u201cterrific name\u201d and \u201cthat he used the term \u2018return top\u2019 in England when he was a child, over fifty years ago.\u201d It is not discernible how this testimony is relevant to the issue as to whether \u201cyo-yo\u201d was the name by which the purchasing public knew and described the toy. Clancy\u2019s testimony is remarkable in that he knew the term \u201creturn top\u201d fifty years ago, while plaintiff evidently had not heard of it at the time his trademarks were allowed and did not use it until twenty-five or thirty years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">John H. Martin, engaged in the toy jobbing business, testified that he had always associated the term \u201cYo-Yo\u201d with Duncan and had received many hundreds of orders for \u201cyo-yos\u201d which he filled with Duncan yo-yo return tops. Daniel A. Golman, another jobber, testified to the same effect. Recognition by jobbers that \u201cYo-Yos\u201d were associated with and manufactured by plaintiff is no proof that the term was not known and used by the public in a generic and descriptive sense. In fact, the testimony of these jobber witnesses shows that the purchasing public identified the toy as \u201cyo-yos\u201d and ordered the toys by that name.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Plaintiff offered in evidence a number of letters, with replies thereto, in support of its so-called policing activities, designed to show that it made a proper effort to prevent the improper use of the trademark \u201cYo-Yo\u201d by others. Most of this exchange of letters was subsequent to 1955, and during the time plaintiff was attempting to fasten upon its toy the name \u201creturn top\u201d as a substitute for \u201cYo-Yo.\u201d This correspondence constitutes a two-edged sword and is of little help to plaintiff. Referring to the fact that competitors had been using plaintiff\u2019s trademark, its counsel in argument in the District Court stated, \u201cAs soon as we know about it, we write them a letter. They write us back and say, \u2018We thought it was generic.\u2019 \u201d Illustrative is the response from Maxwell J. Perrotta, a patent lawyer of Providence, Rhode Island, who in a letter dated June 20, 1962 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">\u201c \u2018Yo-Yo\u2019 is in our opinion clearly a generic term by which the product is now commonly known. The public is not now aware of what a \u2018return top\u2019 is, but they know what a yo-yo is. They do not recognize that yo-yos originate from a single source or have any other trademark significance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The Court apparently recognized plaintiff\u2019s use of \u201cYo-Yo\u201d in a descriptive sense and sought to excuse it. It found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa4\">\u201cIt would be inequitable to forfeit Plaintiff\u2019s trademark rights because of the familiar use of the term Yo-Yo by Plaintiff\u2019s management when referring to toy. The Court takes judicial notice of the fact that many trade-marked items are casually referred to by their trade-marks alone, without a generic term.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">This finding is akin to a plea in confession and avoidance. We do not agree that plaintiff should be excused from using \u201cYo-Yo\u201d as the descriptive name for its product, thereby educating the public to treat it as such, because others might use their trademarks in the same manner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Plaintiff, which has enjoyed a monopoly on its trademarks for more than twenty-five years, in our judgment should not be saved from a situation for which it in major part is responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">\u201cThe publisher of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and the American College Dictionary have agreed to acknowledge Plaintiff\u2019s rights in the trademark Yo-Yo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">It is true that some of the dictionary publishers, at plaintiff\u2019s insistence, listed the term \u201cYo-Yo\u201d as a trademark; however, all dictionaries, so far as we are aware, continued' to treat the term as a noun, descriptive of a toy. Plaintiff on brief, in connection with its argument that \u201cyo-yo\u201d was not known in the Philippines because not listed in certain dictionaries, stated, \u201cThe place to find whether or not a word is a common noun is to look in the dictionary or other documents of record.\u201d Applying plaintiff\u2019s suggestion to the point under discussion, we find \u201cyo-yo\u201d generally and perhaps always listed as a noun, but no dictionary, so far as we are aware, lists \u201creturn top\u201d as a noun or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Plaintiff cites more than a dozen patents in support of its argument, \u201cSince the registration of Plaintiff\u2019s trademark GENUINE DUNCAN YO-YO and Plaintiff\u2019s trademark YO-YO on November 1, 1932 and January 24, 1933 respectively, the U.S. Patent Office has, <em>in accordance with a general policy in these matters, </em>refused to permit the use of Plaintiff\u2019s trademark YO-YO as a generic term in patent applications relating to <em>return tops. </em>[Italics supplied.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">We assume this is a correct statement as to general policy, which seems to mean only that one branch of the Patent Office seeks consistency with another. It is significant, however, that none of these patents describe the toy as a \u201creturn top,\u201d the generic name which plaintiff'has belatedly sought to bestow upon it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, and more important we think, neither the policy of the Patent Office nor the descriptive name accorded to the toy by patent applicants is of any probative value on the issue as to the descriptive name by which the toy is known to the purchasing public.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">We now come to the much discussed survey introduced through the testimony of a single witness, Henry Gleiss, executive vice-president of Markoa Corporation. He testified that preparation of the survey questions was a \u201cjoint venture\u201d with plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, and that the latter proposed the key survey question ultimately used, \u201cWhat company do you think of as I mention each of these names?\u201d The names listed in the interviewers\u2019 list were all well-known brand names, such as Band Aid, Coke, Erector, Jello, supplied to Mr. Gleiss by plaintiff\u2019s counsel. Among such names was listed \u201cYo-Yo.\u201d Without analyzing the result of this survey in detail, we think it sufficient to note that the composite result indicates that a total of 630 out of 1,445 interviewed (43%) associated the trademark \u201cYo-Yo\u201d with plaintiff. None of the supervisors in charge of the survey, the interviewers or interviewees were called as witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Defendants contend that the result of this survey was inadmissible for various reasons, chiefly because it was pure hearsay and that the form of the questions called for biased answers. Plaintiff argues that the evidence was admissible under the \u201cbusiness records\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. We think we need not be diverted by a discussion or a ruling on the question of its admissibility because, in our judgment, the evidence was immaterial and irrelevant to the main issue, that is, whether the generic and descriptive name of the toy was to the public \u201cYo-Yo\u201d (or \u201cyo-yo\u201d) or \u201creturn top.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">The Court found, \u201cThe purpose of the Markoa Survey was \u2018to determine the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>sociation of companies with a selected group of brand names.\u2019 This purpose was accomplished,\u201d and concluded that this was sufficient to establish secondary-meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Plaintiff argues that since \u201cYo-Yo\u201d is an arbitrary mark, a theory which we have previously rejected, it \u201cis not required. to prove a secondary meaning in order to make out a prima facie case. It made the survey with full knowledge that Defendants\u2019 only asserted defense was that YO-YO was or had become generic, and to be in a stronger position to show \u2014even though it is not under a burden to do so \u2014 that YO-YO is in fact associated with Plaintiff and is not generic.\u201d If plaintiff really desired to ascertain from a survey what the interviewees (members of the public) called or described the toy, we think questions could have been framed to obtain that result. For instance, the interviewees could have been shown an unmarked and unidentified' toy and asked, \u201cBy what name do you call or know this toy?\u201d Or, \u201cDo you know this toy as a \u2018Yo-Yo\u2019 or a \u2018return top\u2019?\u201d Answers to these simple questions in all probability would have been decisive of the issue for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Assuming that the survey evidence was properly admitted and relevant to the crucial issue for decision, we think the Court erred in its finding and conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s trademarks acquired a secondary meaning because of \u201ca significant association in the minds of a representative segment of the public between the trade-mark Yo-Yo and the name Duncan.\u201d Plaintiff in its complaint alleged that due to its extensive advertising, \u201cthe consuming public recognizes said trademark as identifying products originating with plaintiff and <em>no one else.\u201d </em>Plaintiff apparently has changed its stance as to the proof required to establish secondary meaning. On brief here it states, \u201cThere is no requirement in the trademark law that there be a showing that the consuming public associates a mark solely with Plaintiff,\u201d and \u201cSecondary meaning of a trademark is amply demonstrated with significant association between the mark and the source.\u201d In support of this contention, plaintiff cites O\u2019Brien v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of United States, 8 Cir., 212 F.2d 38-3, cert. den. 348 U.S. 835, 75 S.Ct. 57, 99 L.Ed. 658; Seven-Up Company v. Green Mill Beverage Co., D.C., 191 F.Supp. 32, and American Thermos Products Co. v. Aladdin Industries, Inc., D.C., 207 F.Supp. 9, affirmed King-Seely Thermos Co. v. Aladdin Industries, Inc., 2 Cir., 321 F.2d 577. We find nothing in these cases, to support the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Defendants argue that for a word to acquire secondary meaning in the minds of the purchasing public, it must have come to identify not the product but the producer. Among the cases cited in support of this contention is Selchow &amp; Righter Co. v. Western Printing and Lithographing Co., et al., 47 F.Supp. 322, affirmed 142 F.2d 707 (C.A. 7), cert. den. 323 U.S. 735, 65 S.Ct. 75, wherein- the Court stated that in order to establish secondary meaning in a trade name, it must be shown that \u201cin the minds of the public, it means the producer rather than the product.\u201d See also Nissen Trampoline Co. v. American Trampoline Co., D.C., 193 F.Supp. 745, and Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111, 1-18, 59 S.Ct. 109, 113, 83 L.Ed. 73, wherein the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">\u201cBut to establish a trade name in the term \u2018shredded wheat\u2019 the plaintiff must show more than a subordinate meaning which applies to it. It must show that the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer. This it has not done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">In our view, the survey evidence of a \u201csignificant association\u201d between the trademark \u201cYo-Yo\u201d and plaintiff did not establish secondary meaning, but in any event it constitutes no proof as to the generic name by which the public Identifies the toy.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">We have previously rejected certain findings of the District Court as being clearly erroneous. In view of what we have held, there are others which must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>rejected which we think need not he specifically enumerated. It is sufficient to state that any and all findings which support directly or indirectly the validity of plaintiff\u2019s trademark \u201cYo-Yo\u201d are clearly erroneous and rejected. This includes those which find that \u201cYo-Yo\u201d was not and had not become in the minds of the public the generic or descriptive name of the toy and that \u201creturn top\u201d was or had become such a name.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">We cite without extended discussion a few of the many cases which support our conclusion that \u201cYo-Yo\u201d (or \u201cyo-yo\u201d) was in the beginning or has become- during the years the generic or descriptive name by which the public knows the product. First, there is the statutory provision, Title <em>15 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052 (e) (1), which provides that a word \u201cwhen applied to the goods of the applicant is merely descriptive,\u201d and cannot properly be the subject of a valid trademark. In Bayer Co., Inc. v. United Drug Co., D. C., 272 F. 505, \u201cAspirin\u201d was held to be the only name by which the public knew the drug, hence it was no longer the exclusive property of plaintiff; in DuPont Cellophane Co., Inc. v. Waxed Products Co., Inc., 2 Cir., 85 F. 2d 75, \u201cCellophane\u201d was held to be the name which to the public ordinarily signified the cellulose product, hence it was no longer a valid trademark; in Dixi-Cola Laboratories, Inc. et al. v. Coca-Cola Co., 4 Cir., 117 F.2d 352, \u201cCola\u201d was held not to indicate the plaintiff\u2019s product but a class of drink to which the goods of defendant and many other competitors belong, hence it was not capable of exclusive use by plaintiff; in Skinner Mfg. Co. v. Kellogg Sales Co., 8 Cir., 143 F.2d 895, \u201cRaisin-Bran\u201d was held to-be descriptive of the breakfast food, hence it could not be appropriated as a trademark; in Nissen Trampoline Co. v. American Trampoline Co., 193 F.Supp. 745, \u201cTrampoline\u201d was held to be \u201ccompletely generic\u201d and invalid as a trademark, and in American Thermos Products Co. v. Aladdin Industries, Inc., 207 F.Supp. 9, affirmed King-Seely Thermos Co. v. Aladdin Industries, Inc., 321 F.2d 577, \u201cthermos\u201d was held to be generic and could be legally used by the defendant. The last two cited cases are particularly relevant to the instant situation. In Nissen, after finding that the term \u201cTrampoline\u201d had been generically used by authors and editors throughout the years and that they are still using it, the Court stated (193 F.Supp. page 749):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">\u201cPlaintiff George Nissen actively promoted the generic use of the word \u2018trampoline\u2019 during the years he had a virtual monopoly in the commercial manufacture of this product. When his monopoly of the manufacture of this product was threatened, he became very active in promoting the use of the word \u2018Rebound tumbling\u2019 instead of \u2018trampoline\u2019 and was active in urging the NCAA and AAU to change the name of their gymnastic event from trampoline to rebound tumbling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In American Thermos, referring to plaintiff\u2019s trademark, \u201cThermos,\u201d the Court stated (207 F.Supp. at page 17&gt;:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">\u201cHowever, the fact that the word was being included in most dictionaries and the fact that the generic definition was occurring more and more often, evidenced the widespread growth of \u2018thermos\u2019 as a synonym for \u2018vacuum-insulated\u2019 in common usage particularly in connection with bottle, jug, jar and flask.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Thus, in Nissen the plaintiff sought to use \u201cRebound tumbling\u201d instead of \u201ctrampoline,\u201d which had become a generic term to the public, and in American Thermos, the plaintiff sought to use the term \u201cvacuum-insulated\u201d for its trademark, \u201cThermos,\u201d which to the public had become a generic term. In both cases the plaintiff was unsuccessful in its attempt to make the substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">In the instant case we have a similar situation. The name \u201cYo-Yo\u201d (or \u201cyo-yo\u201d), if not a generic term in the beginning (we have previously held that it was), became such in the minds of the public and, as previously shown, plaintiff itself did much to educate the public in this respect. Apparently in recognition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>of the situation, sometime after 1955, plaintiff attempted, without success we think, to reclaim \u201cYo-Yo\u201d from the public domain and substitute therefor \u201creturn top.\u201d In this effort it greatly accelerated its policing activities as well as its already expensive advertising. In 1962 and 1963, for instance, it spent $1,000,000 each year with various advertising media, and shortly thereafter the survey previously discussed was made in preparation for this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">In conclusion, based on the record, which is consistent with common knowledge, we hold that the top in question is known and accepted by the general public by the name of \u201cYo-Yo\u201d (or \u201cyo-yo\u201d). A court is not obligated to close its eyes and refuse to see-or its mind and refuse to recognize that which is obvious to the public in general. The term \u201cYo-Yo\u201d (or \u201cyo-yo\u201d) is a descriptive term and not entitled to trademark protection. Thus, there is no occasion to consider the findings of the District Court or its conclusions of law as they relate to the infringement by defendants of this trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"AWz\">This leaves for disposal the issue of infringement by defendants of plaintiff\u2019s trademark registration No. 685,-842, Butterfly, for return tops, issued September 29,1959-. It will be noted that this registration was allowed during the time plaintiff was attempting to substitute \u201creturn top\u201d as a generic name for \u201cYo-Yo.\u201d No question is raised as to the validity of this trademark, so there is involved only the issue of infringement, to which only minor consideration was given, as revealed by the record and briefs in this Court. The evidence bearing on this issue is confusing, as was its consideration and treatment by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The findings as they relate to this issue are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">\u201cDefendants have used, and are now using, Plaintiff\u2019s trademark Butterfly on goods not manufactured by Plaintiff, on packaging material therefor and on advertising and promotional literature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">\u201cDefendants have presented no credible evidence that they have not infringed Plaintiff\u2019s trademark But- \u2022 terfly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">While the Court as a conclusion of law states that \u201cYo-Yo is valid and infringed,\u201d no conclusion is made as to Butterfly. Only in its judgment order does the Court recite that Butterfly is infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">All the toys bearing the trademark \u201cButterfly\u201d sold by Royal were manufactured by and purchased from plaintiff. It is not claimed there was any infringement in this respect. Plaintiff furnished Royal its promotional literature in connection with these toys. Defendant Brown obtained from Royal these Butterfly toys which he sold to the public. Brown also obtained from other sources unmarked toys which he sold to the public. This in itself also did not constitute infringement. However, it is claimed that Brown m connection with his sale of unmarked tops used some of the promotional literature supplied by plaintiff, which described its Butterfly toys. On the other hand, there is evidence that the word \u201cButterfly\u201d on the promotional sheets was blacked out and the word \u201cThunderbird\u201d substituted therefor. We doubt if this confusing and meager bit of proof is sufficient to support a finding of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">It is also doubtful that the Court\u2019s findings and conclusions on this issue are sufficient to support its judgment order. As noted, there is no finding or conclusion as to infringement. After finding that defendants used the trademark \u201cButterfly,\u201d the Court found that they had presented \u201cno credible evidence that they have not infringed.\u201d Of course, the burden was on plaintiff to prove infringement, not on defendants to disprove it. It is not discernible whether the Court\u2019s reference in its judgment order to defendants\u2019 infringement of Butterfly was based on the meager proof offered by plaintiff or the failure of defendants to prove non-infringement. In view of this confused situation and taking into consideration the posture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>which this facet of the case bears to the whole, it is our view and we so hold that the judgment order as it pertains to \u2022Butterfly cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause remanded for such further proceedings as may not be inconsistent with this opinion. Taxable costs of this appeal are to be shared equally by the parties.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-16\">. Defendant Royal Tops Manufacturing Co., Inc. will be referred to as \u201cRoyal,\u201d and defendant Randy Brown as \u201cBrown.\u201d Where both defendants are referred to, it will be as \u201cdefendants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\">. Plaintiff in its promotional literature and otherwise used its trademark \u201cYo-Yo\u201d (in capital letters) and \u201cyo-yo\u201d (in lower ease letters) interchangeably. The terms were thus employed in the District Court and in the briefs filed in this Court. We think there is no basis to distinguish the terms insofar as they relate to the name by which the toy is known to the public, and in this opinion we have made no attempt to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-13\">.
