The demand recited that it was issued pursuant to the Antitrust Civil Process Act (herein ACPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311-1314, and requested documents relating to an investigation of \u201cproposed acquisitions of fertilizer companies by petroleum companies\u201d, for the purpose of \u201cascertaining whether there is or has been a violation of the provisions of [Section 7 of the Clayton Act]\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">On August 27, 1963, pursuant to Section 5(b) of the ACPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1314 (b), Union filed a petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California to have the demand set aside. The petition contained six grounds. It was granted upon the ground that the ACPA may not be used to investigate prospective acquisitions, which, if consummated, might violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">For purposes of this opinion we assume, without deciding, that the demand made was upon a \u201cperson under investigation\u201d, that it was sufficiently definite and certain, and that it otherwise constituted a proper request for the production of documents which Union may have had in its possession from which it may have been determined that Union\u2019s activities were possibly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">The issue in this case is clearly presented. The government states in its demand that it is investigating possible violations of Section 7 of the Clayton Act by <em>proposed acquisitions </em>of fertilizer companies by petroleum companies. Hence, it appears \u2014 and the government so concedes \u2014 that it intended to investigate only Union\u2019s <em>proposed acquisitions, </em>if any, of fertilizer companies. This being so, we are presented with the question of whether the ACPA authorizes the use of the civil investigative process to inquire into proposed acquisitions to determine whether they would be prohibited by Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">In seeking an answer to this question we examine first the wording of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">Section 3(a) of the ACPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1312(a), reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-14\">\u201cWhenever the Attorney General, or the Assistant Attorney General, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, has reason to believe that any person under investigation may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary material relevant to a civil antitrust investigation, he may, prior to the institution of a civil or criminal proceeding thereon, issue in writing, and cause to be served upon such person, a civil investigative demand requiring such person to produce such material for examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The section clearly imposes the requirement that the demand be for material relevant to a \"civil antitrust investigation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u201cAntitrust investigation\u201d is specifically defined in the Act, Section 2(c), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(c), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018antitrust investigation\u2019 means any inquiry conducted by any antitrust investigator for the purpose of ascertaining whether any person <em>is or has been engaged in any antitrust violation.\" </em>(emphasis provided)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Thus, it is apparent that a demand must be confined to material relevant to the ascertainment of whether or not a person \u201cis or has been engaged in any antitrust violation\u201d. Obviously this does not include investigations of activity that will be a violation in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">An \u201cantitrust violation\u201d is defined in Section 2(d) of the ACPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">\u201cThe term \u2018antitrust violation\u2019 means any act or omission in violation of any antitrust law or any antitrust order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">In view of the clear import of the cited provisions, the question posed is: Can a proposed acquisition be a past or present violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act for purposes of the ACPA?</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">The foregoing requires a negative answer, if the word \u201cviolation\u201d is used in a normal sense. Under Section 7 of the Clayton Act an acquisition can be a violation \u2014 a proposed acquisition cannot. That is to say, a proposed acquisition cannot be violative of the operative language of Section 7: \u201cNo corporation * * * shall acquire * * * \u201d An acquisition itself \u2014 the taking of ownership \u2014 is the only type of conduct made illegal, the only type of conduct which may constitute a \u201cviolation\u201d of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">While it is true that under Section 15 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 25, a proposed acquisition \u2014 a proposed violation of Section 7 \u2014 may, if imminent, be enjoined by the Attorney General, this authorization does not transform a proposed violation of Section 7 into a violation. No logical contention can be made that a proposed acquisition can be made a \u201cviolation\u201d of the Clayton Act by virtue of Section 15. That section is not a part of the substantive group of sections delineating that conduct which the Clayton Act prohibits. It gives the Attorney General power to seek, and the District Court power to grant, injunctions against \u201cviolations\u201d of the Clayton Act, violations being set out in Sections 2, 3, 7, and 8. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13,14, 18, and 19. A proposed acquisition is not, then, a violation of the Clayton Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">Appellant, however, does not read \u201cantitrust violation\u201d, as used and defined in the ACPA, to mean conduct made unlawful by the antitrust laws. It interprets the word to mean \u201cany conduct for which the United States could bring an action and obtain relief under any antitrust law.\u201d We take a look at the reasoning employed by the government in support of its argument that the disputed language of the ACPA can reasonably be so interpreted, so as to permit proposed acquisitions to be investigated as past or present \u201cviolations\u201d of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">First, the government argues, pointing to the title of the ACPA, that the Attorney General\u2019s civil investigative authority is made co-extensive with his powers of civil antitrust enforcement. The title of the ACPA is: \u201cAn Act to authorize the Attorney General to compel the production of documentary evidence required in civil investigations for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>enforcement of the antitrust laws, and for other purposes.\u201d This title is generally descriptive, and is as appropriate to describe the Act, as the trial court interpreted it, as it would be to describe the Act as the government interprets it. As a matter of fact, this same title was used for all the proposed acts that were presented over a period of seven years that the government was endeavoring to get an antitrust investigative demand statute to -its liking.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The present act, however viewed, is certainly much narrower than earlier ones proposed with the same title. There is no merit to the proposition advanced that the title is not to be given the broadest possible reading, but that it should, instead, be given the <em>;particular </em>more limited reading for which the government contends. Even if the title were such that it gave real support to the government\u2019s interpretation, the provisions of an act are not embodied in its title. See Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528-529, 67 S.Ct. 1387, 91 L.Ed. 1646 (1947). The type of investigation pursuant to which the ACPA may be used, a \u201ccivil antitrust investigation\u201d, is specifically defined in the Act, Section 2(c). It is to this provision, and not to the general title, that we should look. Unless there is some genuine confusion in the terms of an act, courts will not look to the title. See Strathearn Steamship Co., Ltd. v. Dillon, 252 U.S. 348, 354, 40 S.Ct. 350, 64 L.Ed. 607 (1920) ; Fairport, Painsville &amp; Eastern Railroad Co. v. Meredith, 292 U.S. 589, 594, 54 S.Ct. 826, 78 L.Ed. 1446 (1934). We find no such confusion. It would be false reasoning to look to the title here, apply to it a definite interpretation, note that this conflicts with the clear terms of the statute, and from this conclude there is ambiguity in the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Secondly, the government places much reliance on the fact that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cviolation\u201d causes some distinction between-the power to investigate pursuant to a possible action to enjoin an acquisition and the power to investigate pursuant to a possible action to divest. The government says that this is a purely formalistic distinction and one that should not be found in the statute. We disagree. The basic and broad distinction drawn in the statute, whether advisable or not, is clear and not inherently illogical in any way. The line was drawn between existing violations and prospective violations. There is nothing illogical in a decision to allow the former to be investigated, while leaving the investigation of the latter to traditional methods. There are still many reasons \u2014 relating to the desire to surround the grant of broad investigative powers with adequate safeguards \u2014 that can be advanced to support this distinction. Moreover, the ACPA does not direct itself exclusively to Section 7 of the Clayton Act. It applies to other important sections as well.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus Congress, in granting limited investigative powers and in setting up the distinction referred to, was addressing itself to the antitrust laws generally. The wisdom of its decision may perhaps be brought into question, but the clarity and coherence of its statute remain; the \u201cartificial\u201d distinction with regard to the enforcement of Section 7 of the Clayton Act that the government argues it set up by the ACPA does not suggest any ambiguity in the intended meaning of the phrase \u201cis or has been engaged in any antitrust violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The government further contends that the courts have often viewed successful actions to enjoin consummation of mergers as having established \u201cviolations\u201d of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, though conceding that a proposed merger has never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>been held to be a violation of Section 7. It argues that \u201cviolation\u201d as used in Section 2(c) of the ACPA can thus reasonably be read in the .manner for which it contends. Three cases are cited by appellant in support of this argument. We do not, however, read these cases as giving the word \u201cviolation\u201d a meaning different from that which is customary in this and other areas of the law. The government first cites the following language from a recent opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 323-324, 83 S.Ct. 1715, 1720, 10 L.Ed.2d 915 (1963): \u201cWe hold that the merger of appellees is forbidden by \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act and so must be enjoined * * * \u201d That opinion as we read it gives no support for the proposition advanced that proposed acquisitions are violations of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. A reading of said opinion, as a whole, indicates that the question to which the court was addressing itself throughout was whether or not the merger, when consummated, would violate Section 7. A concluding paragraph on page 371 of the opinion, 83 S.Ct. on page 1746 begins: \u201cIn holding as we do that the merger of appellees <em>would violate </em>\u00a7 7 and must therefore be enjoined * * *\u201d (emphasis provided). This resolves any doubt about the meaning of the language cited by appellant from the earlier part of the opinion. The government similarly, quotes language from two other opinions to support its broad interpretation of \u201cviolation\u201d. In United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F.Supp. 576 (S.D.N.Y.1958), the court at page 619 enjoins the proposed merger \u201cas violative of section 7 of the Clayton Act\u201d. Again, the opinion indicates that the merger itself and not the proposed merger \u201cviolates\u201d Section 7: \u201cThe Court concludes that there is a reasonable probability that the merger of Bethlehem and Youngstown <em>would, in violation of section 7, </em>substantially lessen competition and tend to create a monopoly in * * * \u201d p. 618. (emphasis provided) The casual use of the word \u201cviolation\u201d in one paragraph in the third case cited by appellant, United States v. Crocker-Anglo National Bank, 223 F.Supp. 849, 859 (D.C.1963), similarly gives very little support to appellant\u2019s contentions. The inescapable conclusion seems to be, again, that \u201cis or has been engaged in any antitrust violation,\u201d is straightforward, and susceptible on its face to only one interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">We give substantial weight to the above meaning of the words of the statute. We look to the legislative history only to determine if that meaning would produce \u201can unreasonable result plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole.\u201d Takao Ozawa v. United States, 260 U.S. 178, 194, 43 S.Ct. 65, 67, 67 L.Ed. 199 (1922). Thus in this case, assuming that the language of the statute will bear the interpretation the government gives it, compelling evidence that the intent and purpose of Congress support that interpretation must appear in order to overcome the obvious force of a normal reading of the disputed provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An examination of the history of the ACPA discloses no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">First, the construction we have made is fortified by a look at the circumstances leading up to the introduction of the bill, S. 167, which, amended in several respects, was passed by the 87th Congress as the ACPA. The \u201cReport of the Attorney General\u2019s National Committee to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u25a0Study the Antitrust Laws\u201d in 1955 gave the Justice Department the impetus to seek a bill giving the Department greater investigative authority in antitrust matters. See pp. 343-49. That report does not support the contention now made by the government as the proper scope of such investigative authority. The concern of the report was to secure for the Department of Justice adequate authority to investigate existing \u201cviolations\u201d or \u201coffenses\u201d. See pp. 343, 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">In the 84th Congress a bill on the subject was introduced in the House of Representatives by Mr. Celler and introduced in the Senate by Senator Watkins.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 3(a) of the bill authorized demand of \u201cany documentary material bearing on any antitrust investigation\u201d. \u201cAntitrust investigation\u201d was left undefined. No action was taken on this bill in either house.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In the 86th Congress Senator Kefauver introduced a revision of the earlier bill into the Senate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His bill differed from the former bill in that it, among other changes, added two definitional sections, clarifying the scope of the bill.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The definitional sections comprised what are sections 2(c) and 2(d) of the present ACPA, quoted above, defining \u201cantitrust investigation\u201d and \u201cantitrust violation\u201d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> ' In the same session, Mr. Celler and Senator Wiley introduced in both houses a different bill.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Senate Antitrust Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary reported out Kefauver\u2019s bill, and not Wiley\u2019s.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Due to the two definitional provisions mentioned, the concern of the Kefauver bill was only with past or existing violations, not with future violations. As a matter of fact, we find throughout the legislative history of the bill numerous statements indicating that the bill was aimed only at investigations of past or existing violations of the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nowhere in the history of the bill do we find any real indication that it was intended to cover investigations of proposed acquisitions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Senate passed the Kefauver bill.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> No action was taken upon either bill by the House.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">In the 87th Congress a bill that was virtually identical to the bill that had passed the Senate during the 86th Congress was introduced by Senator Ke-fauver.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Mr. Celler had abandoned his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>former bills and now introduced an identical bill in the House.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It was this Kefauver-sponsored bill that, modified in some respects not here pertinent, was subsequently signed into law.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The history up to this point discloses that a somewhat moderate bill \u2014 notably in the respect here relevant- \u2014 had been settled upon. The inference can clearly be drawn that Section 3(a) of the bill finally passed was meant to carry a different meaning than Section 3(a) of the early, discarded bills \u2014 different in that investigations in which the ACPA could be used were consciously limited by Section 2(c) of the Kefauver bill to those inquiries conducted to determine whether a person \u201cis or has been engaged in any antitrust violation.\u201d We find no language anywhere in the history of the former bills that indicates that the added provision, 2(c), embodying the above language is to be read in other than its literal sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Looking to the discussion surrounding Senator Kefauver\u2019s bill in the 87th Congress, we likewise find no compelling evidence supporting the government\u2019s contention. There are many statements that indicate that a real need existed here, that the Justice Department needed some civil investigative powers to help enforce the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It could arguably be said that this lends some support to the proposition that the government\u2019s construction of this statute is most consistent with the purpose of this act. This line of argument loses its force, however, in light of the tremendous concern shared by the committees, and others concerned with the bill, that it be surrounded by adequate safeguards and proper limitations on its scope.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A real fear was expressed as to the danger of improper use of investigative power. These fears were manifested in the many protective provisions put into the act at various stages.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These two concerns in enacting the statute read together reflect a \u201cpurpose\u201d of Congress not inconsistent with the interpretation we have given the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">The most revealing and legitimate tools of the judge engaged in an examination of the legislative history of an enactment are the reports by the House and Senate committees that consider it and report it to the respective houses. An examination of the House and Senate Reports concerned with the ACPA provides little illumination of the problem at hand, and certainly discloses no substantial support for the government\u2019s contention. Both reports contain broad language of general purpose, as well as language evidencing concern for adequate safeguards accompanying the bill. Both use much the same language as the report of the earlier Kefauver bill \u2014 concerning themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>with investigations of antitrust \u201cviolations\u201d.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>*</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The only plausible support for appellant\u2019s position to be found in these reports lies in the following language in the House Report, at pages 5-6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">\u201cDuring this period the Department of Justice had urged premerger notification legislation. Bills to enact such legislation have been pending in several Congresses. A comprehensive civil investigative demand statute would serve some of the purposes of, and hence might obviate the need for, premerger notification legislation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Much is made of this by the government; indeed, from its brief, this seems to be the basis for its principal argument. It points out that the premerger statute, requiring that the government be apprised of certain contemplated mergers, would \u201cafford enforcement officials a reasonable period of time to study the competitive implications of a proposed merger or acquisition in order to determine whether to seek a preliminary injunction restraining its consummation pending adjudication of its legality or illegality.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This would allow the Justice Department to investigate and act before the corporations are \u201cscrambled\u201d in such a manner that the only remedy is the drastic one of divestiture. The government\u2019s argument suggests that this function of the premerger notification bills would be furthered by the ACPA only if the ACPA allowed investigations of proposed mergers.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">We are not so persuaded. The Department of Justice admitted that the ACPA and the premerger notification bills were concerned with somewhat different questions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Department desired the pre-merger bill in addition to the ACPA.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The premerger bill does not to any appreciable degree facilitate investigation of \u201cproposed\u201d mergers. No notice need be given until 60 days before the effective date of the merger under the bill reported to the House in the 87th Congress.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The required 60 days notice need not be given until after stockholder\u2019s approval so long as 60 days are allowed to elapse after notice and before the effective date of acquisition.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Moreover, there is some area of overlap of the ACPA with the premerger bills. The House Report quoted above provided only that <em>some </em>of the purposes of the premerger bills would be served by the ACPA. One of the purposes of the premerger bills was to allow the Justice Department to acquire information that would enable them to bring a suit to undo a freshly consummated merger before the \u201cscrambling\u201d was such that divestiture was inappropriate.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This purpose of the premerger bills is certainly served by the ACPA as we interpret it.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">In the floor debates we find no persuasive indication that the position we have taken is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">The government in its argument points to a list of 29 instances, which was compiled by the Justice Department, where civil antitrust investigations were frus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>trated.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This list does not undermine the construction we have made.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Finally, the history of the bill confirms that the wording of the ACPA \u2014 specifically the wording of sections 2(c) and 2(d) \u2014 was carefully chosen. The provisions were, as we have said, definitional, and were added to clarify the scope of the bills initially considered. The ACPA, as finally enacted, is quite short. It was long deliberated and its words carefully chosen.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Thus it is quite significant that the phrase \u201cis or has been engaged in any antitrust violation\u201d makes conspicuous use of the present and present perfect tenses <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Likewise, conscious use was made of the word \"violation\u201d. It is apparent that the Congress intended Section 3(a) of the ACPA to mean exactly what it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\">.

Regardless of what view is taken of the role of a court in construing a statute, a minimum requirement would seem to be that the statute reasonably bear the interpretation that it is given \u2014 that no real stress be put upon the language by the interpretation.

In this case the most that can be said is that the language does not easily bear the construction that the government would place upon it, making quite onerous the burden upon the government to show that other aids to construction dictate a different result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b82-6\">.

This list was compiled and introduced simply to show that companies often have declined to cooperate fully with an investigation by the Justice Department.

The great scrutiny the terms of the statute underwent is evidenced, by the many changes that took place in the bill from the time it was first introduced until it was enacted. Many of these were made pursuant to the recommendations of the American Bar Association.

This conscious omission of the future tense is more significant in light of the fact that analogous demand statutes of several states use the \u201cfuture\u201d tense. For example, the civil investigative demand provision of the Antitrust Law of Hawaii \u2014 recently enacted, and drafted with the assistance of the United States Department of Justice \u2014 reads, in part, as follows: \u201cWhenever it appears to the attorney general, either upon complaint or otherwise, that any person or persons, [has] <em>engaged, in </em>or <em>engages in </em>or <em>is about to engage in </em>any act or practice by this Act prohibited or declared to be illegal, * * * \u201d (emphasis provided) Title 24, Chap. 205A, 1961 Supplement \u2014Revised Laws of Hawaii 1955, p. 664.

In the light of that proposition, \u201cproposed acquisitions\u201d is a most equivocal term since it may well be directed to such situations. I therefore agree that the demand in suit is not subject to enforcement and was properly set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">However, I disagree with the majority opinion in permitting the demand only as to an accomplished acquisition \u2014 one beyond the reach of preventive injunction. This, in my judgment, reads the Antitrust Civil Process Act with unnecessary strictness.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">In my view the business of acquiring encompasses more than the formal corporate resolutions finally accomplishing the acquisition. If companies are engaged in activities leading to that end which they can under the antitrust laws be halted from pursuing I would say that they are presently engaged in the process of acquiring and accordingly are presently in the process of violating the antitrust laws,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
