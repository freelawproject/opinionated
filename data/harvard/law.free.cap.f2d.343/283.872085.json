He had spent fifteen of the last seventeen years in prison for various housebreaking and larceny offenses. This time he moved pro <em>se </em>for a presen-tence mental examination because he felt \u201cthat the repetition of these crimes stem[s] from some mental disorder * * [and he wanted psychiatric assistance] to avoid further conflict with the law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court denied this request because it did \u201cnot think there is adequate information to justify a mental examination at this time.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court relied primarily on the following conclusion in a pre-sentence report:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-24\">With each successive appearance of this young man in our Court, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>have less to add to the evaluations previously submitted. He is now 29 years of age and he is to be sentenced on this occasion, having been found guilty of housebreaking. For a relatively young man, he shows an extremely lengthy criminal record and a pronounced larcenistic bent. If there were some gross and obvious defect in his personality or his physique which would preclude his making an honest living, such a record might be understandable. However, we have uncovered no such defect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asl\">This report does not indicate what efforts, if any, were made to uncover \u201csuch defect.\u201d And nowhere in the record does it appear, for example, whether psychiatric or psychological data were obtained' by using facilities available under District of Columbia Code \u00a7 24-106,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or from the records of the numerous institutions of appellant\u2019s previous confinements, or from interviews- with appellant\u2019s family or associates. Nor does it appear either that the probation officer was qualified to make his own psychological evaluation or that the- court inquired of the basis for his finding of \u201cno such defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">The trial court is given wide discretion in sentencing because it alone can command \u201cthe fullest information possible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948), the Supreme Court invalidated a sentence based on misinformation about a defendant because of the absence of counsel who \u201cwould have been under a duty to prevent * * * the careless * * * pronouncement of sentence\u201d and the failure of the sentencing court to engage in a \u201cscrupulous and diligent search for truth\u201d about the defendant. Due process was violated, the Court held, not by the \u201cerror in resolving a question of fact\u201d but because no adequate effort was made to verify the information upon which the court relied' in imposing sentence. 334 U.S. at 740-741, 68 S.Ct. at 1255.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>present case court-appointed counsel did not know of appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion for mental examination until the morning of sentencing and stated that he had \u201cnothing to add to that motion\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And the court made no effort to supply the missing information by requiring it from the probation officer. Since no information is shown to support the probation officer\u2019s bare assertion of \u201cno such [mental] defect,\u201d there is no adequate assurance of its accuracy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In 1960 the United States Probation Office for the District of Columbia referred fifty-one convicted defendants in the United States District Court to the District of Columbia Legal Psychiatric Services for presentence evaluation; in 1961 \u2014 thirteen, in 1962, \u2014 three,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and in 1963 \u2014 nine<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> were so referred. In each of those years there were approximately one thousand convicted defendants. This evidences an almost total failure to seek relevant behavioral data. Whether this failure is attributable to the District Court or the probation office, it hardly instills confidence that a \u201cscrupulous and diligent search\u201d was made in the present case to uncover any \u201c[mental] defect.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cSuch a result, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>caused by carelessness or design, is inconsistent with due process of law * 334 U.S. at 741, 68 S.Ct. at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Furthermore, even if counsel had attempted to support appellant\u2019s request for a mental examination, the court would still have been obligated independently to determine whether there was factual basis for the probation officer\u2019s conclusion. In <em>Townsend </em>the sentencing court relied on misinformation of two previous convictions which defendant\u2019s counsel could have disproved by examining public court records. Here appellant\u2019s counsel could have supplied the missing information only by expert assistance which was not available because of appellant\u2019s indigency; such assistance was, however, available to the probation officer. To avoid invidious discrimination between rich and poor in information available to aid sentencing,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the court must satisfy itself that the probation officer had factual basis for his critical finding that there was \u201cno such [mental] defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">In Leach v. United States, 118 U.S. App.D.C. 197, 334 F.2d 945 (1964), the sentencing court rested denial of a pre-sentence mental examination on the fact that the probation officer failed to recommend it. On appeal we held that the court could not rely on the probation officer\u2019s conclusion without independent consideration of the facts underlying that conclusion. Upon our consideration of the facts revealed in the probation officer\u2019s report and furnished by counsel, we found insufficient support for the probation officer\u2019s conclusion and we directed the court to order a mental examination. In the present case, however, I would not reach the question whether the court was required to grant the request for a mental examination. I would decide only that the court may not deny an examination on the basis of a probation officer\u2019s report without first satisfying itself that the probation officer had made reasonable efforts to uncover \u201csuch [mental] defects.\u201d I would remand this case to the District Court for that purpose.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-17\">. D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301 (1961 ed.) provides for commitment to a mental hospital \u201cprior to the imposition of sentence * * * for examination and observation.\u201d Section 24r-106 makes available psychiatric and psychological services to District Court judges \u201cto assist them in carrying out their duties.\u201d The sixty-day period for reconsideration of sentence, Rule 35, JTed.R.Crim.P., permits the court to refer a defendant to the custody of the Attorney General for mental examination in a procedure analogous to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b).

After imposing sentence, the court recommended \u201cthat upon the beginning of this sentence the prison authorities examine the defendant for any signs of mental disturbance.\u201d The record does not show whether this recommendation has been followed. That the court did not intend to use such examination as a presentence aid plainly appears from his failure either to order or specify a time limit for the examination.

The Desk Book fob Sentencing II-6-7 (1962), prepared by the Committee on the Administration of Criminal Law, Judicial Conference of the United States, warns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">\u201cToo often a presentence report is a mere recital of facts about such tangible items as names of relatives, employment, addresses, church affiliation, and residence without any careful analysis of the defendant\u2019s needs, attitudes and concerns, his outlook on life, and his conception of his ow.n position with respect to the difficulty in which he is involved. It is not requiring too much of a trained probation officer to require that he supply the court with a thorough statement of the more subjective elements in the background of the defendant and, even more important, that he evaluate their meaning for the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">\u201cProbation officers are the eyes and ears of the court in many areas. * * * When these functions are performed properly, the judge has a sound basis for his judicial determination of an appropriate disposition.

Bazelon from Dr. David A. Lanham, Chief of the Legal Psychiatric Services, dated March 25, 1964.

The Federal Probation System\u2019s use of mental evaluation in presentence investigations is similarly meager. In 1962 the Chief of the Probation Division of the Administrative Office, United States Courts, stated that only $5,000 was spent each year for \u201cpsychiatric help\u201d -in the presentence investigations and supervisory functions of the Probation System. Pye, Shadoan &amp; Snee, Preliminary Survey of the Federal Probation System, Geo.U.Law Center 24 (1963). In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>year, presentence investigations alone involved 31,867 individuals. The Chief of the Probation Division also stated, without details, that some psychiatric facilities from the Veterans\u2019 Administration, the Public Health Service and other sources were also available to the System to a limited extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">After publication of the above Survey, the following statement appeared in the 1964 Annual Report of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (Preliminary Draft):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">\u201cPsychiatric facilities were provided [for the Federal Probation System] by the Federal Bureau of Prisons institutions, the Veterans Administration, the United States Public Health Service, the Vocational Rehabilitation Administration, local and state hospitals, local and state court clinics, county and municipal health departments, universities, and psychiatrists in private practice.\u201d Report, at 76.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">The Report further indicated that 620 presentence psychiatric examinations were made during the first nine months of 1964 at the request of probation officers, and. that, by the end of 1964, 775 such examinations would be made. (Report, at 75.) Since there will be approximately 26,098 presentence investigations during 1964 (Report, at 69), it appears that more than 97 per cent of the investigations will not include psychiatric or psychological evaluations. If the facilities now available to the Federal Probation System are adequate, then their use is desperately inadequate. If, on the other hand, the available facilities are able only to provide examinations in less than 3 per cent of the presentence investigations, then the facilities are desperately inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b334-12\">.
