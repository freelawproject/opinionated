Each is engaged in the distribution and sale to its members of electric power which it has purchased from the Carolina Power and Light Company, a privately owned utility, and the Southeastern Power Administration, an agency of the federal Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">Following Board certification of Local Union No. 485 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers as bargaining representative of the employees of both Randolph and Tri-County, the union requested the start of bargaining negotiations. Both refused to grant recognition and bargain with the union on the sole ground that they are not \u201cemployers\u201d within section 2 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152 (1956), but \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d of the state of North Carolina and thus expressly excluded from coverage by the terms of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board held that they are \u201cemployers\u201d within the meaning of the Act, and not \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d as contended. It consequently found that their refusals to bargain with the union constituted unfair labor prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>tices violative of sections 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (5) and (1) (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The case turns then on the sole issue, whether Randolph and Tri-County are \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The term \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d is not defined in the Act and its legislative history is silent as to the purpose of Congress in using these words. We do not, however, write on a clean slate in construing their meaning. Congress has assigned that function to the National Labor Relations Board, and we look to what it has decided in this and in earlier cases. Here the Board\u2019s initial determination as to the specific application of broad statutory terms rests on its familiarity with labor problems and its experience in the administration of the Act. To the extent that it has taken into account economic realities as well as the statutory purposes, the Board\u2019s determination is entitled to great respect. National Labor Relations Board v. E. C. Atkins &amp; Co., 331 U.S. 398, 67 S.Ct. 1265, 91 L.Ed. 1563 (1947). Our function as a reviewing court is limited to determining whether the Board\u2019s conclusion has \u201cwarrant in the record\u201d and \u201ca reasonable basis in law.\u201d National Labor Relations Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U.S. 111, 131, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944); National Labor Relations Board v. E. C. Atkins &amp; Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">For the reasons to be stated we conclude that the Board\u2019s orders were properly issued and are entitled to enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The main thrust of the electric corporations\u2019 argument is that by excepting \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d from the Act\u2019s coverage, Congress wished to disclaim federal jurisdiction and also evidenced an intention that state law declarations and interpretations should control in determining whether an organization is a \u201cpolitical subdivision.\u201d The corporations assert that it is only in situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-11\">\u201cwhere Congress has statutorily asserted federal jurisdiction over enterprises that had theretofore been exclusively under state control * * that courts will disregard state law in an effort to derive a construction of uniform national application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">Their argument then continues that, because North Carolina\u2019s legislature declared and several successive Attorneys General have ruled that corporations formed under the Electric Membership Corporation Act of North Carolina are \u201cpolitical subdivisions,\u201d it follows that they are exempt from coverage by the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">There are, of course, instances in which the application of certain federal statutes may depend on state law. Examples are seen in the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in the assimilative crimes statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">But this is controlled by the will of Congress. In the absence of a plain indication to the contrary, however, it is to be assumed when Congress enacts a statute that it does not intend to make its application dependent on state law. Jerome v. United States, 318 U.S. 101, 104, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">The argument of the electric corporations fails to persuade us that Congress intended the result for which they contend. Furthermore, it ignores the teachings of the Supreme Court as to the congressional purpose in enacting the national labor laws. In National Labor Relations Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U.S. 111, 123, 64 S.Ct. 851, 857, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944), the Court dealt with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the meaning of the term \u201cemployee\u201d as used in the Wagner Act, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-4\">\u201cBoth the terms and the purposes of the statute, as well as the legislative history, show that Congress had in mind no * * * patchwork plan for securing freedom of employees\u2019 organization and of collective bargaining. The Wagner Act is federal legislation, administered by a national agency, intended to solve a national problem on a national scale. * * * Nothing in the statute\u2019s background, history, terms or purposes indicates its scope is to be limited by * * * varying local conceptions, either statutory or judicial, or that it is to be administered in accordance with whatever different standards the respective states may see fit to adopt for the disposition of unrelated, local problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Thus, it is clear that state law is not controlling<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that it is to the actual operations and characteristics of Randolph and Tri-County that we must look in deciding whether there is sufficient support for the Board\u2019s conclusion that they are not \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Like all other North Carolina electric membership corporations, Randolph and Tri-County are organized and operate pursuant to the provisions of the North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation Act. This authorizes the formation of a rural electric membership corporation upon approval of its feasibility by the North Carolina Rural Electrification Authority. The Authority is an agency created directly by the state, whose members are appointed by the Governor; and after the Authority has found the feasibility of the proposed formation of an electric membership corporation and approved any application for loans from the federal Rural Electrification Administration, the Authority exercises no regulatory control over the corporation. The directors of each rural electric corporation are elected independently of the Authority by the corporation\u2019s own members. The directors of the corporation, not the Authority, conduct the corporate business. Each electric membership corporation possesses the usual powers of a private corporation except that it is under a duty to make membership available without arbitrary or unreasonable limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">The Board held that Randolph and Tri-County are not \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d because they are neither created directly by the state nor administered by state-appointed or publicly elected officials.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Its decision rested also on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>facts (1) that the North Carolina statute does not subject operations of electric membership corporations to substantial control or supervision, either by the state or by its Rural Electrification Authority, (2) that these corporations are formed for the exclusive benefit of its own members, (3) do not have the power of eminent domain, and (4) are not empowered to exercise any portion of the sovereign power of the state of North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In a series of cases beginning, with Gibson County Electric Membership Corporation, 65 N.L.R.B. 760 (1946), involving a Tennessee rural electric cooperative, the Board has taken jurisdiction over nonprofit cooperative associations located in v\u00e1rious sections of the country which received financial assistance from the federal Rural Electrification Administration.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Recently, this court granted enforcement of the Board\u2019s order entered against Craig-Botetourt Electric, a Virginia cooperative. N. L. R. B. v. Craig-Botetourt Elec. Co-op., 337 F.2d 374, 375 (4th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Randolph and Tri-County concede that their operations are similar to those of electric cooperatives in other states. They are neither owned nor operated by the state; their officers are not publicly appointed but elected by their own members, as in every privately owned utility; they are regulated in their day-to-day operations in the same manner as other privately owned public service corporations. They stress, however, that, unlike other states, North Carolina has labeled them \u201cpolitical subdivisions.\u201d The fact that North Carolina sees fit to characterize such corporations as \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d and to accord them certain benefits in respect to state taxation and otherwise, which are normally enjoyed only by municipal corporations, counties and political subdivisions, is not decisive of the question before us, since their relation to the state and their actual methods of operation do not fit the label given them.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">The argument is made that several rulings of the United States Treasury Department indicate that Randolph and TriCounty are \u201cpolitical subdivisions.\u201d These rulings, however, point in several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>directions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and are not helpful to the argument. In any event, these rulings of the Internal Revenue Service are not determinative of the meaning of the section 2(2) exemption for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Nor do we perceive any force in the argument advanced by Randolph and TriCounty that it would be illegal under the law of North Carolina<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for them to recognize, bargain with, or enter into collective bargaining agreements with the union, for under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, the state\u2019s jurisdiction to regulate labor relations is limited to matters not pre-empted by federal labor legislation. Division 1287 Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of St. Elec. Ry. etc., Employees v. Missouri, 374 U.S. 74, 83 S.Ct. 541, 9 L.Ed.2d 509 (1963); cf. Guss v. Utah Labor Board, 353 U.S. 1, 77 S.Ct. 598, 1 L.Ed.2d 601 (1957) <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> North Carolina law is thus applicable only if Randolph and Tri-County are within the section 2(2) exemption of the National Labor Relations Act. The argument therefore merely begs the question.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Urging that they are truly \u201cpolitical subdivisions,\u201d Randolph and Tri-County further show that upon dissolution their assets would revert to the state.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This contingency is too remote to be entitled to controlling significance and cannot outweigh all of the evidence upon which the Board concluded that Randolph and Tri-County are not \u201cpolitical subdivisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">For these reasons, we are of the firm opinion that there was ample support in fact and in law for the Board\u2019s order. It will therefore be</p>\n<p id=\"A_j\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-11\">. General Statutes of North Carolina, Ch. 117, Art. 2, \u00a7 6 et seq.

The meaning of the term \u201creal property\u201d as used in that statute is to be determined by state law. See RFC v. Beaver County, 328 U.S. 204, 66 S.Ct. 992, 90 L.Ed. 1172 (1946), discussed at n. 6, infra;</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\">. The Board\u2019s opinion to the contrary in New Bedford, Wood\u2019s Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, etc. Steamship Authority, 127 N.L.R.B. 1322 (1960), rests on a misconception of RFC v. Beaver County, 328 U.S. 204, 66 S.Ct. 992, 90 L.Ed. 1172 (1946), on which it placed heavy reliance. That case held that the meaning of the term \u201creal property\u201d as used in section 10 of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, which authorizes state taxation of real property owned by subsidiary corporations of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, is to be determined by state law. The Supreme Court reasoned that the usual assumption that Congress intends to have its laws operate with national uniformity was inapplicable, since by permitting local taxation of real property, Congress made national uniformity impossible. The Supreme Court held that in that instance the congressional purpose could be accomplished only by applying settled state rules as to what constitutes \u201creal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">Because the purpose of Congress in enacting the National Labor Relations Act was to deal with national problems [National Labor Relations Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U.S. 111, 123, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170, (1944)], the Board in New Bedford was in error in applying the holding but not the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of <em>Beaver County.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b111-16\"><em>. </em>The Board has long required the existence of at least one of these two factors for the section 2(2) exemption to be applicable.
