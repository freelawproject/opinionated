The District Court in this case exercised its judgment and appointed counsel to represent the prisoner, McCartney. Having thus determined that counsel should have been appointed, the District Court should have taken steps to insure effective representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">Counsel apparently misconceived his role. It was his duty to honorably present his client\u2019s contentions in the light most favorable to his client. Instead he presumed to advise the court as to the validity and sufficiency of prisoner\u2019s motion, by letter. We therefore conclude that prisoner had no effective assistance of counsel and remand this case to the District Court with instructions to set aside the judgment, appoint new counsel to represent the prisoner if he makes no objection thereto, and proceed anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-17\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
