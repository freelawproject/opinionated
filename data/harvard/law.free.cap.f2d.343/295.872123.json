On January 30, 1962, Wynn had filed an action against one Ansel Kelley an independent electrical contractor, alleging that Kelley was negligent in repairing and maintaining the pool. Almost three years after his injury and sixteen months after the compensation award, on July 17, 1963, Wynn filed an amended complaint naming appellant, Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) as co-defendant with Kelley. The applicable three-year statute of limitations on the claim against PEPCO would have expired within two weeks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> PEPCO moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that, since more than six months had pased from the compensation award, Wynn\u2019s claim against PEPCO had been assigned to the compensating employer by the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(b) (Supp. Y, 1959-63). PEPCO argues that the statutory assignment removes Wynn\u2019s standing to sue because he is no longer the real party in interest. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss and certified its order for interlocutory appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-18\"> The Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act must be construed liberally in favor of the injured employee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Narrow statutory construction should not deprive the injured employee of either his compensation or his claim in damages against third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-19\">Prior to 1959, the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act required an injured employee to elect between accepting compensation from his employer and suing a third-party tort-feasor. The Act then provided that \u201c [acceptance of such compensation [from an employer] * * * shall operate as an assignment to the employer of all right of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages against such third person.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(b) (1958). Following this assignment, the employer was authorized to bring suit against or compromise with the third person, and the employee took all proceeds in excess of the employer\u2019s expenses and compensatory payment to the employee. Thus the employee, after the assignment, had considerable interest in the employer's action against the third party. The statute was silent, however, regarding the remedies available to the employee if the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ployer-assignee failed to sue, or arbitrarily compromised with, the third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In Czaplicki v. The Hoegh Silvercloud, 351 U.S. 525, 76 S.Ct. 946, 100 L.Ed. 1387 (1956), which arose under that statute, the employee accepted compensation from the employer and the employer\u2019s insurance carrier was then subrogated to the assigned action against the third parties. The carrier was also the insurer of one of the third parties, and thus had no incentive to pursue the employee\u2019s claim against the third parties. The Court stated that \u201cthe statute presupposes that the assignee\u2019s interest will not be in conflict with those of the employee * 351 U.S. at 531, 76 S.Ct. at 550. In that case, \u201cgiven the conflict of interests and inaction by the assignee,\u201d the Supreme Court held that the employee \u201ccan maintain the third-party action himself.\u201d 351 U.S. at 532, 76 S.Ct. at 950. The opinion left open the question of the proper treatment of an employee\u2019s action in a situation where his interest did not clearly conflict with the interest of the assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In the present case, unlike <em>Czaplicki, </em>the record does not support the sole inference that the employer (or his sub-rogee) refused to sue the third party because its interests were identical with that party and opposed to the employee\u2019s. Appellee suggested in oral argument that the employer failed to sue because he feared that if PEPCO were held liable to the employee, PEPCO could then successfully counterclaim against the employer as primary tortfeasor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But it is equally plausible from the record before us that the employer sincerely believed that PEPCO was not liable for the employee\u2019s injury. In the absence of the 1959 amendments, <em>Czaplicki </em>would indicate that we should remand for a hearing on the employer\u2019s reason for failing to sue PEPCO.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In our view of the 1959 amendments, however, this further hearing is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">In 1959 the Act was amended to enlarge the rights of the employee. The employee no longer is required to elect between his statutory and common-law remedies; he may both accept compensation from his employer and bring suit against the third-party tortfeasor. It is further provided that \u201cunless [the compensated employee] shall commence an action against such third person within six months after such [compensation] award * * * all right\u201d of the employee in such action is assigned to the employer. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(b) (Supp. V, 1959-63). Like <em>Czaplicki, </em>the 1959 amendments recognized that the employer and employee do not always have the same interest in pursuing the third party. To meet this problem, the amendments provide a financial incentive for the employer-assignee to take vigorous action against the third party by allowing the employer to retain one fifth of the proceeds recovered from the third party in excess of his expenses and the amount required for his reimbursement of compensation paid to the employee. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(e) (2) (Supp. V, 1959-63).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This financial incentive encourages the employee to permit assignment of his action in order to enlist the superior resources of the employer in suing the third party. Thus, the Act as amended not only attempts to facilitate the employee\u2019s recovery from third parties, but also gives financial incentive to the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ployer in an attempt to insure vigorous prosecution of claims after assignment of the employee\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">If the employer fails to sue after the statutory assignment, and the employee is then required to produce evidence regarding the employer\u2019s motives in order to sue on his own behalf, a substantial burden would be cast on the employee seeking to recover from the third-party tortfeasor. This burden would -be inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the 1959 amendments \u2014 to facilitate the employee\u2019s recovery against the third party. By itself, the employer\u2019s failure to bring suit is burden enough for the employee who is thus relegated to his ordinarily lesser resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Moreover, even if the employerassignee had \u201cproper motives\u201d or did not abuse a \u201cfiduciary duty to the employee\u201d in failing to sue the third party, no statutory purpose would be served in precluding the employee from suing. If, for example, the employer decides in good faith that the third party was not liable for the employee\u2019s injuries, there is no reason under the statute that the employee should not be permitted to take his chances that the employer's judgment is wrong. The statute is not designed to protect third parties from suit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">A further important purpose of the statutory assignment is to \u201csafeguard\u201d the employer\u2019s right of recoupment \u201cwhere a claimant [compensated employee] does not pursue a good third-party action * * <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This purpose does not require us to penalize the employee if the employer-assignee declines to sue the third party. In effect, the employer\u2019s declination amounts to a waiver of the protection offered by the statutory assignment. Moreover, the employer\u2019s interest in recoupment, if the employee ultimately succeeds in recovering from the third party, would presumably be protected by a lien on the proceeds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">We think that the Act\u2019s purposes to benefit the employee, as interpreted by <em>Czaplicki, </em>and supplemented by the 1959 amendments, support the view that the employee may bring suit against a third'party whenever it is evident that the employer-assignee, for whatever reason, does not intend to bring suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-13\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 (1958), as amended, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 906 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp. V, 1959-63).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-15\">.

In these circumstances the employee may prosecute the claim himself. Czaplicki v. The Hoegh Silvercloud, <em>supra </em>Note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>On August 1,1960, appellee Wynn was employed as a lifeguard at Banneker Swimming Pool in Washington, D. C., by Government Services, Inc., the operator of the pool. On that day one or more of the users of the pool were electrocuted and Wynn was severely injured by electrical shock when he attempted to come to their aid. By compensation order entered March 9, 1962, Wynn was awarded compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On January 30, 1962, Wynn filed an action for damages against one Ansel P. Kelley, an independent electrical contractor, charging Kelley with negligence in the electrical repair and maintenance of the pool. On July 17, 1963, almost three years after his injury and 16 months after the compensation award, Wynn filed an amended complaint in his third-party tort action naming for the first time, as a co-defendant with Kelley, the appellant, Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO), alleging that PEPCO\u2019s negligence also was responsible for his injuries. PEPCO moved to dismiss Wynn\u2019s action as to it on the ground that, since the amended complaint had not been filed within six months of the compensation award, Wynn\u2019s claim had been legally assigned to his employer pursuant to 73 Stat. 391, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(b). Thus, according to PEPCO, Wynn lacks standing to sue and is not the real party in interest. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss but certified its order for interlocutory appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Appellant stands squarely on the language of the statute, which states that the filing of a compensation order by the Deputy Commissioner \u201cshall operate as an assignment to the employer of all right of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages\u201d against a third-party tort-feasor unless the injured employee \u201cshall commence an action against such third person within six months after such award.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(b). Ap-pellee, on the other hand, argues that filing of the action against PEPCO by him was required here because his employer had failed to file and the applicable three-year statute of limitations <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on his claim was within two weeks of expiration. Appellee argues that whatever rights his employer acquired under the statutory assignment cannot be used to defeat his equity in his third-party claim for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">My consideration of this case begins with one certainty: the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act must be construed liberally, not in favor of the employer or third-party tort-feasors, but in favor of the injured employee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is clear beyond cavil that nice legalisms and narrow statutory construction cannot be used to deprive the injured employee of either his compensation or his claim in damages against third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">With this principle firmly in mind, it may be well to consider what right is automatically assigned by the statute to the employer six months after the compensation order. Analysis of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933, subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g), discloses that title to the injured employee\u2019s cause of action against third-party tort-feasors is assigned to the employer six months after the compensation award, but four-fifths of the total equity in the claim, minus compensation paid and litigation expenses, remains in the employee. Thus, after assignment the employer becomes, in effect, a trustee of the employee\u2019s right to the major equity in his claim. See Cza-plicki v. The Hoegh Silvercloud, <em>supra </em>Note 1, 351 U.S. at 535, 76 S.Ct. 946 (concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter). As such, the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>may not protect his own interest at the expense of the employee\u2019s.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AV2\">In <em>Czaplicki, </em>in circumstances similar in many -respects to those here, the Supreme Court held that \u201cCzaplicki [the injured employee] can bring this suit * * because in the peculiar facts here there' is no other procedure by which he can secure his statutory share in the proceeds, if any, of his right to action.\u201d 351 U.S. at 532-533, 76 S.Ct. at 951. The Court found it unnecessary to determine whether the assignment created a- fiduciary relationship. Without going \u201cso far as to say that by giving the employee an interest in the proceeds of a third-party action the statute places the assignee in the position of a fiduciary, cf. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. United States [2 Cir.], 152 F.2d 46, 48,\u201d the Supreme Court held \u201cthat, given the conflict of interests and inaction by the assignee, the employee should not be relegated to any rights he may have against the assignee, but can maintain the third-party action himself.\u201d 351 U.S. at 532, 76 S.Ct. at 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">In <em>Czaplicki </em>the Court noted that the probable reason why the employer had not filed suit against some of the third parties was because the employer \u201cmight also be subject to a claim over by [the third parties] if either of them should be held liable. Cf. Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S. S. Corp., 350 U.S. 124 [76 S.Ct. 232]. The result is that Czaplicki\u2019s rights of action were held by the party most likely to suffer were the rights of action to be successfully enforced. In these circumstances, we cannot agree that Czaplicki -is precluded by the assignment of his rights of action from enforcing those rights in an action brought by himself.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">PEPCO, of course, appreciates the significance of <em>Czaplicki. </em>It counters, however, with the suggestion that <em>Cza-plicki </em>was decided before the 1959 amendments <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>sequently has no application here. But, as PEPCO admits in its brief, \u201cthe nature of the assignment was not changed by the 1959 amendment.\u201d All the 1959 amendments did, as shown by their language and by their legislative history,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was to remove the election which was forced on the injured employee by the statute. Instead of being required to choose between compensation and prosecuting his third-party complaint, the 1959 amendments make it possible for the injured employee to obtain a compensation award and, within six months of that award, file a suit in damages against a third-party tort-feasor. After that time, the right to file is transferred to the employer. But, as already indicated, the major equity in the claim remains in the employee. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(e). Thus the rationale of <em>Czaplicki </em>is as compelling now as it was before the 1959 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">PEPCO relies on two other cases, one from New York and the other from this court. The New York case, Taylor v. New York Cent. R. Co., 294 N.Y. 397, 62 N.E.2d 777 (1945), was specifically rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Cza-plicki, </em>351 U.S. at 532, 76 S.Ct. 946. And the case from this court, Moore v. Hech-inger, 75 U.S.App.D.C. 391, 127 F.2d 746 (1942), is simply not in point. In that case there was no suggestion that the employer frustrated the injured employee\u2019s rights to protect his own. As a matter of fact, in that case the third-party action was brought by the employer\u2019s insurer in its own name as well as in the name of the employee. All the court held was that \u201cthough [the employer] may not join the employee as a \u2018legal plaintiff\u2019,\u201d there is \u201cno legal impediment to an action by the insurer or employer in his own name to his own use and to the use of the injured employee.\u201d 75 U.S.App.D.C. at 395, 394, 127 F.2d at 750, 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Alexander v. Creel, E.D.Mich., 54 F.Supp. 652 (1944), and McClendon v. Charente Steamship Co., S.D.Tex., 227 F.Supp. 256 (1964), do hold that after assignment of the third-party claim the employee may not bring the action in his own name. I respectfully disagree with the result reached and the opinions filed in those cases. I have seen nothing to indicate that Congress, in passing the 1959 amendments, intended to change the rule of <em>Czaplicki. </em>Nor is there any reason, in law or equity, why an injured employee\u2019s rights against a tort-feasor should be sacrificed on the altar of the employer\u2019s self-interest.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-21\">.
