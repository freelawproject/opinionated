No design features are asserted to be part of the mark although in actual use such features are sometimes employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-22\">The mark, as is apparent, is a slogan. It is used by The E. Kahn\u2019s Sons Company, of Cincinnati, Ohio, to promote the sale of various meat products. The instant application, serial No. 37,269, was filed September 16, 1957, to register the slogan On the Principal Register as a trademark for \u201csausage and bacon.\u201d The examiner\u2019s first action required that \u201cthe words \u2018and bacon\u2019 should be can-celled from the identification.\u201d The application stands rejected solely because those words are not cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-23\">The reason given for this requirement has been variously stated throughout the prosecution but has finally been taken, by both the solicitor and appellant, to be as thus stated in the examiner\u2019s answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX_\">\u201cThe ground for refusal is that the mark is used by applicant as part of advertising clauses calling the attention of the purchaser of applicant\u2019s bacon to the wieners which applicant sells and, as such, is not trademark use <em>to identify applicant\u2019s bacon.\u201d </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-24\">The sole issue before us, therefore, is whether \u201cThe Wiener the World Awaited\u201d has been used as a trademark on or in association with appellant\u2019s bacon. There is no issue as to registrability of the mark for <em>sausage, </em>that apparently being conceded by the Patent Office, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>is there an issue as to secondary meaning, notwithstanding the fact four pages of the solicitor\u2019s brief are devoted to this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The board said (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u201cIt is the Examiner\u2019s position that while the subject matter for registration is used as a trademark for sausage, such use as applicant has made of that term in connection with bacon has been <em>merely </em>to advertise applicant\u2019s wieners by calling the attention of the purchaser of applicant\u2019s bacon to the wieners which applicants [sic] also sells. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\u201cThe above noted specimens [discussed below] do not evidence that applicant uses \u2018The Wiener The World Awaited\u2019 <em>to identify bacon </em>and distinguish that product from similar goods of others. * * * ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">\u201cIt is concluded that the subject matter for which registration is sought is not being used as a trademark for bacon and therefore cannot be registered as a trademark for bacon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">We disagree with this conclusion. Before explaining why, we wish to point out that although section 45 of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127), in defining \u201ctrademark,\u201d says that it must be used so as \u201cto identify his goods,\u201d a requirement which the examiner and board have apparently been thinking of in saying that the slogan has not been used \u201cto identify bacon,\u201d what the statute obviously <em>means </em>is \u201cto identify <em>the </em>goods <em>as his.\u201d </em>In other words, the requirement is not that a trademark identify what the goods are but where they come from. Merchants are entitled to identify source in what may appear to be a ridiculous manner if they choose.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">While appellant\u2019s slogan unquestionably does serve to advertise its wieners, as it appears on. bacon packages, we disagree that this is its <em>sole </em>use or function. We believe it is <em>also </em>used <em>as a trademark </em>on bacon. What is this use?</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">The record includes a specimen of a container for one-half pound of bacon and a specimen of a container for two pounds of bacon. The smaller package prominently displays \u201cThe Wiener the World Awaited!\u201d in large print, together with a platter of ten wieners in rolls and an illustration of applicant\u2019s packaged wieners. The descriptive goods designation \u201cHickory Smoked Bacon\u201d also appears on the package. The two pound package shows the phrase \u201cThe Wiener the World Awaited\u201d on a representation of a pennant, which is preceded by the phrase, in <em>much </em>smaller type, \u201cYour family will also enjoy.\u201d The words \u201cSliced Bacon\u201d appear prominently on the package. The bacon package, in other words, is waving the pennant bearing the house slogan, \u201cThe Wiener the World Awaited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">In addition, the record includes a specimen submitted with an affidavit of Raymond C. Wissel, appellant\u2019s Assistant Treasurer, and described by him as \u201can advertisement reproduced for use as a point of purchase banner or poster display * * This specimen shows bacon slices stacked together and bacon being cooked, advertising copy, and the words \u201cHickory-Smoked BACON\u201d and the slogan <em>in quotation marks </em>\u201cThe Wiener the World Awaited\u201d immediately below the word BACON and preceded by the words \u201cAnother \u2018first\u2019 from Kahn\u2019s \u2014 home of.\u201d We think this specimen shows use within the meaning of the clause \u201cor the displays associated therewith\u201d in the section 45 definition of \u201cUse in commerce.\u201d We are, of course, concerned here with the phrase of section 1 of the act: \u201cThe owner of a trade-mark used in commerce may register * *</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">We believe that the three above described specimens establish trademark use by appellant on bacon.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">The words \u201cThe Wiener the World Awaited\u201d clearly constitute an <em>origin indicating </em>slogan, the affidavits of record having established that even to the satisfaction of the Patent Office, as to sausage. This being true, we think the slogan, when it appears on a package of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>bacon, or a point of sale display associated with bacon, identifies that bacon as from appellant and also serves to \u201cdistinguish\u201d that bacon from bacon \u201cmanufactured or sold by others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Summarizing, although appellant\u2019s origin-identifying slogan has been so used on or in connection with the sale of its bacon as to constitute advertising of another product, wieners, it has at the same time, by its presence on the package, made it clear to purchasers, actual or potential, that the source of the bacon is the home of \u201cThe Wiener the World Awaited.\u201d That being so, it has served the basic function of a \u201ctrademark,\u201d as traditionally understood and also as specifically defined in the statute. The ground of rejection has not been well taken. It is not necessary that the slogan \u201cidentify bacon\u201d but only its source.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">WORLEY, Chief Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
