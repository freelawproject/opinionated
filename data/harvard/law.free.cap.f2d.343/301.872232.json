W. This note was given in partial payment for the conveyance by appellee of the Montana Avenue property to the Suttons. Appellee in turn transferred this note, without recourse, to appellant for the sum of $2,500. Payment on the note now being in default, appellant seeks to enforce the second trust interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-17\">The trial court properly held that the conveyance from appellee to the Sut-tons was \u201cvoid and of no effect\u201d on the ground that appellee, who was at the time of the conveyance more than eighty years old, had not been properly informed and did not realize that the documents she signed were conveyances of her property. It follows that the Suttons had no title in the Montana Avenue property to support the second trust deed they executed. Even assuming that appellant took that deed as a bona fide purchaser without notice of the irregularity in the transaction between appellee and the Sut-tons, he has no enforceable interest in the property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-14\">. 3 American Law of Property \u00a7 12.58, at 303 (Casner ed. 1952). Compare Osin v. Johnson, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 230, 243 P. 2d 653 (1957), where a conveyance of property by \u201ca woman of more than average business experience\u201d induced by the- buyer\u2019s misrepresentations was held voidable rather than void so that subsequent trust deeds conveyed to bona fide purchasers were valid.
