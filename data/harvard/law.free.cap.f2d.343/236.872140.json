The Secretary of the Army personally ordered him released from active duty after Major Roberts delivered an unauthorized speech to the Daughters of the American Revolution criticizing prominent public officials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claiming that this action would cause him to lose substantial sums of retirement pay,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Major Roberts sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to have the Secretary\u2019s order set aside. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court granted defendant\u2019s motion and denied plaintiff\u2019s. Major Roberts then brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-16\">The Secretary claims plenary authority, under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 681 (1958), to personally effect Roberts\u2019 release:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-17\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this Title, the Secretary concerned may at any time release a Reserve under his jurisdiction from active duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-18\">Roberts contends, however, that certain procedural safeguards which he was denied are \u201cotherwise provided\u201d in Title 10 and regulations thereunder and by the due process clause of the Constitution. Since we agree that these safeguards are provided by law we set aside the Secretary\u2019s action without reaching any questions arising from the due process clause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>By Army Regulation 135-173, entitled <em>Reserve Components: Relief of Officers and Warrant Officers from Active Duty, </em>the Secretary has prescribed procedures governing exercise of his authority under \u00a7 681. In addition to sections prescribing involuntary release from active duty upon completion of maximum periods of service, attainment of maximum age, failure of promotion, etc., Section XV of AR 135-173 establishes the procedures to be followed in releasing \u201cthose officers whose degree of efficiency and manner of performance of duty require relief from active duty or elimination from the service.\u201d Following annual screening of records at Headquarters, Department of of the Army, to determine which officers fall into this category,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">\u201cThe chief of arms and services, Headquarters, Department of the Army, will forward, without recommendation, to the Department of the Army Active Duty Board, or other designated board, the records of officers to be considered within the annually prescribed guidance and criteria. Cases of officers selected by the board for release and elimination will be considered for processing under A.R. 140-175 or NGR 20-6, immediately following their release from active duty.\u201d [\u00a7 XV.-50.a]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Thus to release a reserve officer from active duty on grounds other than maximum age or period of service, failure of promotion, etc., the Secretary must observe the two-step procedure outlined in \u00a7 XV: (1) screening by Headquarters, followed by (2) Active Duty Board review.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">By express Congressional direction reserve officers within two years of qualifying for military retirement benefits are afforded special protection. In 1956 Congress provided lump sum readjustment payments for members of reserve components who were involuntarily released before they were eligible for retirement benefits,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in order to \u201cguarant[ee] to the reservist that if he remains on active duty for a number of years and is then involuntarily released, he will be assured of some percentage of economic security during his readjustment to civilian life.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the same time Congress recognized in subd. (d) of the readjustment payment statute that reservists within two years of qualifying for retirement benefits (chiefly 18-year reservists) not only deserved compensation in the event of release, but should be protected against release at all:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-13\">\u201cUnder regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, which shall be as uniform as practicable, a member of a reserve component who is on active duty and is within two years of becoming eligible for retired pay or retainer pay under a purely military retirement system, may not be involuntarily released from that duty before he becomes eligible for that pay, unless his release is approved by the Secretary.\u201d [10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1163(d) (Supp. IV 1959-62)]<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The Secretary has implemented this statute, as directed by providing in AR 135-173 that secretarial approval is required before an 18-year reservist can even be processed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">\u201cIndividuals who are within 2 years of qualifying for retirement under AR 635-130 on scheduled release date will not be processed under this section, unless such action is approved by the Secretary of the Army.\u201d [\u00a7 XV.50.d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In sum, release of Major Roberts required (1) secretarial approval of processing under \u00a7 XV, (2) screening by Headquarters, (3) review by the Army Active Duty Board, and (4) final approval by the Secretary ;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but his release was effected solely on the basis of step (4). We -think the Secretary was required to observe his own regulations. Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L. Ed.2d 1012 (1959); Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1957); United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954). And he was not relieved from this requirement by the provision of AR 135-173 that \u201cexceptions to these regulations may be authorized on an individual basis by Headquarters, Department of the Army.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No such authorization, or explicit reasons to justify one, are set forth in the record before us. In light of the 18-year reservist\u2019s special status, we will not assume that the Secretary authorized an exception <em>sub silentio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">But the Secretary urges that AR 135-173 is not the exclusive method of releasing 18-year reservists from active duty. We are told that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1163 (d)\u2019s prohibition against releasing such men without secretarial approval implies that such approval is sufficient for release. Thus, it is argued, \u00a7 1163(d) protects the 18-year reservist by requiring the Secretary personally to authorize release rather than allowing him to delegate his authority under \u00a7 681. But \u00a7 1163(d) specifically directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to implement the 18-year reservist\u2019s enhanced status. Since we have been shown no other regulation on the subject, we must conclude that \u00a7 <em>XV.SO.d, </em>AR 135-173, governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">More important, perhaps, is the fact that \u00a7 XV limits the Secretary\u2019s power to release officers who have not served 18 years, by providing for review of their cases at two levels. The question therefore arises whether a single, personal decision by the Secretary provides greater protection than a two-board screening. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>We think Congress\u2019 special concern for the 18-year reservist requires us to avoid such speculation and to hold that it intended secretarial approval <em>in addition to </em>the safeguards accorded reserve officers generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">It follows that the Secretary\u2019s action was invalid and the District Court\u2019s order granting his motion for summary judgment must be reversed. The Court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the District Court to consider this motion in the light of this opinion, and to conduct such further proceedings as may be necessary to determine the extent of the relief required.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\">. The release order assigned no reasons. These were supplied in an affidavit by General Underwood, Deputy Chief of Information, United States Army, which was introduced by the Government in support of its motion for summary judgment below. According to the affidavit, Major Roberts had a history of difficulties with the Army. While on the staff of General Edwin Walker, Roberts had participated in the \u201cpro-Blue\u201d troop information program. Later, while on another assignment, Roberts circulated literature attacking the Army\u2019s treatment of General Walker as part of a hidden campaign by unnamed individuals in the Pentagon, supported by the civilian heads of the Army, \u201cto wreck all genuine anti-Communist activities within the Armed Forces of the United States.\" After investigation, the Army reassigned Roberts, without prejudice, because of \u201cpersonal actions which placed him at variance with established positions of the Department of the Army.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2I\">On February 14, 1962, Major Roberts submitted for clearance a speech entitled \u201cIs Pro-Blue Troop Training Un-Ameri-can\u201d which he proposed to give before the national convention of the Daughters of the American Revolution on April 19. On April 14, he was notified that the speech could not be cleared \u201cfor reasons of impropriety.\u201d Major Roberts submitted no further material for clearance. Instead he delivered another speech, also not cleared in which he criticized Assistant Secretary of State G. Mennen Williams and stated that Mayor Samuel Yorty of Los Angeles had a Communist background.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-20\">In the investigation which followed, Major Roberts was afforded the opportunity to present evidence, but was not granted a hearing. After considering the alternatives of court-martial, less-than-honorable discharge, and release from active duty, and after submitting the problem to senior Army officials for study, the Secretary chose release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-21\">. The complaint alleges that but for the release, Major Roberts would have qualified for retirement under AR 635-130 at age 48 (after 20 years of active federal service) rather than at age- 60.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac4\">The complaint further recites the loss of medical care to the plaintiff and his family, loss of quartermaster and PX privileges, and loss of housing and travel privileges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b285-23\">.

Defense Department spokesmen told legislators that retention of 18-year reservists until completion of 20 years of service is service policy. That Congress intended to codify this policy is shown by the House Report\u2019s explanation of the fact that readjustment payments are computed on the basis of % months pay for each year served <em>only up to 18:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-15\">\u201canother section of the bill provides that a member of a Reserve component who is on active duty and is within 2 years of qualifying for retirement pay shall not be involuntarily sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>rated from active duty before he qualifies for that pay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">H.R.Rep.

This comports with the view communicated to Congress by spokesmen for the Department of Defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-15\">\u201cColonel Benade. Well, there are several methods, sir, by which a man can be released between his 18th and 20th year. Of course, as a result of court-martial, that can happen at any phase of a man\u2019s service. Otherwise, there are several other administrative methods by which an individual can be released. But I would like to remind the committee, if I may, that the bill provides a safeguard that such an individual not be released without the personal approval of the Secretary of the Department concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-17\">\u201cContinuing now as to the methods which might be followed, * * * if his performance is substandard and does not measure up and is of such low caliber that the Departments feel that the officer should be released from service, then a board would screen the records of the individual and would make a recommendation for his retention or for his release, as the case might be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-19\">House Hearings, <em>supra, </em>at 4585.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b287-20\">. \u00a7 I.l.b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">.

We have no occasion to reach the basic decision of the Secretary to separate appellant from active duty; our concern is only with procedures. But the very purpose of all procedures is to insure that decisions are reached only after calm and orderly deliberation. To require the Secretary to accomplish the separation of an 18 year officer strictly in accord with the Secretary\u2019s own regulations does not impose an undue hardship. On the contrary it serves the important purpose of guaranteeing that action will not be taken in haste or under the impact of some unusual episode such as arose here.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
