That such values may be a property interest to which tax liens can attach is settled by United States v. Bess, 357 U.S. 51, 78 S.Ct. 1054, 2 L.Ed.2d 1135 (1958). A separate question is that of whether, on the facts of a particular case, they are property \u201cbelonging to\u201d the taxpayer within the meaning of Section 3670 of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code. See United States v. Burgo, 175 F.2d 196 (3d Cir. 1949). It is this latter question which was raised, both in the District Court and on this appeal, at the instance of the taxpayer\u2019s wife who claimed to have paid all of the premiums on one policy and a substantial portion of those on the other, and who. assertedly had physical possession of the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-22\">The record as it comes to us is not too well adapted to the resolution of this issue. However, as the Third Circuit in <em>Burgo </em>held that on the record before it it could' not regard as \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d the District Court\u2019s determination that the taxpayer had no property iri the cash surrender values of insurance policies on his life, so do we hold here that on this record we have no warrant to disturb the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the values involved here did \u201cbelong to\u201d the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
