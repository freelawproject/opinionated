A panel of this court denied petitioner\u2019s- request to appeal in forma pauperis from a denial without hearing of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and for appointment of counsel on appeal. That petition raised substantial and nonfrivolous questions concerning the scope of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and of review under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-24\">Damaging admissions were obtained from petitioner by government agents after his indictment for first degree murder and his appearance before a committing magistrate but before he had retained counsel. These incriminating statements were admitted into evidence at his trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arguably in violation of peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>tioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 206, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 1203, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964), the Supreme Court held \u201cthat the petitioner was denied the basic protections of that guarantee [of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel] when there was used against him at his trial evidence of his own incriminating words, which federal agents had deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel.\u201d Although <em>Massiah </em>involved eavesdropping by federal agents, the scope of the case is not limited to surreptitiously obtained admissions. The Court quoted with approval a New York Court of Appeals statement that \u201c \u2018Any secret interrogation of the defendant, from and after the finding of the indictment, without the protection afforded by the presence of counsel, contravenes the basic dictates of fairness in the conduct of criminal causes and the fundamental rights of persons charged with crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 84 S.Ct. at 1202 quoting People v. Waterman, 9 N.Y.2d 561, 565, 216 N.Y.S.2d 70, 75, 175 N.E.2d 445, 448 (1961). People v. Waterman involved police interrogation prior to retention of counsel similar to that in the present case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">This objection to a conviction should be cognizable on a \u00a7 2255 motion. A conviction obtained in violation of the right to counsel is subject to collateral attack. See Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 414, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963) (dictum), citing Andersen v. Treat, 172 U.S. 24, 19 S.Ct. 67, 43 L.Ed. 351 (1898); Evans v. Rives, 75 U.S.App.D.C. 242, 126 F.2d 633 (1942); <em>cf. </em>Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 19-20, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed. 2d 148 (1963) (dictum). The trial judge in denying petitioner\u2019s motion without hearing stated, \u201cThe objections to admissibility of evidence at his trial are not cognizable on a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d The government\u2019s objections to Tucker\u2019s original petition to this court cited Plummer v. United States, 104 U.S. App.D.C. 211, 260 F.2d 729 (1958), in support of the trial judge\u2019s disposition. There it was held that allegations of an illegal arrest, illegal detention, and illegal search and seizure \u201care not grounds for vacating a sentence under \u00a7 2255 and do not entitle appellant to a hearing.\u201d Since there was no allegation in <em>Plummer </em>that unconstitutionally obtained evidence had been admitted, <em>Plummer </em>is irrelevant to petitioner\u2019s motion. Fay v. Noia, <em>supra, </em>and Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), established that the erroneous admission of evidence obtained in violation of constitutional rights is a basis for a \u00a7 2254 motion. <em>A fortiori </em>such an error should be cognizable under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Since the \u201cfacts on which petitioner\u2019s claim * * * is predicated are outside the record,\u201d petitioner has a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>argument that the District Gourt judge erred in failing to hold a hearing on whether petitioner\u2019s right to counsel had been violated. See Sanders v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-18\">. See petition for Rehearing En Banc, pp. 8-11; Tucker v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 250, 318 F.2d 221 (1963), Joint Appendix, pp. 56-61, 67-68.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-19\">Petitioner was indicted hy the grand jury for first degree murder, assault with intent to kill, assault with a dangerous weapon, and carrying a dangerous weapon on November 4, 1957. He was arrested on June 4, 1959, when he told an arresting officer \u201cthat in August of 1957, here in Washington, D. C., he shot at one Tynia Broadway and that he missed her and accidentally shot one Bernice Thomas. He said he did not know until the folowing day, when he read it in the newspapers, that he had actually killed Bernice Thomas.\u201d Joint Appendix, <em>supra, </em>at p. 68. He aso described his flight from Washington, D. O., the day after the murder. After having appeared before a committing magistrate and having pled not guilty, he was questioned by a detective sergeant of the Metropolitan Police Department who testified, \u201cWell, he stated that on the night of the shooting, that he had left Washington; that after the shooting he had been drinking for three days; he didn\u2019t know anything about the shooting, he had been drunk and he couldn\u2019t handle whiskey; that that night he stayed at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Meridan Hill Park all night and had walked around the streets, in fact, going by No. 13th Precinct the next day and started to go in and give himself up; and then the next day, that he had left town and hooked a ride to Lynchburg, Virginia, and had been all over the country since then.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at p. 61.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\">. People v. Waterman clearly indicates that whether defendant has retained counsel at the time of the interrogation, as he had in <em>Massiah, </em>is irrelevant to his Sixth Amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>216 N.Y.S.2d at 75, 175 N.E.2d at 447.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">The <em>\"Waterman </em>case suggested in dictum that the right to counsel might not be violated if the defendant were informed of the right prior to interrogation. <em>Id. </em>216 N.Y.S.2d at 75, 175 N.E. 2d at 448. At Tucker\u2019s trial the detective sergeant who questioned Tucker after his plea of not guilty testified, \u201cI advised him that he would be represented by counsel later * * * \u201d Tucker v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 1, Joint Appendix, p. 61. This statement did not inform Tucker of his right to refuse to answer questions without the presence of counsel, and there is no indication that Tucker was advised of his right to counsel prior to his earlier admissions to the arresting officer. Moreover, a waiver of the right to counsel cannot be presumed from the mere fact that petitioner was informed of the right. See Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
