The deficiencies were based upon the'Commissioner\u2019s determination that <em>the principal purpose </em>of creating the three corporations was to evade the surtax rate payable if all earnings were to remain in one corporation; thus contravening Section 269 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>\u00a7 269).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to 1954, the towing business was owned by Esson Smith and Virginia Smith as a nonineorporated business.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Jurisdiction below rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, and here on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Appellants claimed they had several good and sufficient business reasons, other than the tax saving feature, to organize their business into three corporations. These related to (1) the preservation of the estate for the Smith family, and particularly for Terry Smith, by \u201ccompartmentalizing\u201d the risks involved; (2) personal property tax problems with the State of Oregon; (3) a tariff schedule of the Interstate Commerce Commission which required delivery of a lumber tow before billing.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The sole question before us on this appeal is the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. That verdict was based upon an acceptance of the tax avoidance advantages as <em>the </em>principal purpose of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Unfortunately for taxpayers\u2019 position, their attorney, acting on their behalf, had filed a statement, sworn to by the Smiths, with the Interstate Commerce Commission, in support of their application for a transfer of their towing rights to two of the new corporations, (Defendants\u2019 Exhibit A, Tr. p. 12), and to prove such transfer was in the public interest. This document described the tax saving as \u201cone of the principal reasons\u201d for the change. The government made full use of this document.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">The Smiths\u2019 attorney admitted the tax saving \u201cwas definitely a purpose\u201d\u2014 \u201cWhether it was Mr. Smith\u2019s principal purpose, I don\u2019t know, but as far as I was concerned, yes [it was].\u201d (Tr. pp. 113-14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">Appellants assure us that appellants\u2019 witnesses below were \u201cconfused\u201d; that the jury (though admittedly properly instructed in a manner to which no objection was or could have been made) was undoubtedly \u201cconfused\u201d and \u201cmisled\u201d by the government\u2019s emphasis on said Exhibit A; that this emphasis prevented \u201ca fair and true interpretation of the testimony explaining it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-17\">There is no merit in appellants\u2019 position. A determination of what is <em>the </em>principal purpose of the acquisition of a corporation is a question of fact. Kessmar Constr. Co. v. Commissioner, 336 F.2d 865 (9th Cir. 1964); Shaw Constr. Co. v. Commissioner, 323 F.2d 316 (9th Cir. 1963) ; Hawaiian Trust Co. v. United States, 291 F.2d 761 (9th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-18\">Our one task on an appeal such as this is to determine if there is reasonable evidentiary support for the jury\u2019s conclusion. Commissioner v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 290-91, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-19\">We are required to consider the evidence in the way that most favors the winning party below. United States v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Holland, 111 F.2d 949, 953 (9th Cir. 1946). We cannot reweigh conflicting evidence, or pass upon the credibility of witnesses. Kessmar Constr. Co. v. Commissioner, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Granting there was sufficient evidence to prove that several purposes existed for 'he creation of the three corporations, ,ne such purpose was tax avoidance. The jury decided that it was <em>the principal purpose. </em>Such determination is binding upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">. Section 269(a), as it existed in 1955, 1956 and 1957 (and prior to its February 26, 1964 amendment), reads as <em>follows:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-10\">\u201c\u00a7 269.
