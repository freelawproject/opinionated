(hereafter called Stauffer) and its principal officer, pursuant to a complaint charging the petitioner with using unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce and with disseminating false and misleading advertisements with respect to a certain device which it offered for sale and sold, and which it called its \u201cMagic Couch\u201d or \u201cPosture-Rest\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">This so-called \u201ccouch\u201d consists of a central oscillating section measuring ten by fifteeen inches and two larger sections that are attached to opposite sides of the central section. The couch is intended to be used in connection with a plan known as the \u201cStauffer Home Plan.\u201d The entire plan consists of two parts. One is the use of the couch and the other is the following of a low calorie diet. In the use of the couch the user lies upon it with his head on one attached portion and his legs on another while the central portion of his body is given what is called \u201ceffortless exercise\u201d through the oscillation of the central portion. The representation of the advertising involved is that by following the plan the purchaser will lose weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">The complaint before the Commission was not addressed to the plan as a whole' but rather to certain advertisements which the complaint alleged amounted to statements that the use of the couch alone, when used in a program of effortless exercise, would cause loss of weight and increase muscle tone. The allegation was that the advertisements here under attack directly or inferentially asserted that the couch, taken alone and by itself, and apart from any other portion of a so-called \u201cplan\u201d, is of value in bringing about weight reduction and a toning of sagging muscles. The complaint then charges, and the Commission found, that the \u201cMagic Couch\u201d cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>and will not perform in accordance with these claims, and that it has no value or usefulness in accomplishing the asserted results.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The opinion of the Commission sets forth certain of the accused advertisements which it found to be typical. They are copied in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the process of making its finding that the petitioner in its advertisements was making claims for the effectiveness of the device independently of the plan the Commission discussed these advertisements as follows : \u201cWhile it is true that respondents mention the \u2018plan\u2019 in their advertising, the emphasis is mainly on the device. The advertisements state or imply that the device itself will provide or contribute to the claimed benefits. For instance, one representation reads: \u2018This exercise does away with inches * * * tones and firms hard to reach problem areas. * * * The \u2018This exercise\u2019 is the exercise which the user is supposed to get from the couch; hence, according to the representation, it is the couch itself which does the reducing and toning.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-17\">\u201cWhile the advertisements briefly refer to calorie reduction,, the general impression is that the couch provides most or all of the benefits. Certain of the advertisements state that the couch adds something which the user can\u2019t get by the diet alone, thus clearly plugging the merits of the couch. An exampi\u00e9 is as follows: \u2018When you want to lose both inches and pounds, exercise on the Magic Couch is combined with sensible calorie reduction. This brings about results you just <em>can\u2019t get from diet alone. </em>* *' (Emphasis supplied.) The significance of the device is stressed in other ways, such as by referring to it as the \u2018heart of the famous Stauffer Home Reducing Plan\u2019 and by prominent illustrations. In addition, respondents\u2019 advertisements mention \u2018effortless exercise\u2019, which plainly places the emphasis on the device, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>and they make claims for reductions in specific areas (e. g., \u2018hard to lose inches from ankles, thighs, hips and tummy\u2019), which suggest the exercising of these areas by the device. When all these factors are considered, there is no doubt that respondents, though selling a device in conjunction with a plan, are also making claims for the effectiveness of the device independent of the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The petitioner takes issue with these findings of the Commission saying: \u201cThe Commission erringly concludes that the potential purchaser of the Plan is misled into believing that any and all benefits resulting from the Plan are obtained solely through use of the Device. But, Petitioner advertises and sells a \u2018Stauffer Home Plan,\u2019 a \u2018Stauffer Home Reducing Plan,\u2019 a \u2018Figure-Beautifying Plan,\u2019 and a \u2018Stauffer Principle\u2019 of \u2018sensible\u2019 weight reduction and muscle toning. All of these terms are constantly used in Petitioner\u2019s advertising and booklets.\u201d Although the texts of these advertisements are before us, and in that sense the facts as to what the advertisements were are undisputed, yet we are not for that reason free to disagree with the Commission\u2019s finding to the effect that the advertisements did make these claims for the effectiveness of the device independent of the plan. In reviewing the findings of a district court, the established rule, recognized by this court, is that in respect to inferences drawn from undisputed facts the findings may not be set aside unless found to be clearly erroneous. Lundgren v. Freeman, 9 Cir., 307 F.2d 104, 115. In that case this court adopted the rationale employed by the Supreme Court in Commissioner v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 289, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 1198, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218, where the Court said: \u201cDecision of the issue presented in these cases must be based ultimately on the application of the fact-finding tribunal\u2019s experience with the mainsprings of human conduct to the totality of the facts of each case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">That view of the significance of the inference drawn by the fact finding body is even more applicable in the review of a decision of the Federal Trade Commission, for in such a review we must take into account the experience and the expertise of the Commission which is set up to deal with precisely this sort of thing in the advertising field. This court stated in Carter Products, Inc. v. F. T. C., 9 Cir., 268 F.2d 461, 495, \u201cThe Commission is deemed to have expert experience in dealing with matters of the character involved in the instant case. * * * And it may draw upon its own experience in order to determine (even) in the absence of consumer testimony, the natural and probable result of the use of advertising expressions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">We cannot hold erroneous the Commission\u2019s finding as to what the advertisements stated and represented even if we were inclined to disagree with the Commission, which we are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Petitioner argues that as a matter of law the Commission cannot consider the device, that is the couch, otherwise than as an inextricable component of petitioner\u2019s whole plan. Petitioner says that the device, while essential, is inextricably intertwined with the plan. There is no doubt that in working out its selling program petitioner undertook to tie the device in with its whole plan, for the device obviously was the money making portion of the enterprise. Low calorie diets can be readily procured in small, inexpensive booklets or pamphlets; they can be procured without charge or for a nominal sum from the Governm\u00e9nt Printing Office, and they may be found in almost any ladies\u2019 magazine. But the couch is what really produced the money, as it represented an investment of approximately $300 for the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">As we shall note hereafter, evidence before the Commission tended to indicate that the purchaser would get as much in the way of beneficial weight reduction from using and following a low calorie diet, obtainable from an inexpensive diet list, as he would get from such a list plus the $300 couch. But, if the couch added nothing of value to the plan, and if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the advertisements attributed effective weight reduction to the couch alone, then we have- a situation in which something worthless has been packaged with something effective. In such a case the seller cannot with impunity advertise that the worthless article is effective to produce certain results.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Counsel for the Commission illustrate this as follows: \u201cAssume for example that a glass of orange juice supplies the daily ration of Vitamin C. A seller of sugar pills could well advertise: \u2018Take one capsule each day with one glass of orange juice and you will receive your daily requirement of Vitamin C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">This is not the first time in which the Commission has had to deal with this problem. Thus, In re Damar Products, Inc., 59 F.T.C. 1263, 1270 (affirmed in Damar Products, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 309 F.2d 323 (3d Cir. 1962), the Commission said: \u201cThe general tenor and effect of respondents\u2019 said advertising * * * is not to emphasize dieting as is argued by respondents, but to sell the said vibrator device; and since those who read the advertisements are not required to dissect and analyze the words used in detail, only one conclusion can be reached, which is that the advertisements cause the average person of ordinary intelligence, let alone the ignorant, to believe the vibrator alone is of value in causing body-weight reduction and will also tone and firm sagging muscles, even though reference is made in such advertisements to a so-called \u2018Plan\u2019 which also includes provisions for following a low-calorie diet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">We hold that this approach of the Commission whereby it dealt with the advertisement representation respecting the couch apart from any other portion of the- so-called \u201cPlan\u201d was an appropriate one.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">The Commission then found that the \u201cMagic Couch\u201d cannot and- will not perform in accordance with the claims expressly and impliedly made in these advertisements; and that it has no value or usefulness in accomplishing such results.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">This finding was amply supported by evidence adduced in the proceedings before the Commission, evidence which the Commission had the right to believe and accept. The applicable section of the Act provides (\u00a7 5(c), Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(c)), that upon a review of this kind \u201c[t]he findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d A large portion of petitioner\u2019s brief is devoted to an effort to convince us that the Commission\u2019s evidence was less authoritative and less persuasive than that produced by petitioner. In pursuing this effort the petitioner has undertaken to analyze the Commission\u2019s evidence, particularly that given by medical experts called by the Commission and has undertaken to denigrate their testimony by characterizing three of them as \u201cProfessors of Medicine\u201d, asserting that they had but limited familiarity with the couch and with the plan as a whole, and charging some of them with manifest bias as well as lack of professional knowledge and skill. On the other hand, says petitioner, its case was based upon the testimony of \u201chighly qualified medical doctors\u201d plus that of a professor of anatomy who was a \u201cnoted\u201d professor, and its medical witnesses are asserted to be \u201cspecialists\u201d in medicine who had a thorough understanding of the couch and of the plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Such matters are not properly argued to us in- a case of this kind, where the findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. In Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n v. Algoma Co., 291 U.S. 67, 73, 54 S.Ct. 315, 318, 78 L.Ed. 655, the Court, after quoting from the provision of the Code to which we have just alluded, and in reversing the decision of this court which had annulled an order of the Federal Trade Commission, said: \u201cIn fact what the court did was to make its own appraisal of the testimony, picking and choosing for itself among uncertain and conflicting inferences. Statute and decision (Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific States Paper Trade Association, 273 U.S. 52, 61, 63 [47 S.Ct. 255, 71 L.Ed. 534]) forbid that exercise of power.\u201d Some twenty-two years later, when this court, in reviewing another order of the Federal Trade Commission relating to false advertising, forgot the admonition made in the Algoma case, and again annulled an order of the Federal Trade Commission on the basis of the court\u2019s disagreement with the Commission\u2019s findings of fact, (Sewell v. Federal Trade Commission, 9 Cir., 240 F.2d 228), the Supreme Court promptly and summarily reversed. (Federal Trade Commission v. Sewell, 353 U.S. 969, 77 S.Ct. 1055, 1 L.Ed.2d 1133.) The authorities in accord are numerous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">The Commission in its decision and order reviewed at great length the evidence presented before it. That decision, not yet officially reported in the Commission\u2019s reports, is reported in Vol. 3 C.C.H. Trade Reg.Rep. No. 16,798, p. 21,737. It would serve no useful purpose for us to review the evidence which we have examined and which, as we have stated, is abundantly sufficient to sustain the Commission\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>4a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Petitioner contends with great earnestness that the Commission failed to make the essential basic findings called for by \u00a7 8(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1007(b)), and cites and relies upon cases holding that such findings are essential to sustain the order of the Commission, such as Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 83 S.Ct. 239, 9 L.Ed.2d 207, and Anglo-Canadian Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Federal Maritime Commission, 9 Cir., 310 F.2d 606. There is no doubt but that such is the rule with respect to required findings but we are unable to perceive that it has an application to this case. Here the Commission has found, in line with testimony which it believed most persuasive, that the \u201cMagic Couch\u201d has no value or usefulness in accomplishing the result claimed for it. We are unable to perceive why that does not amount to a basic finding of fact. The word \u201cvalue\u201d has a plain and simple meaning. In the language of the dictionary it means \u201cThe quality of fact of being worthwhile, excellent, useful or desirable.\u201d The argument made by petitioner would call for a refinement in re-spect to findings beyond anything which the statute or reason requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">To illustrate, petitioner says that the Commission failed to make required findings \u201cBy failing to make basic findings as to the amount of weight-inch loss required\u2019 to constitute \u2018value\u2019 and the percentage of oxygen consumption or caloric expenditure required to constitute \u2018value\u2019, the Commission sought to establish an impregnable barrier to Petitioner\u2019s disproving the complaint\u2019s no \u2018value\u2019 allegations and, by this failure, sought to prevent effective judicial review of its action.\u201d This is a view of what is necessary in the shape of findings which we cannot accept. As stated by Judge Learned Hand for the court in Petterson Lighterage &amp; Towing Corp. v. New York Central R. Co., 2d Cir., 126 F.2d 992, 996: \u201cFindings should not be discursive; they should not state the evidence or any of the reasoning upon the evidence; they should be categorical and confined to those propositions of fact which fit upon the relevant propositions of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">In framing Rule 52 relating to findings by a court in a case tried without a jury, it is noteworthy that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>case just referred to was cited by the Advisory Committee drafting the rule in support of the following statement: \u201cBut the judge need'- only make brief, definite, pertinent findings and conclusions upon the contested matters; there is no necessity for over elaboration of detail or particularization of facts.\u201d We think that findings which would satisfy the requirements of Rule 52 would satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 8(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Supreme Court indicated as much in Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co. v. United States, 361 U.S. 173, 193, 80 S.Ct. 229, 241, 4 L.Ed.2d 223, as follows: \u201cBy the express terms of \u00a7 8(b), the Commission is not required to make subordinate findings on every collateral contention advanced, but only upon those issues of fact, law, or discretion which are \u2018material\u2019.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As stated in B. &amp; O. R. Co. v. United States, 298 U.S. 349, 359, 56 S.Ct. 797, 803, 80 L.Ed. 1209: \u201cThere is no requirement that the Commission specify the weight given to any item of evidence or fact or disclose mental operations by which its decisions are reached.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Petitioner is here insisting upon what in our view would be an \u201cover-elaboration of detail or particularization of facts.\u201d We perceive no reason for a contention that all these subsidiary, evi-dentiary matters, referred to by petitioner, should be incorporated in the findings. Even so, the decision and opinion of the Commission relates at great length and detail all of the evidence and states with particularity the portions of the evidence which the Commission credited and believed. Nothing is lacking in this record to permit an adequate review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Petitioner asserts that the Commission\u2019s order should not be enforced because the Commission failed to consider certain attachments which could be affixed to the couch and be used by the person on the couch to obtain more active exercise than that furnished by the oscillation alone. The attachments referred to included a \u201cstretch bar\u201d and other extra parts which, if used, would provide a certain amount of resistance or increased physical effort by the user. Several things may be said about this \u2014 \u2022 petitioner\u2019s advertising claims made no reference to such attachments; any benefits attributable to them would not be relevant to the truthfulness of the advertising. We can take judicial notice that a person after using the couch might reach for the foot of her bed and at that point do setting up exercises; thus the foot of the bed might be used as an adjunct or attachment but its use would have no bearing upon the value of the couch as such or upon the truthfulness of the advertisements. The Commission did have before it evidence which it believed disproved the claims made by Stauffer for these attachments and this evidence the Commission was entitled to credit and accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Petitioner contends that the Commission should have found value in a psychological or \u201cmotivational\u201d factor in the use of its couch. Petitioner notes that one of its medical witnesses expressed the belief \u201cthat the psychological or motivational factor is the most important.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">As we understand this contention it is that when a woman has paid $300 for a couch, which she uses for many hours, thinking this use is help<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ing her figure, she will be motivated not to undo these benefits by failing to stick to the prescribed diet. If, as we have held, the Commission properly found that the couch, as such, had no value for weight reduction, then this argument as to a motivational factor, amounts to saying that the advertisements and sales were justified because the woman who was deceived into buying the couch and used it in the mistaken belief that it was taking off pounds or toning her muscles, would thereby be encouraged to follow a low calorie diet; in other words, that it is all right to deceive by false advertising if the result of the deceit is to create a useful psychological attitude. No- authority we know of would permit the Commission to approve false advertising if the result of the deceit is to create a useful psychological attitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Petitioner asserts that it was denied a fair hearing, charging the Commission with a \u201cclosed-mind, institutional approach to decision making\u201d, that it \u201cacted with rarely equalled capriciousness and arbitrariness\u201d, that some of the hearings \u201camounted to a nation-wide circus\u201d, and that it applied a dual standard which \u201creared its ugly head in what perhaps amounts to the most shocking episode in the annals of administrative agency procedure.\u201d We find nothing in the record to justify such statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In line with these rather extreme assertions is the claim that the Commission is engaged in a \u201ccrusade against each and every device which is designed in any way to affect weight loss.\u201d We think that the Commission\u2019s procedures here were in line with the purposes of Congress in enacting the Act. We think it sound doctrine to say that \u201cIf the Commission * * * thinks it best to insist upon a form of advertising clear enough so that, in the words of the prophet Isaiah, \u2018wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein,\u2019 it is not for the courts to revise its judgment.\u201d Aronberg v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 132 F.2d 165. See also Charles of the Ritz Dist. Corp. v. Federal Trade Comm\u2019n, 2d Cir., 143 F.2d 676. The need for such clarity in advertising would seem to be particularly acute in the case of reducing devices. The eagerness with which women seek beauty aids is notorious. In this area they may be readily overreached. Through the years a number of things have been marketed as aids to reducing, and the Commission has often been obliged to prevent the false advertising of such things. A partial list of these Commission actions are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This compendium of false advertising claims in connection with weight-reduction provides additional support for the Commission\u2019s effort to induce complete truth in the advertising of products in that field.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The order of the Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\">. \u201cGET SLIM</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ar-dedup-0\">STAY SLIM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlV\">insist on STAUFFER the only home plan backed by 20 years of reducing success The Stauffer principle has helped more than 5 million women remake their figures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">It\u2019s a complete figure-beautifying plan of effortless exercise and calorie reduction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">Stauffer\u2019s \u2018Magic Couch\u2019 \u2014 The Posture-Rest unit \u2014 provides controlled rhythmic motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">Helps take off excess weight, remove unwanted inches.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">No starvation diets.

Ed. 456, as follows: \u201cNor was it intended to negative the function of the Labor Board as one of those agencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge, whose findings within the field carry the authority of an expertness which courts do not possess and therefore must respect,\u201d And in Universal Camera the Court added: \u201cNor does it mean that even as to matters not requiring expertise a court may displace the Board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it <em>&amp;e novo.\u201d </em>(340 U.S. at p. 488, 71 S.Ct. 456.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4a\">\n<p id=\"b128-13\">. Without attempting to summarize all of the Commission\u2019s discussion of the evidence we may note that the Commission\u2019s resolution of the issues of fact did not turn upon questions of credibility. Rather the Commission accepted the views of those experts who it believed had superior qualifications and whose opinions were based upon fully established premises. For instance-, the medical experts who testified, as stated by the examiner, \u201cthat the device was of no value in reducing weight or toning or firming muscles either alone or in conjunction with a diet or anything else,\u201d were all ranking specialists in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation. They were professors of medicine in leading medical schools and diplomates of the American Board of Physical Medicine and of Rehabilitation. One of them had observed controlled tests of this device at a Washington University hospital and another had conducted a study of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>similar device, operating in the same manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Petitioner produced medical witnesses to testify that patients of theirs who used the couch had lost weight. But these same patients had been put on low-ealorie diets. The Commission noted that \u201cthere is little, if anything, to indicate that the unit alone was responsible for the weight and inch losses claimed.\u201d Petitioner also produced evidence of certain oxygen tests. These showed that as compared to a \u201cbasal\u201d state or one of complete rest, a person using the couch would show an oxygen consumption increase. This, it was contended, would denote an increased calorie consumption and loss of weight. On the other hand, a witness for the Commission, who was the chief of the Metabolic Disease Branch of the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases, and a specialist in studies relating to metabolism, testified with respect to petitioner\u2019s witnesses\u2019 claims respecting calorie consumption and increase in energy expenditure, as follows : \u201cIf one were to accept these changes as statistically significant, which I do not, but if one were to accept them, the increase in energy expenditure would amount to such a small amount in the realm of \u2014 for example, requiring more than a year to lose one pound in weight \u2014assuming the dietary intake was kept constant, as to be of no real significance for the furtherance of weight loss in an obese person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">This brings to mind the statement of Judge Gould of the District of Columbia Supreme Court in United States v. Buffalo Lithia Springs Water (1914), quoted in Capon Water Co. v. F. T. C., 107 F.2d 516, 3 Cir. \u201cFor a person to obtain a therapeutic dose of lithium by drinking Buffalo Lithia Water he would have to drink from one hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred and twenty-five thousand gallons of water per day.\u201d (p. 518)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">The Commission was fully justified in concluding that what Stauffer here produced could not, in the light of the credible evidence, in the slightest degree justify the advertisements here under attack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b130-5\">.
