Specifically, the issue is whether the article of personal property damaged is a \u201ctrailer\u201d within the meaning of the clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">In December 1987, appellee Carlis McGlothlin owned a 1987 Prowler \u201ccamper trailer,\u201d which was destroyed by a sudden windstorm while parked near his residence in Russell County. At the time, McGlothlin was the named insured under a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued by appellant United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company. The policy provided coverage for damage to a dwelling, other structures, and personal property. It also afforded coverage for loss of use, personal liability, and medical payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">According to the policy terms, there was a general limit of liability of $7,560 for damage to personal property usually located at the insured\u2019s residence. The insured claimed he was entitled to this sum as payment under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">The insurer admitted the loss was covered. It took the position in denying the claim, however, that the amount of the payment due was confined to $1,000, according to the provisions of paragraph 4 of the \u201cSpecial Limits of Liability\u201d portion of the policy applicable to personal property coverage. As pertinent, that portion provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-13\">\u201cThe special limit for each numbered category below is the total limit for each loss for all property in that category.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>3. $1000 on watercraft, including their trailers, furnishings, equipment and outboard motors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-3\">4. $1,000 on trailers not used with watercraft.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">In September 1988, the insured filed this breach of contract action against the insurer seeking judgment for $7,560. Following the insurer\u2019s denial of liability for any sum in excess of $1,000, both parties filed motions for summary judgment and joined in a stipulation of facts. The parties agreed that the camper trailer was not used with watercraft, was not self-propelled, and \u201cwas designed both to be towed and used standing alone.\u201d They attached to the stipulation a photograph of the damaged property and a copy of the certificate of title for the vehicle, noting that the insurer had paid the insured $1,000 on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Following a hearing, the trial court ruled in favor of the insured, granting his motion for summary judgment and denying the insurer\u2019s. The court held that the amount of the covered loss was not subject to the \u201cSpecial Limits of Liability\u201d clause, implicitly deciding that the property damaged was not a \u201ctrailer\u201d within the meaning of that clause. The court entered judgment for the insured for $6,560 in a June 1989 order, from which we awarded the insurer this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The insurer argues that the trial court erred, and asserts that the loss is subject to the special limit of liability clause because the insured\u2019s vehicle was a \u201ctrailer\u201d within the meaning of that clause. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">According to the appellate record, including the photograph, the insured\u2019s vehicle was approximately seven feet wide and fifteen feet long. It had two axles and four tires located just behind the center of the vehicle and weighed 3,320 pounds when empty. In addition, the unit had hard, non-collapsible sides, a trailer hitch at the front, and windows on at least one side. The \u201cbody style\u201d noted on the certificate of title was \u201cCAMP TRL,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The policy contract does not define the term \u201ctrailer.\u201d Therefore, in construing the policy language, we will employ accepted meanings of the term, following the example of the Court in <em>Safeguard Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Justice, </em>203 Va. 972, 128 S.E.2d 286 (1962) (towed racing car not \u201ctrailer\u201d within meaning of exclusion in automobile liability policy). As we shall demonstrate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the vehicle in question fits precisely within the usual definitions of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The pertinent Virginia statute dealing with motor vehicles defines \u201ctrailer\u201d as \u201cevery vehicle without motive power designed for carrying property or passengers wholly on its own structure and for being drawn by a motor vehicle, including mobile homes.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-100. According to the stipulation, the insured\u2019s unit was not self-propelled; hence, it was \u201cwithout motive power.\u201d Obviously, the vehicle was designed to carry property, such as personal effects associated with recreational pursuits, and was designed to be drawn by a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The same statute also defines \u201ccamping trailer\u201d as \u201cevery vehicle which has collapsible sides and contains sleeping quarters but may or may not contain bathing and cooking facilities and is designed to be drawn by a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The insured\u2019s unit does not fit that definition, however, because it does not have collapsible sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Also, \u201ctrailer\u201d is defined as: \u201cA separate vehicle, not driven or propelled by its own power, but drawn by some independent power.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1340 (5th ed. 1979). This meaning describes the characteristics of the unit in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">In addition, \u201ctrailer\u201d means \u201ca vehicle.or one in a succession of vehicles hauled usually by some other vehicle: as ... an automobile-drawn highway vehicle designed to serve wherever it is parked as a dwelling or as a place of business (as an office, laboratory, or field headquarters).\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2424 (1981). The insured\u2019s vehicle comports with this meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">We have not overlooked the fact that the Court in <em>Justice </em>said that the word \u201ctrailer\u201d as used in the exclusion of that policy was ambiguous and, employing familiar rules of interpretation, construed the policy against the insurer. 203 Va. at 977, 128 S.E.2d at 289. In the context of the present policy limitation, however, we do not find the use of the term to be ambiguous. But, even if we construe the language most strongly against the insurer, nonetheless, we are forced to the conclusion that this vehicle is a \u201ctrailer\u201d because all the foregoing accepted definitions of that term apply to it without question. Therefore, the limitation on the amount of the recovery under the policy controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Consequently, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and final judgment will be entered here in favor of the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
