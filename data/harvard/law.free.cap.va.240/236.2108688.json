Hines.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">I. PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">On May 1, 1989, Eaton was indicted by a Rockbridge County grand jury for capital murder under former Code \u00a7 18.2-31(f), now Code \u00a7 18.2-31 (6),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and for the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. On Eaton\u2019s motion, the venue was changed to Fauquier County. At the conclusion of the first stage of a bifurcated jury trial conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4, the jury convicted Eaton of both offenses. The jury fixed his punishment at imprisonment for two years on the firearm conviction. At the penalty phase of the trial, after hearing evidence in aggravation and mitigation, the jury fixed Eaton\u2019s punishment at death for capital murder, based upon his \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d After reviewing the post-sentence report, the trial court, on January 10, 1990, entered final judgments confirming the two convictions and imposing the penalties fixed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">We have consolidated the automatic review of Eaton\u2019s death penalty with his appeal of the capital murder conviction in Record No. 900238, Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-110.1(A) and -110.1(F), and have given them priority on the docket, Code \u00a7 17-110.2. We have also certified from the Court of Appeals of Virginia Eaton\u2019s appeal of his firearm conviction, Record No. 900239, and have consolidated the two records for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">II. THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Pursuant to established principles of appellate review, we will view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. On February 20, 1989, while under the influence of drugs and alcohol, Eaton shot and killed Walter Custer, Jr., in an orchard near the mobile home they shared in Shenandoah County. Later that day, Eaton went to the Shenandoah County home of Ripley Marston, a friend and neighbor. Eaton shot, killed, and robbed his friend, taking Marston\u2019s wallet, containing $15, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Marston\u2019s 1981 Ford Fairmont automobile. Eaton then returned to his mobile home where he joined his girlfriend, Judy Ann McDonald, who also resided there. The pair decided to flee Shenandoah County in order to avoid Eaton\u2019s scheduled court appearance the following week on unrelated burglary and larceny charges; Eaton \u201cdidn\u2019t want to go to jail.\u201d They drove south on Interstate Highway 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Approximately 11:30 p.m. that evening, Virginia State Master Trooper Jerry L. Hines, who was patrolling Interstate 81 in Rock-bridge County, caused the Ford to stop. Judy was operating the vehicle, and Hines, who suspected her of driving while intoxicated, called his dispatcher for a radio check on her operator\u2019s license. Soon thereafter, Hines asked for a \u201csignal 25,\u201d which enabled all state troopers in his vicinity to receive his radio transmissions. In this transmission, Hines was heard saying, \u201chold still there, hold still there just a minute.\u201d In the background, a woman\u2019s voice could be heard. Virginia State Trooper Allen K. Golleher, Jr., was just minutes away when he heard Hines request assistance because \u201che was having a problem with a drunken driver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Charles W. Dees, an interstate truck driver, was driving south on Interstate 81 while Hines was in the process of arresting Judy. He \u201cobserved a man and a woman and the Trooper all standing between the two vehicles, in the headlights of the Trooper\u2019s car.\u201d Dees saw the trooper \u201creally chewing . . . out\u201d the man who was standing a few feet in front of him while the woman was standing next to the right rear fender of the Ford. Soon thereafter, Dees again saw the Ford approximately eight miles down the road as it sped past him southbound toward Salem.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Trooper Golleher arrived at the scene at 11:55 p.m. He found Hines\u2019 police cruiser with its motor running, the doors closed, and the flashing lights on. As Golleher approached the front of the car, he saw Hines lying dead, face-down, just beyond the bumper, in a pool of blood. Golleher rolled the trooper\u2019s body over and saw two bullet holes; one in Hines\u2019 neck and another in his chest. Hines\u2019 service revolver was still holstered, with the strap secured. Golleher found the registration to Marston\u2019s 1981 Ford on the seat of Hines\u2019 cruiser and \u201cadvised State Police Salem\u201d that Trooper Hines had been killed and that the suspected perpetrator was headed toward Salem in a 1981 Ford. Golleher found a summons in Hines\u2019 cruiser citing Judy McDonald for a traffic offense, along with the Ford\u2019s registration card, enabling Golleher to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>transmit the license number and description of the car. The dispatcher broadcast a lookout for the Ford and its occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Approximately 1:30 a.m., Salem Police Officer Michael E. Green found the Ford in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant in Salem. When Green pulled in behind the Ford, he shone a spotlight into its rear window. Green then got out of his vehicle, drew his revolver, shouted \u201cpolice,\u201d and instructed the two occupants, Eaton and Judy McDonald, to put their hands on their heads. Judy reached for the floor and thereafter Green saw a pistol in Eaton\u2019s right hand. Green fired a shot at the car and Eaton put it in gear and drove out of the parking lot. A high-speed chase ensued, in which the cars attained speeds of 100 miles per hour through city streets. Several other officers in their police cruisers joined the pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The chase ended when Eaton crashed into a street lamp post. As fire and smoke emanated from the Ford, the police officers took up positions surrounding the vehicle. Before the police could take the pair into custody, Eaton shot Judy in the left temple and then fired a shot into his own head. When they were pulled from the wreckage, Judy was dead, and Eaton was alive but unconscious. His hands were wet and bloody. Subsequently, Eaton was transported to Roanoke Memorial Hospital where he was treated for a gunshot wound to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The police recovered a .38 caliber handgun from the Ford. According to forensic tests, the handgun was the weapon used to kill Custer, Marston, Hines, and Judy McDonald. Although Eaton had used the gun to shoot Custer, Marston, Judy, and himself, forensic tests for powder residue on his hands were negative. According to a forensic expert, however, prior to testing the residue could have been washed off Eaton\u2019s hands by water or blood, both of which were in abundant supply at the scene due to Eaton\u2019s injury and the fire department\u2019s efforts to douse the burning automobile. Forensic tests performed on Judy\u2019s hands demonstrated that she had also handled the weapon. Eight empty shell casings were found in Eaton\u2019s pockets. The pistol had been fired at least seven times that day, before the crash. Custer had received three shots, Marston two, and Hines two.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Approximately 7 a.m. on February 21, 1989, shortly after Eaton received treatment for his wounds, Virginia State Police Special Agent George D. Watts approached him in his hospital room. Watts informed Eaton of his constitutional rights. Eaton indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>that he understood by nodding his head up and down. Watts then asked Eaton if he was \u201cwilling to continue to answer questions,\u201d to which Eaton indicated \u201cno\u201d by shaking his head. Watts immediately ceased the questioning and left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Three days later, on February 24, 1989, Eaton was released from the hospital and transferred to the Roanoke County jail, where he was incarcerated for the alleged murder of Judy McDonald. Sergeant Jeffrey Dudley of the Salem Police Department and Detective C.R. Hottinger of the Rockingham County Sheriff\u2019s Department arrived at the jail that afternoon to meet with other officers and a Rockingham County prosecutor. Their discussion centered on unrelated burglary and larceny charges pending against Eaton in Rockingham County, for which counsel had been appointed. The prosecutor informed the officers that those charges had been <em>\u201cnolle </em>prossed\u201d earlier that day. Dudley and Hottinger then entered an interrogation room where Eaton was seated.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The officers advised Eaton of his constitutional rights and he indicated that he understood them. The officers then proceeded to interrogate Eaton and to discuss Judy\u2019s burial. Eaton neither admitted nor denied shooting Trooper Hines. When asked whether Judy shot Hines, Eaton stated: \u201cJudy was a good girl. Judy wouldn\u2019t hurt anybody.\u201d The interrogation eventually ceased when Eaton became confused and asked for \u201csome time to think.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Two days later, on February 26, Eaton sent a message to Dudley requesting that he deliver a photograph of Judy to the jail. After Dudley delivered the photograph and again advised Eaton of his constitutional rights, Eaton began asking about Judy\u2019s wounds, indicating that he thought that she was already dead when he shot her. Eaton also said that \u201cJudy was upset . . . that the trooper was going to arrest her.\u201d Additionally, Eaton related details of the murders of Custer and Marston.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Pursuant to a plea agreement dated November 21, 1989, Eaton pleaded guilty in Shenandoah County to the first degree murder of Custer, the capital murder and robbery of Marston, and other related offenses. He was sentenced to three consecutive life terms plus 44 years. Eaton also accepted the provisions of Code \u00a7 53.1-151 (B1), under which he would be ineligible for parole. He subsequently entered a guilty plea in Rockbridge County to the murder of Judy McDonald.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">In the guilt phase of Eaton\u2019s trial for the murder of Trooper Hines, Chadwick J. Holley, another inmate of the Roanoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>County jail, testified that Eaton had admitted being the trigger-man. Holley, who was in jail on drug charges, testified that Eaton discussed each killing at length. With regard to Trooper Hines, Eaton told Holley that, as the Trooper and Judy were returning to the Ford from the police cruiser, Eaton \u201cshot the cop.\u201d Holley then gave a detailed description of Eaton\u2019s getaway and the subsequent high-speed chase which resulted in Eaton\u2019s capture.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">An autopsy performed on the Trooper\u2019s body indicated that he was shot twice. One bullet, fired from 9 to 18 inches away, pierced his chest at the right armpit and traveled downward through his heart and lung. The second bullet, fired from 12 to 24 inches away, pierced his neck and traveled through his windpipe. Each wound would have been fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In his defense, Eaton testified that he had told Holley that it was Judy, not he, who shot Trooper Hines. He testified that Judy shot the trooper because she did not want to go to jail. The jury, however, rejected Eaton\u2019s version and found him guilty of capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">At the penalty phase of the trial, the Commonwealth argued for the death penalty based solely upon the aggravating factor of Eaton\u2019s \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d It introduced evidence of the Custer, Marston, and McDonald murders, and entered a part of Eaton\u2019s Shenandoah County plea agreement into evidence. The jury was not informed that Eaton was ineligible for parole as a result of the agreement, and the defense objected to the deletion of that part of the plea bargain. Holley testified at the penalty phase that as Eaton described the murders, he joked that he was free to blame the trooper\u2019s death on Judy because she was dead. Additionally, the Commonwealth introduced evidence from two other inmates at the Roanoke County Jail who testified that Eaton had fashioned a \u201cshank,\u201d a weapon made out of wire and a spring from a shower curtain rod, with which he planned to escape by overpowering a guard and taking his weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Eaton\u2019s evidence in mitigation consisted of a psychologist\u2019s testimony describing Eaton\u2019s intelligence as \u201clow-average,\u201d and the testimony of certain jail employees that Eaton was not a problem prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">After receiving instructions from the trial court, the jury retired to determine the sentence. Following over two hours of deliberations, the jury notified the trial court that it was deadlocked and inquired whether a unanimous vote, such as is required for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>death sentence, was required to impose a life sentence. The trial court responded: \u201cI cannot instruct you beyond the instruction which you have received; if you are unable to agree upon the penalty, please advise the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">No further communication was received from the jury. Three and one-half hours later, the jury returned with a unanimous verdict fixing Eaton\u2019s punishment at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR WAIVED</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Eaton is deemed to have waived Assignments of Error 2, 5, 7, 11, 12, and 30.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Despite assigning error to these issues, Eaton failed to argue them on brief. Therefore, pursuant to Rule 5:27(e), we will not consider them on appeal. <em>Cheng </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 41, 393 S.E.2d 599, 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">IV. ISSUES PREVIOUSLY DECIDED</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Eaton\u2019s appeal raises certain issues which have been decided adversely to his claims by our previous decisions. We adhere to those rulings and, accordingly, will not discuss them further here. The issues thus previously resolved are whether:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">A. The death penalty is unconstitutional. See <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 78, 84, 393 S.E.2d 609, 613 (1990) (Spencer IV).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">B. The defendant should have been granted additional peremptory challenges. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>C. By permitting <em>voir dire </em>questions concerning the death penalty, the court impanelled a \u201cdeath-prone\u201d jury. See <em>Pruett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 266, 277-78, 351 S.E.2d 1, 7-8 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>482 U.S. 931 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">V. <em>VOIR DIRE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">A. Refusal to Strike Veniremen for Cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Eaton contends that the trial court erred in retaining four veniremen over his objections. As an appellate court, we must give deference to the trial court\u2019s decision whether to retain or exclude individual veniremen because the trial court \u201csees and hears the juror.\u201d <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 426 (1985); <em>accord Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 563, 572, 385 S.E.2d 850, 855 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S.__, 110 S.Ct. 1171 (1990) <em>(Spencer III); O\u2019Dell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 693, 364 S.E.2d 491, 503, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 871 (1988). For that reason, the trial court\u2019s decision in that regard will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of \u201cmanifest error.\u201d <em>Spencer IV, </em>240 Va. at 94, 393 S.E.2d at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">The standard to be applied by the trial court in determining whether to retain a venireman on the jury panel is whether his answers during <em>voir dire </em>examination indicate to the court something that \u201cwould prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>448 U.S. 38, 45 (1980); <em>accord Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 543, 549, 364 S.E.2d 483, 486, <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1017 (1988); <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>234 Va. at 695, 364 S.E.2d at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">1. Frances B. Gouldthorpe</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">During the <em>voir dire </em>examination of Frances B. Gouldthorpe, Eaton\u2019s counsel inquired about involvement with other criminal prosecutions. The juror said that she could not sit on a drunk driving case because she had had a previous \u201ctragic experience\u201d with respect to such an offense. After informing the juror that evidence of alcohol consumption was forthcoming, the trial court asked her if that evidence would affect her impartiality; she indicated that it would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Eaton contends that he \u201cwas prevented from engaging in meaningful inquiry regarding [Juror Gouldthorpe\u2019s] pre-formed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>opinions about cases involving alcohol consumption.\u201d Those opinions, he continues, might have affected the juror\u2019s impartiality.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not agree. The record clearly demonstrates that the trial court, by inquiring about the juror\u2019s ability to remain impartial, was satisfied that her prior experience with drunk driving cases would not \u201cprevent or substantially impair the performance of [her] duties as a juror.\u201d We find nothing in the record to indicate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">2. John Lutley</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Eaton\u2019s counsel asked venireman John Lutley numerous, lengthy questions regarding a defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence and a defendant\u2019s option not to take the stand in his own defense. Initially, Lutley voiced concern about Eaton\u2019s not taking the stand. However, when asked: \u201cYou will listen to the evidence and fairly consider that along with the instructions?\u201d Lutley responded: \u201cYes, and I understand that the case has to be made by the prosecution, not by the defense, I understand that.\u201d Over Eaton\u2019s objection, Lutley was seated on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Eaton contends that Lutley was \u201cconfused about the presumption of innocence\u201d and, therefore, unqualified to sit on the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree. Taking Lutley\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>as a whole, <em>see Pruett, </em>232 Va. at 281, 351 S.E.2d at 10, the record indicates that Lutley understood the presumption of innocence. With regard to Lutley\u2019s potential desire that the defendant take the stand, the trial court found that he could \u201cdisabuse [his] mind of [his] natural curiosity and decide the case on the evidence submitted and the law as propounded in the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>See Townes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 307, 329, 362 S.E.2d 650, 662 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 971 (1988). We find no \u201cmanifest error\u201d in the trial court\u2019s retention of juror Lutley.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">3. Phyllis J. Daines</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">During the <em>voir dire </em>of Phyllis J. Daines, Eaton\u2019s counsel posed several lengthy questions, essentially asking whether she would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u201cautomatically\u201d impose the death penalty if Eaton were proved guilty. Initially, Daines answered, \u201cYes.\u201d When the trial court asked her if she meant to say \u201cautomatically,\u201d Daines emphatically stated: \u201cI would not automatically\u201d impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Eaton contends that Juror Daines was clearly \u201cdeath prone.\u201d On the contrary, the record indicates that she would not \u201cautomatically\u201d impose the death sentence. Her only error was in responding \u201cyes\u201d to a lengthy and confusing question posed by Eaton\u2019s counsel which contained the word \u201cautomatically.\u201d When the question was posed in clear and unambiguous terms by the trial court, the juror responded that she would abide by the trial court\u2019s instructions. There was no error in seating juror Daines.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">4. Donald S. Cherry</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Eaton contends that venireman Donald S. Cherry should have been excused for cause because Cherry stated that he \u201cwould lean towards\u201d the death penalty if Eaton were convicted of capital murder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, taking Cherry\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>as a whole, the record clearly shows that he would give evidence in mitigation the same weight as evidence in aggravation. Based on the record, we agree with the trial court that Cherry was not \u201cdeath prone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">B. Questions Concerning Parole Eligibility</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The defense proposed a <em>voir dire </em>question which informed the jury that Eaton would be ineligible for parole by reason of sentences previously imposed upon him for his other murders. The question also asked the jurors whether they could consider a sentence \u201cless than death\u201d if they were instructed not to concern themselves with the possibility of parole or of Eaton\u2019s ultimate return to society. The court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection to the question and Eaton assigns error to that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Information regarding parole eligibility is not relevant evidence to be considered by the jury. <em>Spencer IV, </em>240 Va. at 85, 393 S.E.2d at 613; <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 341, 351, 385 S.E.2d 50, 56 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S.__, 110 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>1797 (1990); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 168, 178-80, 360 S.E.2d 361, 367-68 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1020 (1988); <em>Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 418-19, 329 S.E.2d 815, 828, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 865, 888 (1985). Indeed, \u201cthe jury has no right to be advised of post-sentencing events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 329 S.E.2d at 836. The Supreme Court has expressly left this question to be determined by the States, as a matter of state law. <em>California </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>463 U.S. 992, 1013-14 (1983). Therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing Eaton\u2019s proposed <em>voir dire </em>question.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">VI. SUPPRESSION OF STATEMENTS TO POLICE</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Contending that they were obtained in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments, Eaton assigns error to the court\u2019s refusal to suppress the statements he made to the police on February 24 and February 26. Eaton did not testify at the October 30 hearing on his motion to suppress. The only witnesses to his statements were the two police officers, Dudley and Hottinger, who interviewed him on February 24 and February 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Although the testimony of the two officers differed in some respects, they both testified that Eaton received full <em>Miranda </em>warnings before, and several times during, his interrogation; that he gave every indication that he fully understood them; that he made inquiries about his entitlement to the assistance of counsel; that he was repeatedly told that he was not required to talk to the officers in the absence of counsel; and that counsel would be obtained for him if he so desired. Both officers testified that Eaton never requested counsel and that he continued, quite voluntarily, to discuss the case with them. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found that Eaton had never invoked his right to counsel and that his statements were freely and voluntarily made. Our examination of the record satisfies us that the court\u2019s findings were supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Sgt. Dudley\u2019s testimony, more favorable to the defense, was offered by the defense. Detective Hottinger, whose version <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>was more favorable to the Commonwealth, was called as a Commonwealth witness. In accordance with familiar principles of appellate review, we will review the evidence concerning the interviews in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">As stated earlier, when Special Agent Watts attempted to interview Eaton on February 21, Eaton indicated by a shake of his head that he did not wish to answer any questions and Watts left immediately. No further efforts were made to interview him until Dudley and Hottinger met him in an interview room on February 24. Dudley gave Eaton <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and Eaton said that he understood them. After discussing the high-speed chase, the crash, the shooting of Judy, and Eaton\u2019s attempted suicide, Dudley turned to the shooting of Trooper Hines. Dudley said: \u201cThe reason you shot the trooper was because he had stopped you?\u201d Eaton replied, \u201cHe was going to arrest Judy.\u201d At that point, Eaton asked Dudley: \u201cYou did say I could have an attorney if I wanted one?\u201d Hottinger then told Eaton \u201cthat he didn\u2019t have to tell [the officers] anything; that he did have the right to have an attorney if he wanted one.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">A short period of silence followed. Dudley left the room for a few minutes. Hottinger then told Eaton about the funeral of Judy McDonald and where she was to be buried. They discussed that subject until Dudley returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">After Dudley\u2019s return, the officers asked some questions about the gun. Eaton described the traffic stop by Trooper Hines and Judy\u2019s arrest. He said that Judy wasn\u2019t drunk. Hottinger then asked Eaton \u201cif Judy had shot the trooper.\u201d Eaton replied: \u201cJudy was a good girl and she wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone.\u201d He neither directly admitted nor denied shooting Trooper Hines and, in contrast to his later testimony at trial, gave no hint that Judy was the perpetrator of the crime. Eaton made no other statement concerning the Hines killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">A waiver of an accused\u2019s right of counsel must not only be voluntary; it must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment and abandonment of a known right or privilege. In each case, this depends \u201cupon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ence, and conduct of the accused.\u201d <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 482 (1981) (quoting <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938)); <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 374-75 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">A waiver of the right to counsel, however, need not be explicit; it can be shown by the circumstances. <em>Cheng, </em>240 Va. at 35, 393 S.E.2d at 604. In the present case, the court inferred such a waiver from Eaton\u2019s willingness to engage in a discussion of the case with the officers after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings and indicating that he understood them. <em>See North Carolina </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S. at 373. The court also noted that Eaton was no stranger to the criminal justice system. He had been arrested on prior occasions, had received numerous <em>Miranda </em>warnings in the past, and until the morning of February 24, when his Rockingham County charges were <em>\u201cnolle prossed,\" </em>had the benefit of court-appointed counsel in those cases. He had conferred with, and had been advised by, that attorney. Eaton\u2019s intelligence was in the \u201clow average\u201d range, and there is no evidence that he was mentally impaired by his self-inflicted gunshot wound or by any other cause. We conclude that the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Eaton voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel in the first instance, when he entered into discussions with officers Hottinger and Dudley on February 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Eaton contends that this might be true had he not refused an interview with Special Agent Watts on February 21, but that his refusal on that occasion had the effect of prohibiting <em>any </em>subsequent interviews unless he initiated them. We do not agree. It is true that if Eaton had requested counsel on February 21, no subsequent police-initiated questioning would have been permitted in counsel\u2019s absence. <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 484-85. A mere refusal to speak, however, is not the same as a request for counsel. The police \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d Eaton\u2019s right to remain silent, and they did not violate that right when they re-initiated questioning three days later, following renewed <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 106-07 (1975) (police did not violate defendant\u2019s right of silence by re-initiating questioning, after renewed <em>Miranda </em>warnings, three hours after defendant had invoked right to remain silent).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Eaton also contends that his Sixth Amendment rights were infringed because he had appointed counsel in his unrelated property-crime cases in Rockingham County (terminated by <em>nolle prosequi </em>just before the interview on February 24) who was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>present at the interview. That contention is also untenable. Eaton\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not yet attached with respect to the murder of Trooper Hines because \u201cadversary judicial proceedings\u201d had not yet been initiated on that charge. <em>See Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 629 (1986). The Sixth Amendment rights attached to Eaton\u2019s charges in Rockingham County were specific to those charges. Such rights do not travel with a defendant and attach themselves to any other crimes he might commit. <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Moulton, </em>474 U.S. 159, 180 n.16 (1985). Therefore, Eaton\u2019s Rockingham County counsel had no involvement with the present case, and the Rockingham cases, even if they had remained pending, would have conferred no rights upon Eaton with respect to the Hines murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Eaton next argues that even if his right to counsel was validly waived at the inception of the February 24 interview, he invoked it during the course of the conversation. Citing <em>Edwards, </em>he contends that when he mentioned his right to counsel the interview should have ended immediately, to be resumed only in the presence of counsel or upon Eaton\u2019s own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The holding of <em>Edwards </em>is succinct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">[W]e now hold that when an accused <em>has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, </em>a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights. We further hold that an accused, such as Edwards, <em>having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, </em>is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">451 U.S. at 484-85 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). Our inquiry, therefore, must focus upon the question whether Eaton \u201cinvoked his right to have counsel present\u201d or \u201cexpressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">We agree with the trial court that Eaton\u2019s utterances concerning his right to counsel were equivocal. Authorities in other jurisdictions have adopted differing standards with respect to the specificity with which a request for counsel must be expressed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Some courts require a clear and unambiguous request, some prohibit all further questioning when the subject of counsel is mentioned in any way, while others permit further questioning only for the purpose of resolving the ambiguity. The United States Supreme Court has not expressly decided the question, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illi</em>nois, 469 U.S. 91, 95-96 (1984), but has expressed a preference for \u201cbright-line rules\u201d for the guidance of the police who must conduct custodial interrogatories. <em>Fare </em>v. <em>Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 718 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The trial court, relying on <em>Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 329 S.E.2d 815, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 888 (1985) and <em>Bunch </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 423, 304 S.E.2d 271, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 977 (1983), concluded that the standard prevailing in Virginia is that a request for counsel must be \u201cunambiguous and unequivocal\u201d in order to trigger the <em>Edwards </em>rule. We distinguished the facts in <em>Bunch </em>from those in <em>Edwards </em>by pointing out that \u201cwhere <em>Edwards </em>involved an unequivocal statement by the accused that he wanted counsel, Bunch\u2019s statement . . . was couched in ambiguous terms to the effect that he <em>might </em>want to talk to a lawyer.\u201d <em>Bunch, </em>225 Va. at 433, 304 S.E.2d at 276 (emphasis in original). We noted a further distinction: in <em>Edwards, </em>the defendant was told that he had to talk to the police. Bunch, like Eaton, was told that he need not do so. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The circumstances in <em>Poyner </em>were remarkably close to those of the present case. After police officers had given Poyner <em>Miranda </em>warnings, they summarized the information in their possession linking Poyner with one of the murders charged against him. At that point, Poyner asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say I have the right to an attorney?\u201d The officers said, \u201cYes.\u201d Citing <em>Bunch, </em>we held that the defendant\u2019s statement was not a request for counsel. \u201cAt most, it sought to clarify one of the rights of which he had already been advised.\u201d <em>Poyner, 229 </em>Va. at 410, 329 S.E.2d at 823. The trial court\u2019s view that we have required a clear request for counsel was, therefore, well-founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We share the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s preference for \u201cbright-line\u201d rules for the guidance of those who must conduct and evaluate custodial interrogations. In further explication of the views expressed in <em>Bunch </em>and <em>Poyner, </em>we hold that the <em>Edwards </em>rule is invoked, and that custodial interrogation must cease, when the accused, having received <em>Miranda </em>warnings and having begun to respond to the questions of the authorities, \u201chas <em>clearly </em>as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>serted his right to counsel,\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 485 (emphasis added). Because Eaton\u2019s words and conduct fell short of that standard, we hold that he failed to invoke his right to counsel and that the <em>Edwards </em>rule did not come into play on February 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Eaton\u2019s constitutional rights were not infringed in any respect by the interview of February 26. It was initiated at Eaton\u2019s request, thus complying with the <em>Edwards </em>criterion. Eaton asked Sgt. Dudley to return to the jail in order to deliver a picture of Judy McDonald. When Dudley arrived, he delivered the photograph to Eaton, gave him renewed <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and responded to-Eaton\u2019s questions about Judy. Eaton then responded to a number of questions about the Custer, Marston, and McDonald crimes. The only statements made concerning the present case were to the effect that Judy was upset because the trooper was going to arrest her. Eaton described the positions in which the three were standing between the cars, but said nothing about the shooting of Trooper Hines. He made no reference to counsel during the interview. We conclude that the trial court did not err in denying Eaton\u2019s motion to suppress his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">VII. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE - TRIGGERMAN</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Eaton assigns error to the court\u2019s denial of his motion to strike the evidence at the guilt phase. He contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he, rather than Judy McDonald, fired the shots that killed Trooper Hines. The short answer to that contention is that the jury was entitled to, and obviously did, accept the testimony of Holley. Despite Eaton\u2019s attack on the credibility of Holley as a \u201cjailhouse snitch,\u201d Holley\u2019s testimony was corroborated in several respects: first, the circumstantial evidence of the relative locations of . assailant and victim when the shots were fired; second, Eaton\u2019s murderous career on February 20 which cost three other lives; and third, Eaton\u2019s statements to the police in which he made no contention that Judy McDonald had been Hines\u2019 killer. Eaton\u2019s effort to blame the killing on Judy did not emerge until the trial, by which time Eaton\u2019s regard for her-had evidently worn thin.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">VIII. JURY INSTRUCTIONS - GUILT PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed Instruction No. 6 which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>You may consider evidence that the defendant committed other offenses other than the offense for which he is on trial only as evidence of the defendant\u2019s motive; as evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent; as evidence of the defendant\u2019s knowledge; as evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct and feelings toward the victim and relations between them; evidence of the defendant\u2019s malice; as evidence of the defendant\u2019s premeditation; as evidence of the defendant\u2019s opportunity in connection with the offense for which he is on trial and for no other purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Eaton\u2019s proposed Instruction A, which was refused by the trial court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">The court instruct [s] the jury that you are not to consider evidence of the fact that defendant has plead guilty to homicide in Shenandoah County and the City of Salem, Virginia as evidence of his guilt of the capital murder of Trooper Jerry Hines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In refusing Instruction A, the trial court ruled that it was duplicative of Instruction No. 6. We agree. The granted instruction, while not felicitously phrased, fairly covered the principle of law at issue. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant another, duplicative instruction. <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 145, 314 S.E.2d 371, 384, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Eaton\u2019s proposed Instructions B and C would have instructed the jury on the definition of a principal in the second degree and on the jury\u2019s duty to convict the defendant of the lesser offense if it had a reasonable doubt as to his guilt on the capital murder charge. The trial court refused both instructions, ruling that there was no foundation for either in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u201cA defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed only on those theories of the case that are supported by evidence.\u201d <em>Frye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 388, 345 S.E.2d 267, 280 (1986). More than a scintilla of evidence must be present to support an instruction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Eaton contends, based upon his own testimony, that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support his theory that he was a principal in the second degree. He points, specifically, to his testimony in which he stated that Trooper Hines instructed him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>return to the Ford and wait for another trooper to arrive. On brief, Eaton argues that by following the trooper\u2019s instructions, he purposefully distracted Hines, giving McDonald the opportunity to shoot the trooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">There is no evidence in the record to support this theory. Eaton never testified that he was attempting to distract Trooper Hines, nor was any other evidence introduced to indicate such an attempt. Because the evidence fails to support defendant\u2019s proposed Instructions B and C, the trial court correctly denied them.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Eaton also proffered Instruction D, which would have instructed the jury to find Eaton guilty of second degree felony murder if it believed Trooper Hines was killed during the continuing larceny of Marston\u2019s car. The trial court, however, denied the instruction because it was \u201can incorrect statement of the law,\u201d and there was insufficient evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Eaton contends that Instruction D was proper \u201cbecause of the continuing larceny of the Marston vehicle in which a murder occurred without Eaton being the triggerman.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The felony murder statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-33, defines the crime as \u201c[t]he killing of one <em>accidentally, </em>contrary to the intention of the parties, while in the prosecution of some felonious act . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Clearly, no evidence was introduced to indicate that Trooper Hines was killed \u201caccidentally.\u201d Therefore, Instruction D was unsupported by any evidence, and the trial court properly refused the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">IX. JURY INSTRUCTIONS - PENALTY PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Eaton proffered six jury instructions, A through F, at the penalty phase of the trial. The trial court refused all six. Eaton assigns error to each refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Instructions A, D, E, and F were all variations on Instruction 1, proffered by the Commonwealth, and approved by the trial court. That instruction, tailored to the aggravating factor of \u201cfuture dangerousness,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">You have convicted Dennis Wayne Eaton of an offense which may be punished by death. You must decide whether Dennis Wayne Eaton shall be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment. Before the penalty can be fixed at death, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, after consideration of his history and background, there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">If you find from all the evidence, unanimously, that the Commonwealth has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that, after consideration of his history and background, there is a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society, then you may fix the punishment of Dennis Wayne Eaton at death or if you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified, then you shall fix the punishment of Dennis Wayne Eaton at life imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">If the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, after consideration of his history and background, there is a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society, then you shall fix the punishment of Dennis Wayne Eaton at life imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Instruction A would have added: \u201cIf, after conscientious discussion and deliberation, you cannot reach a unanimous decision whether to impose the death sentence or life imprisonment, you may so advise the Court.\u201d Eaton argued that this was a better statement of the law. The trial court, however, refused Instruction A because it would have allowed the jury to avoid its duty. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Besides being duplicative of an instruction previously granted, <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 145, 314 S.E.2d at 384, Instruction A would have given the jury an easy way to avoid determining a sentence. While Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(E) provides for the imposition of a life sentence by the trial court when the jury cannot agree upon a penalty, the jury, nevertheless, has a duty conscientiously to attempt to arrive at a sentence. Thus, the trial court correctly refused Instruction A.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Similarly, Instructions D, E, and F were duplicative of Instruction 1. Instruction D informed the jury that it could not base the death sentence solely upon the fact that Eaton killed a police officer. Instruction E listed a number of mitigating factors to be considered by the jury, and Instruction F stated that the jury could impose a life sentence despite finding beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of aggravating circumstances. Because Instruction 1 fully and fairly instructed the jury on the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>law, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by ruling that Eaton\u2019s proffered Instructions A, D, E, and F, were duplicative. <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 145, 314 S.E.2d at 384. We have previously considered and rejected Eaton\u2019s assignments of error to the refusal of his penalty-phase Instructions B and C, <em>supra </em>n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">X. SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE REGARDING \u201cFUTURE DANGEROUSNESS\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">During the penalty phase, Eaton moved to strike at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and again at the close of all the evidence. The court denied both motions. The jury returned a sentence of death, \u201chaving unanimously found after consideration of [Eaton\u2019s] history and background that there is a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In contending that the Commonwealth failed to produce sufficient evidence to indicate that he would pose a future threat to society, Eaton ignores the evidence which reveals that he committed four unprovoked and seemingly irrational murders, and related crimes, within a 24-hour period. Additionally, Eaton joked about his crime spree to Holley and, while incarcerated, fashioned a deadly weapon with which he planned to assault a guard in an escape attempt. After considering this, and the evidence introduced in mitigation, we conclude that there was ample evidence presented by the Commonwealth to support the jury\u2019s finding that Eaton posed a continuing, serious threat to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">XI. JURY DEADLOCK</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Upon being instructed by the court at the penalty phase of trial, the jury retired to consider its verdict. As noted above, after approximately two and one-half hours, the foreman sent a note to the trial court requesting further instruction: \u201cWe continue to be deadlocked with the same vote after two and a half hours. The Death Verdict indicates we must be unanimous. The Life imprisonment does not indicate a unanimous vote is necessary. Please clarify.\u201d The trial court responded: \u201cI cannot instruct you beyond the instruction which you have received; if you are unable to agree upon the penalty, please advise the court.\u201d No other response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>came from the jury until three and one-half hours later when it returned a unanimous verdict fixing punishment at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Eaton contends that, upon receiving the note, the trial court was required to discharge the jury and impose a life sentence pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(E). That provision states: \u201cIn the event the jury cannot agree as to the penalty, the court shall dismiss the jury, and impose a sentence of imprisonment for life.\u201d Further, Eaton maintains that if the trial court did not dismiss the jury, it should have given a supplemental charge informing it that if it could not reach a unanimous decision, the trial court would impose a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Neither option proposed by Eaton was warranted. Obviously, the jury was not finally deadlocked. When a jury is deciding a matter of the gravity of a capital murder sentence, two and one-half hours is not an excessive time for deliberation. The jury had been instructed fully regarding the law applicable to sentencing, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its response to the jury\u2019s inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The state has a strong interest, in a capital sentencing proceeding, in having the conscience of the community expressed by a jury on the ultimate question of life or death. <em>Lowenfield </em>v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231, 238 (1988). The court is entitled to encourage the jury to continue its deliberations for a reasonable time even after the jury has indicated that it is deadlocked. <em>Id.; U.S. </em>v. Gordon, 817 F.2d 1538, 1543 (11th Cir. 1987), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>487 U.S. 1265 (1988); <em>accord United States </em>v. <em>Thibodeaux, </em>758 F.2d 199, 203 (7th Cir. 1985). In our view, Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(2) becomes applicable only after it has become apparent to the trial judge, following a reasonable period of deliberation, that further deliberations would be fruitless and that the jury\u2019s deadlock is final.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">XII. PASSION, PREJUDICE, AND PROPORTIONALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C) requires us to review the death sentence on the record to consider and determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">1. Whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">2. Whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>We have accumulated the records of all capital murder cases reviewed by this Court, pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.1(E), giving particular attention to those cases in which the death penalty was based solely upon the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate, <em>e.g., Savino </em>v. Commonwealth, 239 Va. 534, 391 S.E.2d 276 (1990); <em>Fisher </em>v. Commonwealth, 236 Va. 403, 374 S.E.2d 46 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1028 (1989); <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 360 S.E.2d 352 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 1015 (1988); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 302 S.E.2d 520, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 865 (1983); <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 844, 284 S.E.2d 844 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 938 (1982); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 766, 284 S.E.2d 816 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1038 (1982), <em>aff'd on remand, </em>228 Va. 468, 323 S.E.2d 114 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1025 (1985); <em>Giarratano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 1064, 266 S.E.2d 94 (1980); and <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 257 S.E.2d 808 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980). After considering those records, as well as cases in which life imprisonment was imposed, we conclude that Eaton\u2019s sentence of death was neither excessive nor disproportionate to sentences generally imposed by other sentencing bodies in Virginia for comparable or similar crimes. Additionally, nothing in the record suggests that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">XIII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We find no reversible error among the issues presented by Eaton\u2019s appeal. Having reviewed the sentence of death pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.1, we decline to set it aside.

Arizona, 451 U.S. <em>477 </em>(1981), requires the police to stop questioning a suspect when he invokes his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. Interrogation may not be resumed until a lawyer is present, or until the suspect himself reinitiates the dialogue. The question in this case is whether Dennis Wayne Eaton invoked his Fifth Amendment right to counsel during his interrogation by Officers Dudley and Hottinger on February 24 when he referred to counsel with statements such as \u201cMaybe I ought to talk to a lawyer,\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t you say I had a right to a lawyer,\u201d and \u201cI need to talk to someone, a lawyer, a psychiatrist, someone.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In my opinion, when equivocal statements such as these are made, the most obvious and appropriate response is to ask the suspect, \u201cDo you want a lawyer?\u201d. The suspect\u2019s response to this question should resolve the ambiguity and allow the interrogators to proceed accordingly. This test is easy to apply, consistent with <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966) and its progeny, and efficient in terms of police and court time. It provides a true bright-line rule which is fair to defendants and police alike.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Under the rule adopted today, however, the constitutional right to an attorney cannot be invoked unless the defendant utilizes language which is clear, unambiguous, and \u00fanequivocal. This is a very demanding standard to place on the exercise of one\u2019s constitutional rights, and I believe it has both practical and legal flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The cornerstone of <em>Miranda </em>was to dispel the inherent coercion of custodial interrogations, and to allow a defendant to exercise his free will in asserting his constitutional privileges. A principal objective of this policy was to allow a defendant to request counsel \u201cin any manner\u201d and at any stage of the proceeding. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444. The standard adopted by the majority today complies with neither the rationale, nor the language, of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In support of their standard, the majority cites one phrase from <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona-, </em>a phrase in which the Supreme Court declared that <em>Miranda </em>does not allow the police to continue a custodial interrogation if the defendant \u201chas <em>clearly asserted </em>his right to counsel.\u201d 451 U.S. at 485 (emphasis added). This phrase provides tenuous support at most for the majority\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\"><em>Edwards </em>involved the waiver of a constitutional right, not the invocation of that right. There was no question as to whether or not the defendant wished to have an attorney present. Furthermore, in discussing the waiver issue, the Court noted that in some jurisdictions waiver was possible, \u201cwhen the request for counsel is equivocal. <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>597 F.2d 513 (CA5 1979) <em>(en banc). See Thompson </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>601 F.2d 768 (CA5 1979).\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 486, n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">When specifically addressing the invocation of counsel issue, the. Supreme Court did comment in <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 738 (1969), that the statement, \u201cI think I had better get a lawyer before I talk any more,\u201d might be sufficient to invoke the defendant\u2019s right to counsel under the \u201cin any manner\u201d language of <em>Miranda, </em>but fell short of the test under <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>379 U.S. 487 (1964), which controlled the case. <em>Frazier, </em>394 U.S. at 738. Three years after <em>Edwards, </em>the Supreme Court in <em>Smith </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91 (1984), acknowledged that it had not established a standard for determining the consequences of an equivocal request for counsel, and determined that it need not resolve the issue in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Based on these cases, one must take a step of significant proportions to maintain that the Court\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cclearly asserted\u201d in <em>Edwards, </em>established or even supports the standard adopted by the majority today.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In addition to placing an improper burden on the defendant, the majority\u2019s exacting test also places an unnecessary burden on the police officer. The intent of the defendant is now to be measured through the perspective of the interrogating officer, the very person who has a substantial interest in the fruits of the interrogation. What may seem clear and unequivocal to one police officer may appear ambiguous and equivocal to another. Furthermore, his judgment will continually be subject to review by the courts. \u2022Courts, like police officers, may well arrive at divergent conclusions regarding the import of a suspect\u2019s references to an attorney.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The rule adopted by the Court today undercuts the rationale of <em>Miranda </em>and the preference expressed by the Supreme Court for establishing bright-line rules which will provide law enforcement officers with appropriate guides for responses to particular actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In my opinion, the record in this case supports a finding that Eaton intended to request counsel, but at a minimum, exemplifies the practical and legal dangers inherent in the majority\u2019s rule requiring an unambiguous request for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Eaton, a functional illiterate with an I.Q. between 84 and 94, was interrogated on his release from the hospital after three days of treatment for a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. About an hour before the interrogation began, Officers Dudley and Hottinger met with two state troopers and the Commonwealth\u2019s attorneys for the City of Salem and the County of Rockbridge. At this meeting, strategy for the interrogation of Eaton was discussed, including the fact that unrelated property charges pending in Rock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ingham County had been <em>nolle prossed </em>earlier that morning, thereby releasing the attorney appointed for Eaton on those charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">At the beginning of the interrogation, Officer Dudley explained the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Eaton, but no written explanation or waiver of rights was used. The interrogation was not tape recorded. The interview lasted approximately 45 minutes, during which time Sergeant Dudley testified, and his handwritten notes reflected, that Eaton made at least five references to an attorney including \u201cDidn\u2019t you say I had a right to an attorney?\u201d and, on at least two occasions, that \u201che ought to talk to an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">After each reference to an attorney, the police officers reiterated that Eaton had a right to an attorney. Eaton remained silent. The police then reinitiated the interrogation with conversation concerning Eaton\u2019s girlfriend Judy, who was being buried that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">At one point, after Eaton said, \u201cMaybe I\u2019d better talk to a lawyer,\u201d Sergeant Dudley left the room to confer with the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney concerning the implications of Eaton\u2019s reference to counsel. They decided to continue the interrogation and determine where they stood on the attorney question later. The interrogation finally concluded when Eaton again stated that he needed time to think.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">On this record, Eaton\u2019s continued waiver of his rights was brought into question when he began referring to his right to counsel. As Eaton continued to refer to counsel, albeit at times in an ambiguous manner, the reactions of the police evidenced their own concern over the consequences of Eaton\u2019s statements. Yet, they took no affirmative action to remove the ambiguity and find out whether he wanted counsel. Rather, they orchestrated their actions in a manner which they believed would avoid the requirement of the presence of an attorney during the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The rule adopted by the majority today encourages such activity, rather than encouraging police officers to determine in a straightforward manner the intent of persons in custodial interrogations regarding the exercise of their constitutional rights. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>end could easily be met by a rule which requires simply asking the clarifying question, \u201cDo you want a lawyer?\u201d.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> The majority\u2019s holding that, under <em>Poyner </em>v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 401, 329 S.E.2d 815, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 888 (1985), Eaton\u2019s statement inquiring about his right to an attorney was only a clarifying question and not a request for counsel, does not address the consequences of Eaton\u2019s remaining references to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Detective Hottinger\u2019s initial handwritten notes only referred to Eaton\u2019s statement that he needed to talk to someone. Hottinger\u2019s second, typewritten set of notes and his testimony at the suppression hearing state that Eaton referred to an attorney on two or three other occasions, but Hottinger did not recite the precise wording of those statements. Dudley\u2019s notes state that Eaton said \u201che ought to talk to a lawyer,\u201d \u201cmaybe I better talk to a lawyer,\u201d and \u201cmaybe I ought to talk to a lawyer.\u201d Although the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence upon which the trial court relied must also be considered. Without identifying either Hottinger or Dudley by name, the court held that statements testified to by each, \u201cDid you say 1 had a right to an attorney?\u201d, and \u201cI might ought to talk to an attorney,\u201d were ambiguous and equivocal and, therefore, did not constitute a request for counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\"> This approach to determining whether the defendant intends to invoke his constitutional right has been adopted by a number of courts. <em>See, e.g., Norman </em>v. <em>Ducharme, </em>871 F.2d 1483 (9th Cir. 1989); <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>849 F.2d 536, 539 (11th Cir. 1988); <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Gotay, </em>844 F.2d 971 (2d Cir. 1988); <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Fouche, </em>776 F.2d 1398 (9th Cir. 1985), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>denied, </em>486 U.S. 1017 (1988); <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Cherry, </em>733 F.2d 1124 (5th Cir. 1984); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>601 F.2d 768 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>597 F.2d 513 (5th Cir. <em>en banc), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 981 (1979); State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>427 N.W.2d 217 (Minn. 1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moulds, </em>105 Idaho 880, 673 P.2d 1074 (1983); <em>Cannady </em>v. <em>State, </em>427 So.2d 723 (Fla. 1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Robtoy, </em>98 Wash.2d 30, 653 P.2d 284 (1982); <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>State, </em>644 P.2d 172 (Wyo. 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\"> Compare, for example, the holding of one circuit court in this Commonwealth that a defendant invoked his right to counsel when he stated that \u201che might want to talk to a lawyer,\u201d <em>Bunch </em>v.
