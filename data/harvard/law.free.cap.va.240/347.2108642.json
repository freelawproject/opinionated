Hagan brought this action against appellee Rodolfo (or Rudolfo) Antonio, M.D., and others, for damages allegedly occurring during a physical examination conducted by the defendant on July 30, 1987 in connection with plaintiffs employment by Fairfax County. The defendant filed a demurrer and motion to dismiss, asserting that the motion for judgment was insufficient in law because the plaintiff had failed to allege that she had given the defendant notice \u201cof the alleged malpractice in writing\u201d prior to commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">Upon consideration of argument of counsel, the trial court sustained the demurrer and the motion. We awarded the plaintiff this appeal from the December 1989 order below dismissing with prejudice the plaintiffs case against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">We shall examine the allegations of the plaintiffs motion for judgment according to the familiar principle that a demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. On brief and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>during oral argument of the appeal, defendant disputes the accuracy of plaintiffs charges and mentions facts wholly at odds with the plaintiffs account of the incident. At this stage of the proceeding, however, the defendant\u2019s recitation of the facts must be disregarded because the demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs pleading only.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The plaintiff alleges that, in connection with her employment as a \u201ccivilian\u201d with the Fairfax County Police Department, she was required by the County to submit to a \u201cpre-employment physical\u201d to be conducted by defendant. She asserts that, prior to the scheduled date for the exam, she was told by County officials that the County would accept records of examinations conducted by her private physician in lieu of having certain tests (\u201ca pap smear, a pelvic examination and a breast examination test\u201d) performed by defendant. The plaintiff further alleges that upon arrival for the examination at the County Medical Exam Unit, she brought records of her previous tests which \u201cwere all within normal limits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">She asserts that she was examined preliminarily by a nurse \u201cwho took her blood, blood pressure, urine sample, and weight and tested her hearing.\u201d She further alleges that when she arrived in the room where she was to be examined by defendant, no nurse or other attendant was present. She asserts that defendant stated that she must submit to a breast examination, although he agreed to accept the results of the other tests performed by her private physician. According to plaintiff, she then asked that a nurse be present in the room during the examination and defendant granted this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The plaintiff further alleges that when defendant examined her breasts, \u201che ran his fingers over the Plaintiffs nipples and asked her if she was excited.\u201d The plaintiff asserts that defendant did not conduct \u201ca breast examination of the type that had been conducted by prior obstetricians and gynecologists on your Plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">As the result of defendant\u2019s conduct, plaintiff alleges, she \u201cbecame extremely emotional and upset and started to cry.\u201d Claiming that defendant was guilty of an assault and battery as well as an intentional infliction of emotional distress, plaintiff alleges that she is entitled to recover damages because the \u201cexamination did not constitute a proper medical examination, but rather was done to satisfy [defendant\u2019s] prurient interests, was accompanied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>sexual innuendos uttered by [defendant] and was extremely offensive to the Plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer. She maintains that the Act \u201cdoes not address nonmedical conduct, and does not legislate a blanket, of procedural protection for all acts no matter how inappropriate, illegal or disgraceful, merely because the perpetrator is a physician and his victim is a patient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The plaintiff argues that the question whether defendant\u2019s acts constituted \u201chealth care\u201d within the meaning of the Act, thus triggering the notice requirement, is an issue for the trier of fact to decide, given the allegations of the motion for judgment. If the issues raised by these allegations are not left to the fact-finder, the plaintiff urges, \u201cthen the statutory definitions are rendered meaningless and any and all intentional tortious misconduct will be shielded by [the Act].\u201d We do not agree that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The applicable statutory language is clear and unambiguous. Thus, as in two prior cases involving similar issues, we will apply the plain meaning of the Act\u2019s language to the facts of this case. <em>See Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Fairfax Hospital System, </em>239 Va. 307, 389 S.E.2d 458 (1990); <em>Glisson </em>v. <em>Loxley, </em>235 Va. 62, 366 S.E.2d 68 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The following pertinent portions of the Act bear upon the issue presented. Code \u00a7 8.01-581.2(A) provides, in part: \u201cNo action may be brought for malpractice against a health care provider unless the claimant notifies the health care provider in writing .. . prior to commencing the action.\u201d There is no dispute that this plaintiff did not give the required notice. But, is this an action for \u201cmalpractice\u201d within the meaning of the Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">According to Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1, the term \u201cmalpractice\u201d is defined as \u201cany tort based on health care or professional services rendered, or which should have been rendered, by a health care provider, to a patient.\u201d There is no dispute that this defendant was a health care provider. Likewise, it cannot be disputed that assault and battery as well as intentional infliction of emotional distress are \u201ctorts,\u201d and qualify as \u201cany\u201d tort under the Act. <em>See Glisson, </em>235 Va. at 69, 366 S.E.2d at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The crucial question then becomes whether the plaintiffs allegations, as a matter of law, demonstrate that defendant\u2019s alleged tortious conduct was \u201cbased on health care or professional services rendered,\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Under Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u00a7 8.01-581.1, \u201chealth care\u201d is defined as \u201cany act . . . by any health care provider for, to, or on behalf of a-patient during the patient\u2019s medical . . . care.\u201d The plaintiff does not dispute that medical \u201ccare\u201d includes performance of a physical exam. If the foregoing query is answered affirmatively, this qualifies as an action for \u201cmalpractice\u201d under the Act and the suit is barred because notice was not given to the defendant as required by \u00a7 8.01-581.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Reference to the plaintiffs own language in the motion for judgment clearly demonstrates that defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cbased on\u201d health care or professional services rendered. For example, the plaintiff alleges that the \u201cpre-employment physical took place on July 30, 1987, and was performed by the Defendant.\u201d Also, she asserts that after the nurse conducted \u201ca preliminary examination,\u201d she was instructed to enter a room where the defendant \u201cwould complete the physical examination.\u201d After reciting the fact of the request for a nurse to be present during the breast examination, the plaintiff alleges that her breasts \u201cwere examined by\u201d the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">When the statutory definitions are applied to the facts alleged, the conclusion must be that defendant\u2019s conduct, legitimate or improper, was \u201cbased on\u201d an \u201cact\u201d by a health care provider to \u201ca patient during the patient\u2019s medical . . . care.\u201d In other words, the defendant\u2019s conduct, according to the allegations, stemmed from, arose from, and was \u201cbased on\u201d the performance of a physical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In a rather frenetic argument, the plaintiff posits that an affirmance of the trial court\u2019s decision will mean that any time a physician, during examination or treatment of a patient, commits any one of a number of criminal acts which could be classified as torts, such as robbery or rape, such conduct could be classified as \u201chealth care\u201d and thus be \u201cmalpractice.\u201d The answer to such a suggestion should be obvious, aside from the fact that this is not such a case. It is undisputed that a breast examination, including the touching, is an inseparable part of a typical, complete physical examination of a woman. Rape or robbery during such an examination, or during treatment of a patient, could never arguably be classified as an inseparable part of examination or treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">This conclusion is illustrated by our two prior cases on the issue. In <em>Glisson, </em>an alleged battery arising from a patient\u2019s lack of consent for performance of arthroscopic surgery was held to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>arisen from health care and to be \u201cmalpractice.\u201d 235 Va. at 69, 366 S.E.2d at 72. In Gonzalez, the patient\u2019s toe was lacerated during a physical therapy session by a sharp metal object inside a whirlpool tub. We rejected the plaintiffs contention that the action was not one for \u201cmalpractice,\u201d but was a claim merely based upon \u201cordinary, traditional negligence.\u201d 239 Va. at 309-10, 389 S.E.2d at 459-60. In both cases, the respective claims were based upon conduct that was an inseparable part of the health care being rendered and, under the broad language of the Act, amounted to \u201cmalpractice,\u201d requiring the statutory notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In response to the plaintiffs demand that we read the Act more narrowly, we repeat what was said in <em>Gonzalez. </em>\u201cWhen there is a claim that the language employed in a statute is too broad in its scope, the fault, if any, should be corrected by the General Assembly, not by this Court.\u201d 239 Va. at 310-11, 389 S.E.2d at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b376-7\">JUSTICE HASSELL, with whom JUSTICE WHITING and JUSTICE LACY</author>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">I dissent because I do not believe that the Medical Malpractice Act, Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1 <em>et seq., </em>applies to acts of sexual molestation committed by a health care provider when such acts would constitute the crime of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">As the majority correctly observes, the dispositive issue in this appeal is whether Dr. Antonio provided health care to Ms. Hagan at the time he allegedly sexually molested her. It is true that the Act defines health care as \u201cany act . . . by any health care provider for, to, or on behalf of a patient during the patient\u2019s medical . . . care.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-581.1. However, I do not interpret the phrase \u201cany act\u201d as broadly as the majority because to do so would cause illogical consequences which the Act clearly was not designed to achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">The Act was passed by the General Assembly in response to the medical malpractice insurance crisis. The purpose of the Act was to curtail the escalating costs of medical malpractice insurance premiums so that Virginia\u2019s health care providers would be able to afford such coverage. <em>See </em>Senate Document No. 22, entitled Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>port of the Commission to Study the Costs and Administration of Health Care Services to the Governor and the General Assembly of Virginia. The Act, among other things, creates a process which is intended to resolve colorable claims of medical malpractice against health care providers and discourage the pursuit of frivolous claims. To accomplish these objectives, the Act grants numerous protections to health care providers which are not enjoyed by other classes of defendants. <em>See Etheridge </em>v. <em>Medical Center Hospitals, </em>237 Va. 87, 376 S.E.2d 525 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Courts are not at liberty to rewrite statutes because that is the function of the legislature. However, we have repeatedly said that \u201c[wjhile in the construction of statutes the constant endeavor of the courts is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, that intention must be gathered from the words used, unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity.\u201d <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Town &amp; Country Properties, </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990); <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934); <em>See also Simpson </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>162 Va. 621, 638, 175 S.E. 320, 327 (1934); <em>Ingram </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>174 Va. 1, 9, 5 S.E.2d 624, 627 (1939) (Hudgins, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The majority\u2019s literal construction of the Act will create illogical results which the General Assembly did not intend. For example, under the majority\u2019s holding, a physician who commits an act of sexual molestation on a young boy during the course of a urological examination would be entitled to the protection of the Act. Similarly, an obstetrician who sexually assaulted a female patient during a pelvic examination would also be entitled to the protection of the Act. Certainly, the General Assembly did not intend such a broad interpretation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Neither <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Fairfax Hospital System, </em>239 Va. 307, 389 S.E.2d 458 (1990) nor <em>Glisson </em>v. <em>Loxley, </em>235 Va. 62, 366 S.E.2d 68 (1988), relied upon by the majority, involved acts of sexual molestation committed by a physician. Rather, they involved issues of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The tort alleged by Hagan was not a tort based upon the provision of health care but rather a tort arising out of Dr. Antonio\u2019s prurient interests and actions. This alleged tort falls outside of the scope of the Act. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a trial on the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
