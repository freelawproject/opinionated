In connection with the work, the Department condemned a parcel of land as being the property of Mabel Farnsworth and Leona Farnsworth Eads. It was not considered to be the property of the heirs of A. B. Lowe during the acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>When excavation of the parcel commenced, the Lowe heirs claimed ownership of the property. They consulted appellant William P. Sheffield, an attorney, to determine if compensation could be recovered for the alleged wrongful taking of their land. After some discussion with Department representatives, the Lowe heirs did not pursue the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Some years later, the Lowe heirs sold the property to Sheffield and his wife. In 1987, the Sheffields filed the present action against the Department, inexplicably \u201cat the relation of\u201d the Lowe heirs, labelling the pleading, \u201cMotion for Judgment in Ejectment.\u201d The plaintiffs alleged that the Lowe heirs were possessed of the subject parcel \u201cat the time the defendant took possession\u201d and that the Department \u201cnow claims title to such land as a part of the highway system all of which is to the damage of the plaintiffs in the amount of $10,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Responding in the name of the \u201cCommonwealth of Virginia, Department of Transportation,\u201d the Attorney General filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal on the ground of sovereign immunity. Asserting that the motion for judgment \u201csounds in ejectment,\u201d the Attorney General contended that the ejectment statutes contain neither a waiver of sovereign immunity nor any authorization to bring an action in ejectment against the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Ruling that ejectment \u201cdoes not lie against the Commonwealth under the facts of this case,\u201d the trial court sustained the motion for summary judgment. We awarded the plaintiffs this appeal from the October 1989 order dismissing the action with prejudice, in order to consider the foregoing issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Constitution of Virginia prohibits enactment of any law \u201cwhereby private property shall be taken or damaged for public uses, without just compensation.\u201d The plain purpose of the constitutional provision is \u201cto guarantee to an owner just compensation both where his property is <em>taken </em>for public uses and where it is <em>damaged </em>for public uses, irrespective of whether there be negligence in the taking or the damage.\u201d <em>Heldt </em>v. <em>Elizabeth River Tunnel </em>District, 196 Va. 477, 482, 84 S.E.2d 511, 514 (1954). <em>Accord Hampton Roads Sanitation District </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>234 Va. 235, 238, 360 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1987). Moreover, the constitutional provision is self-executing and the landowner may enforce the right to compensation in a common-law action. <em>Id.; Morris </em>v. <em>Elizabeth River Tunnel District, </em>203 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>196, 198, 123 S.E.2d 398, 400 (1962); <em>Heldt, </em>196 Va. at 482, 84 S.E.2d at 515; <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Newport News, </em>105 Va. 108, 114-15, 52 S.E. 821, 824 (1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\">Ejectment is a common-law action, although it is now controlled by statute, Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-131 through -165. Indeed, the codification expressly provides that the common-law action of ejectment \u201cis retained.\u201d \u00a7 8.01-131.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">In order to determine whether ejectment is an appropriate remedy under these circumstances, the nature of the action should be reviewed. Ejectment is an action to determine the title and right of possession to real property. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>233 Va. 210, 216, 355 S.E.2d 563, 567 (1987). The judgment entered for a successful plaintiff in the action \u201cshall be, that he recover the possession of the premises . . . according to the description thereof in the motion for judgment.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-155.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">We have not been confronted before with the precise issue presented in this case. <em>But cf. e.g., Bolling </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c., </em>24 Va. (3 Rand.) 563, 573-74 (1825) (ejectment proper to establish landowner\u2019s title subject to easement held by town of Petersburg for a public highway). And, the courts in other jurisdictions do not deal uniformly with the suitability of a landowner\u2019s action in ejectment for so-called \u201cinverse condemnation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The author of a respected treatise on the subject notes, \u201cit is well settled that in all cases in which possession of land has been wrongfully taken from the owner under color of eminent domain, whether the supposed taking is of a fee or only of an easement, the owner may recover possession in an action of ejectment.\u201d 6A <em>Nichols\u2019 Law of Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 28.32 (Rev. 3rd ed. 1990) (footnotes omitted). Nichols observes, however, that ejectment \u201chas frequently been denied, primarily because of the adverse effect thereof upon the public welfare, but often because other remedies are available.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The writer of an exhaustive Note on the subject views the state of the law differently. \u201cIf the public is benefiting from a particular use of property, ejectment . . . would cause that use to discontinue with possible harm to the public. Although such relief is sometimes granted, it is more often denied, usually because of the possible harmful effect upon the public welfare.\u201d Note, <em>Eminent Domain </em>\u2014 <em>Rights and Remedies of an Uncompensated Landowner, </em>1962 Wash. U.L.Q. 210, 223-24 (1962) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Given the nature of the action of ejectment, and the entitlement of the successful claimant to be put into possession of the disputed land, we conclude that the remedy is inappropriate and unsuitable as a vehicle to prosecute an inverse condemnation claim against the Commonwealth. If landowners whose property has been taken mistakenly without compensation by the State for highway purposes could eject the State from the highway and take possession of the roadway, the public transportation system could be thrown into chaos and a continuous highway system would be jeopardized. Furthermore, the landowner\u2019s constitutional right is a right to just compensation, not a right to recover possession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\">We reiterate that we decide in this case only the question posed at the outset, that is, whether ejectment is available under these circumstances. Implicit in our decision is the assumption, but not the decision, that sovereign immunity would not bar the action of ejectment against the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">And, notwithstanding the contention of the Attorney General, we will not decide in this case that the enactment of Code \u00a7 8.01-187 created the sole remedy for enforcement of inverse condemnation claims like the one presented in this case. That section, enacted in 1968, authorizing use of the declaratory judgment procedure, \u201cmerely supplies another remedy to enforce existing rights\u201d of a landowner whose property has been wrongfully appropriated to public use without just compensation. <em>Stroobants </em>v. <em>Fugate, Highway Comm., </em>209 Va. 275, 277, 163 S.E.2d 192, 194 (1968). In an unbroken line of cases, the most recent being <em>McDonnell, </em>the Court has said a landowner may enforce his constitutional right to compensation in \u201ca\u201d common-law action. 234 Va. at 238, 360 S.E.2d at 843. We make these statements fully aware of the suggestion by dictum in <em>Chaffinch </em>v. <em>C &amp; P Tel. Co., </em>227 Va. 68, 71-72, 313 S.E.2d 376, 378 (1984), that there is \u201csome logic\u201d in the argument that the enactment of \u00a7 8.01-187 was intended to create the \u201csole remedy\u201d available when an inverse condemnation claim is asserted against the sovereign or one of its agencies or political subdivisions. <em>See also McDonnell, </em>234 Va. at 238 n.2, 360 S.E.2d at 843 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court dismissing the ejectment action will be</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
