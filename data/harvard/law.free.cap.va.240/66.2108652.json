In early 1988, after considering several alternatives, the Board adopted resolutions declaring that it was necessary to acquire a tract containing \u201c50.2569 Acres, more or less\u201d in the City, owned by members of the Hamer family, as a site for a future public high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">In May 1988, the Board filed a petition for condemnation in the trial court. By responsive pleadings, the owners challenged the internal proceedings that led to the Board\u2019s adoption of the resolutions authorizing the taking, questioned whether the taking was being made for a public purpose, and challenged the necessity for the taking. The owners demanded a jury trial on all issues other than just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The trial court denied the request for jury trial and heard <em>ore terms </em>all issues other than that of just compensation. After overruling the owners\u2019 other objections, the court conducted an extensive <em>ore terms </em>hearing on the question of the necessity of the taking, during which both sides presented witnesses and documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The owners\u2019 first contention on appeal is that the court erred at this \u201cfirst part of the bifurcated trial\u201d in ruling that the petition for condemnation made a <em>prima facie </em>case for the necessity of the taking, thus placing the burden on the owners to go forward with evidence to refute the Board\u2019s assertion of necessity. The owners contend that the burden of proof and the burden of going forward with evidence on that issue should have been on the condemnor.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">After that hearing, the court determined that the Board had proved the necessity of the taking. Thereupon, the court empaneled commissioners for trial of the issue of just compensation. After two days of testimony, the commissioners awarded $2,764,129.50 as just compensation for the property taken. The court overruled the owners\u2019 exceptions and confirmed the commissioners\u2019 report by final order entered August 11, 1989. We granted the owners an appeal, limited to the questions stated in the opening paragraph of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>I. NECESSITY OF THE TAKING</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The parties devoted a full day in the trial court to evidence and argument concerning the necessity of the taking. A large part of this time was consumed in debating whether there was a need, as the Board contended, for a new high school. The parties also devoted considerable time in oral argument and on brief to that issue on appeal. The owners contend that the Board had the burden of proof on that issue. The Board seemed to concede that it had some burden, but, analogizing this proceeding to zoning cases, contended that it was only required to show that the issue of necessity was \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d and that its petition was sufficient to make that showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">We, as well as the trial court, should have been spared this needless exercise. The question whether a taking is for a public purpose is a judicial question, reviewable by the courts, but the necessity or expediency of the condemnor\u2019s project, when its public purpose has been established, is a legislative question. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Highway Commissioner, </em>212 Va. 689, 692, 187 S.E.2d 156, 159 (1972). The power of eminent domain is an essential attribute of sovereignty which, in our system, inheres in the General Assembly. The only constitutional limitations imposed upon the power of eminent domain are contained in the just compensation clause, Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 11. Thus, there is no constitutional right to a hearing on the issue of necessity. <em>See Railway Company </em>v. <em>Llewellyn, </em>156 Va. 258, 278-80, 157 S.E. 809, 815-16 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The legislature may delegate its power to political subdivisions, governmental bodies, and certain regulated private entities exercising functions charged with the public interest, but such a delegation does not render the necessity for the exercise of the power by the delegatee subject to judicial review, unless the legislature, by statute, expressly so provides. <em>Stanpark Realty Corporation </em>v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>199 Va. 716, 721, 101 S.E.2d 527, 531 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Code \u00a7 15.1-237, by cross-reference to other sections, imposes limitations upon condemnations for certain enumerated public purposes, subjecting the necessity of those takings to judicial review under certain circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Public school uses, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>are not among the purposes subjected by statute to judicial review on the issue of necessity. Accordingly, neither the trial court nor this court has jurisdiction to review the wisdom of the Board\u2019s legislative decision that an acquisition of property was necessary for an expansion of the school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">II. SITE SELECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">There was an additional component to the owners\u2019 attack on the Board\u2019s right to acquire the property. Even if it is beyond dispute that it was necessary for the Board to acquire property somewhere, the owners contend that the Board selected their particular property \u201carbitrarily and capriciously.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In Stewart, 212 Va. at 692, 187 S.E.2d at 159, we observed that although the necessity and expediency of a road was a legislative question, the discretion of the officials determining its <em>location </em>would be \u201creviewable by the courts only if it is arbitrarily or capriciously exercised or where there is manifest fraud.\u201d In <em>Kricorian </em>v. C <em>&amp; P Tel. Co., </em>217 Va. 284, 288, 227 S.E.2d 725, 728 (1976), we reaffirmed that statement in <em>Stewart, </em>holding that a condemnor\u2019s discretion \u201cin determining the specific property and the amount of land to be taken\u201d was subject to judicial review if that discretion is alleged to have been arbitrarily and capriciously exercised. Examining the evidence in <em>Kricorian, </em>we determined that the \u201ccondemnor\u2019s choice of plans was at least fairly debatable, and action is not arbitrary or capricious if exercised honestly and upon due consideration, when there is reason for a difference of opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Having alleged an arbitrary and capricious exercise of discretion, the owners were entitled to prove it if they could. In such cases, however, the burden is upon the owner, because it is presumed that an entity to which the legislature has delegated the power of eminent domain \u201chas exercised the power with the wisdom and discretion lodged in it by the legislature. The burden of showing the contrary is upon any person who objects to the proceeding.\u201d 1A. J. Sackman, Nichols\u2019 The Law of Eminent Domain \u00a7 4.11[4], p. 4-291 (rev. 3rd ed. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Accordingly, we hold that when a condemnee alleges that the condemnor has arbitrarily and capriciously decided upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>-location or quantity of property to be taken, the condemnee has both the burden of persuasion and the burden of going forward with the evidence on that issue. If the condemnee establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden of going forward with the evidence shifts to the condemnor. The condemnor\u2019s burden is then only to produce sufficient evidence to show that the issue was \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d <em>Kricorian, </em>217 Va. at 288, 227 S.E.2d at 728. If the condemnor makes that showing, the court will conclude that the condemnor\u2019s discretion was fairly and honestly exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Here, the trial court correctly placed the burden of persuasion on the owners. Reviewing the evidence, the court found that the owners had failed to adduce any proof in support of their allegation of arbitrary and capricious site selection. The record fully supports that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">III. BURDEN OF PROOF ON ISSUE OF JUST COMPENSATION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The owners assign error to the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the commissioners that the Board had the burden of proof on the issue of just compensation. We have not previously made an express ruling on that question. The present case involves a taking of the owners\u2019 entire property. Accordingly, we are not here concerned with the burdens of proving damage to the residue or enhancement in value which attend most partial takings. <em>Cf. State Highway Comm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Allmond, </em>220 Va. 235, 240 n.2, 257 S.E.2d 832, 835 n.2 (1979) (burden of proving damages to residue is on owner; burden of proving enhancement is on condemnor). Rather, we are concerned with the allocation of the burden of proving the value of the property taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">In support of their contention that this burden should be on the condemnor, the owners analogize the case to an action at law, in which the burden would be upon the condemnor because it is th\u00e9 \u201cplaintiff.\u201d That argument misconceives the origin of the statutory scheme governing condemnation cases. Condemnation proceedings in Virginia, as elsewhere in the English common-law system, were originally conducted pursuant to the ancient common-law writ of <em>ad quod damnum. </em>The writ was issued out of chancery to the sheriff, directing him to empanel a jury or commissioners to enquire what damages the king would incur by laying out a market, fair, highway, or other public works on private property. The proceeding was entirely <em>ex </em>parte; the landowner was given no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>notice or hearing and was not even named. The jury or commissioners went upon the land and returned their report to the court, but no proceedings were had in a courtroom. Neither the judge nor counsel took part. <em>See generally, </em>1 Nichols\u2019 The Law of Eminent Domain \u00a7 1.21, p. 1-71 and 1-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\">After the adoption of the due process guarantees contained in both State and Federal Constitutions, <em>ad quod damnum </em>proceedings were modified to provide the owner an opportunity for fair notice and a right to be heard on the issue of just compensation. Nevertheless, the function of the commissioners remains today essentially as it was under the writ of <em>ad quod damnum. </em>The commissioners, who are disinterested resident freeholders, take an oath \u201cthat they will faithfully and impartially <em>ascertain </em>what will be the value of the property to be taken.\u201d Code \u00a7 25-46.20 (emphasis added). They are not sworn, as a jury would be, to decide the case \u201caccording to the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The reason for the distinction is that commissioners may still, as in the time of <em>ad quod damnum </em>proceedings, \u201cascertain\u201d the value of the property taken without being limited by the opinions of those who testify in the courtroom. They are not bound by the opinions of expert witnesses, <em>Highway Commissioner </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>216 Va. 745, 748-49, 222 S.E.2d 780, 782 (1976), and may, indeed, \u201cascertain\u201d the value of the property based \u201clargely\u201d upon their view of it, <em>Highway Commissioner </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>216 Va. 639, 641, 222 S.E.2d 776, <em>777 </em>(1976), although the commissioners\u2019 view is no longer, as it once was, to be considered as the \u201csole evidence in the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Further, the commissioners are not bound by the apparent <em>weight </em>of the evidence, although their awards must be \u201cmeasured by the evidence,\u201d must be \u201crelated to the value of the property,\u201d and must not be \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>VEPCO </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>204 Va. 574, 578, 132 S.E.2d 436, 439 (1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>376 U.S. 956 (1964). For those reasons, the burden-of-proof principles which govern actions at law are inapplicable to condemnation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Because of the great responsibility and relative independence vested in condemnation commissioners to \u201cascertain what will be the value of the property to be taken,\u201d there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>burden of proof, in the common-law sense, on the issue of just compensation. The condemnor must institute the proceeding by filing a petition and giving notice pursuant to Code \u00a7 25-46.9, but the owner need not file responsive pleadings. He is not in default on the issue of just compensation if he fails to do so, because it is expressly provided that he may appear and present evidence on that issue notwithstanding his failure to file responsive pleadings. <em>Id. </em>The condemnor\u2019s duty to institute the proceedings is therefore not the counterpart of the burden that devolves upon a plaintiff by virtue of his bringing an action at law. There is no ultimate \u201crisk of nonpersuasion\u201d on the issue of just compensation for property taken in a condemnation proceeding, and the trial court correctly so held in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">IV. RIGHT TO OPEN AND CLOSE</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The owner contends that the trial court erred in giving the Board the right to open and close the final arguments to the commissioners after having ruled that the Board did not have the burden of proof on the issue of just compensation. The question of the right to open and close was decided in <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>201 Va. 79, 109 S.E.2d 409 (1959), where we said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">It has been the traditional practice in this State for the condemner to open and close the argument before Commissioners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">Regardless of the burden of proof, the principle remains that the condemner has the burden of bringing the proceeding and going forward with the evidence. This clearly gives him the right to open and close.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 84-85, 109 S.E.2d at 414 (citations omitted). Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">V. COMMENTS OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">In closing argument before the commissioners, counsel for the Board criticized the testimony of one of the owners\u201d experts on valuation and then asked, \u201c[i]s that what you are going to pay your money for?\u201d Owners\u2019 counsel immediately objected. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>court sustained the objection and instructed the commissioners that counsel\u2019s reference to \u201cyour money\u201d was improper argument and was to be disregarded. The owners nevertheless moved for a mistrial. Counsel for the Board agreed that the remark had been improper and stated that it had been inadvertent. The court denied the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\">Soon thereafter, in concluding his rebuttal argument, counsel for the Board said to the commissioners, \u201cGentlemen, I say to you the same thing: Be fair, but be fair to yourself when you come in with your award.\u201d The owners\u2019 counsel again objected, saying \u201c[tjhat is the same thing he was talking about before.\u201d The court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">On appeal, the owners point out that the commissioners were required by law to be resident freeholders of the City, and thus, necessarily, were subject to assessment for local property taxes which would be levied to defray their award. Therefore, the owners argue, references to paying \u201cyour money\u201d and being \u201cfair to yourself\u2019 were strong appeals to their private pecuniary interests, and for that reason highly improper. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In <em>Maxey </em>v. <em>Hubble, </em>238 Va. 607, 385 S.E.2d 593 (1989), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">Where counsel makes an improper statement and the court takes prompt action to remove it by appropriate instruction to the jury, it will ordinarily be presumed that the jury heeded the instruction and that no lasting harm was done. But where the prejudicial effect is so overwhelming that it cannot be removed by the court\u2019s instruction, the injured party, if he requests it, is entitled to a new trial. <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 294, 303, 237 S.E.2d 150, 156 (1977). The injured party\u2019s right to a new trial is especially strong where his opponent has persisted in an objectionable course of conduct after the trial judge has expressed disapproval of it, sustained an objection to it, or instructed the jury to disregard it. In that situation, an appellate court will presume that the prejudicial effect of the improper conduct was too strong to be removed by further admonitions or jury instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 615-16, 385 S.E.2d at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Standing alone, any prejudicial effect of either remark by the Board\u2019s counsel would have been cured by a prompt cautionary instruction from the court. Counsel\u2019s persistence in a course of conduct which the court had disapproved and instructed the commissioners to exclude from their considerations, however, raised a presumption that \u201cthe prejudicial effect of the improper conduct was too strong to be removed by further admonitions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616, 385 S.E.2d at 597. Nothing was done in the present case to rebut that presumption. When counsel for the Board, for the second time, made an appeal to the commissioners\u2019 personal interests, the court gave no further cautionary instruction, but overruled the objection. In those circumstances, the party injured by the improper remarks has made out an \u201cespecially strong\u201d case for a new trial. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial on the issue of just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"> When <em>Stanpark </em>was decided in 1958, Code \u00a7 15-668, the statutory predecessor of Code \u00a7 15.1-237, provided that no property was to be condemned for the enumerated purposes \u201cunless the necessity therefor shall be shown to exist to the satisfaction of the court.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>A 1983 amendment provides an alternate method of establishing necessity: where it is \u201cdeclared by resolution of the governing body following a public hearing.\u201d Acts 1983, c. 434.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\"> <em>See </em>Office of the Executive Secretary, Supreme Court of Virginia, Handbook for Judges and Clerks in Virginia, p. 1:A-19 (rev. 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"Arl\">JUSTICE COMPTON</author>\n<p id=\"AP\">dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u201cWhen it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached, no judgment shall be arrested or reversed.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-678.

Even if I agreed with the majority that the trial court abused its discretion in connection with the closing argument, I nevertheless would affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The landowners\u2019 evidence on the issue of just compensation ranged from about $4.9 million to about $5.4 million. The condemnor\u2019s evidence on that issue valued the property in the sum of approximately $1.6 million. The award of $2.7 million is well within the range of the conflicting evidence, lower than the landowner claimed and higher than the condemnor estimated.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Given the otherwise errorless conduct of the trial, I would not put these parties to the time and expense of another trial for two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>fairly innocuous comments during closing argument when, I submit, it appears the litigants have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been attained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
