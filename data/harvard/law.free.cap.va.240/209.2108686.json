McDonnell filed a motion for judgment against Hampton Roads Sanitation District Commission (Hampton Roads) seeking compensation for damage to his land. McDonnell alleged that Hampton Roads wrongfully had discharged sewage and other pollutants onto his land. In addition to filing a plea of governmental immunity and a grounds of defense to the motion for judgment, Hampton Roads filed a third-party motion for judgment against the City of Virginia Beach (the City).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">In its third-party motion for judgment, Hampton Roads alleged that the overflows and discharges of pollutants onto McDonnell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>property resulted from \u201cexcessive infiltration and inflow of water into the sewage collector lines owned by the City.\u201d Therefore, the cause of any damage to McDonnell was \u201cthe action of the City in delivering to the [Hampton Roads\u2019] pump station an excessive amount of non-sewage water from the City storm sewage system.\u201d Consequently, Hampton Roads requested that in the event of a judgment in favor of McDonnell against it, a judgment be entered \u201cdirectly against [the] City for the same, as well as a judgment-over in favor of [Hampton Roads] against [the] City in the same amount, or in the alternative, [Hampton Roads] be awarded judgment against the City for its share in contribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">In its grounds of defense to the third-party motion for judgment, the City, <em>inter alia, </em>denied responsibility for McDonnell\u2019s damages and asserted that if McDonnell sustained damages, \u201cthey are the sole responsibility of [Hampton Roads].\u201d Thereafter, the City filed a motion to sever the third-party motion for judgment, asserting that \u201cthe case between [McDonnell] and [Hampton Roads] is extremely complicated with a multitude of issues and that the issues between [Hampton Roads] and [the City] are different, large in number and complicated resulting in a case that would be extremely confusing for a jury.\u201d By order entered October 12, 1983, the third-party action was' severed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">McDonnell\u2019s action against Hampton Roads was tried by a jury, which returned a verdict in favor of McDonnell for $100,000 compensatory damages. Judgment was entered thereon and Hampton Roads appealed. In the appeal, we affirmed the judgment. <em>Hampton Roads Sanitation District </em>v. <em>McDonnell, 234 </em>Va. 235, 360 S.E.2d 841 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The pertinent facts, as stated in <em>McDonnell, </em>were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">Hampton Roads, a political subdivision of the Commonwealth . . . , owns and operates a sewerage system in conjunction with the sewerage systems of various cities and counties in the Tidewater area. Hampton Roads receives wastewater from various cities and counties, transmits the wastewater to its treatment plants, treats the wastewater, and discharges the treated effluent into various bodies of water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">A pump station owned and operated by Hampton Roads is located near McDonnell\u2019s land. The pump station receives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>sewage from the City\u2019s system and pumps it into Hampton Roads\u2019 system. Under normal conditions, the flow from the City\u2019s system passes into and through the pump station. When the flow reaches approximately three times the normal quantity, however, the pump station cannot accommodate the wastewater. In such a situation, a bypass valve opens, diverting the overflow from the pump station and discharging the wastewater upon McDonnell\u2019s property. Hampton Roads\u2019 general manager testified that \u201c[t]he pump station was constructed [in 1969] specifically to allow [wastewater] to bypass\u201d onto the land now owned by McDonnell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 237, 360 S.E.2d at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In <em>McDonnell, </em>Hampton Roads contended that as a matter of law. it was not guilty of trespassing upon McDonnell\u2019s land. Further, Hampton Roads contended that if a trespass did occur, the City, not Hampton Roads, was the guilty party because the discharge resulted from excessive water in the City\u2019s collector lines. <em>Id. </em>at 239, 360 S.E.2d at 844. In rejecting this contention, the trial court held that, as a matter of law, Hampton Roads was guilty of trespass, and we agreed. <em>Id. </em>at 240, 360 S.E.2d at 844. In so holding, however, we noted that \u201cHampton Roads [had] filed a third-party action against the City that was severed by the trial court [and that] [w]e express [ed] no opinion regarding the liability of the City vis-a-vis Hampton Roads.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240 n.3, 360 S.E.2d at 844 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The present case involves the third-party action. At the close of Hampton Roads\u2019 evidence, the City moved to strike the evidence. The trial court granted the City\u2019s motion and entered judgment for the City. In its oral opinion from the bench, the trial court ruled that, because Hampton Roads was guilty of trespass, \u00a7 46 of the enabling act, Acts 1960, c. 66, precluded it from recovering damages from the City. Section 46 reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">No pecuniary liability of any kind shall be imposed upon any county, city, town or other political subdivision constituting any part of the District because of any act, agreement, contract, tort, malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance, by or on the part of the Commission, or any member of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Commission, or any of its officers, agents and employees</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">Section 46 immunizes the City from liability for a wrongful act committed by Hampton Roads. The section, however, does not immunize the City from liability for its own alleged wrongful act; <em>i.e., </em>the delivery of an excessive amount of non-sewage water to Hampton Roads\u2019 pump station, which is the focus of the third-party action.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The trial court also opined that, because Hampton Roads had litigated and lost the trespass issue, the City thereby was exonerated. Without so labeling its ruling, the trial court apparently relied upon the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Under the collateral estoppel concept, the parties to a prior action and their privies are precluded from litigating in a subsequent action any factual issue that actually was litigated and was essential to a valid and final personal judgment in the prior action. <em>N. &amp; W. </em>v. <em>Bailey, 221 </em>Va. 638, 640, 272 S.E.2d 217, 218 (1980); <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Devers, </em>214 Va. 667, 671, 202 S.E.2d 917, 921 (1974). In Virginia, it is well established that collateral estoppel requires mutuality, <em>i.e., </em>\u201ca litigant is generally prevented from invoking the preclusive force of a judgment unless he would have been bound had the prior litigation of the issue reached the opposite result.\u201d <em>Bailey, 221 </em>Va. at 640, 272 S.E.2d at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In <em>McDonnell, </em>the issue actually litigated and essential to the final judgment was whether Hampton Roads was guilty of trespass. The City was not a party to that action and is not in privity with Hampton Roads. Thus, mutuality is lacking. Furthermore, the issue to be litigated in the present action is different. In this case, the issue is whether the City wrongfully delivered to Hampton Roads\u2019 pump station an excessive amount of non-sewage water from the City\u2019s storm water system. For these reasons, Hampton Roads is not estopped by virtue of the judgment in <em>McDonnell </em>from prosecuting the third-party action against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
