Subsection B(3) thereof provides, however, that the general prohibition in Subsection A shall not apply to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">[a] contract awarded to a member of a governing body as a result of competitive sealed bidding where the governing body has established a need for the same or substantially similar goods through purchases prior to the election or appointment of the member to serve on the governing body. However, the member shall have no involvement in the preparation of the specifications for such contract, and <em>the remaining members of the governing body, by written resolution, </em>shall state that it is in the public interest for the member to bid on such contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The sole question in this appeal is whether application of the exception set forth in Subsection B(3) requires a unanimous vote by the disinterested members of the governing body.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Curtis W. Harris, a member of the City Council of the City of Hopewell, brought a declaratory judgment proceeding against the City and against the other members of council (collectively, the City).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Harris sought, <em>inter alia, </em>to have the trial court declare that Subsection B(3) \u201crequires that all of the remaining members [of council] agree in a written resolution . . . that it is in the public interest for a member to bid on a contract with the City.\u201d The trial court, in sustaining the City\u2019s demurrer and dismissing the proceeding, ruled that Subsection B(3) \u201cdoes not require the written resolutions ... to be adopted by unanimous vote of all eligible council members.\u201d Harris appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">The facts are those as alleged in the bill of complaint. Before his election to council, Robert R. Saunders, Jr., principal owner of E.H. Saunders &amp; Sons, \u201ccustomarily entered into contracts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the . . . city to provide electrical goods and services.\u201d On October 11, 1988, council members Ingram, Karnes, Tomlin, Fuzy, and Leadbetter voted to adopt two resolutions stating that \u201cit is in the public interest for the firm of E.H. Saunders &amp; Sons, of which [Saunders] is a principal owner, to bid by competitive bidding on a contract to provide electrical work [to the City].\u201d Harris voted against the adoption of the resolutions, and Saunders abstained. Subsequently, E.H. Saunders &amp; Sons was awarded the contracts as the low bidder after competitive sealed bidding.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Harris contends that the phrase, \u201cthe remaining members of the governing body,\u201d requires a unanimous vote of all members of council who are not involved in the proposed contractual relationship. The City contends that the phrase merely identifies the members of council eligible to vote on the resolution, and that the resolution may be passed by a majority vote..</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The statute requires the action to be taken by \u201cwritten resolution.\u201d Generally, only a majority of a governing body is necessary to adopt a resolution. <em>See Town of Victoria </em>v. <em>Victoria Ice, Etc., Co., </em>134 Va. 124, 129, 114 S.E. 89, 90 (1922). Exceptions to the general rule are strictly construed, and unless they clearly apply, the general rule prevails. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Subsection B(3) does not state that the resolution must be approved by a unanimous vote of the remaining members of the governing body. It simply provides that only those members who do not have a personal interest in the contract may vote on the resolution. Construing Subsection B(3) strictly, we conclude that the General Assembly did not abrogate the general rule of \u201cmajority vote\u201d and impose an exception requiring a unanimous vote of the remaining members of council.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b71-10\"> The defendants/appellees are Riley Ingram, Paul Karnes, Oscar Tomlin, Victor Fuzy, Barbara Leadbetter, and Robert Saunders, Jr., who were members of council when the challenged action was taken, and Robert Legat, who subsequently became a member of council in the place of Leadbetter, who resigned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
