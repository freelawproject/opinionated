Both sustained serious personal injuries. Mr. Preston was on duty as a track policeman for the town of Epping and was helping to operate the pit lights from time to time during the race. Mr. Bird was watching the race but worked part-time at another race track. During the race in which he was injured, he was in the Speedway pit area with a line-up sheet that was kept to show the positions of the racers. These he showed to the racers from time to time upon request. After Bird and Preston brought suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>against Speedway, the racing association and others (and after their wives brought consortium actions), American Home Assurance Company brought a declaratory judgment action to determine its obligation to Star Speedway and to New England Super Modified Racing Association Inc., its named insureds under two separate insurance policies. The policies contained certain exclusions that would apply if Bird and Preston were found to be race participants. On August 8,1978, the Superior Court <em>{Goode, </em>J.) found that there was no basis on which to conclude that the plaintiffs were participants. The court further found that none of the insurance company\u2019s arguments were \u201cpersuasive\u201d and that its interpretations of its policies were strained and \u201cunreasonable and absurd.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">Following a September 1978 hearing on the question of attorney fees, the court awarded fees to the insureds as well as to the tort plaintiffs, Bird and Preston. The exceptions of American Home Assurance Company were transferred to this court by <em>Goode, </em>J., and give rise to the sole question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\"> Whether or not American\u2019s arguments were strained, the court did not specifically find bad faith or \u201cobstinate, unjust, vexatious, wanton or oppressive conduct.\u201d <em>Pugliese v. Town of Northwood Planning Board, </em>119 N.H. 743, 408 A.2d 113 (1979). In the absence of such specific findings supportable by the evidence, courts are precluded by the reasoning and holding of <em>Harkeem v. Adams, </em>117 N.H. 687, 377 A.2d 617 (1977), from awarding attorney fees. In any event, our review of the case leads us to the conclusion that American\u2019s position was not as \u201cunreasonable and absurd\u201d as described below. Although fees were awarded to the insureds in accordance with RSA 491:22-b (Supp. 1977), that statute does not provide for an award of fees to tort plaintiffs under the particular circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Accordingly, the order awarding fees to the tort plaintiffs must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b985-8\">King, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
