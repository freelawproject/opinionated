Would passage of Senate Bill 21 make administrative determinations and hearings of the department of employment security relative to claims for benefits \u2018public proceedings\u2019 under RSA 91-A:l-a and 2 (Supp. 1977)?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">\u201c2.

Would passage of Senate Bill 21 make available to the public the personnel, financial, commercial, personal or confidential information of individuals, claimants, and employing units?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">\u201cThat the Clerk of the Senate submit the necessary copies of this resolution to the Clerk of the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">\n<em>To the Honorable Senate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">The undersigned justices of the supreme court return the following reply to your request filed in this court on April 24, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">Your request is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">Whether the enactment of Senate bill 21, which proposes to repeal the provision of the right to know statute, RSA 91-A:6, that the right to know statute does not apply to employment security, RSA ch. 282, would make</p>\n<p id=\"b297-17\">1. administrative determinations and hearings of the department of employment security relative to claims for benefits \u201cpublic proceedings\u201d under RSA 91-A:l-a, :2 (Supp. 1977); and</p>\n<p id=\"b297-18\">2. records and information, which RSA 282:9(M) makes confidential, available to the public; and</p>\n<p id=\"b297-19\">3. personnel, financial, commercial, personal, or confidential information of individuals, claimants, and employing units available to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The repeal of the exemption in question, without more, might create ambiguities as to whether administrative determinations and hearings would become public and whether the confidentiality provisions of RSA 282:9(M) would be impliedly repealed even though RSA 91-A:5 IV already exempts certain personnel, financial, commercial, personal, or confidential information from being made public. The existence of these ambiguities is presently known to the Honorable Senate and appears to be the underlying reason for the request. Moreover, the request seeks, to a large extent, an interpretation of existing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Any contingent ambiguities between RSA ch. 91-A and RSA 282:9(M) may easily be removed by express provisions added to the pending legislation which will make clear the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We respectfully ask, therefore, to be excused from answering your present inquiries as not being within the spirit or the letter of N.H. Const, pt. II, art. 74. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>116 N.H. 358, 360 A.2d 889 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">We are returning the reply without waiting for the filing of memoranda in order to save unnecessary work on the part of those who have planned to file such memoranda.</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-8\">Edward J.
