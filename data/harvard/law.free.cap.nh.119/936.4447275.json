He raised the defense of entrapment and objects now to certain rulings as well as to the trial court\u2019s jury instructions regarding entrapment and reasonable doubt. The case was transferred here by <em>Mullavey, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-19\">The defendant asks this court to review rulings excluding testimony of a police informant\u2019s wife. Apparently the husband asserted the marital privilege. RSA 516:27. The record reflects that then defense counsel took no exception to this exclusionary ruling. We recently reminded the bar in <em>Martineau v. Perrin, </em>119 N.H. 529, 404 A.2d 1100 (1979), that our procedural requirement of a contemporaneous objection and exception is \u201cgrounded on judicial economy and common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532, 404 A.2d at 1102. The rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>applies in all criminal or civil cases. <em>See Sperl v. Sperl, </em>119 N.H. 818, 408 A.2d 422 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-3\"> This rule applies with equal force to the trial court\u2019s jury-instructions. In this appeal, new defense counsel attempts to raise issues regarding the court\u2019s entrapment and reasonable doubt instructions. After the judge instructed the jury, he inquired if counsel cared to approach the bench. The then defense trial counsel said \u201cNothing.\u201d in response to the court\u2019s invitation. We thus have neither an objection nor an exception. We will not bend our requirement so that new counsel can comb the record on a \u201ctreasure hunt\u201d for issues never properly brought before the trial judge. <em>See Martineau v. Perrin, </em>119 N.H. 529, 404 A.2d 1100 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b967-5\">King, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
