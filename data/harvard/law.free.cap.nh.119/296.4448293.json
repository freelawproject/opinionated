The Trial Court <em>{Cann, </em>J.) found for the defendant mortgagee, and reserved and transferred the plaintiffs exceptions. We overrule the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">Prior to September 1973, the property in question was owned by the Albee Trust. A first mortgage, which is not at issue here, was held by the Rochester Savings Bank. In September 1973, Everett Albee, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>trustee of the Albee Trust, borrowed money from the Bank of New Hampshire, signing a 180-day promissory note for $2,932. As security for the loan, Albee, acting in his capacity as trustee, gave the bank a second mortgage on the Wolfeboro property, which was duly recorded in the Carroll County Registry of Deeds. The debt was not discharged by Albee or by the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In July 1975, the trust\u2019s interest in the property was sold on execution to satisfy an unrelated judgment. The plaintiff purchased the interest, which consisted of the right of redeeming both mortgages. RSA 511:7; 479:18. The plaintiff concedes that prior to purchase he had actual knowledge of both mortgages, although he had \u201cquestions in my mind\u201d about the validity of the second mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In October 1975, the bank assigned its interest as second mortgagee to the defendant, who began foreclosure proceedings. The plaintiff then brought this action to prevent foreclosure. His claim is that the second mortgage is void for lack of consideration because it was given in exchange for a personal loan to Albee, in violation of his fiduciary duty. <em>See, e.g. In re Frolich Estate, </em>112 N.H. 320, 327, 295 A.2d 448, 453 (1972). The plaintiff did not offer any evidence showing what Albee did with the money he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling, the plaintiff, as purchaser of the equity of redemption, has standing to assert a failure of consideration in the same manner as the original mortgagor. <em>True v. Congdon, </em>44 N.H. 48, 58 (1862); <em>Brewer v. Hyndman, </em>18 N.H. 9 (1845). The record before us, however, supports the trial court\u2019s finding of adequate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u201cConsideration may be given to the promisor or to some other person.\u201d RESTATEMENT OF Contracts \u00a7 75(2) (1932). The bank suffered a legal detriment when it loaned money to Everett Albee in exchange for his promissory note and the mortgage. <em>See Corning Glass Works v. Max Dichter Co., </em>102 N.H. 505, 512, 161 A.2d 569, 575 (I960). There was no evidence that the trustee lacked the power to mortgage the trust property. <em>See </em>RSA 564-A:3 III(g). A mortgage that the trustee has authority to make is valid whether or not the trustee misapplies the sum borrowed. G. BOGERT, TRUSTS &amp; TRUSTEES \u00a7 767, at 46 (2d ed. 1962); 3 A. SCOTT, TRUSTS \u00a7 271 (1967). Neither the bank nor its assignee was \u201cbound to assure the proper application of trust assets paid or delivered to the trustee.\u201d RSA 564-A:7; G. Bogert, TRUSTS &amp; TRUSTEES \u00a7 902 (2d ed. 1962). A trust beneficiary can of course seek to recover from the trustee for misuse of trust assets. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF Trusts \u00a7\u00a7 199(c) 200 (1959). Any dispute between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>trustee and the beneficiaries does not, however, affect an innocent mortgagee\u2019s interest in the trust assets. G. BOGERT, TRUST &amp; TRUSTEES \u00a7\u00a7 596, 871, 904 (2d ed. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled; petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-6\">Grimes, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
