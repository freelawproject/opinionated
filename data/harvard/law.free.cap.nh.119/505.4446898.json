The buildings were erected in 1965 when they were a permitted use. The area is presently zoned as a \u201cresidential district.\u201d The intervenor applied for a variance to erect an additional building of twelve apartments. A hearing was held on October 5, 1976, and the board granted the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">The plaintiffs appealed to the superior court, alleging not only that the intervenor failed to present evidence of any of the factors necessary to warrant the grant of a variance, but also that the board made no finding of any of the five statutory requirements needed to justify the issuance of a variance. RSA 31:72 III; <em>see Art. XII-R, Salem Zoning Ordinance. See also Ouimette v. City of Somersworth, </em>119 N.H. 292, 402 A.2d 159 (1979); <em>Carbonneau v. Town of Exeter, </em>119 N.H. 259, 401 A.2d 675 (1979). The record reveals that the hearing was particularly concerned with the question of unnecessary hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">The court found \u201cthat there was no evidence on the issue of unnecessary hardship by the applicant,\u201d and that \u201c[testimony from Mr. Durrett indicated that the income from the existing apartments was sufficient to meet the expenses.\u201d The court further found \u201cthat the reason for requesting a variance... was to obtain a greater return on his investment.\u201d The court concluded that \u201c[t]hese reasons are insufficient as a matter of law to meet the burden of establishing that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>denial of the permit would result in unnecessary hardship.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 31:72 III; <em>Carbonneau v. Town of Exeter, </em>119 N.H. 259, 401 A.2d 675 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"> RSA 31:78 provides that the findings of the board must be deemed prima facie reasonable. Nevertheless, \u201cRSA 31:78 provides that decisions reached by zoning boards \u2018shall not be set aside or vacated, except for errors of law, <em>unless the court is persuaded by the balance of probabilities, on the evidence before it that said order or decision is unjust or </em>unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cook v. Town of Sanbornton, </em>118 N.H. 668, 669, 392 A.2d 1201, 1202 (1978) (emphasis in original). We have held that \u201c[a] variance by definition is granted with respect to a piece of property and not with respect to the \u2018personal needs, preferences, and circumstances,\u2019 of a property owner.\u201d <em>Carbonneau v. Town of Exeter, </em>119 N.H. at 262, 401 A.2d at 677. We emphasize again that \u2018\u201c[i]t is not uniqueness of the plight of the owner, but uniqueness of the land causing the plight that is the criterion\u2019 for unnecessary hardship.\u201d/d (citation omitted). \u201cThe inability to use land for one particular purpose is irrelevant to whether a variance should be granted.\u201d <em>Ouimette v. City of Somersworth, </em>119 N.H. at 294, 402 A.2d at 161. It is established that \u201c[a] hardship results only if use of the particular property is unduly restricted by the zoning ordinance because of special conditions unique to that property which distinguishes it from all others similarly restricted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The trial court properly found that there was no evidence before it to demonstrate those \u201cspecial conditions\u201d which would distinguish the intervenor\u2019s property from other property in the area and warrant a variance based upon \u201cunnecessary hardship.\u201d It properly held as a matter of law that a variance had been improperly granted by the town\u2019s board of adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
