Supp. 1978), and the State\u2019s burden of proof in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">Custody of Brenda H. was-awarded temporarily to the division of welfare under RSA ch. 169 on July 6,1977.. In December 1977, Brenda\u2019s parents were granted occasional visitation rights. Between July 1977 and April 1978, the parents received counselling services from Central New Hampshire Community Mental Health Services, Inc. On June 5,1978, the parents filed a motion to regain custody of Brenda. At the July 1978 custody hearing the parents excepted to the admission of testimony of Dr. A, a physician working at the mental-health clinic, and Ms. B, a mental-health therapist also employed at the clinic. The Hooksett District Court <em>(Kfoury, </em>J.) issued its opinion on July 24,1978, continuing custody of Brenda with the division of welfare. The parents contend that their communications with Dr. A and Ms. B were privileged and that the court applied an incorrect standard of proof in determining that Brenda should not be returned to her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">I. <em>The Physician-Patient a,nd Psychologist-Patient Privileges</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJc\">The district court admitted the testimony of the physician and thera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>pist under RSA 169:43, which provides that \u201c[n]o common law or statutory privilege except the attorney-client privilege shall be grounds for excluding evidence regarding the abuse or neglect of a child in any civil proceeding resulting from a report pursuant to this subdivision.\u201d The parents contend that, despite this statute, their communications with Dr. A and Ms. B are privileged under RSA 329:26 (Supp. 1977) and RSA 330-A:19.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"> RSA 329:26 (Supp. 1977) provides that the confidential communications between a physician and patient are privileged \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by law.\u201d RSA 330-A:19 provides thatcommunications between a certified psychologist and his client are also privileged. These statutory privileges should be strictly construed. <em>Marceau v. Orange Realty, Inc., </em>97 N.H. 497, 92 A.2d 656 (1952). We note that the testimony of Ms. B, the therapist at the mental health center, is not privileged under RSA 329:26 (Supp. 1977) or RSA 330-A:19, because she is neither a licensed physician nor a certified psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The parents first argue that RSA 169:43 applies only to proceedings immediately following a report of abuse or neglect, and not to subsequent judicial proceedings in which the parents seek to regain custody. This limited construction of the statute is incompatible with its express language and the stated legislative purpose of protecting the child\u2019s welfare. The statute is applicable \u201cin <em>any </em>civil proceeding resulting from a report\u201d of child abuse or neglect. RSA 169:43 (emphasis added). If parents assert the privilege and physicians\u2019 or psychologists\u2019 testimony is excluded from later proceedings, the district court will be unable to determine whether the child should be returned to the parents, and the State will be unable to bear its burden of proof. We decline to adopt the narrow construction of the statute suggested by the parents. <em>See </em>Chamberlain &amp; Eaton, <em>Protecting the Abused and Neglected Child, </em>19 N.H.B.J. 25, 44 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The parents also contend that the district court\u2019s admission of evidence under RSA 169:43 contravenes the legislative purpose of RSA ch. 169, which includes \u201cpreserving the unity of the family and separating the child from his parents only when it is clearly necessary for his welfare or the interests of public safety.\u201d RSA 169:1 III (Supp. 1977). The purpose of the reporting sections of the statute, RSA 169:37-:45, is \u201cto provide for the protection and welfare of abused and neglected children ... to prevent further abuse or neglect . . . and to strengthen the family life whenever possible.\u201d RSA 169:37. Admission of relevant medical and psychiatric evidence permits the district court to make a decision that both protects the child and where possible strengthens the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>This court has previously considered the conflict between the provisions of these statutory privileges and the requirement of a commitment renewal hearing for the criminally insane under RSA 651:ll-a on the issue of dangerousness. <em>State v. Kupchun, </em>117 N.H. 412, 373 A.2d 1325 (1977). Although RSA 651:ll-a is silent on the question of admissibility of psychiatric evidence, we held that \u201cthe privileges in question are not absolute and must yield when disclosure of the information concerned is considered <em>essential;\u201dId. </em>at 415,373 A.2d at 1327. We stated that the court must be \u201cpresented with the best information available which has a bearing on defendant\u2019s dangerous or mental condition\u201d to determine the issue of dangerousness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In this case, the legislature has considered the admissibility of usually privileged evidence, and has expressly stated that the statutory privileges do not apply. Further, the rationale behind the admission of such evidence in <em>Kupchun </em>is equally applicable here. The district courts have the continuing duty to supervise a neglect case once a child has been found to be neglected. The court must \u201creview the disposition of each child under RSA 169:7 ... at least once within one year after such disposition and at least annually thereafter.\u201d RSA 169:31-a. An integral part of this duty is to determine whether or when the child should be returned to his parents. The best information available to the court concerning past and future parental behavior is often the testimony of treating physicians, psychologists, and social and mental-health workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Although the statutory privileges are abrogated by RSA 169:43, the significant policies underlying these privileges, which .also apply to unprivileged communications between patients and therapists and professional support staff, are particularly applicable in child-abuse and neglect cases. The preservation of confidentiality of communications between therapist and patient may be a crucial factor in the successful treatment of psychiatric problems. \u201cMany physical ailments might be treated with some degree of effectiveness by a doctor whom the patient did not trust, but a psychiatrist must have his patient\u2019s confidence or he cannot help him.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>222 F.2d 398, 401 (D.C. Cir. 1955); <em>see </em>Louisell, <em>The Psychologist in Today\u2019s Legal World: Part II, </em>41 MINN. L. REV. 731, 745 (1957). The treatment of parents who abuse or neglect their children may require prolonged interaction with psychiatrists, psychologists, mental-health workers, and social workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Because successful therapeutic treatment of parents is crucial to the preservation of family unity, which is a goal of RSA ch. 169, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>district courts must carefully exercise their discretion in admitting these communications, and must cautiously balance the probative value of the evidence against the possible damage to the therapeutic relationship in each case. In the present case, the court in its own words <em>\u201csua sponte, </em>issued a cautionary instruction to [Dr. A. and Ms. B] on the specifics of their counselling and treatment of these patients with communications [sic] and requested that they provide the court more with recommendations and options than a specification of their conferences with their patients.\u201d The district court\u2019s commendable conduct in issuing this cautionary instruction is an example of the careful exercise of discretion we have described. Allowing the district court this discretion furthers the purpose of protecting the welfare of the child and recognizes that \u201c[t]he real purpose of any privilege is not to exclude relevant evidence, but simply to facilitate activities which require confidence.\u201d McNamara, <em>The Hierarchy of Evidentiary Privilege in New Hampshire, </em>20 N.H.B.J. 1, 27 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We note that the parents\u2019 interest in the privacy of these communications is not greatly jeopardized by limited disclosure of medical or psychiatric evidence at neglect proceedings. RSA 169:20 provides that \u201c[n]o one shall attend such hearing, unless his presence is necessary either as parent, party or witness, or, in the opinion of the court, in the interest of justice.\u201d The records of such proceedings \u201cshall be withheld from indiscriminate public inspection.\u201d RSA 169:22.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">II. <em>The State\u2019s Standard of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The district court granted the parents\u2019 requested ruling of law that Brenda \u201cshould continue to be kept from the physical custody of her natural parents only if the Division of Welfare meets its burden of showing that its retention of custody and control will plainly better the child.\u201d His ruling incorporated the language of RSA 169:1 III (Supp. 1977), which establishes the purposes and policies of RSA ch. 169, including \u201cpreserving the unity of the family and separating the child from his parents only when it is clearly necessary for his welfare.\u201d The district court judge declined to rule that it would be dangerous for Brenda to return to her parents. Instead, he ruled that it would be untimely, inappropriate, or premature to return her to them. He also ruled that it would be in the child\u2019s best interest to remain in foster care. The parents contend that the court improperly permitted the division of welfare to retain custody because of the court\u2019s use of the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">In considering permanent termination of parental rights under RSA ch. 170-C, this court stated that \u201cto hold merely that inadequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>parenting, absent specific harm to the [child], is sufficient to terminate parental rights in the \u2018best interest of the child\u2019 is too vague a concept and places undue emphasis on the parental conduct rather than any harm to the child.\u201d <em>State v. Robert H., </em>118 N.H. 713, 718, 393 A.2d 1387, 1390 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">This court\u2019s emphasis on harm to the child is similar to language in RSA 169:2 V(b), which specifically defines a neglected child as one \u201c[w]ho is without proper parental care . . . necessary for his physical, mental, or emotional health, when it is established that his health has suffered or is likely to suffer serious impairment.\u201d This definition \u201callow[s] a court the flexibility it needs in order to consider each child and each parent/child relationship on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Chamberlain &amp; Eaton, <em>supra </em>at 29. The district court should make an express finding of harm or impairment to the child in an abuse or neglect case. Although the district court judge did not make an express finding, it can be implied from his ruling that returning Brenda to her parents would be harmful or cause impairment to her health. His ruling was based in part on the testimony of the treating physician and therapist and on his conclusion, drawn from the testimony, that the parents did not understand or properly attach importance to mental health counselling or parent effectiveness training. He also considered the fact that Brenda\u2019s parents had admitted to neglect of their child when he first awarded custody to the division. The court\u2019s finding that leaving custody with the division was in the child\u2019s best interest, although not the applicable test, does not negate its other factual findings. These findings are sufficient to support the court\u2019s ruling that custody of the child should remain with the division of welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The parents further argue that in abuse and neglect proceedings the State must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt before temporary custody can be continued with the division. In <em>State v. Robert H., </em>118 N.H. 713, 393 A.2d 1387 (1978), we held, in cases involving permanent and final <em>termination </em>of parental rights under RSA ch. 170-C that the New Hampshire Constitution requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of specific harm to the child. RSA ch. 169 does not specify the standard of proof to be employed by the court in making orders in neglect or abuse cases. Fourteen States use a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard; seven States require proof by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence; and two States require proof \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 6 National Task Force to Develop Standards and Goals for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Abuse and Neglect 138 (1977) (hereinafter Abuse and Neglect).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>The preponderance standard \u201cbend[s] somewhat in favor of intervention in order to protect the child from injury in doubtful cases,\u201d and thus may not adequately protect family integrity. <em>Id. </em>at 140. On the other hand, \u201cthe proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard established in <em>Robert H. </em>is inappropriate in abuse and neglect cases because in the latter instances the parents are only temporarily deprived of custody. Termination of parental rights under RSA ch. 170-C is <em>final. </em>The \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidentiary standard is recommended by the Juvenile Justice Standards Project. IJA-ABA STANDARDS Relating to Abuse and Neglect 140-41 (Tentative Draft 1977). This \u201cmiddle-of-the-road\u201d approach is most satisfactory \u201cin light of the substantial parental rights being challenged and the possible harms to the child from intervening.\u201d ABUSE AND NEGLECT, <em>supra </em>at 141. <em>See Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418 (1979) (discussion of \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"> Given the danger of unwarranted or harmful intrusion into family life, <em>State v. Robert H., </em>118 N.H. 713, 393 A.2d 1387 (1978), we hold that the State must initially prove child abuse or neglect by clear and convincing evidence and the same standard applies to continue the child\u2019s custody in the division of welfare. We do not have a transcript of the district court hearing before us; nevertheless, the district court\u2019s opinion indicates that there was such evidence supporting the court\u2019s ruling that custody of the child should remain with the division of welfare. <em>See McCrady v. Mahon, </em>119 N.H. 247, 400 A.2d 1173 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b419-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
