RSA ch. 281. The issues are whether the labor commissioner improperly denied plaintiff an award for permanent bodily losses under RSA 281:26; and whether the plaintiff is eligible for an award of fees and interest under RSA 281:37-a. By agreement of the parties, these issues, in the form of five questions, were reserved and transferred to this court without rulings by <em>King, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">On January 7,1976, Freeman Corson struck his head while working for Brown Products. This blow caused a subdural hematoma rendering him unconscious. From that date to December 18, 1978, when he died, Corson had been in an irreversible comatose state. He had lost the use of every member of his body. Defendant had conceded that Corson\u2019s condition would not change, except for the worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">On February 2,1977, the Superior Court <em>(King, </em>J.) ruled that Cor-son\u2019s injury was work-related, and held that he was entitled to receive weekly total disability benefits under RSA 281:23 and reasonable medical and hospital benefits under RSA 281:21. The parties have agreed on these matters and they are not in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">In November 1976, Corson commenced a separate claim seeking additional benefits under RSA 281:26 (Scheduled Impairment Award). The commissioner of labor denied the claim and his decision was appealed to the superior court. Corson also filed in that court a motion seeking counsel fees and interest under RSA 281:37-a. After a hearing, <em>King, </em>J., transferred without ruling questions A-E which will be discussed in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">\u201cA. Based on the evidence and the law, is Freeman Corson entitled to benefits under RSA 281:26 for permanent impairment of the various parts of his body, in addition to the benefits already awarded under RSA 281:23 and 281:21?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">The labor commissioner properly found that: \u201cIt has now been established by medical evidence that the claimant has remained in a coma since surgery on January 7,1976 and may best be described as a living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>vegetable which will not be reversible in the future.\u201d The commissioner properly held that the law prior to July 1, 1973, required the workman to choose between scheduled benefits under RSA 281:26 and disability benefits under RSA 281:23 and :25. He also correctly held that since that date permanent scheduled impairment awards are a right of the employee \u201cwhich is separate and independent of the rights provided by RSA 281:23 and 25.\u201d RSA 281:26 II.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The commissioner then referred to a hypothetical case discussed by \u201can unofficial Advisory Committee\u201d comprised of management and labor and other parties who were interested in an agreed bill which apparently became RSA 281:26 (Laws 1973, 481:10). The commissioner stated that it was agreed by the committee members that a quadraplegic should have the \u201cmental and financial comfort of receiving payment for such loss.\u201d The committee agreed, however, \u201cthat an injured person suffering permanent brain damage rendering him comatose should not ... as his condition is such that it is not much different than a deceased person.\u201d On that basis the commissioner decided that, \u201cconsidering the severe nature of the injury rendering the claimant permanently unconscious,\u201d Corson was not entitled to benefits under RSA 281:26 and \u201conly total disability benefits under Section 23 shall continue in force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The commissioner explained his reasoning at a hearing before the superior court, and in response to questions by plaintiffs counsel he stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">Q. Now if the statutory language says that benefits shall be awarded simply by virtue of loss of use, there must have been some reason why you still did not award benefits. What is that reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">A. The reason is what the individual is aware he has lost.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">Q. Mr. Commissioner, can you point to any language within 281:26 which imposes <em>sl </em>requirement that the recipient of Section 26 benefits have awareness, consciousness, meditation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">A. There is no such provision in the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">Q. So you are not saying that you will not award benefits to any brain damage, only when it\u2019s permanent and total brain damage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">A. Right, and irreversible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Q. And only because they don\u2019t have awareness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">A. Well that\u2019s the basic reason for my judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\"> It is well established law that the intention of the legislature expressed by the words in the statute itself is the touchstone to its meaning. <em>Plymouth School Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Educ., </em>112 N.H. 74, 77, 289 A.2d 73, 75 (1974). In other words, the legislative intent is to be found not in what the legislature might have said, but rather in the meaning of what it did say. <em>Hartford Elec. Light Co. v. Water Resources Comm\u2019n., </em>162 Conn. 89, 98, 291 A.2d 721, 728 (1971). Hence this court cannot speculate upon any supposed legislative intent not appropriately expressed in the language of the act itself. <em>See Naum v. Naum, </em>101 N.H. 367, 369, 143 A.2d 424, 426 (1958); <em>Hamby v. Adams, </em>117 N.H. 606, 610, 376 A.2d 519, 522 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">We have also held that the legislative history of a statute can be taken into consideration in arriving at its meaning. <em>Nazarro v. Merrimack Sch. Dist., </em>118 N.H. 287, 290, 385 A.2d 230,232 (1978). Reports of commissions established to prepare or recommend statutory revisions can prove to be valuable aids in construing particular statutes. J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 48.09 (C. Sands 1973). However, the commissioner relied on the proceedings of an informal committee. No minutes of its discussions and no written report of its recommendations have been presented to us and none is apparently available. Nor is there helpful official legislative history on this legislation. The labor commissioner relied on his recollection of a discussion supposedly had in the informal committee. Personal recollections by a member of an informal committee are, for good reasons, held inadmissible as history to affect the interpretation of a statute. J. SUTHERLAND, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 48.09, 48.16; <em>see Rausch v. Nelson, </em>134 N.W.2d 519 (N.D. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\"> What is of paramount importance in this case is that words such as \u201cawareness\u201d or \u201cconsciousness\u201d cannot be added under the guise of legislative history to a statute which clearly states that, \u201cThe scheduled awards under this section accrue to the injured employee simply by virtue of the loss or loss of the use of a member of the body.\u201d RSA 281:26 II. When the language used in a statute is clear and unambiguous, its meaning is not subject to modification by construction. <em>International Bus. Machine Corp. v. Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 134, 355 A.2d 236, 241 (1974). Hence transferred question \u201cA\u201d must be answered from the plain words of the statute and not by speculation as to any supposed intention of the legislature. We hold therefore that \u201cFreeman Corson [is] entitled to benefits under RSA 281:26 for permanent impairment of the various parts of his body, in addition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>benefits already awarded under RSA 281:23 and 281:21 . . . .\u201d The answer to question \u201cA\u201d is \u201cYes\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u201cB. If the preceding question is answered affirmatively, to what awards listed in RSA 281:261 a-p inclusive, would Freeman Corson be entitled?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">It would serve no useful purpose, and most likely produce confusion, to reproduce verbatim RSA 281:26 I a-p, which sets out in detail the number of weeks to be allowed for specified bodily losses. It is sufficient to say that plaintiff argues that he should be allowed the scheduled award of the total loss of use of two arms, and in addition thereto the loss of use of two separate hands and the total loss of use of both hands; that he should be allowed benefits for the total loss of use of both legs, and in addition for the total loss of use of two feet and the total loss of use of both feet; that he should receive a scheduled award for the loss of use of binaural hearing, and in addition for the loss of hearing in two ears; that he should be entitled to the loss of bilateral vision, and also for the loss of vision in both eyes. By the plaintiffs computation, he would be entitled to awards totaling more than 3000 weeks at the rate provided by RSA 281:23. As Corson is entitled to a weekly compensation rate of $142.71, a total award of over $400,000 would result.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">However, RSA 281:26 I(w) specifically provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">Subsequent amputation: Upon amputation of a member resulting from an original or subsequent injury which has been preceded by the loss of a component part thereof, an additional award shall accrue on the basis of the difference between the award for the newly established loss and the award for the original loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">This indicates a legislative intent to prevent duplication or cumulation of awards. Thus if there is an award for the loss of an arm there cannot be an award also for the loss of the hand and arm from the same extremity. <em>Nabb v. Haveg Indus., Inc., </em>265 A.2d 320, 322 (Del. Super. 1969), <em>aff'd, </em>266 A.2d 879 (Del. Super. Ct. (1970)). In other words, if one loses initially the full loss of use of a member, he can recover only for the total loss of use of that member itself and not additional amounts for an accumulation of the parts of that member. <em>Magreta v. Ambassador Steel Co., </em>378 Mich. 689, 148 N.W.2d 767 (1967); 99 C.J.S. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 308, at 1114 (1958). The plaintiffs reliance on <em>Bernier v. Mills, </em>93 N.H. 165, 37 A.2d 5 (1944), for a contrary result is misplaced. That decision was rendered long before the present statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>enacted in 1973, with its amendments. Even so, the <em>Bernier </em>holding that the healing periods awarded for the loss of each of four fingers are concurrent and not cumulative supports the result reached in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We hold that, as in the case of subsequent amputations, the statute intends that if a person loses the full use of a member, he can recover only for the total loss of that member and not an additional award for the loss of parts which comprise the member. The same reasoning applies to the loss of vision and loss of hearing; a person cannot recover more than the total loss of binaural hearing and the total loss of bilateral vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Our answer to transferred question \u201cB\u201d is that plaintiff is entitled to awards for the loss of use of two arms, two legs, binaural hearing, and bilateral vision provided for in RSA 281:26 I.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">We have been advised that Freeman Corson has died since this case was argued. In the case of death, RSA 281:26 V and RSA 281:22 become material. The issues resulting thereunder have not been raised or argued in the proceedings now before us and we do not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u201cC. Under RSA 281:37-a, is an attorney\u2019s fee of one-third of the award reasonable under the facts of this case?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">RSA 281:37-a provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">In any dispute over the amount of benefits payable under this chapter which is appealed to the superior or supreme courts, the employee, if he prevails, shall be entitled to reasonable counsel fees as approved by the court, and interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum on that portion of any award the payment of which is contested; provided that the interest shall be computed from 30 days after award by the commissioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">The above statute was enacted by Laws 1969,187:1 effective August 1,1969. Such statutes have come into being because of the \u201cincompatability between the original idealized theory of compensation administration which was that the benefits would issue automatically according to the clear specifications of the statute, and the actualities of modern compensation administration, in which lawyers are employed by claimants in a majority of compensation cases in many jurisdictions.\u201d 2 A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation 83.10 (Desk ed. 1978). Hence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u201creasonable counsel fees as approved by the court\u201d were made available to an injured workman who sought legal redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">This court has recently held in <em>Couture v. Mammoth Groceries, Inc., </em>117 N.H. 294, 371 A.2d 1184 (1977), that a contingent fee of one-third is not per se in excess of a reasonable fee provided in this statute. It also set out relevant factors to be used in the determination of a reasonable fee. They include, \u201cthe amount involved, the nature, novelty, and difficulty of the litigation, the attorney\u2019s standing and the skill employed, the time devoted, the customary fees in the area, the extent to which the attorney prevailed, and the benefit ther\u00e9by bestowed on his clients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296, 371 A.2d at 1186.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Plaintiffs counsel maintains that, based on the expectation of a contingent fee, he has represented claimant from February 9,1976, to date without remuneration. Defendant argues, however, that the substantial part of the work performed by counsel for the claimant concerned that portion of the case, which has already been resolved by the parties, that is, the issue of causal connection. Defendant maintains that \u201cfor this portion of [plaintiff] counsel\u2019s work he has already been compensated and compensated well.\u201d Defendant further argues that the additional effort required to obtain an award for bodily losses under RSA 281:26 \u201cis relatively small.\u201d Unless the parties arrive at an agreement, an evidentiary hearing will be necessary. The superior court is better suited than this court to hold such a hearing and to determine the issue of reasonable fees, which is then subject to review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Our answer to transferred question \u201cC\u201d is that we cannot say as a matter of law based on the record before us whether a fee of one-third of the award under RSA 281:26 would be unreasonable. That issue is to be decided by the superior court by applying the factors set out in <em>Couture v. Mammoth Groceries, Inc., </em>117 N.H. 294, 371 A.2d 1184 (1977), to the whole situation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u201cD. Is claimant entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, in an amount set by the Court, on medical benefits awarded and to be awarded in the future under RSA 281:21?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">In certain instances attorney\u2019s fees should be allowed for an award of medical benefits. <em>See, e.g., Carter v. Tom Carter\u2019s Wheels, Inc., </em>257 So. 2d 529 (Fla. 1972); <em>Cavinsv. State Accident Ins. Fund, </em>272 Ore. 162, 536 P.2d 426 (1975). The defendant represents that the issue of medical payments was never contested, in that only the issue of work connection was in controversy. RSA 281:37-a provides for reasonable counsel fees in \u201cany dispute over the amount of benefits payable under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>this chapter.\u201d RSA ch. 281. The medical benefits were necessarily part and parcel of the suit for causation; once it was established that Cor-son\u2019s injury was work related he received both total disability payments and medical benefits. We understand that plaintiff was awarded counsel\u2019s fees for that proceeding. The record before us does not reveal whether these fees were for all the services that were rendered. Without further fact finding by the trial court, we cannot say whether a further award is appropriate. Our response to question \u201cD\u201d, is to remand to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u201cE. Under RSA 281:37-a is Freeman Corson entitled to receive interest on medical benefits awarded him pursuant to RSA 281:21 from the time of such award to the time of payment?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Interest is usually awarded to a claimant to compensate him for the delay on the part of the obligated party to meet its obligations. RSA 281:211 provides that \u201can employer ... or his insurance carrier, shall furnish to an injured employee or cause to be furnished, reasonable medical, surgical, and hospital services ....\u201d Since the time of injury and until the superior court decree in plaintiff\u2019s favor on the issue of work relatedness, his medical expenses were paid for by Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the employer\u2019s group carrier. Thereafter the expenses were paid for by the defendant. No principle of justice or equity would be served by giving an employee an interest payment on top of these timely services paid for by the employer on its insurance carrier. We hold that plaintiff is not entitled to an interest payment on the medical care benefits he has received pursuant to RSA 281:21, and our answer to question \u201cE\u201d is \u201cNo\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b57-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
