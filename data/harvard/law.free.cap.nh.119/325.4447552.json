The object of N.H. Const, pt. II, art. 87, which requires issuance in the name of the State, was \u201cto avoid all appearance of recognizing the royal authority.\u201d <em>Parsons v. Swett, </em>32 N.H. 87, 88 (1855).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">If beyond this there is any design to give authenticity and credit to legal process, by requiring an actual attestation of the chief, first, or senior justice of the court, the practical construction which has uniformly been put on this provision of the Constitution has wholly defeated that object; for the ordinary process of the court never in fact bears the actual signature of the chief justice, but his name is printed into the blank writs before they are delivered out of the clerk\u2019s office. The <em>teste </em>of the writ is therefore in practice a mere matter of form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-7\"><em>Id. </em>The court in <em>Parsons </em>concluded that a writ that issues \u201cwithout the proper <em>teste </em>is not in terms declared by the Constitution to be void, and we think is not to be held so by construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88-89. In that case a writ issued over the signature of a former chief justice of the superior court was upheld. The court in <em>Parsons </em>further stated that a writ is not void if it lacks the signature of the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">In <em>Smith v. Tallman, </em>87 N.H. 176, 175 A. 857 (1934), writs issued by clerkless police courts, the predecessors of our district courts, were upheld although they had no <em>teste </em>authenticated by a clerk\u2019s signature. The lesson of the <em>Parsons </em>and <em>Smith </em>cases is that the requirements of N.H. Const, pt. II, art. 87 are largely matters of form. This court has recently approved a central purchasing procedure for uniform printed complaints in the district and municipal courts. Senate bill 78 is another step in this modernization process and we find no constitutional infirmity in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The answer to the question is \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b357-4\">Edward J.
