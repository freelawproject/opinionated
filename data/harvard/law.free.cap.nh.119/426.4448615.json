Title to a condominium and all stocks, bonds and the like in the name of plaintiff were decreed to him. All stocks, bonds, and the like in the name of defendant were decreed to her. Plaintiff was ordered to pay defendant $600, which was money deposited by her to cover checks written by plaintiff. Support and alimony were specifically denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The decree was entered on the recommendation of the Master, <em>Henry P. Sullivan </em>Esq., after a hearing without a transcript, and defendant\u2019s exceptions were transferred by <em>Bean, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Without a record in this case, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in not awarding support or alimony. <em>McCrady v. Mahon, </em>119 N.H. 247, 400 A.2d 1173 (1979); <em>Hunneyman v. Hunneyman, </em>118 N.H. 652, 392 A.2d 147 (1978); <em>Greenglass v.
