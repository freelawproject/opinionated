In accordance with a stipulation incorporated in the decree, the plaintiff was ordered to pay the defendant $100 per week for the support of the four minor children, \u201csaid support shall be continued... until the age of twenty-one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">In 1978 Lillian filed a petition to increase the support payments alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Ronald had unilaterally reduced payments to $50 per week. After a hearing, the Master <em>(Nicholas G. Copadis, </em>Esq.) recommended that payments be continued at $100 per week but that $25 of that payment be made directly to one child, a college student residing away from home. A decree was entered in accordance with this recommendation by <em>Mullavey, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">The plaintiff then moved to set aside the decree on the basis that payments should be reduced because one of the children living with his mother was self-supporting and that a daughter had been living with him but was now in college. On the master\u2019s recommendation, the motion was denied by <em>Randall, </em>J., who transferred the plaintiffs exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">The court was correct in ruling that the original decree did not provide for any reduction in support due to employment of a child under the age of twenty-one years. There being no transcript of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>evidence before the master, we cannot say that there was any abuse of discretion in the failure to reduce payments by modification based on changed circumstances. <em>Cotter v. Cotter, </em>119 N.H. 426, 402 A.2d 198 (1979); <em>Greenglass v. Greenglass, </em>118 N.H. 570, 391 A.2d 890 (1978). Even accepting as true the allegations of the plaintiffs motion to set aside the decree, modification would not be compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
