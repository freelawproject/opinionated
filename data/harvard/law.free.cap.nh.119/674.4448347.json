We hold that the superior court has neither in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The defendant was convicted of first degree murder, RSA 630:l-a I, and began serving a life sentence at the State prison oh February 16, 1977. We affirmed the conviction and the constitutionality of his sentence. <em>State v. Farrow, </em>118 N.H. 296, 386 A.2d 808 (1978). On May 23, 1978, the defendant filed a motion requesting that the superior court order a probation investigation and suspend a portion of his sentence. He argued that the court has both the statutory authority, RSA 504:1 (Supp. 1977); RSA 651:20, and the inherent common law power, <em>e.g., State v. Dean, </em>115 N.H. 520, 522-23, 345 A.2d 408, 410 (1975), to suspend his sentence. The Court <em>{Johnson, </em>J.) reserved and transferred this issue to us without ruling. RSA 491:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">We first review the defendant\u2019s contention that the superior court has statutory authority to suspend his sentence. RSA 504:1 (Supp. 1977) provides in pertinent part that the court has the authority \u201cto suspend imposition or execution of sentence, or any part thereof.\u201d <em>See State v. Lemire, </em>116 N.H. 395, 359 A.2d 644 (1976). But this statute gives no explicit authority to suspend the defendant\u2019s sentence when the sentence has already been imposed and is being executed. The statutory authority of the court to suspend a sentence that has already been imposed or is being executed exists in RSA 651:20, which provides in pertinent part that \u201cthe sentence to imprisonment of any person may be suspended, at the time of sentence or at any time while any part thereof remains unserved <em>.\u2019\u2019But see </em>Laws 1979, 407:3. This provision, however, is specifically made inapplicable to all sentences imposed under RSA 630:l-a III by virtue of RSA 651:1. Therefore, we conclude that the superior court has no statutory authority to suspend the defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The defendant also argues that the superior court has the inherent common law power to suspend his sentence even in the absence of statutory authority. There is no case law in New Hampshire that supports this contention. Although we have long recognized \u201cthe common-law power of the courts to suspend either the imposition or execution of a sentence,\u201d State <em>v. Valrand, </em>103 N.H. 518, 520, 176A.2d 189, 191 (1961); <em>accord, State v. Dean, </em>115 N.H. 520, 345 A.2d 408 (1975); <em>State v. Burroughs, </em>113 N.H. 21, 300 A.2d 315 (1973); <em>State v. Thomson, </em>110 N.H. 190, 263 A.2d 675 (1970), this court has held that the common law power does not extend to instances such as the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>case where the term of the court that sentenced the defendant has expired and the defendant has begun serving his sentence. <em>State v. Dunn, </em>111 N.H. 320, 321, 282 A.2d 675, 676 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The defendant has been sentenced and committed, and has served two and one-half years in the State prison. In a comprehensive opinion deciding this case on direct appeal, we fully analyzed and denied the defendant\u2019s constitutional challenges to the validity of his sentence. <em>State v. Farrow, </em>118 N.H. 296, 386 A.2d 808 (1978). Because we have held that his sentence was validly imposed and we now hold that the judiciary has no authority to suspend it, the defendant\u2019s only recourse is to petition the Governor and Council for a pardon. N.H. CONST, pt. II, art. 52; <em>see State v. Farrow, </em>118 N.H. at 305, 386 A.2d at 813-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">\n<em>Case dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b706-7\">All concurred; GRIMES, J., concurring specially.</judges>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Although I adhere to my dissent in <em>State v. Dean, </em>115 N.H. 520, 345 A.2d 408 (1975), I concur because I am bound by the decision of the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
