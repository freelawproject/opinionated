He excepted to the Trial Court\u2019s (.Mullavey, J.) denial of his motions to quash and dismiss the burglary indictment, to give requested jury instructions on that indictment, and to set aside the verdict on the theft indictment. He also excepted to the court\u2019s admission of certain evidence. We overrule all of the defendant\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The defendant argues that the burglary indictment is legally insufficient because it does not allege ownership of the burglarized building. The building was identified in the indictment as \u201can occupied structure known as Portsmouth Auto Body Garage on Ocean Road.\u201d We have stated that \u201can indictment is sufficient if it uses the words of the proper section of the applicable statute. The test of its sufficiency remains always the same: whether it gives the defendant enough information so that he can prepare for trial.\u201d <em>State v. Panichas, </em>107 N.H. 359, 362, 222 A.2d 211, 213 (1966) (citations omitted). The indictment in this case states the elements of burglary using the words of RSA 635:1 and identifies the building. We therefore hold that the indictment is'sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The defendant submitted a request for instructions concerning the issue of his intent to commit a crime at the time he entered the building. This requested instruction commented at length on various purposes for which the defendant might have entered the building which would not constitute intent to commit a crime. During his instructions to the jury, the trial judge fully explained all of the elements of burglary. He twice stated that the State was required to prove that the defendant entered the building with \u201cthe purpose to commit a crime therein.\u201d It was within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion to determine \u201cfwjhether an instruction on a particular issue is necessary to assist the jury in making its verdict.\u201d <em>Fusegni v. Portsmouth Housing Auth., </em>114 N.H. 207, 209, 317 A.2d 580, 582 (1974). We hold that the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence to support the guilty verdict on the theft indictment requires us to view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the State with all reasonable inferences therefrom. <em>\u201cState v. Dupuy, </em>118 N.H. 848, 395 A.2d 851 (1978); <em>State v. Canney, </em>112 N.H. 301, 303, 294 A.2d 382, 383 (1972). The evidence shows that the defendant helped two other men break into the garage, handed a tool to one of the men in order to break into an adjoining room, held the door open as the men carried out the stolen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>items, and hid one of the items, a pistol. The defendant himself testified that he received part of the proceeds from the sale of the pistol. We hold that on the basis of this evidence the jury could find that the defendant obtained the pistol with the intent to deprive the owner of its possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The defendant argues that the admission of an out-of-court statement of one of the men who broke into the building is reversible error. Defense counsel did not object to this testimony. By failing to make a timely objection and reserve an exception, the defendant waived his right to raise this issue on appeal. <em>State v. Breest, </em>115 N.H. 504, 505-06, 345 A.2d 391, 392 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b108-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
