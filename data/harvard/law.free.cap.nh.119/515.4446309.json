It further alleges that defendant\u2019s address is unknown but that his last known address was in care of his parents in West Springfield, New Hampshire. Service was made on the defendant pursuant to RSA 458:9 and Superior Court Rule 231, RSA 491:App. R. 232 (Cum. Supp. 1978) by sending it to his last known address in this State. The court found that the defendant had actual knowledge of the divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">The court decreed a divorce and made an award of custody and property, but only conditionally ordered support payments depending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>upon the decision of this court regarding personal jurisdiction over the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\">RSA 458:5 III provides that jurisdiction over the parties exists \u201c[wjhere the plaintiff was domiciled in the state for one year next preceding the time when the action was commenced.\u201d Plaintiff meets this requirement, and service being properly made in accordance with RSA 458:9, personal jurisdiction attaches under RSA 458:5. Federal constitutional requirements, however, must also be met. <em>Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186 (1977); <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310 (1945). The defendant was married in New Hampshire, fathered a child here, and lived in this State with the plaintiff as husband and wife. The record before us shows that New Hampshire is still his domicile, although he may presently be elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">We have no hesitancy in holding that the defendant has more than the minimum contacts with this State to satisfy the requirements of <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310 (1945); <em>see Nickas v. Nickas, </em>113 N.H. 261, 306 A.2d 51 (1973); <em>cf. Kulko v. Superior Court, </em>436 U.S. 84, 92 (1978) (denying in personam jurisdiction in a domestic relations case where the \u201cquality and nature\u201d of the defendant\u2019s activities within the forum State were insufficient to make it \u201creasonable and fair\u201d to require him to subject himself to the forum State\u2019s jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
