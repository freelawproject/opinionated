The agreement with the county attorney recommended that a State prison sentence be served in the Rockingham County House of Correction. Fidler and the trial judge relied on that bargain and agreement by the county attorney. Fidler was sent to the prison for processing. His return to Rockingham County was opposed by the sheriff under RSA 623:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The trial court was entitled to assume that the county attorney knew the law and had cleared the matter with the sheriff. The court and Fidler were entitled to rely upon the agreement of the county attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u201cProhibition is an extraordinary remedy which, although within the discretion of this court, is used with caution and forebearance and only when the right to relief is clear.\u201d <em>State v. Superior Court, </em>116 N.H. 1, 2, 350 A.2d 626, 627 (1976).
