They were married on June 14,1975. Plaintiff continued to attend college in Providence, Rhode Island. She had certain college loans, some of which had been obtained before the marriage. Defendant began the study of law in Virginia in September 1975. A newly constructed house owned by defendant\u2019s parents was rented by the parties and they also maintained residences in Virginia and Rhode Island where they were attending school.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Plaintiff claims that in order to maintain these residences through April 1976, she continued to borrow by way of student loans. After graduation, plaintiff became employed as a computer analyst to earn money as the primary source of income for both parties. In December 1977, defendant purchased a 1977 Cadillac allegedly without plaintiff\u2019s knowledge or consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">In March 1978, defendant filed a petition for a legal separation and plaintiff filed a libel for divorce. After a hearing before a Master <em>(Peter J. Bourque, </em>Esq.) without a record, the court decreed a divorce for the cause of irremediable breakdown of the marriage. RSA 458:7-a (Supp. 1977). Each party was made responsible for certain specified joint obligations. Plaintiff\u2019s share totaled $3,255, and defendant\u2019s share, $2,700. Defendant was awarded the Cadillac and certain other assets. The plaintiff was awarded the diamond engagement ring and certain household items. The court further ordered that the defendant be responsible for one-third of the plaintiffs student loans, and that he reimburse the plaintiff for one-third of all payments made by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Defendant argues that the court was without jurisdiction \u201cto make one party solely liable for the joint obligations of both parties.\u201d The question whether the court has authority between the debtors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>creditors to relieve one of the parties of the obligation has no bearing on the authority of the court to fix the debtor parties\u2019 responsibilities between themselves. The court\u2019s order in this case related only to the fixing of responsibility as between the parties and not as to the creditors and was within its jurisdiction. RSA 458:19. Considering the fact that plaintiff was made responsible for more of the joint debts than defendant, and because no transcript of the evidence was made, we cannot say that there was any abuse of discretion. <em>Cotter v. Cotter, </em>119 N.H. 426, 402 A.2d 198 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Relying upon RSA 460:3, defendant contends that the court lacked jurisdiction to make him responsible for plaintiff\u2019s student loan debts incurred before the marriage. RSA 460:3 provides: \u201cMarriage shall not render the husband liable for the debts contracted by his wife prior to their marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">This statute, which appears in a different chapter than the divorce statute, relates to the wife\u2019s obligation to creditors and does not restrict the court in a divorce action from apportioning responsibility between the parties. RSA 458:19 empowers the court to \u201cassign to [the wife] such part of the estate of her husband, or order him to pay such sum of money, as may be deemed just.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The effect of the court\u2019s order was to require the defendant to pay to the wife a sum of money equaling one-third of her premarital debts including interest. Such an order is authorized by RSA 458:19, is not precluded by RSA 460:3, and in no way grants any rights to the creditor. Here again, in the absence of a record, we cannot say the order was unreasonable. <em>Greenglass v. Greenglass, </em>118 N.H. 570, 391 A.2d 890 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The final issue involves the engagement ring. Defendant relies on <em>Gikas v. Nicholis, </em>96 N.H. 177, 71 A.2d 785 (1950). That case, however, was an action of trover by the donor after the engagement was broken. No marriage had taken place. In the case before us, it was clearly within the authority of the court under RSA 458:19 to award the ring to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
