Murphy, </em>Esq.) erred when he found that the defendant is entitled to keep the plaintiffs\u2019 ten thousand dollar deposit as liquidated damages for the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to purchase under a purchase and sale agreement. We hold that the record supports the master\u2019s finding and we overrule the plaintiffs\u2019 exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">On December 20, 1973, the parties entered into a written purchase and sale agreement. The plaintiffs contracted to purchase a large tract of land in Hanover from the defendant for a total purchase price of one hundred thousand dollars. The plaintiffs paid ten thousand dollars into an escrow account held by the defendant. The purpose of the escrow deposit was to assure performance by the plaintiffs. The contract provided that the deposit would either be credited toward the purchase price at closing or be retained by the defendant as liquidated damages if the plaintiffs defaulted. The contract provided that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>transaction would 'close on February 1, 1974, with a thirty-day extension possible if necessary to correct any defects in title. In a January 31, 1974, letter, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney requested an extension agreement to enable the defendant to cure a serious defect in the record title. In a February 4, 1974, letter, the defendant\u2019s lawyer confirmed \u201can indefinite extension of time for performance.\u201d In an August 20, 1974, memorandum, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer reminded the defendant of its continuing contractual burden, and of the plaintiffs\u2019 intent to enforce the December 20, 1973, agreement as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">All findings of fact contained in the master\u2019s report are supported by the record. The report was approved by the Trial Court <em>(Johnson, </em>J.), who reserved and transferred all questions of law raised therein. The master found that until late December 1974, the parties continued to engage in a course of conduct indicative of a contractual relationship. The defendant assiduously sought to clear its record title. The plaintiffs encouraged this effort, and demonstrated their willingness to purchase as soon as marketable title was available. They never formally or informally repudiated the agreement. They never demanded return of their deposit money despite the defendant\u2019s failure to perform within the time limits specified in the written agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In late December 1974, two months after the defendant had cleared all title defects and was capable of performing its obligation under the agreement, the plaintiffs repudiated the contract, claiming that all contractual obligations had terminated earlier that year. The master found, and plaintiff Bower\u2019s testimony confirms, that \u201cthe passage of time had dampened their enthusiasm for the investment.\u201d When the defendant did not return the ten thousand dollar deposit, the plaintiffs sued to recover it.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">I. <em>Enforceability of the Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Because the determination of the existence of a contract in the present case \u201cdepends on the credibility of extrinsic evidence or on a choice among reasonable inferences to be drawn from extrinsic evidence,\u201d it is the function of the master as the trier of fact to make that determination. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS \u00a7 238(2) (Tent. Draft No. 1-7 1973); <em>accord, Erin Food Services, Inc. v. 688 Properties, </em>119 N.H. 232, 235, 401 A.2d 201, 203 (1979); <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Cray, </em>109 N.H. 223, 225, 248 A.2d 83, 84 (1968). In such an instance, we will reverse a master\u2019s finding that a contract exists only \u201cwhen it cannot \u2018reasonably be made on the evidence,\u2019 or when it \u2018can be said to be erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Humiston v. Bushnell, </em>118 N.H. 759, 762, 394 A.2d 844. 846 (1978) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The plaintiffs claim that the original agreement had expired because of the passage of time and the dates expressly imposed by the contract. They argue that even if it is found that they had agreed to an extension or that they had entered into a second agreement, such extension or additional agreement would be unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. RSA ch. 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The master found that the Statute of Frauds is inapplicable in this case because the defendant relied and acted on the plaintiffs\u2019 written and oral statements and their course of conduct, which indicated that the plaintiffs considered the purchase and sale agreement to be of continuing effect. The record is replete with evidence to support this finding. The finding is supported by the correspondence between the parties\u2019 lawyers extending indefinitely the time of performance. The testimony of plaintiff Bower indicates that he was aware of his lawyer\u2019s role in securing a contract extension. It may be inferred that Bower had full knowledge of his lawyer\u2019s acts and intended to adopt them. <em>See deRochement v. Holden, </em>99 N.H. 80, 83, 105 A.2d 43, 46 (1954). We therefore reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that they are not bound by acts of their lawyer. <em>Cf. Manchester Housing Authority v. Zyla, </em>118 N.H. 268, 385 A.2d 225 (1978) (action within scope of lawyer\u2019s authority during civil litigation binding on client).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">On January 31, 1974, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer wrote, \u201cMy clients have requested that I obtain from you a letter confirming that the parties are now operating under an extension of time. . . .\u201d The defendant\u2019s lawyer responded in a letter dated February 4, stating, \u201cThis letter will confirm that we have agreed to an indefinite extension of time for the performance under the purchase and sale agreement dated December 20, 1973.....\u201d The exchange of letters indicates that the parties intended to continue their contractual relationship, and intended the provisions of the written agreement to remain operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\"> A party to a purchase and sale agreement who consents to a postponement of'the time for performance and induces the other party to act upon the consent cannot claim default and argue that the contract has lapsed. This is true even when time has been made of the essence in the original written agreement. <em>Warren v. Dodge, </em>83 N.H. 47, 51, 138 A. 297, 299-300 (1927), <em>citing Neppach v. Oregon &amp; California Railroad Co., </em>46 Or. 374, 397, 80 P. 482, 487 (1905). If we were to allow the plaintiffs to prevail in this case, we would sanction their practice of treating \u201cthe contract as binding and as rescinded at the same time.\u201d <em>Weeks v. Robie, </em>42 N.H. 316, 320 (1861); <em>Sumner &amp; Company v. Parker, </em>36 N.H. 449, 454 (1858). This we will not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>We further reject the plaintiffs\u2019 implicit argument that their performance under the purchase and sale agreement should be excused under either the doctrine of impossibility of performance or commercial frustration. The impossibility doctrine requires that there be complete and permanent impossibility. <em>Perry v. Champlain Oil Co., </em>99 N.H. 451, 453, 114 A.2d 885, 887 (1955). Under the commercial frustration doctrine, frustration is relative, and usually not deemed present when the contract\u2019s main purpose is obtainable. <em>Id. </em>at 553-54, 114 A.2d at 888. In the present case, the conveyance of marketable title was neither impossible nor unobtainable. At the time the plaintiffs repudiated the agreement, the defendant was able and willing to tender marketable title, and the plaintiffs were obligated to purchase it.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">II. <em>Liquidated Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">This court\u2019s appellate function is not independently to find facts in order to determine the appropriateness of an award of damages. \u201cOur only function is to determine whether a reasonable man could have reached the same decision as the master on the basis of the evidence before him.\u201d <em>Sargent Lake Ass\u2019n v. Dane, </em>118 N.H. 720, 722, 393 A.2d 559, 561 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Liquidated damages provisions are enforceable when, upon execution of a contract, potential actual damages are difficult to estimate, the parties intend to liquidate damages in advance, and the amount stipulated is both reasonable and proportionate to the anticipated damages. <em>Langlois v. Maloney, </em>95 N.H. 408, 412-13, 64 A.2d 697, 701 (1949). The master\u2019s award of the liquidated damages to the defendant is reasonable. In real estate transactions, projected damages from a breach are difficult to forecast because land values fluctuate. The purchase and sale agreement specifically states that \u201cSELLER shall retain said sum of Ten Thousand ($10,000.) Dollars as liquidated damages in lieu of any other remedy at law or in equity.\u201d Finally, the liquidated sum is reasonable and proportionate to the damages actually incurred' by the defendant. The contract price in the present case was one hundred thousand dollars. After the plaintiffs\u2019 breach, the defendant sold the property to a third party for ninety thousand dollars in an arm\u2019s-length transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">We sustain the master\u2019s finding that the purchase and sale agreement is enforceable and that the defendant is entitled to retain the ten thousand dollar deposit as liquidated damages. The master\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>detailed report is amply supported by the hearing transcript and exhibits in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b640-4\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
