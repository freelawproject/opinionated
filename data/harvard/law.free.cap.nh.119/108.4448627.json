Plaintiff\u2019s exception was transferred by <em>DiClerico, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-18\">On June 13, 1974, the plaintiff, then fourteen, was operating a mini-bike, an off-highway recreational vehicle (OHRV), on State land. The defendant was constructing alterations to a highway interchange and the plaintiff alleged that the defendant negligently failed to warn and erect appropriate barriers which would have prevented the plaintiff from driving into a culvert and injuring himself. At trial the defendant moved for a nonsuit at the end of plaintiffs opening statement. The motion was granted after the trial court determined that there was no duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Subject to certain exceptions, RSA 212:341 provides that a lessee or occupant of premises \u201cowes no duty of care to keep such premises safe for . . .
