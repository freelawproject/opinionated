Kawerk, doing business as Rox Products Company, made application to the United States Patent Office, under the \u25a0 provisions of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 81 et seq., for the registration of his trademark Rox_salve ^or use on \"Salve, useful in the treatment of head and chest colds, nasal congestion, and as an antiseptic dressing for minor cuts or insect bites.\u201d Appellant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., filed notice of opposition to said proposed registration, based upon the prior use of its registered trade-mark \u201cRoche\u201d on a large variety of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations, including preparations recommended for the treatment of colds and preparations having antiseptic qualities.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">Appellant took the testimony of one witness, its acting vice-president; appellee took no testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">Appellant alleges a use of its mark, by itself and its predecessors, over a period of nearly fifty years for a \u201cconstantly varying and ever-increasing line of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations,\u201d and that during that period millions of dollars had been spent in advertising and popularizing said mark. These allegations find support in the evidence introduced .by appellant. Appellee\u2019s earliest use of his mark on his goods was November 29, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">The Examiner of Trade-mark Interferences held that the marks, in some instances used on identical goods, are confusingly similar, and that \u201cconfusion may be reasonably expected,, to result from their concurrent use in trade\u201d; and (the appellant being senior in use) he sustained the opposition and adjudged that appellee\u2019s mark should not be registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-16\">Upon appeal, the Commissioner of Patents (speaking through an assistant commissioner), took the opposite view from that taken by the examiner with reference to the likelihood of confusion and reversed the examiner\u2019s decision. 58 U.S.P.Q. 614. It was the view of the commissioner that purchasers of appellee\u2019s salve would call for \u201cRox Rox Salve\u201d rather than asking for \u201cRox Salve.\u201d He recognized the similarity, in sound but held that those desiring appellant\u2019s \u201cRoche\u201d salve would state the nature of the preparation, and that, considering \u201cRox Rox Salve\u201d in its entirety, there was such a difference in the appearance and manner in which the goods of the respective parties would be purchased that confusion would be unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">It will be noticed that appellee\u2019s trademark, as applied for, is Rox-S^lve. TIle word \u201csalve\u201d has been disclaimed. In the label submitted to the Patent Office illustrating the manner in which appellee uses his mark, it is observed that immediately under the first term \u201cRox\u201d is placed the word \u201cBrand\u201d in small red letters. The first term \u201cRox\u201d is also printed in red, while the term \u201cRox-Salve\u201d is printed in green. This would seem to indicate that appellee regards the second \u201cRox\u201d as the important term of the mark in indicating origin. Appellee\u2019s answer to the notice of opposition admits that \u201cRox\u201d is the dominant feature of the mark. We think all the probabilities are that purchasers will call for appellee\u2019s product as \u201cRox Salve\u201d and it is our view that confusion would be likely to result, owing to the fact that on the same shelf would probably be found appellant\u2019s \u201cRoche\u201d salve.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-18\">There is some dispute about the pronunciation of the word \u201cRoche,\u201d which admittedly is the French word for \u201crock.\u201d The record shows that the term \u201cRoche\u201d is correctly pronounced with a short \u201co,\u201d as in the term \u201crochelle,\u201d which means a small rock, and that \u201crochelle\u201d is pronounced with a short,\u201co,\u201d as the \u201co\u201d is pronounced in the words \u201crock\u201d and \u201cRox.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Both products are sold over the counter (appellant\u2019s extensively), and appellant\u2019s \u201cRoche\u201d salve is additionally sold on physicians\u2019 prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">It is our view that the Examiner of Trade-mark Interferences arrived at the right conclusion in holding that purchasers of salve might obtain a different product from that which they contemplated purchasing, or at least would be confused with reference to the origin of the goods. We think there is sufficient similarity in sound, appearance, and meaning between the two marks, the goods in part being identical, to justify the conclusion that the likelihood of confusion flowing from the concurrent use of the marks would be imminent. At least there is sufficient doubt on the question to require, when it is resolved against the applicant-appellee, that the opposition be sustained and the registration of appellee\u2019s mark be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Appellant has cited a number of cases with reference to the dominant portion of appellee\u2019s mark. Unquestionably, under the circumstances stated, the \u201cRox\u201d part of the mark is the only portion calculated to indicate origin. This is true notwithstanding the fact that the mark applied for must be \u201c Rox \u201d considered in its entirety as R0x-Salve Appellee, in urging that confusion would be unlikely, argues that appellant\u2019s mark \u201cRoche\u201d would be pronounced \u201cRosh\u201d as in \u201croach.\u201d The record does not support this contention, and it is, of course, well known that the pronunciation of proper names is more or less arbitrary. So, it is probable that the name would be pronounced \u201crock\u201d as often as \u201cRosh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Numerous decisions are cited by the appellee in support of his position that the marks ars sufficiently dissimilar in sound, meaning, and appearance to avoid the likelihood of confusion; but we find it unnecessary to discuss them because, as we have frequently said, so many different considerations enter into the determination of a question of this character that each case must, in the final analysis, rest on its own bottom. It is seldom that any decided case involving this question affords an absolute yardstick for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">On the question of considering the marks in their entirety, appellee urges the applicability of numerous decisions. Of course, it is the rule that in determining this question, the mark as a whole must be taken into consideration; but that does not mean that those called upon to determine the question may not analyze the different features of the mark with a view of determining whether the marks involved in a case are confusingly similar. See Franco-Italian Packing Corporation v. Van Camp Sea Food Co., Inc., Cust. &amp; Pat. App., 142 F.2d 274, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">Appellee, as well as the commissioner, stresses the fact that appellee\u2019s mark is Rox-Salve and that one callinS for \u201cRox Rox Salve\u201d would not be confused with appellant\u2019s \u201cRoche\u201d salve. If it is assumed that confusion would be likely to result between \u201cRox\u201d salve and \u201cRoche\u201d salve, it does not seem reasonable to believe that appellee avoids the probability of confusion by repeating the dominant feature of his mark. It seems to us that under such circumstances, the importance of the word \u201cRox\u201d is emphasized rather than minimized.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">It is further proper to say that in cases of this character, in considering the likelihood of confusion, it is of greater importance to consider the points of similarity than the points of difference. In Guggenheim v. Cantrell &amp; Cochrane, Ltd., 56 App.D.C. 100, 10 F.2d 895, 896, Mr. Justice Robb, speaking for the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (now the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia), said: \u201cIn this court, it has been repeatedly declared that (here is neither legal nor moral excuse for even an approximate simulation of a well-known mark applied to goods of the same descriptive properties, and that, when an attempt to effect such simulation becomes apparent, the two marks should not be examined with a microscope to detect minute differences, but, on the contrary, should be viewed as a whole, as the general public would view them; in other words, that the points of similarity are of greater importance than the points of difference. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">The last above-quoted language was cited by us with approval in Campbell Products, Inc. v. John Wyeth &amp; Bro., Inc., Cust. &amp; Pat. App., 143 F.2d 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-17\">It would be logical to conclude that appellee, when he adopted his mark, the reasons for doing so not being shown (except as the similarity of his Christian name and the term \u201cRox\u201d appears), knew of the favorable repute of appellant\u2019s identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>product, sold under the \u201cRoche\u201d mark. Under such circumstances it was incumbent upon him to select, from the vast field of trade-mark possibilities, a term that would indicate \u25a0 origin of the goods in him and one which would not be likely to bring about the result Congress, in the enactment of the said Trade-Mark Act, sought to avoid. Failing to do so, the law requires that registration be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b616-6\">BLAND, Associate Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A78\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">I concur in the foregoing opinion and, in addition to what is said by the majority, I wish' to express my views on one phase of the case which is not mentioned by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">In determining the similarities and dissimilarities between trade-marks, each feature of each mark may be separately considered with a view toward ascertaining what purchasers and sellers of the merchandise would do and think. The statute under which we are proceeding was designed to do away with the likelihood of confusion, and the pertinent portion reads: \u201c * * * be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the <em>public </em>or to deceive <em>purchasers </em>* * (Italics mine.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">We are concerned not only with what the purchaser might think, but in the instant case, if one came into a drugstore and asked for the new product, \u201cRox Salve\u201d, there would be a grave probability that if the druggist had only \u201cRoche Salve\u201d, he might mistakenly deliver it to the purchaser; thus, being deceived himself, he would aid in the deception of the purchaser. The statute attempts to ward against confusion or mistake in the mind of the <em>public </em>as well as to avoid deceiving <em>purchasers. </em>Surely the drug clerk is not only a seller but also a purchaser of the salve, and he also forms one of the public. In a case of the character of that at bar, we are interested not only in seeing that the purchaser makes no mistake himself, hut that he is not led into error by the confusion or mistake of others interested in the transaction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
