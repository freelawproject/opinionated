The appellee, Esquire, Inc., opposed said registration upon the ground that appellant sought to appropriate appellee\u2019s entire corporate name. The opposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>tion is based upon that portion of the proviso to \u00a7 5 of the Trade-mark Act of February 20, 1905, which states that \u201cno mark which consists merely in the name of an individual, firm, corporation, or association not written, printed, impressed, or woven in some particular or distinctive manner * * * shall be registered under the terms of this Act\u201d. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85 (1940), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The record shows dhat the corporate name of appellee since 1939 (prior to appellant\u2019s first use of its trade-mark) has been Esquire, Inc. There is nothing except the answer of appellant to appellee\u2019s notice of opposition which discloses the nature of the goods dealt in by the appellee corporation, Esquire, Inc. While immaterial in view of our conclusion, it was disclosed, without controversy, in argument before this court that Esquire, Inc., appellee, is now and has been continuously, since 1939, publishing a well-known magazine under the title Esquire.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The Commissioner of Patents, speaking through an assistant commissioner, affirmed the decision of the Examiner of Trademark Interferences, which sustained the opposition and adjudged that the trad\u00e9mark should not be registered. 58 U.S.P.Q. 564. Appellant has here appealed and contends: (1) That appellee\u2019s corporate name is Esquire, Inc., that appellant has not appropriated the entire name of appellee, and that therefore appellant\u2019s mark does not consist <em>merely </em>in the name of the appellee corporation; (2) that hamburger molding machines are merchandise wholly different in character from magazines, and that therefore there is no likelihood of confusion; (3) that appellant\u2019s application shows the trade-marls: to be printed in a \u201cparticular or distinctive manner\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The first question to determine is whether appellant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cconsists merely in the name of\u201d the appellee corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"ADN\">The Supreme Court of the United States interpreted the statutory 'provision now under consideration in the case of American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, 269 U.S. 372, 46 S.Ct. 160, 162, 70 L.Ed. 317. There the corporate name involved was the \u201cSimplex Electric Heating Company\u201d. Another had attempted to appropriate for a trade-mark the word \u201cSimplex\u201d. The Court laid down the following principle with reference to the said prohibition in the registration statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">\u201cThe provision, therefore, that no mark consisting merely in the name of a corporation shall be registered, is to be construed in harmony with those established principles in respect of the appropriation of corporate names to which we have referred. Where the appropriation of the corporate name is complete, the rule of the statute, by its own terms, is absolute, and the proposed mark must be denied registration, without more; but, where less than the whole name has been appropriated, the right of registration will turn upon whether it appears that such partial appropriation is of such character and extent that, under the facts of the particular case, it is calculated to deceive or confuse the public to the injury of the corporation to which the name belongs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Appellant contends that in determining whether it has appropriated the entire name of appellee, we cannot ignore the term \u201cInc.\u201d Appellee, agreeable to the holdings of the tribunals below, contends that in cases of this character the law is well settled that such terms as \u201cInc.\u201d, \u201cIncorporated\u201d, \u201cCompany\u201d, etc., must be ignored. We are in agreement with the latter view.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">We think the rule was clearly stated by Assistant Commissioner Frazer in White Cap Company v. Allied Stores Corporation, 41 U.S.P.Q. 554, in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">\u201cThe examiner\u2019s ruling finds no support in the decisions of the courts or of the Commissioner of Patents. It has been the uniform practice to ignore such words as \u2018company,\u2019 \u2018incorporated\u2019 and \u2018limited\u2019 in corporate names, on the theory that they do not serve to identify any particular corporation. For example, it was held by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in Asbestone Co. v. Philip Carey Manufacturing Co., 41 App.D.C. 507, that \u2018Asbestone\u2019 was the corporate name of The Asbestone Company; and that case was cited with approval by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in Feldman v. Amos and Andy, 68 F.2d 746, 21 C.C.P.A. [Patents] 823 [20 U.S.P.Q. 189]. In the Patent Office it has been held that \u2018Fire Fighter\u2019 is the corporate name of The Fyr-Fyter Company (The Fyr-Fyter Co. v. William L. Barrell Co., 475 O.G. 688, 32 U.S.P.Q. 260) ; that \u2018Wizard\u2019 is the corporate name of Wizard, Inc. (Ex parte Gruendler Crusher &amp; Pulverizer Co., 156 Ms.D. 710, 10 U.S.P.Q. 174); and that \u2018Americanmaid\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>is the corporate name of the American Maid Company (Ex parte The American Thermos Bottle Co., 156 Ms.D. 301, 4 U.S.P.Q. 326).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">On this phase of the question, we think it is unnecessary to discuss the several cases cited by the assistant commissioner in the above quotation, since they are all to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">We are of the opinion, therefore, that appellant has appropriated the name of appellee within the meaning of the well-settled applicable rule, because the portion which it has not adopted does not serve to identify the corporation in any particular. The cases relied upon by the assistant commissioner and the examiner, we think, abundantly support this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">In holding as we do that appellant has appropriated the entire corporate name of appellee, notwithstanding the fact that it does not use the term \u201cInc.\u201d, we must consider the language of the statute when it says \u201cconsists merely in the name of * * [a] corporation\u201d. Appellant has taken all of the corporate name of appellee that has any bearing whatever on identifying the particular corporation, and it stands to reason that in the use of the term \u201cmerely\u201d, Congress did not contemplate that one would be privileged to appropriate everything about the corporate name that would serve to identify it and, by the omission of an insignificant part of the name, avoid the mandate of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> We think appellant\u2019s second contention \u2014 that its mark is printed in a particular or distinctive manner \u2014 is without merit. The letters of the word \u201cEsquire\u201d are all capitals of the same type. There is nothing unusual, \u201cparticular or distinctive\u201d about their appearance or arrangement. The correct rule on this subject was stated in the case of In re Artesian Manufacturing Company, 37 App.D.C. 113, by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (now the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia), quoting from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents in Ex parte Polar Knitting Mills, 154 O.G. 251, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">\u201cIt is believed that the controlling principle underlying the requirement of the statute that a mere name, unless written or printed in a distinctive manner, may not be registered, is that the distinctive manner in which the name is displayed must be of a character as to give such a distinct impression to the eye of the ordinary observer as to outweigh the significance of the mere name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">See also In re Nisley Shoe Co., 58 F.2d 426, 19 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1211, and In re American Steel &amp; Wire Co. of New Jersey, 81 F.2d 397, 23 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">Since we have held that appellant\u2019s mark is merely the name of appellee, we need not consider appellant\u2019s argument relating to the difference in character of its goods and those of appellee. American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
