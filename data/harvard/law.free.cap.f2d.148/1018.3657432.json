The oil, as a result of the acid treatment, retains in solution a. quantity of oil-soluble sulfonic acids which may be removed by various methods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-26\">\u201cOne method for accomplishing such removal comprises neutralizing the oil with a basic solution, such as sodium hydroxide, and thereafter washing the neutralized oil with an aqueous solution of water-soluble petroleum sulfonates to extract from the oil its content of oil-soluble sulfonates. Having obtained by this process an aqueous solution of water-soluble sulfonates containing the extracted oil-soluble sulfonates, it becomes necessary .to provide a method by which the oil-soluble'sulfonates may be separated from the aqueous solution of water-soluble sulfonates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>\u201cIn accordance with applicant\u2019s invention, this is accomplished by adding to the mixture a lower aliphatic alcohol such as methyl alcohol in a quantity sufficient to precipitate from the aqueous solution, a concentrate of oil-soluble sulfonates. The resulting concentrate is then separated from the aqueous solution of water-soluble sulfonates by decantation, and the alcohol thereafter is recovered from the solution by distillation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">Claim 7 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-5\">\u201c7. The process of removing oil-soluble sulfonates from an aqueous solution of water-soluble sulfonates, which comprises admixing said solution \u201c with a low boiling aliphatic alcohol to precipitate therefrom a concentrate of oil-soluble sulfonates, and separating said concentrate of oil-soluble sulfonates from the solution containing the water-soluble sulfonates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">Claim 9 specifies that the water-soluble sulfonate is a petroleum gas oil sulfonate. Claim 11 specifies that the alcohol is methyl alcohol. Claims 8, 10, and 12 specify the removal of the alcohol by distillation. Aside from these limitations, claims 8, 9, 10, and 12 do not differ in meaning from claim 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">Three patents were cited as references, viz. :</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">Bransky, 1,396,399, November 8, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">Beard et al., 1,997,566, April 16, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-10\">Bird, 2,028,185, January 21, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">There seems to be a disagreement between appellant and the board with respect to certain facts, particularly with regard to the Bird patent, and it is not altogether clear just how much weight the board gave to the other references.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-12\">It does not appear to be questioned that both the Bransky and the Beard et al. patents disclose, as is stated in substance in the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office, the treatment of hydrocarbon oil with sulfuric acid to precipitate the water-soluble sulfonates and then apply a solution of such sulfonates to the oil to extract the oil-soluble sulfonic compounds. It appears to be agreed also that Beard et al. further disclose a treatment of the resulting mixture of water-soluble and oil-soluble compounds to separate these constituents so that the water-soluble elements may be again used to extract more oil-soluble compounds. The board defined the showing of Bransky and Beard et al. as \u201ca disclosure of broad conception,\u201d and continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-15\">\u201c* * * jt jg our 0p:ni0n that Bird satisfies the terms of the claims in that beginning line 51, second column, page 1, and extending through the first column of page 2, he proposes to treat the aqueous suspension of apparently water-soluble and oil-soluble sulfonates with methyl, ethyl or isopropyl alcohol. Upon standing the mass appears to separate into three layers. The bottom layer is believed to contain the oil-soluble sulfonates described as an aqueous water-white bottom layer, lines 7 to 12. A middle layer said to be viscous tar appears to form on top of the bottom layer. This layer is regarded as immaterial to the question before us, but the third or uppermost layer seems to consist of alcohol and according to applicant\u2019s theory it would contain water-soluble sulfonates to the exclusion of oil-soluble sulfonates apparently contained in the bottom layer. The alcoholic mixture is then treated by distilling oil the alcohol as in applicant\u2019s case, line 16.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-17\">The text of the specification referred to by the hoard as beginning in line 51 of the Bird patent reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-18\">\u201cThe top layer in the sludge dilution step is called \u2018washed acid sludge\u2019. It is neutralized with sodium carbonate or hydroxide or other alkali or ammonia. An oxygenated organic solvent such as methyl, ethyl or isopropyl alcohol is added to the neutralized sludge until the mixture contains above about 30 to 60% alcohol. During this operation the temperature is preferably kept at substantially room temperature although higher or lower temperatures may be used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-19\">\u201cUpon standing a separation occurs and after 3 to 10 hours an aqueous water-white bottom layer is formed. This consists mainly of a super-saturated solution of inorganic salts which sets to a crystalline mass on longer standing or on cooling. A layer of viscous tar forms above this bottom layer. The uppermost layer consists of a solution of purified alkali sulfonates in alcohol. This layer is separately withdrawn. The alcohol may be recovered therefrom by distillation and the solution remaining contains alkali sulfonates of markedly improved properties with respect to color, solubility and wetting power when compared to the sulfonates prepared directly by neutralizing acid sludge. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1076-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>Appellant takes the position that the board was confused in its interpretation of the above quoted disclosure, and, therefore, erred in applying it to the claims on appeal. Briefly it is contended that the Bird patent is concerned solely with the recovery of water-soluble sulfonates from acid sludge in which no oil-soluble sulfonates are present; that \u201cAt no place does that patent disclose the separation of oil-soluble sulfonates from water-soluble sulfonates\u201d; that appellant recovers the water-soluble sulfonates disclosed in Bird and then proceeds to utilize them for the extraction of oil-soluble sulfonates from a particular oil after which he separates the extracted oil-soluble sulfonates from the water-soluble sulfonates, thus disclosing a process embracing \u201ctwo principal steps beyond the furtherest step disclosed by Bird.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">We .think it must be conceded that the board\u2019s discussion of the Bird disclosure above quoted is not altogether clear, at least it is not so to us, but we do not feel assured that the board erred in stating any of the essential facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">The brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office expresses the belief that appellant is in error in asserting, in substance, that Bird does not teach the use of alcohol on a mixture of oil-soluble and water-soluble sulfonates \u201cto precipitate out the former,\u201d and in this connection points out that Bransky describes the same kind of sludge which Bird treats as containing both water-soluble and oil-soluble sulfonic compounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">The examiner\u2019s analysis of the claims in his statement following the appeal to the board has been very carefully studied, in the light of appellant\u2019s comments thereon. It seems to us to be quite clear and we take .the liberty of quoting the following from it:</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">\u201cIf claim 7, for example, is analyzed in connection with the references, the anticipation will be \u00a1obvious. The claim is divided into the quoted sections as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-8\">\u201cClaim <em>7 </em>\u2014 \u2018The <em>process of removing oil-soluble sulphonates from an aqueous solution of water-soluble sulphonates </em>\u2014'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-9\">\u201cBird is concerned with a directly analogous process, i. e., the removal of oily impurities from an aqueous 'solution of water-soluble sulphonates. Further Bran-sky and Beard et al disclose the exact type of mixed solution recited in the claim and no invention would be involved in applying the purification technique of Bird to such solution <em>ot </em>remove the oil-soluble sulphonates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-11\"><em>\u201c \u2018 </em>\u2014 which <em>comprises admixing said solution with a low-boiling aliphatic alcohol to precipitate therefrom a concentrate of oil-soluble sulphonates </em>\u2014'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-12\">\u201cBird follows this exact procedure in that he adds a low-boiling aliphatic alcohol \u2022to the solution of water-soluble sulphonates to precipitate oily impurities. See Bird, page 2, col. 2, line 71 to page 3, col. 1, line 9.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-13\">\u201c <em>\u2018 </em>\u2014 and <em>separating said concentrate of oil-soluble sulphonates from the solution-containing the water-soluble sulphonates\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-14\">\u201cBird discloses separation of the precipitated matter and the remaining solution of water-soluble sulphonates. See-Bird, page 2, col. 2, line 74 to page 3, col. 1, line 9; also page 2 col. <em>1, </em>lines 7 to 15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-15\">\u201cThus it is evident that <em>the </em>claim is unpatentable over the references.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-16\">\u201cIn the same <em>manner, </em>all the other claims are considered equally unpatentable. These claims contain limitations all' of which are met by the references. Thus :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-17\">\u201cClaim 8 specifies the additional step of distilling alcohol from the purified solution of water-soluble sulphonates. This is shown by Bird, page 2, col. 1, lines 15 to 21. This same limitation is found in claims 10 to 12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-18\">\u201cClaims 11 and 12 specify the use of methyl alcohol. Bird discloses methyl alcohol on page 3, col. 1, line 22.\u201d (Italics quoted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1076-19\">As indicated above, the board placed greatest emphasis upon the Bird patent, but it stated in next .to the last paragraph of its decision \u201c* * * While it is conceded Bird does not set forth the principal [sic] and process in such simple and direct terms as expressed by applicant, we believe his procedure accomplishes such result, and in accordance with the terms of the claims,\u201d and the decision of the examiner was affirmed generally, thus impliedly endorsing the latter\u2019s application of the Bransky and Beard et al. references.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-20\">In view of the state of the prior art, we are not convinced that appellant is entitled to an award of invention for his process as defined in the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-21\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
