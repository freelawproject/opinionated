In so holding, the commissioner, among other things, said: \u201c * * * <em>What the applicant seems to have done is to invent a catchy name for bread, and undertakes to promote the sale of oil-paper wrappers by the use of this name. </em>The question is may a trader in wrappers register as a trade-mark for wrappers a device which is obviously intended for one particular article of trade and on its face refers to the article within the wrapper rather than to the wrapper itself? While no exact precedent has been found, this question must be answered in the negative. The meaning of a trade-mark, like a reputation, grows out of the opinions of others and not the opinion or intent of the owner. The ultimate consumer is the man who buys the bread, and he would never suppose this mark to refer to the wrapper. <em>Even the baker, the immediate consumer of the applicant\u2019s goods </em>\u2014 wrappers\u2014un<em>derstands the term to refer to the bread, and buys the wrapper for no other purpose than to use the name 'Butter Krust\u2019 as a name for bread. </em>The only thing in the wrapper over and above the making of the paper (which the applicant does not make) is the affixing of the name \u2018Butter Krust.\u2019 Probably the baker has little interest in knowing who made the paper, and the goods he buys are not bought because of the applicant\u2019s reputation for making paper, but because they contain this fancy name. In Pioneer Co. v. Oppenheimer\u2019s Sons (C. D., 1907, 144; 128 O.G., 1293), the alleged trade-mark \u2018Combination Sets,\u2019 for paper boxes, was canceled because the mark itself represented something other than boxes \u2014 namely, suspenders, garters, and armbands \u2014 for which the applicant had not registered it (and probably could not register it because it was descriptive.)\u201d (Italics not quoted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">In his decision in the instant case affirming the decision of the Examiner of TradeMarks, the Commissioner of Patents stated that counsel for appellant argued that appellant did not bake or sell bread, but, on the contrary, sold its wrappers to bakers of bread,' and that as its trade-mark was used on the wrappers only appellant was entitled to the registration of its mark. The commissioner then said: \u201c * * * Breakfast bread is bread primarily suitable for breakfast and therefore the words \u2018Breakfast Bread\u2019 applied to bread wrappers, particularly when, as appears on the specimen wrappers filed with the application, they are associated with the words \u2018Tailored for Toast\u2019 or \u2018Delicious Toasted\u2019, are merely descriptive of the intended purpose and function of the wrappers,'to wit, to contain or to enclose bread suitable for breakfast, for instance, toastable bread; and the mark is not registrable for the wrappers for that reason. Walgreen Co. v. Godefroy Manufacturing Co., 74 F.2d 127, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 818, 454 O.G. 530. Ex parte Viking Refrigerators, Inc., 532 O.G. 776, 163 Ms. D. 835, 51 U.S.P.Q. 142.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">It is contended here by counsel for appellant that appellant does not sell its goods to the retail trade, but only to manufacturers of bread; that \u201cAppellant and its competitors have created a new industry which is an integral part of modern food selling\u201d; that it and its competitors are rarely known to the retail merchant or to the general public; that its wrappers lose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>their identity as a separate commercial commodity when used by the bread manufacturer; and that, although appellant\u2019s customers (manufacturers of bread) \u201csalvage\u201d appellant\u2019s mark aud use it to identify and describe their breakfast bread and although the mark as used may be descriptive of the contents of the wrapper so far as the purchaser of the bread is concerned, appellant is, nevertheless, entitled to register its mark. Counsel rely here largely on the decision in the case of Bayer Co., Inc. v. United Drug Co., 272 F. 505, wherein it was held, among other things, by the District Court for the Southern District of New York that the owner of a trade-mark might have the right to the exclusive use of such mark in sales to manufacturing chemists, physicians, and retail druggists, but would not be entitled to its exclusive use so far as the general public is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The decision in the Bayer Co. case, supra, is not of vital importance here as the question before us is not whether appellant is entitled to the registration of a trade-mark for use on its bread wrappers, but rather whether it is entitled to the registration of a trade-mark which is designed not merely to indicate origin of its wrappers but also to describe, as it does, the bread enclosed in such wrappers.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Counsel for appellant frankly state in their supplemental brief that if appellant is entitled to the registration of its mark, the baker of bread who uses appellant\u2019s wrappers would be entitled to prevent other bakers from using the term \u201cBreakfast Bread\u201d on wrappers or- packages to describe their breakfast bread.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Obviously, if appellant is entitled to register its mark \u201cBreakfast Bread\u201d for use on wrappers designed to indicate to the purchasing public that the bread contained therein is breakfast bread, it would be entitled to use and register such terms as \u201cluncheon -bread,\u201d \u201ctea bread,\u201d \u201cdinner bread,\u201d \u201csupper bread,\u201d and any other term which is descriptive of bread and of which it was the first user and thereby <em>monopolize </em>the entire field and prevent bread manufacturers other than its customers from using any of such descriptive terms on their bread or bread wrappers.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">It would seem to be too clear for argument that appellant\u2019s alleged trade-mark is, as stated by the commissioner, \u201cmerely descriptive of the intended purpose and function of the wrappers, to wit, to contain or to enclose bread suitable for breakfast,\u201d and is, therefore, merely descriptive of the character of appellant\u2019s goods. See Walgreen Co. v. Godefroy Manufacturing Co., 74 F.2d 127, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 818, 24 USPQ 77; In re General Permanent Wave Corporation, etc., 118 F.2d 1020, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1099, 49 USPQ 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Counsel for appellant have presented many ingenious arguments in support of their contention that appellant\u2019s mark is registrable under the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905. Those arguments have been given the consideration they merit. We are of opinion, however, that, for the reasons hereinbefore stated, appellant is not entitled to the registration of its mark. Accordingly, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
