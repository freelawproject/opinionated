Because the court\u2019s order complied with neither the statute governing involuntary admissions (405 ILCS 5/2\u2014 107.1 (West 2008)), nor the statute governing agreed orders for alternative treatment (405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 801.5 (West 2008)), we vacate the order as void for want of statutory authority.</p> <p id=\"b322-11\" pgmap=\"322\">I. BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b322-12\" pgmap=\"322\">Respondent, a 56-year-old man, has had a long history of mental illness and has been the subject of prior orders of involuntary admission. On October 10, 2008, respondent\u2019s case coordinator filed a petition for continued involuntary admission at McFarland Mental Health Center (McFarland) pursuant to section 3 \u2014 813 of the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code (Mental Health Code) (405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 813 (West 2008)). The petitioner alleged respondent was a person subject to continued involuntary admission because (1) due to his mental illness, he was reasonably expected to engage in dangerous conduct (405 ILCS 5/1 \u2014 119(1) (West 2008)) and (2) the nature of his mental illness prevented him from understanding his need for treatment and, if he was not treated, he was reasonably expected to suffer or continue to suffer mental deterioration or emotional deterioration, or both, to the point that he was reasonably expected to engage in dangerous conduct (405 ILCS 5/1 \u2014 119(3) (West 2008)). Attached to the petition were certificates of examination prepared by Dr. A.M. Eberhardt and McFarland\u2019s clinical director, Greg Coughlin.</p> <p id=\"b323-4\" pgmap=\"323\">The same day, Coughlin filed a petition for alternative treatment, alleging that respondent\u2019s condition had improved since July 2008, when the last order of involuntary commitment was entered against him. The petitioner requested that the trial court consider placement in an intermediate care facility or a 24-hour supervised group home. Also filed was an agreement for alternative treatment signed by respondent\u2019s sister and guardian, a psychiatrist, Coughlin, and the admissions coordinator at Springfield Terrace Nursing Home. The agreement provided that, in lieu of hospitalization, respondent would (1) take his prescribed medications, (2) comply with prescribed lab work, (3) meet with his psychiatrist, (4) meet with staff for follow-up appointments, (5) comply with treatment or risk a return to McFarland, and (6) reside at the facility or another facility approved by his guardian. On the line designated for respondent\u2019s signature, the clinical director noted that \u201c[Respondent] chose not to sign.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b323-5\" pgmap=\"323\">On October 17, 2008, the trial court conducted a hearing on the petition for involuntary admission. The State moved to amend the petition to include the allegations that respondent was a person subject to involuntary admission because (1) due to his mental illness, he was unable to provide for his basic physical needs so as to guard himself from serious harm without the assistance of family or outside help and (2) he was in need of immediate hospitalization for the prevention of such harm. Without objection, the court allowed the amendment.</p> <p id=\"b323-6\" pgmap=\"323\">Respondent\u2019s treating psychiatrist at McFarland, Dr. Kasturi Kripakran, testified as the State\u2019s expert witness. She said respondent was diagnosed with schizophrenia and has suffered from delusions and paranoia. Although respondent has demonstrated some improvement with treatment, he recently reverted to threatening Dr. Kripakran. According to Dr. Kripakran, respondent does not believe he has a mental illness or that he needs medication. But, in her opinion, continuing respondent\u2019s treatment would be in his best interest.</p> <p id=\"b323-7\" pgmap=\"323\">The State posed the following question to the doctor:</p> <blockquote id=\"b323-8\" pgmap=\"323\">\u201cQ. Doctor, do you have an opinion within a reasonable degree of psychiatric certainty whether because of his mental illness he is reasonably expected to engage in dangerous conduct, which may include threatening behavior or conduct that places that person or another individual in reasonable expectation of being harmed? Do you have an opinion as to that?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b323-9\" pgmap=\"323\">A. Yes, I do.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b323-10\" pgmap=\"323\">Q. And what is your opinion?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b323-11\" pgmap=\"323\">A. I do believe that he is a danger if he does not continue treatment.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b323-12\" pgmap=\"323\">Q. And what factual basis do you have for your opinion?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b324-3\" pgmap=\"324\">A. Based on his past history and his past repeated hospitalizations for similar other episodes of aggression.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b324-4\" pgmap=\"324\">Q. When you describe his past history, does he have a long history of violence?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b324-5\" pgmap=\"324\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b324-6\" pgmap=\"324\">Dr. Kripakran testified that on September 19, 2008, respondent told her \u201che had a KPO order against [her], which means kill to protect order.\u201d He also told the doctor he had \u201cpeople who could carry out his order.\u201d In her opinion, respondent\u2019s mental illness prevented him from caring for his basic physical needs without assistance. She said in the last several years, respondent has resided only in nursing homes or McFarland. She said, to a reasonable degree of psychiatric certainty, she believes respondent is unable to understand his need for treatment and without treatment, he will suffer or continue to suffer mental or emotional deterioration. If he deteriorates, he will be reasonably expected to engage in dangerous conduct. Dr. Kripakran said she considers respondent in need of continued treatment for the prevention of harm to himself or others.</p> <p id=\"b324-7\" pgmap=\"324\">The prosecutor introduced the written agreement for alternative treatment, which was marked and introduced into evidence as exhibit No. 1. Dr. Kripakran described Springfield Terrace as the least-restrictive environment for respondent\u2019s treatment.</p> <p id=\"b324-8\" pgmap=\"324\">On cross-examination, Dr. Kripakran said respondent had lived in an apartment on his own several years ago, but that \u201cfailed because of his delusional beliefs.\u201d He had collected feces and urine in the apartment and was evicted.</p> <p id=\"b324-9\" pgmap=\"324\">Dr. Kripakran recommended for respondent a nursing home rather than McFarland because \u201che has not shown any dangerous behavior, and he has been able to take care of his ADLs [(activities of daily living)] with supervision.\u201d She opined that if he did well in the nursing home and continued his treatment and medication, he had a good chance of succeeding in an independent environment in the community.</p> <p id=\"b324-10\" pgmap=\"324\">Respondent testified on his own behalf as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b324-11\" pgmap=\"324\">\u201cQ. There\u2019s a proposal today to have you live at Springfield Terrace Nursing Home\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b324-12\" pgmap=\"324\">A. Uh-huh.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b324-13\" pgmap=\"324\">Q. \u2014for a period of not to exceed 90 days.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b324-14\" pgmap=\"324\">A. Uh-huh.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b324-15\" pgmap=\"324\">Q. What do you think about that?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b324-16\" pgmap=\"324\">A. Well, the ADLs that they spoke of, I can take care of myself. I take showers on my own, and I can eat on my own. I can cook for myself. I have done it before.</blockquote> <p id=\"b325-4\" pgmap=\"325\">The \u2014 evidently, I was in the apartment in 2004, and I was having fun walking across the street. I was acting like (indicating), you know, a little curtsy, having fun and going across the street, and somebody saw me doing that. I was just having a good time.</p> <blockquote id=\"b325-5\" pgmap=\"325\">Q. So is it your belief that\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-6\" pgmap=\"325\">A. I wasn\u2019t doing anything.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-7\" pgmap=\"325\">Q. \u2014you could live in an apartment right now?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-8\" pgmap=\"325\">A. Yes. But somebody saw me doing it, and they didn\u2019t like it, so they filed a petition to admit me. That\u2019s how I ended up here in \u201904. And I have been going in and out of nursing homes since October \u201904.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-9\" pgmap=\"325\">Q. Has that been helpful to you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-10\" pgmap=\"325\">A. No, not at all. It\u2019s a strain. It\u2019s stressful. I give other people freedom. I don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t give me freedom.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-11\" pgmap=\"325\">Q. Do you have an apartment you would go live in if you left here today?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-12\" pgmap=\"325\">A. Not that I know of, not right now. It would have to be arranged.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-13\" pgmap=\"325\">^ i|? %</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-14\" pgmap=\"325\">Q. Bob, if you were to be in the nursing home and did well, would you \u2014 do you think it would be possible for you to five in the community?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-15\" pgmap=\"325\">A. Well, what \u2014 what the doctor said was \u2014 and Scott said was about mental deterioration. That happens with the Haldol over a period of time when someone doesn\u2019t need it. And the stress and the brain, I want my own freedom. Plus the Haldol Decanoate, it can cause a little bit of deterioration. Yes, it can.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-16\" pgmap=\"325\">Q. So you believe the medications are harming you at this particular time?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-17\" pgmap=\"325\">A. Yes, I do. Right now they are. I have my \u2014 I don\u2019t have anything in the city\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-18\" pgmap=\"325\">Q. Would you agree to live at Springfield Terrace\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-19\" pgmap=\"325\">A. Yeah.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-20\" pgmap=\"325\">Q. \u2014for a little while?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-21\" pgmap=\"325\">A. Yeah. I can go for a little while. They need to correct what they did to me because they filed a wrong complaint against me and put me in here.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b325-22\" pgmap=\"325\">Both parties rested. After considering the evidence and arguments of counsel, the trial court found as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b325-23\" pgmap=\"325\">\u201cThe [cjourt finds that the petition has been proved by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-24\" pgmap=\"325(38) 326(12)\">In particular, the [cjourt finds that [respondent] is a person who is suffering from mental illness, and as a result of his illness, he is unable to provide for his basic physical needs so as to guard himself from serious harm without the assistance of his family or outside help.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b326-4\" pgmap=\"326\">Moreover, I find that he \u2014 -as a result of his illness, he\u2019s unable to understand the need for treatment as testified. He doesn\u2019t believe that he needs medication. And if not treated, he\u2019s reasonably expected to suffer or continue to suffer mental deterioration or emotional deterioration or both to the point that he is reasonably expected to engage in dangerous conduct.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b326-5\" pgmap=\"326\">In light of the doctor\u2019s testimony that he has not been dangerous in the recent weeks, I find that as of today there is insufficient evidence to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he is expected to engage in dangerous conduct at the present time.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b326-6\" pgmap=\"326\">I find that he\u2019s subject to hospitalization or to treatment at a facility. In this particular case, I\u2019m going to honor that agreement of all the parties and order that he be hospitalized in the care of Springfield Terrace here in Springfield, Illinois, under the agreement. And the agreement is incorporated as part of this order, and that that stay at Springfield Terrace shall not exceed 90 days.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b326-7\" pgmap=\"326\">The court entered a written order consistent with his oral pronouncement. This appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b326-8\" pgmap=\"326\">II. ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b326-9\" pgmap=\"326\"> Respondent claims section 1 \u2014 119(3) of the amended Mental Health Code (405 ILCS 5/1 \u2014 119(3) (West 2008)), which provides one definition of a person subject to involuntary admission, is unconstitutional as violative of the due-process clause and is impermissibly vague. Before delving into the constitutional standards of who qualifies as a person subject to involuntary admission under the Mental Health Code, we are mindful of the supreme court\u2019s admonition regarding constitutional questions. The court has repeatedly stated that \u201ccases should be decided on nonconstitutional grounds whenever possible, reaching constitutional issues only as a last resort.\u201d In re E.H., 224 Ill. 2d 172, 178, 863 N.E.2d 231, 234 (2006). Finding that this requirement \u201cseem[ed] to fall not infrequently on deaf ears,\u201d the court added specific requirements within the supreme court rules to address the court\u2019s admonition. E.H., 224 Ill. 2d at 178, 863 N.E.2d at 234; 210 Ill. 2d R. 18(c)(4) (effective September 1, 2006). Complying with the supreme court\u2019s admonition and the dictates of Rule 18, we have found the issues presented here can be resolved on nonconstitutional grounds. Therefore, we will not discuss, in the context of this case, the constitutionality of section 1 \u2014 119(3) (405 ILCS 5/1 \u2014 119(3) (West 2008)).</p> <p id=\"b326-10\" pgmap=\"326(22) 327(93)\"> We note this case, like the majority of involuntary-admission cases where the orders extend for only 90 days, is moot. Ordinarily, we are precluded from reviewing moot issues because we are unable to provide any meaningful relief. However, we may review moot issues if they qualify for review under the public-interest exception to the mootness doctrine. We find this case falls within the exception due to the following criteria: \u201c(1) the public nature of the question; (2) the desirability of an authoritative determination for the purpose of guiding public officers; and (3) the likelihood that the question will recur.\u201d In re Mary Ann R, 202 Ill. 2d 393, 402, 781 N.E.2d 237, 242-43 (2002).</p> <p id=\"b327-5\" pgmap=\"327\">The procedures that must be followed before an individual, who is suffering from a mental illness, is ordered to be involuntarily admitted for treatment is a matter of public concern. Mary Ann P., 202 Ill. 2d at 402, 781 N.E.2d at 243. That concern, coupled with the nature of the order entered in this case, satisfies this court that the requirements for review are appropriate as an exception to the mootness doctrine. This is not simply a case reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence. Instead, this case presents an issue of statutory interpretation that affects the procedural requirements of a respondent\u2019s admission for treatment under the Mental Health Code. See In re Alfred H.H., 233 Ill. 2d 345, 356, 910 N.E.2d 74, 81 (2009). The statute at issue is a relatively new piece of legislation and has been discussed in only one published opinion (see In re Michael H., 392 Ill. App. 3d 965, 975-79, 912 N.E.2d 703, 711-14 (2009)). Therefore, an authoritative determination regarding the interpretation of this statute will be helpful in the future guidance of public officers. See In re Phillip E., 385 Ill. App. 3d 278, 282, 895 N.E.2d 33, 39 (2008). And, due to the short duration of an order for an involuntary admission, the issues raised here are likely to recur without an opportunity for appellate review.</p> <p id=\"b327-6\" pgmap=\"327\">For the reasons that follow, we find the trial court lacked the statutory authority to enter the type of order entered in this case. In its order, the trial court (1) found respondent subject to involuntary admission, and (2) incorporated an agreement for alternative treatment. These two remedies are mutually exclusive and possess their own procedural requirements within the Mental Health Code. We will review the procedural requirements for each remedy below, keeping in mind the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b327-7\" pgmap=\"327\">\u201cThe procedural safeguards enacted by the legislature are not mere technicalities. Rather, they are intended to safeguard the important liberty interests of the respondent which are involved in mental[-]health cases. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b327-8\" pgmap=\"327\">*** The total disregard for the legislatively established procedures is contrary to the balancing of interests established by the [Mental Health] Code and should not be condoned.\u201d In re Luttrell, 261 Ill. App. 3d 221, 230, 633 N.E.2d 74, 81-82 (1994).</blockquote> <p id=\"b328-4\" pgmap=\"328\">A. Procedural Requirements for Involuntary Admission</p> <p id=\"b328-5\" pgmap=\"328\"> Involuntary admission into a mental-health facility involves a \u201c \u2018massive curtailment of liberty.\u2019 \u201d In re Barbara H., 183 Ill. 2d 482, 496, 702 N.E.2d 555, 561 (1998), quoting Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 491, 63 L. Ed. 2d 552, 564, 100 S. Ct. 1254, 1263 (1980). In this vein, the legislature enacted the Mental Health Code, which sets forth specific procedures that will serve to protect the respondent\u2019s interests in order to \u201censure that Illinois citizens are not subjected to such services improperly.\u201d Barbara H., 183 Ill. 2d at 496, 702 N.E.2d at 561-62. A petition for involuntary admission must assert that the respondent is suffering from a condition that requires immediate hospitalization in order to protect himself or others from harm. 405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 601(a) (West 2008). The petition must be supported by two certificates of examination. 405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 703 (West 2008). The trial court must conduct a hearing within five days of the petition being filed. 405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 611 (West 2008). At the hearing, the respondent has a right to counsel (405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 805 (West 2008)), the right to be present (405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 806(a) (West 2008)), and the right to a jury trial (405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 802 (West 2008)). The State must prove the allegations in the petition by clear and convincing evidence. 405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 808 (West 2008).</p> <p id=\"b328-6\" pgmap=\"328\">An initial order for involuntary admission is of short duration; it is valid for only 90 days. 405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 813(a) (West 2008). Despite the short duration, an order for involuntary admission into a hospital is a serious deprivation of the respondent\u2019s liberty in that it (1) subjects him to psychiatric care that he presumably does not want to receive, and (2) restricts his ability to come and go as he wishes. Michael H., 392 Ill. App. 3d at 972, 912 N.E.2d at 709. \u201cThus, the procedures set forth in the Code are a legislative recognition that civil commitment is a deprivation of personal liberty. The purpose of the procedures is to provide adequate safeguards against unreasonable commitment.\u201d In re James, 191 Ill. App. 3d 352, 356, 547 N.E.2d 759, 761 (1989).</p> <p id=\"b328-7\" pgmap=\"328\">B. Procedural Requirements for Agreed Orders for Treatment</p> <p id=\"b328-8\" pgmap=\"328(91) 329(106)\"> On the other hand, a respondent who agrees to admission at an outpatient-alternative-treatment facility cannot be subject to involuntary admission. See 405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 801.5(d) (West 2008). There is an inherent inconsistency in the concept of agreeing to something that is involuntary. See Michael H., 392 Ill. App. 3d at 973, 912 N.E.2d at 710. In 2006, our legislature enacted section 3 \u2014 801.5 (405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 801.5 (West 2008)) to address agreed orders for outpatient treatment. The statute provides that (1) the trial court must be satisfied that the agreement is in the respondent\u2019s and the public\u2019s best interests (405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 801.5(a)(1) (West 2008)), (2) the court must advise respondent of the conditions and be satisfied that the respondent understands and agrees to the conditions (405 ILCS 5/3\u2014 801.5(a)(2) (West 2008)), (3) the court must advise the proposed custodian and ensure his agreement (405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 801.5(a)(3) (West 2008)), (4) generally speaking, the agreed order may not include a requirement that the respondent be hospitalized (405 ILCS 5/3\u2014 801.5(a)(4) (West 2008)), and (5) no order may include the administration of psychotropic medication (405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 801.5(a)(5) (West 2008)).</p> <p id=\"b329-5\" pgmap=\"329\">As a limited exception to the no-hospitalization requirement set forth above, the statute does provide that a custodian may have the authority to admit a respondent to a hospital if he fails to comply with the conditions of the agreed order. 405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 801.5(b) (West 2008). However, if the respondent is admitted pursuant to such a provision, he must be treated as a voluntary admittee and be immediately advised of his right to request a discharge. 405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 801.5(b) (West 2008). Finally, and most importantly, such an agreed order cannot be construed as a finding that the respondent is subject to involuntary admission. 405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 801.5(d) (West 2008).</p> <p id=\"b329-6\" pgmap=\"329\">C. Trial Court\u2019s Order</p> <p id=\"b329-7\" pgmap=\"329\">The order in this case found respondent subject to involuntary commitment and, at the same time, incorporated an agreement for voluntary treatment at an alternative treatment facility. The Mental Health Code does not authorize such an order. In fact, the order \u201cflies in the face of this entire statutory scheme.\u201d Michael H., 392 Ill. App. 3d at 979, 912 N.E.2d at 714. \u201cIf the respondent agrees to be admitted, he must be admitted on a voluntary basis.\u201d Michael H., 392 Ill. App. 3d at 979, 912 N.E.2d at 714. A trial court cannot find respondent subject to involuntary admission while, at the same time, setting forth conditions pursuant to an agreement for alternative treatment, conditions that are statutorily prohibited in involuntary-admission proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b329-8\" pgmap=\"329(92) 330(29)\"> The only provision in the Mental Health Code that addresses both an involuntary and voluntary status is section 3 \u2014 801 (405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 801 (West 2008)). There, if a respondent requests voluntary admission at the time a petition for involuntary admission is pending, the trial court may dismiss the petition for involuntary admission upon proof that dismissal would be in the respondent\u2019s and the public\u2019s best interests. 405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 801 (West 2008). If the court determines that the petition should not be dismissed, the case proceeds subject to all procedural safeguards applicable to involuntary-admission cases. See Michael H., 392 Ill. App. 3d at 978-79, 912 N.E.2d at 714. Both proceedings cannot move forward at the same time.</p> <p id=\"b330-5\" pgmap=\"330\"> The trial court\u2019s order did not satisfy the statutory requirements for involuntary-admission orders. For example, one of the conditions set forth in the agreement incorporated into the order required respondent to \u201ctake all his medications as prescribed.\u201d This condition is strictly prohibited in involuntary-admission orders. See 405 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 107 (West 2008) (a respondent has the right to refuse medications). In order to involuntarily administer medications, the court must conduct a separate hearing with separate procedural safeguards. See 405 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 107.1 (West 2008). No such hearing was conducted in this case. Thus, respondent cannot be ordered to \u201ctake all his medications as prescribed\u201d without further inquiry.</p> <p id=\"b330-6\" pgmap=\"330\">Likewise, the trial court\u2019s order incorporating an agreement for alternative treatment did not satisfy the statutory requirements for agreed orders. Nothing in the record suggests that respondent agreed to comply with, or was even aware of, the conditions set forth in the order. See 405 ILCS 5/3 \u2014 801.5(a)(2) (West 2008). Respondent did not sign the document nor was he advised of the specific conditions set forth in the agreement. Respondent agreed to live at Springfield Terrace for \u201ca little while\u201d but that was the extent of his agreement.</p> <p id=\"b330-7\" pgmap=\"330\">Because the trial court\u2019s order did not comply with the statutory requirements for either an involuntary-admission order or an agreed order, the order is void for want of statutory authority. In re Weimer, 219 Ill. App. 3d 1005, 1009, 580 N.E.2d 182, 184 (1991). The Mental Health Code makes clear that a respondent cannot be treated as both an involuntary and voluntary patient in the same proceedings. The State argues that this court should simply strike the portions of the agreement that do not comply with orders for involuntary admission. Due to the fundamental liberty interests at stake in involuntary-admission proceedings, we will not pick and choose which of the trial court\u2019s requirements implicate respondent\u2019s due-process rights and which do not. For the reasons stated, we reverse the order finding respondent to be subject to both involuntary admission and the conditions of the agreement for alternative treatment. In light of this conclusion, we need not consider respondent\u2019s additional arguments.</p> <p id=\"b331-4\" pgmap=\"331\">III. CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b331-5\" pgmap=\"331\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment as void.</p> <p id=\"b331-6\" pgmap=\"331\">Vacated.</p> <p id=\"b331-7\" pgmap=\"331\">POPE, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\"> <author id=\"b331-8\" pgmap=\"331\">MYERSCOUGH, J.,</author> <p id=\"A-d\" pgmap=\"331\">specially concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p> <p id=\"b331-9\" pgmap=\"331\">I specially concur in part and respectfully dissent in part. I agree the trial court should not have adopted the \u201cagreed\u201d order for alternative treatment because the court had ordered involuntary commitment and respondent had not agreed to or been advised of a voluntary commitment and the terms set forth in that \u201cagreed\u201d order. However, the court\u2019s order is not void in full. The court\u2019s involuntary commitment was correct and should stand. This matter should, therefore, be remanded for further hearing on placement.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
