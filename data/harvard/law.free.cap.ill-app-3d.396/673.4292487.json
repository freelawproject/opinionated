Flaugher, to two consecutive 15-year prison terms upon his convictions of two counts of attempt (first degree murder) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 38, pars. 8 \u2014 4(a), 9 \u2014 1(a)(1)). The court stayed the execution of defendant\u2019s sentence until he was released from federal prison. After serving 17 years in federal custody, defendant filed a motion for a declaratory judgment, seeking a declaration that his Calhoun County sentences should run concurrently with his federal sentence, thereby entitling him to sentence credit for time served in federal prison.</p> <p id=\"b690-10\" pgmap=\"690\">In June 2008, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion, ordering defendant\u2019s two 15-year sentences for attempted first degree murder run concurrently with each other and with his federal sentence. The State appeals. We find the court (1) lacked jurisdiction to modify the two 15-year terms from mandatory consecutive to concurrent and (2) erred in ordering defendant\u2019s state sentence to run concurrently with his federal sentence when the two were statutorily mandated to run consecutively. We vacate the court\u2019s judgment and remand with directions.</p> <p id=\"b690-11\" pgmap=\"690\">I. BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b690-12\" pgmap=\"690(23) 691(68)\">On July 9, 1990, by information, the State charged defendant with two counts of attempt (first degree murder) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 38, pars. 8 \u2014 4(a), 9 \u2014 1(a)(1)) for shooting his brother, Thomas Flaugher, and Thomas\u2019s then wife, Dorothy, with a shotgun on July 8, 1990. The shooting incident stemmed from a dispute regarding a land partnership between Thomas and defendant. Defendant was released on bond on July 10, 1990. On August 3, 1990, the State charged defendant with the same offenses by the issuance of superseding indictments.</p> <p id=\"b691-4\" pgmap=\"691\">On November 30, 1990, while released on bond, defendant was arrested by federal authorities and later charged in the Southern District of Illinois in case No. 92 \u2014 2559 with (1) conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, (2) using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime, and (3) possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. According to the statement of facts in the subsequent reported appellate decision (see United States v. Carson, 9 F.3d 576, 579-81 (7th Cir. 1993)), defendant and several other individuals were involved in the drug trade. In the spring of 1990, a confidential informant notified federal agents about the drug trafficking, which triggered a six-month investigation. Finally, on November 30, 1990, a controlled sale of cocaine was organized. Federal agents began surveillance and watched as the informant and the various individuals met at several different locations throughout the day exchanging drugs and cash. As for defendant\u2019s role, he provided $50,000 to one of the buyers. When all of the parties (except for defendant) arrived at the designated location, each was arrested. Agents confiscated five kilograms of cocaine, and in some of the vehicles, the agents found loaded weapons. Defendant was arrested a few hours later with $1,500 in his wallet and bundled cash totaling $5,000 in his truck. On May 30, 1991, a jury convicted defendant on all counts. On June 5, 1992, the federal court sentenced defendant to 235 months in prison. He appealed, and his convictions and sentence were affirmed. See Carson, 9 F.3d at 592-93.</p> <p id=\"b691-5\" pgmap=\"691\">On August 5, 1991, after defendant was convicted on his federal charges but before he was sentenced thereon, a Calhoun County jury convicted him of two counts of attempt (first degree murder). On October 2, 1991, defendant filed a posttrial motion, challenging the strength of the evidence, the admission of certain jury instructions, the State\u2019s closing argument, and several evidentiary rulings. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p> <p id=\"b691-6\" pgmap=\"691\">On October 4, 1991, the trial court sentenced defendant to two consecutive 15-year prison terms, finding specifically that Dorothy had been \u201cseverely injured.\u201d The court further noted as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b691-7\" pgmap=\"691(23) 692(36)\">\u201cThis [c]ourt is not taking into consideration the federal offense at all or what sentence they might hand down. That has nothing to do \u2014 it doesn\u2019t relate to this proceeding at all. This is a totally separate proceedings [sic] in the Circuit Court of Calhoun County. What happens in the Federal Court is a total other ball[ ]game.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"AtGV\" pgmap=\"692\">After sentencing, defendant was remanded to the custody of the federal marshal.</p> <p id=\"b692-3\" pgmap=\"692\">On October 11, 1991, the trial court entered the sentencing judgment, which stated as follows: \u201cMittimus is stayed until defendant is released from custody of the United States Department of Justice.\u201d Defendant appealed. On August 13, 1992, this court affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences. See People v. Flaugher, 232 Ill. App. 3d 864, 598 N.E.2d 391 (1992).</p> <p id=\"b692-4\" pgmap=\"692\">On September 7, 1993, defendant filed his first pro se postconviction petition, alleging, inter alia, that the trial court erred by imposing consecutive prison terms because the evidence at trial did not reveal that either victim suffered severe bodily injury justifying consecutive terms. The court appointed counsel to represent defendant and, after a hearing, \u201cdismissed\u201d the petition. Defendant timely appealed the court\u2019s order. This court affirmed the dismissal. See People v. Flaugher, No. 4\u201494\u20140652 (September 15, 1995) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23).</p> <p id=\"b692-5\" pgmap=\"692\">On March 12, 1997, defendant filed his second pro se postconviction petition, alleging, inter alia, the ineffective assistance of trial, postconviction, and appellate counsel. On June 7, 1997, the trial court dismissed defendant\u2019s petition as frivolous and patently without merit.</p> <p id=\"b692-6\" pgmap=\"692\">On June 22, 2005, defendant filed his third pro se postconviction petition, alleging the trial court had failed to present the issue of whether the victims suffered great bodily harm to a jury for consideration before imposing consecutive prison terms on those grounds. He claimed his sentencing judgment was void. On January 12, 2007, the court summarily dismissed defendant\u2019s petition, finding that the law set forth in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 455, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 2362-63 (2000) (any factor used as a reason to increase a sentence must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt) could not be applied retroactively. Defendant appealed, filing a motion for remand, for the appointment of counsel and for further proceedings. This court allowed the motion and dismissed the appeal. See People v. Flaugher, No. 4\u201407\u20140154 (May 25, 2007) (appeal dismissed on appellant\u2019s motion).</p> <p id=\"b692-7\" pgmap=\"692(57) 693(99)\">On April 24, 2008, defendant, through counsel, filed a motion for declaratory judgment (the subject of this appeal), claiming that, at the time he was sentenced in this matter to two consecutive 15-year prison terms, he had not yet been sentenced on his pending federal charges. The sentencing court had stayed the execution of the sentencing judgment until defendant was released from federal custody. Citing People v. McNeal, 301 Ill. App. 3d 889, 891, 704 N.E.2d 793, 795 (1998) (\u201ca sentence may not be ordered to run consecutively with a sentence not yet imposed\u201d), defendant argued that the court was prohibited from ordering that his consecutive state terms would run consecutive to his federal sentence \u2014 a sentence that had not yet been imposed at the time he was sentenced in state court. Without citing statutory authority, defendant sought a declaratory judgment that his state sentences were to run concurrently to his federal sentence.</p> <p id=\"b693-4\" pgmap=\"693\">On June 12, 2008, defendant was released from federal prison, and five days later, the trial court conducted a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment. In his opening statement, defendant\u2019s counsel claimed this motion was one seeking clarification \u201cas to the sentence that was imposed against [defendant] back on October 4th of 1991.\u201d He argued that the sentencing stay effectively ordered defendant\u2019s sentences to run consecutively to his federal sentence, an impermissible result when he had not yet been sentenced on his pending federal conviction. See McNeal, 301 Ill. App. 3d at 891, 704 N.E.2d at 795.</p> <p id=\"b693-5\" pgmap=\"693\">The State did not object to the trial court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction. Instead, the State claimed defendant should now begin serving his consecutive 15-year prison terms as he had been released from federal prison into state custody.</p> <p id=\"b693-6\" pgmap=\"693\">Defendant presented the testimony of Wynona Hughes (his sister), Edward Flaugher (his nephew), Henry Flaugher (his brother), Curtis Flaugher (his son), Donna Flaugher (his wife), and defendant himself. They testified that defendant was not a threat to society, not at risk of committing any further crimes, and had served his federal sentence without incident. Defendant accepted responsibility and testified that he regretted shooting Thomas and Dorothy. Each witness blamed Thomas for the deterioration of the relationship between defendant and him, which had escalated into the shooting incident.</p> <p id=\"b693-7\" pgmap=\"693\">The State presented no evidence. During his closing argument, defendant\u2019s attorney argued that \u201c17 years for what he has done is more than enough.\u201d Counsel asked the trial court to \u201cdirect these sentences be concurrent with the federal sentence, accordingly.\u201d On the other hand, the prosecutor argued that the sentencing court specifically found that it was not considering the federal offense at all as a factor in imposing consecutive sentences. Rather, the prosecutor argued, the court imposed the consecutive terms after specifically finding that the nature of the victim\u2019s injuries warranted such terms. The prosecutor asked for a continuance of the hearing for an opportunity to present the testimony of the victims. The court granted the State\u2019s request for a continuance.</p> <p id=\"b694-3\" pgmap=\"694\">On June 24, 2008, the continued hearing resumed. The State called Thomas Flaugher. He referred to defendant as his \u201cex-brother\u201d and testified that he still feared defendant even though he has had no contact with him or his family in 15 years. Defendant had also shot at Thomas approximately a month and a half before the incident that resulted in the criminal charges. He said he \u201ccontinue[d] to express concern about [defendant\u2019s] release.\u201d He said defendant had not contacted him to express his remorse or to apologize.</p> <p id=\"b694-4\" pgmap=\"694\">On cross-examination, defendant\u2019s counsel had Thomas read portions from the trial transcript where, during his testimony, Thomas admitted that he had threatened to kill defendant and had slapped Curtis, defendant\u2019s son, prior to the shooting incident. Thomas testified that, as a result of the shooting, he suffered a pellet wound on his arm, which did not require surgery.</p> <p id=\"b694-5\" pgmap=\"694\">Dorothy Flaugher testified that defendant shot her in the head, arm, hand, and chest with shotgun pellets, causing injuries requiring hospitalization. She said she was still afraid for her personal safety. She testified that, after the shooting, Curtis had exhibited threatening behavior toward her, such as following her extremely closely in his vehicle and shooting toward her house. Defendant had not apologized to her either.</p> <p id=\"b694-6\" pgmap=\"694\">In rebuttal, defendant called Curtis Flaugher, who denied following or stalking Dorothy or firing a weapon toward her home. He said prior to the shooting incident, Thomas had assaulted him twice \u2014 once by pulling him off of his four wheeler and another time by striking him in the face. He was 16 years old at the time.</p> <p id=\"b694-7\" pgmap=\"694\">Donna Flaugher testified in rebuttal that the shooting incident stemmed from Thomas\u2019s violence toward Curtis, the sale of certain personal property, and the named owners of certain real property. She said these circumstances no longer exist; and therefore, defendant would not be a threat to the victims.</p> <p id=\"b694-8\" pgmap=\"694(157) 695(35)\">Defendant testified that prior to the incident, he and Thomas did not have any personal problems with each other and had never been physically violent toward each other. He said he is no longer a threat to Thomas or Dorothy. He testified that he was currently 62 years old. He received an additional three years on his federal sentence as a result of the Calhoun County convictions. He was expected to serve an additional 10 years of supervised release. If he were released from state custody, he would secure employment and comply with all restrictions of his federal supervised release. He asked the trial court for a chance to \u201cbecome a viable citizen and a husband and father,\u201d stating as follows: \u201cWhenever this ended, whenever the altercation finally come [sic] to a head, I was mentally and physically, I was destroyed, and I\u2019m sorry I did it, and I couldn\u2019t help it. I wasn\u2019t mentally right.\u201d Upon questioning by the trial court, defendant testified that he \u201cwill never do \u2014 [he] will never be involved in anything illegal in [his] life again, ever.\u201d He again expressed his remorse for the incident.</p> <p id=\"b695-4\" pgmap=\"695\">After considering the testimony and arguments of counsel, the trial court noted, and the parties agreed, that section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(b) of the Unified Code of Corrections (Unified Code) (Ill. Rev. St'at. 1991, ch. 38, par. 1005 \u2014 8\u20144(b)) (\u201cThe court shall not impose a consecutive sentence except as provided for in subsection (a) unless, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and character of the defendant, it is of the opinion that such a term is required to protect the public from further criminal conduct by the defendant, the basis for which the court shall set forth in the record\u201d) governed the decision. In announcing its decision, the court found as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b695-5\" pgmap=\"695\">\u201cNow, having said that, said all of that, we are now 17 years later, 17 years where it\u2019s undoubtedly you have been sitting in a federal cell during that time. I have to weigh and measure what you told me on the witness stand I should believe that the public should believe *** that they\u2019re safe and will remain safe in the course of this.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b695-6\" pgmap=\"695\">What I look to in the process of making that determination today, as compared to 17 years ago, is that, in fact, you went into the federal system and you not only sat in a cell, but you also had no problems, other than the one incident that was, that you testified to, the one incident while in custody.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b695-7\" pgmap=\"695\">You sought education, got education in the process of doing that. You kept contact with your family, and I\u2019m going to address that here in just a very brief moment.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b695-8\" pgmap=\"695\">How it would have appeared from the public perspective, my perspective, had you taken the time, whether it be one year, five years, 10 years down the road, 15 years down the road to have just written one line and addressed a letter to each of your brother and your ex-sister-in-law and said [\u2018]I\u2019m sorry. [\u2019] ^ $</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b695-10\" pgmap=\"695\">*** [T]he thing that probably affects me as much as anything is the fact that there\u2019s a lady sitting behind you who for 17 years, 17 years, has believed in you, has believed that there is the right character factors in you that when everything else is revealed, spread apart, that you won\u2019t do this again, that the two of you can have a meaningful life.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b695-11\" pgmap=\"695\">I believe she is sincere, and I believe that she is not diluting [sic] herself, and in large part[,] I base the decision that I am going\u2014 about to tell you about, and I think you can see what it is, on that.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b696-4\" pgmap=\"696\">Mr. Flaugher, if I\u2019m wrong, it will weigh heavy on me. It truly will because I take my job seriously here. And it will weigh heavy in the sense that I have misread. I have misread, and that\u2019s something that I try very hard [not] to do, and I misread you, and I misread the things that are going on around you at this point in time.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b696-5\" pgmap=\"696\">So, for the reasons stated, I find that under the statute this should be a concurrent sentence, that you should receive credit for the time served in the Federal Department of Corrections, that you will be committed to the Illinois Department of Corrections so that they can administratively process you in and then, in turn, if they \u2014 as they find their credit, apply the credit that the court has directed, that you should in turn be released on the three[-]year mandatory supervised release.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b696-6\" pgmap=\"696\">You are not going free today, but it\u2019s my belief that that will take place shortly.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b696-7\" pgmap=\"696\">The court indicated that defendant would receive credit for time spent in federal custody beginning May 30, 1991.</p> <p id=\"b696-8\" pgmap=\"696\">On June 24, 2008, the trial court entered a written order finding as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b696-9\" pgmap=\"696\">\u201cCause coming on for hearing on defendant[\u2019]s motion to re[ ]consider sentence herein. Evidence presented. Court finds said sentence should [run] concurrent with federal sentence heretofore entered. Court finds further protection of the public is not necessary and defendant poses no threat to safety of other persons.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b696-10\" pgmap=\"696\">That credit should be granted for time served in federal prison and defendant should be remanded to Illinois] Department] of Corrections for computation of good time since May 30, 1991, mittimus to issue, until June 12, 2008[,] through June 24, 2008[,] as corrected.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b696-11\" pgmap=\"696\">On June 24, 2008, an amended sentencing judgment was entered indicating that defendant had been sentenced to two 15-year prison terms to be served concurrently to each other and to defendant\u2019s federal sentence. This appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b696-12\" pgmap=\"696\">II. ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b696-13\" pgmap=\"696(75) 697(46)\">The primary issue presented in this appeal is whether the trial court had jurisdiction in 2008 to reconsider the sentence imposed upon defendant in 1991. The State first argues that the court did not have jurisdiction because defendant\u2019s motion was untimely, and therefore, the June 2008 amended sentencing judgment is void. A trial court normally loses subject-matter jurisdiction 30 days after a sentence is imposed. People v. Flowers, 208 Ill. 2d 291, 303, 802 N.E.2d 1174, 1181 (2003). However, pursuant to section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) of the Unified Code (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) (West 2006)), a section which specifically addresses the issue presented, the court was revested with subject-matter jurisdiction and the authority to reconsider defendant\u2019s 1991 sentence.</p> <p id=\"b697-4\" pgmap=\"697\"> Section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) of the Unified Code (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) (West 2006)) provides as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b697-5\" pgmap=\"697\">\u201cA defendant who has a previous and unexpired sentence of imprisonment imposed by an Illinois circuit court for a crime in this [s]tate and who is subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment by another state or by any district court of the United States and who has served a term of imprisonment imposed by the other state or district court of the United States, and must return to serve the unexpired prior sentence imposed by the Illinois [c]ircuit [c]ourt may apply to the court which imposed sentence to have his sentence reduced.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b697-6\" pgmap=\"697\">The circuit court may order that any time served on the sentence imposed by the other state or district court of the United States be credited on his Illinois sentence. Such application for reduction of a sentence under this subsection (f) shall be made within 30 days after the defendant has completed the sentence imposed by the other state or district court of the United States.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b697-7\" pgmap=\"697\">In People v. Bainter, 126 Ill. 2d 292, 296, 533 N.E.2d 1066, 1067 (1989), the supreme court addressed the issue of whether the legislature violated the separation-of-powers clause of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. II, \u00a71) by enacting subsection (f) \u2014 a section which appears to revest the trial courts with jurisdiction over otherwise final judgments. The court held that the section was constitutional and did not violate separation of powers. Bainter, 126 Ill. 2d at 305, 533 N.E.2d at 1071. The legislature properly exercised its authority in enacting subsection (f). According to the court, the legislature realized that \u201cspecial circumstances may arise in which the interests of finality are lessened and the circuit court should be re-vested with jurisdiction over a previously determined matter. The subsequent imposition of a sentence in another jurisdiction is the type of circumstance that may warrant the expansion of the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Bainter, 126 Ill. 2d at 305, 533 N.E.2d at 1071.</p> <p id=\"b697-8\" pgmap=\"697(79) 698(37)\">Such is the case here. The subsequent imposition of defendant\u2019s federal sentence was a \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d that allowed the trial court to regain jurisdiction over the sentence imposed 17 years earlier. Pursuant to the relevant statute, defendant had 30 days after he completed his federal sentence to seek the relief he requested in state court. See 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) (West 2006). Defendant filed his motion two months prior to his release, and the court began conducting the hearing five days after his release. The court entered its order within 30 days of defendant\u2019s release from federal prison. We find his motion was timely and note that the State never raised a timeliness issue.</p> <p id=\"b698-4\" pgmap=\"698\">Despite the fact that neither defendant\u2019s motion nor the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion relied on section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) (West 2006)), we nevertheless hold that the court had the proper authority to consider the matter. The court allowed defendant to receive credit on his Illinois sentence for time served in federal prison \u2014 the exact remedy contemplated in section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f). See 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) (West 2006).</p> <p id=\"b698-5\" pgmap=\"698\">According to the Unified Code, a defendant has two opportunities to seek the relief he requested, that of having the trial court review a state-court sentence upon the subsequent imposition of a foreign sentence. See 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(a), 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) (West 2006); see also Bainter, 126 Ill. 2d at 299-305, 533 N.E.2d at 1068-71. Section 5 \u2014 8\u2014 4(a) allows a trial court to order that an Illinois sentence run concurrently with a subsequently imposed foreign sentence if the defendant applies for such relief within 30 days after the defendant\u2019s foreign sentence is finalized. 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(a) (West 2006). However, section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f), as previously stated, allows a trial court to award credit on an Illinois sentence for time served in a foreign penitentiary if the defendant applies for such relief within 30 days after he has completed his foreign sentence. 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) (West 2006). Based solely on the timing of defendant\u2019s motion in this case, we find the trial court proceeded under section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f), rather than section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(a), and properly considered the matter presented.</p> <blockquote id=\"b698-6\" pgmap=\"698\">\u201cWhen a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant by an Illinois circuit court and the defendant is subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment by another state or by a district court of the United States, the Illinois circuit court which imposed the sentence may order that the Illinois sentence be made concurrent with the sentence imposed by the other state or district court of the United States. The defendant must apply to the circuit court within 30 days after the defendant\u2019s sentence imposed by the other state or district of the United States is finalized.\u201d 730 ILCS 5/5\u2014 8 \u2014 4(a) (West 2006).</blockquote> <p id=\"b698-7\" pgmap=\"698(67) 699(111)\"> We find the trial court had the statutory authority pursuant to section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) of the Unified Code (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) (West 2006)) to consider whether defendant should receive credit for time served in federal prison against his state-imposed sentence. However, we find no authority in the Unified Code that would allow the court to modify defendant\u2019s Illinois sentence as imposed, from two consecutive 15-year prison terms to two concurrent 15-year prison terms. The authority to \u201creduce\u201d a defendant\u2019s sentence as set forth in section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) refers only to the court\u2019s discretion of allowing a defendant to receive credit for time spent incarcerated in a foreign prison. See 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) (West 2006). Neither this section nor any other section in the Unified Code authorizes a court to reduce the state sentence itself, beyond 30 days from the date the sentence was imposed. See 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(c) (West 2006) (the court may reduce a sentence upon a defendant\u2019s motion filed within 30 days of the imposition of the sentence).</p> <p id=\"b699-4\" pgmap=\"699\">Because Judge Pezman made a finding that defendant\u2019s conduct resulted in great bodily harm, defendant\u2019s two sentences were required to run consecutively to each other. In October 1991, the sentencing court ordered defendant\u2019s two state sentences to run consecutively to each other due to the severe bodily injury suffered by Dorothy. See 111. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 38, par. 1005 \u2014 8\u20144(a). That sentencing judgment was not amended within 30 days of its entry, and it remains in force today. Therefore, we find that the court erred in ordering defendant\u2019s two consecutive 15-year prison terms for attempt (first degree murder) to run concurrently with each other. The court lacked the jurisdiction to enter that order.</p> <p id=\"b699-5\" pgmap=\"699\">Moreover, while the trial court did have jurisdiction to consider whether defendant should be given credit on his Calhoun County sentences for time served in federal prison, the State claims that the court was without discretion to reconsider the sentence in such a manner because section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) of the Unified Code (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) (West 2006)) mandated that the three sentences (state and federal) be imposed to run consecutively.</p> <p id=\"b699-6\" pgmap=\"699\">Subsection (h) provides as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b699-7\" pgmap=\"699\">\u201cIf a person charged with a felony commits a separate felony while on pre[ ]trial release or in pretrial detention in a county jail facility or county detention facility, the sentences imposed upon conviction of these felonies shall be served consecutively regardless of the order in which the judgments of conviction are entered.\u201d 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) (West 2006).</blockquote> <p id=\"b699-8\" pgmap=\"699(85) 700(15)\">As the State admits, no published decisions apply to the mandatory-consecutive-sentencing provision of section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) to federal felonies committed while on pretrial release on a state charge. However, we note that the supreme court has applied the provisions of section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) when a subsequent felony was committed in another state. See People v. Clark, 183 Ill. 2d 261, 266, 700 N.E.2d 1039, 1042 (1998) (trial court lacked authority to sentence the defendant to the agreed-upon six-year prison term as a concurrent sentence when he committed a felony in the State of Missouri while on pretrial release).</p> <p id=\"b700-3\" pgmap=\"700\">Defendant claims section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) (West 2006)) \u201cis not applicable because nothing in the record supports the fact that the [defendant committed an offense while on bond as well as the fact the federal charges fall under federal sentencing guidelines.\u201d According to Carson, 9 F.3d at 580-81 (the Seventh Circuit\u2019s opinion from defendant\u2019s federal case), defendant committed the federal felonies while on pretrial release in the case sub judice. Further, defendant provides no authority for the second part of his argument that the statute does not apply because federal sentencing guidelines apply.</p> <p id=\"b700-4\" pgmap=\"700\">The law is clear that sentences that are statutorily mandated to run consecutively are void if they have been ordered to run concurrently. Indeed, this court recently noted as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b700-5\" pgmap=\"700\">\u201cWhere sentences are mandatorily consecutive and the defendant is sentenced to concurrent sentences, the sentences are void and the remedy is to remand for imposition of consecutive sentences. [Citation.] When a trial court\u2019s decision to impose concurrent prison terms is deemed void, the appellate court has the authority to correct the sentence and the appellate court is not barred from doing so by supreme court rules limiting the State\u2019s right to appeal or prohibiting the appellate court from increasing a defendant\u2019s sentence. [Citation.] Thus, we can, if we so desire, remand simply for the trial court to amend its sentencing order to make sentences already given consecutive. [Citation.]\u201d People v. Davison, 378 Ill.

He was arrested for federal charges on November 30, 1990, as a result of a drug-trafficking sting operation. The federal authorities -witnessed defendant participating in the operation on the day of his arrest. Defendant committed the separate federal felony while on pretrial release on his state court charges. The chronological order of the entry of the convictions and respective sentences is of no consequence to the applicability of section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h). See People v. Williams, 184 Ill. App. 3d 1094, 1096, 540 N.E.2d 832, 833 (1989).</p> <p id=\"b700-8\" pgmap=\"700(47) 701(139)\">Pursuant to the plain language of section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) of the Unified Code (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) (West 2006)), defendant was subject to mandatory consecutive sentences. In relying on section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(b) (finding protection of public is not necessary and defendant poses no threat to safety of other persons) to find defendant\u2019s sentences should run concurrently to each other and concurrently to the federal sentence, the trial court erred, because this provision only applies to nonmandatory consecutive situations. Public safety or other factors are not considered where the statute mandates imposition of consecutive sentences. Because Judge Pezman made a finding of great bodily harm, consecutive sentences were mandated on the state charges. Because defendant was on pretrial release when he committed the federal charge, consecutive sentencing was mandated for that offense also. Thus section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(b) had no application here. We vacate the trial court\u2019s amended sentencing judgment and remand for the entry of an amended judgment, making the state sentences consecutive to each other and consecutive to his federal sentence, with no credit for time served in federal custody.</p> <p id=\"b701-4\" pgmap=\"701\">III.

The trial court here correctly applied the law even in the face of a maze of confusing sentencing statutes. I would affirm the trial court on any number of grounds. The trial court lacked jurisdiction to increase defendant\u2019s sentence for committing a felony while on bond because the original judge stayed the mittimus, that is, sentencing judgment, for 17 years, rendering the order void and causing the court to lose jurisdiction to enforce it. Alternatively, the trial court did not, as the majority maintains, make the state consecutive sentences concurrent to each other, although the court did have the authority to reduce those sentences. Further, the court properly granted defendant credit for time served on the federal sentence.</p> <p id=\"b701-10\" pgmap=\"701\">I. STAYING THE SENTENCING JUDGMENT FOR 17 YEARS RENDERED THE ORDER VOID</p> <p id=\"b701-11\" pgmap=\"701(53) 702(15)\">The October 11, 1991, sentencing order, which was stayed for 17 years, is void. The original trial judge, Alfred Pezman, should not have stayed the written sentencing judgment for 17 years. Judge Pezman should have entered judgment and issued a warrant requiring the federal authorities to turn defendant over to the Illinois authorities upon completion of his sentence. The court lacked the authority to suspend the judgment indefinitely:</p> <blockquote id=\"b702-3\" pgmap=\"702\">\u201cThe effective administration of the criminal law requires that one who pleads guilty or is convicted of a violation of the law shall be promptly and certainly punished, and no court has authority to suspend sentence indefinitely in such a case. It is the duty of the court to pronounce judgment at the term at which the conviction is had, unless upon a motion for a new trial, in arrest of judgment[,] or for other cause the case is continued for further adjudication, and the defendant, by recognizance or being held in custody, is still required to answer the charge. If sentence is indefinitely suspended[,] the court loses jurisdiction, and a judgment subsequently entered is void. (People [ex rel. Smith] v. Allen, 155 Ill. 61[, 65, 39 N.E. 568, 569 (1895)]; People [ex rel. Boenert] v. Barrett, 202 [Ill.] 287[, 298, 67 N.E. 23, 27 (1903)].) The court, by reserving judgment for an indefinite period as to the seven counts, lost jurisdiction as to them, but the mittimus was issued upon the judgment properly entered as to the first five counts[,] and the court did not lose jurisdiction by any postponement of sentence.\u201d People ex rel. Fensky v. Leinecke, 290 Ill. 560, 562-63, 125 N.E. 513, 514 (1919).</blockquote> <p id=\"A4r\" pgmap=\"702\">See also People v.

The stay of the sentencing judgment is what the majority relies upon to assume jurisdiction to impose the mandatorily consecutive state sentences to the federal sentence. Only section 5 \u2014 8\u2014-1(f) of the Unified Code affords the trial court here with jurisdiction. The trial court had authority to reduce defendant\u2019s state court sentences within 30 days of completion of the federal sentence or order his Illinois sentence to run concurrently to his just-completed federal court sentence within 30 days of completion of the federal sentence. That is a very limited jurisdiction and not authority to resentence defendant to a mandatorily consecutive sentence which has never been imposed \u2014 or even considered \u2014 by the original sentencing judge, the judge at the section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) reconsideration hearing, or the attorneys at the hearing and even on appeal.</p> <p id=\"b702-4\" pgmap=\"702\">II.

Trial Court Did Not Make the State Sentences Concurrent to Each Other</p> <p id=\"b702-7\" pgmap=\"702(21) 703(73)\">The majority and the State erroneously assert the trial court made the two state court sentences concurrent to each other. Defendant\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment asked only that \u201cthe State charges run concurrent [ly] with any sentence imposed in the [flederal charges.\u201d Defendant does not argue on appeal for the two state court sentences to run concurrently to each, nor does the record support such a finding. Judge Greenlief s handwritten order and the docket entry therefor both order the complete consecutive state sentence to run concurrently with the federal. The handwritten order provided:</p> <blockquote id=\"b703-4\" pgmap=\"703\">\u201cCause coming on for hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to re[ ]consider sentence herein. Evidence presented.

There was nothing he did that had \u2014 that he had any authority to do, other than issue his mittimus, which he did, and he said in the sentencing that the sentence must, by statute, be consecutive due to the nature of the injuries and the nature of the offense, the type of crimes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b704-4\" pgmap=\"704\">THE COURT: These two together?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b704-5\" pgmap=\"704\">MR.

We had no way of knowing when we would be here.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b704-8\" pgmap=\"704\">But, the fact remains that all those federal years that Mr. Flaugher got he got for a completely unrelated crime in an unrelated jurisdiction in an unrelated incident, and he wants us to give him credit and ignore what happened in Calhoun County? Is the court giving no efficacy to the fact that two people\u2019s lives were severely impacted by the criminal conduct of this defendant?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b704-9\" pgmap=\"704\">Defendant never has answered for that if he does not do any time in the state court. For that reason[,] we ask the court to apply justice and apply law, and the fact that I think the victims have indicated they still continue to fear for their lives and their safety that the sentences still need to be served in the [Sjtate of Illinois.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b704-10\" pgmap=\"704\">THE COURT: Mr. Fanning, I will ask you, and I will give you the opportunity to further argue, but in the same respect, I will ask you, in the process, that you address the question that I just posed to Mr. Burch.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b704-11\" pgmap=\"704\">MR.

Finally, \u201c[wjhile penal statutes are to be strictly construed in favor of an accused, they must not be construed so rigidly as to defeat the intent of the legislature.\u201d Parker, 123 Ill. 2d at 213, 526 N.E.2d at 139. \u201c[W]e are not bound by the literal language of a statute if that language produces absurd or unjust results not contemplated by the legislature.\u201d In re Donald A.G., 221 Ill. 2d 234, 246, 850 N.E.2d 172, 179 (2006). Here, the statute provides that the trial court can reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. This makes sense, given that after the federal sentence has been served, the state court has additional factors it can consider in sentencing: whether the federal trial court sentenced defendant to a lengthier sentence due to the state conviction, defendant\u2019s behavior while imprisoned, etc.</p> <p id=\"b708-7\" pgmap=\"708\">Moreover, the revestment doctrine may apply here to give the trial court jurisdiction to reconsider the state sentences. \u201cA trial court loses jurisdiction to vacate or modify its judgment 30 days after entry of judgment unless a timely postjudgment motion is filed.\u201d People v. Minniti, 373 Ill. App. 3d 55, 65, 867 N.E.2d 1237, 1246 (2007).

App. 3d at 65, 867 N.E.2d at 1246. The revestment doctrine has only been \u201capplied where the circuit court loses jurisdiction over a matter because of the passage of time after a judgment.\u201d Wierzbicki v. Gleason, 388 Ill. App. 3d 921, 928, 906 N.E.2d 7, 15 (2009) (refusing to apply the revestment doctrine outside the situation where a trial court loses jurisdiction because of the expiration of 30 days after judgment; the appellate court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the revestment doctrine made an order entered after the notice of appeal was filed valid when the appeal was dismissed). Here, defendant\u2019s motion for a declaratory judgment (which the trial court essentially treated as a motion to reconsider sentence) was an untimely postjudgment motion.</p> <p id=\"b709-3\" pgmap=\"709\">Under the revestment doctrine, the parties can revest a court with jurisdiction so long as (1) the court has general jurisdiction over the matter, (2) the parties actively participate without objection, and (3) the proceedings are inconsistent with the merits of the prior judgment. Minniti, 373 Ill. App. 3d at 65, 867 N.E.2d at 1246 (applying the revestment doctrine where the defendant filed an untimely postjudgment motion but the State appeared at the hearing and failed to object to the untimeliness of the motion; due to revestment, the notice of appeal filed within 30 days of the ruling on the untimely postjudgment motion vested the appellate court with jurisdiction); see also People v. Price, 364 Ill. App. 3d 543, 546, 846 N.E.2d 1003, 1006 (2006) (noting the rationale \u201cis that the trial court considers the benefitting party to have ignored the judgment and started to retry the case [citation], the benefitting party by its conduct consents to have the prior ruling set aside [citation], or that the benefitting party by its conduct waives the right to question the jurisdiction of the court [citation]\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b709-4\" pgmap=\"709\">The revestment-doctrine factors are present here. The trial court had general jurisdiction over the matter. The parties actively participated in the hearing. In fact, the State called the two victims to testify on the issue of whether consecutive terms were required to protect the public. By participating and not objecting to the hearing, the prosecutor essentially acknowledged that the prior sentencing judgment should be revisited. See Minniti, 373 Ill. App. 3d at 67, 867 N.E.2d at 1248, citing People v. Gargani, 371 Ill. App. 3d 729, 732, 863 N.E.2d 762, 766 (2007) (finding the trial court was revested with jurisdiction to hear an untimely posttrial motion where the State actively participated in the hearing without objecting to the untimeliness of the motion). Therefore, the parties revested the trial court with jurisdiction to reconsider the state sentences imposed.</p> <p id=\"b709-5\" pgmap=\"709\">Alternatively, if the trial court had the authority to stay the sentencing judgment and the length of the stay did not deprive the court of jurisdiction, the trial court retained jurisdiction here.</p> <blockquote id=\"b709-6\" pgmap=\"709(127) 710(61)\">\u201cWhen a person accused of a crime has been convicted, sentenced!,] and delivered into the custody of the proper officer of the penitentiary under a mittimus, the court rendering the judgment and imposing the sentence loses jurisdiction over the case and is without power to vacate, set aside[,] or modify the judgment! ] (People v.

Hamel, 392 Ill. 415, [64 N.E.2d 865 (1946)])[,] and the filing of a motion to vacate does not have the effect of staying the mittimus even though the motion is filed before the defendant is delivered to the penitentiary. (People ex rel. Swanson v. Williams, 352 Ill. 227[, 185 N.E. 598 (1933)].) In this case, as in Swanson, no motion for a stay of mittimus was filed and defendant was delivered to the penitentiary while the mittimus was in full force and effect. The judgment having been executed, the trial court was without power to set it aside and an order to that effect would have been a nullity.\u201d People v. Wakeland, 15 Ill. 2d 265, 269, 154 N.E.2d 245, 248 (1958).</blockquote> <p id=\"b710-4\" pgmap=\"710\">Here, the judgment was never executed. Therefore, the trial court had jurisdiction to reconsider the sentence. At the very least, this court should remand for the trial court to determine whether the state sentences should be reduced.</p> <p id=\"b710-5\" pgmap=\"710\">C. Trial Court Had the Authority To Make the State Sentences Concurrent to the Federal Sentences</p> <p id=\"A-S\" pgmap=\"710\">In 1991, the trial court made no mention about whether the state sentences would be served concurrently or consecutively to the federal sentence that had not yet been imposed. Such an order would have been improper. See People ex rel. Middleton v. MacDonald, 85 Ill. App. 3d 982, 984, 407 N.E.2d 775, 776-77 (1980). In 2008, the court ordered that defendant receive credit on his state consecutive sentences for the time served in the federal penitentiary. The new sentencing judgment provided that the state court sentences were to run concurrently with the federal sentence. Although no one cited the statute to the court, section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) of the Unified Code provides that a circuit court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence and order that any time served on the sentence imposed by the federal court be credited to the Illinois sentence. See 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) (West 2008); Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 38, par. 1005 \u2014 8\u20141(f); Ill. Rev.

State and Federal Sentences Are Presumed To Run Consecutively but a Defendant Can Petition for Concurrent Sentences</p> <p id=\"b710-8\" pgmap=\"710(141) 711(13)\">Unless stated otherwise by the trial court, two or more sentences to the Illinois penitentiary are presumed to run concurrently. People v. Boney, 128 Ill. App. 2d 170, 174, 262 N.E.2d 766, 768 (1970). In contrast, when one sentence is to a federal penitentiary and one is to an Illinois penitentiary, the sentences are presumed to run consecutively unless otherwise specified in the court\u2019s order. Boney, 128 Ill. App. 2d at 174, 262 N.E.2d at 768; see also Thomas v. Greer, 143 Ill. 2d 271, 275, 573 N.E.2d 814, 815 (1991); People ex rel. Hesley v.

Because the court\u2019s order here did not and could not specify the state sentences as consecutive to the yet-to-be imposed federal sentence, the state sentences were presumed to run consecutively to the federal sentence.</p> <p id=\"b711-3\" pgmap=\"711\">Nonetheless, a defendant can petition the state trial court for an order that the state sentences run concurrently with the federal sentence. Section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(a) of the Unified Code provides that upon imposition of the later-imposed federal sentence, the defendant may ask the state court within 30 days of federal sentencing to order the sentences to run concurrently. Section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(a) of the Unified Code provides as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b711-4\" pgmap=\"711\">\u201cWhen a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant by an Illinois circuit court and the defendant is subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment by another state or by a district court of the United States, the Illinois circuit court which imposed the sentence may order that the Illinois sentence be made concurrent with the sentence imposed by the other state or district court of the United States. The defendant must apply to the circuit court within 30 days after the defendant\u2019s sentence imposed by the other state or district of the United States is finalized.\u201d 730 ILCS 5/5\u2014 8 \u2014 4(a) (West 2006).</blockquote> <p id=\"b711-5\" pgmap=\"711\">See also Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 38, par. 1005 \u2014 8\u20144(a). Again, the trial court in 2008 noted the language about applying within 30 days for a concurrent sentence but stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b711-6\" pgmap=\"711\">\u201cI did read case law which would suggest that previous, previous to the 1991 statute in effect, that at some point this was required that the defendant bring within 30 days of the imposition of the federal sentence this matter to the circuit court\u2019s attention for a determination as to whether it should be consecutive or concurrent. That\u2019s no longer there. I don\u2019t see that as an issue. I only use that as an example in this, [defendant].\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b711-7\" pgmap=\"711\">That language is still there, so apparently the court was referring to the language in section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(a) and indicating that option (applying within 30 days of sentencing) was no longer at issue. In any event, defendant did not apply for a concurrent sentence within 30 days of his federal sentencing as required by section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(a), but he did timely apply under section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f).</p> <p id=\"b711-8\" pgmap=\"711\">Section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f) of the Unified Code allows a defendant to apply for a reduction in sentence within 30 days after the defendant has completed the sentence imposed by the other state or district court of the United States.

Sections 5 \u2014 8\u20144(a) and (b) of the Unified Code direct the trial court when it can sentence defendants to concurrent or consecutive sentences. 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(a), (b) (West 2006). Section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) of the Unified Code mandates that sentences be served consecutively when one of the felonies is committed on pretrial release. 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) (West 2006).</p> <p id=\"b712-9\" pgmap=\"712\">Sections 5 \u2014 8\u20141(e) and (f) of the Unified Code, on the other hand, are not original sentencing provisions but rather address a reconsideration of inmates\u2019 sentences who have served a sentence in a federal facility or another state and are returned to Illinois for service of an Illinois sentence. 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(e), (f) (West 2006). These provisions grant the trial court jurisdiction to revisit defendant\u2019s Illinois sentence and determine whether the Illinois sentence should be credited with time served in the other jurisdiction.</p> <p id=\"b712-10\" pgmap=\"712\">Defendant here timely applied to the trial court and requested his Illinois sentence run concurrently to his federal sentence. The court granted that request after extensive evidence and deliberation.

There, the circuit court was required to order the escape sentence to run consecutively to the crime for which the defendant was detained. However, Greer does not address section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(e) or section 5 \u2014 8\u20141(f), which permit the trial court to order the federal and state sentences to run concurrently, no doubt because Greer\u2019s multiple sentences were imposed in 1978, at a time when the statute which revests the court with jurisdiction to award credit for federal time served addressed only other states\u2019 convictions and not other federal convictions:</p> <blockquote id=\"b713-4\" pgmap=\"713\">\u201cA defendant who has a previous and unexpired sentence of imprisonment imposed by another state[,] and who after sentence for a crime in Illinois must return to service the unexpired prior sentenceE,] may have his sentence by the Illinois court ordered to be concurrent with the prior sentence in the other state[,] and the court may order that any time served on the unexpired portion of the sentence in the other state prior to his return to Illinois shall be credited on his Illinois sentence.

Wilson, 181 Ill. 2d at 411-12[, 692 N.E.2d at 1108]. Like the defendant in Wilson, defendant here committed the other felonies while he was out on bond from the original felony with which he was charged.

Further, the court does not indicate when the defendant was sentenced in Missouri. \u201cWhile on [pretrial] release, however, [the] defendant committed other felonies in the State of Missouri and ultimately received a four-year term of imprisonment there.\u201d Clark, 183 Ill. 2d at 263, 700 N.E.2d at 1040.

(Previously imposed federal/ other state felony convictions must still run concurrently.) The new section is now entitled by the legislature \u201c(e) CONSECUTIVE TERMS; SUBSEQUENT NON-ILLINOIS TERM.\u201d</p> <blockquote id=\"b715-9\" pgmap=\"715\">\u201cIf an Illinois court has imposed a sentence of imprisonment on a defendant and the defendant is subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a court of another state or a federal court, then the Illinois sentence shall run consecutively to the sentence imposed by the court of the other state or the federal court. That same Illinois court, however, may order that the Illinois sentence run concurrently with the sentence imposed by the court of the other state or the federal court, but only if the defendant applies to that same Illinois court within 30 days after the sentence imposed by the court of the other state or the federal court is finalized.\u201d 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(e) (West 2008).</blockquote> <p id=\"b715-10\" pgmap=\"715\">The statutory language here makes clear that the Illinois sentence shall run consecutively to a subsequent federal sentence unless the Illinois court orders they run concurrently. (The provision for reconsideration of this issue upon release from federal custody has concededly been stricken. However, defendant may select which sentencing statute to proceed under and he has selected the former version. See People v. Hollins, 51 Ill. 2d 68, 71, 280 N.E.2d 710, 712 (1972).)</p> <p id=\"b715-11\" pgmap=\"715(62) 716(49)\">This amendment did not change section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) (West 2006)) regarding a felony committed while on bail but did move that provision to subsection 5 \u2014 8\u20144(d)(9) (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(d)(9) (West 2008)), entitled \u201cCONSECUTIVE TERMS; MANDATORY.\u201d These changes indicate that the previous language about a subsequently committed felony while out on bond refers only to a state court felony \u2014 not a federal offense as here. Section 5 \u2014 8\u2014 4(e) (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(e) (West 2008)), \u201cCONSECUTIVE TERMS; SUBSEQUENT NON-ILLINOIS TERM,\u201d again permits the trial court to run those sentences concurrently. Otherwise, the subsequent federal and state court convictions run consecutively.</p> <p id=\"b716-4\" pgmap=\"716\">Still, recognizing the cautious use of legislative intent so gleaned, the original statutory language expressed this very same intent. First, the statutory scheme set up in sections 5 \u2014 8\u20141 and 5 \u2014 8\u20144 of the Unified Code shows the legislature clearly recognized the difference between state and federal convictions. In fact, in light of People ex rel. Middleton v. MacDonald, 85 Ill. App. 3d 982, 407 N.E.2d 775 (1980), the legislature amended section 5 \u2014 8\u20144 to grant Illinois state courts the authority to reconsider its sentence within 30 days of a subsequent federal or other state sentence.</p> <p id=\"b716-5\" pgmap=\"716\">Sections 5 \u2014 8\u20141 and 5 \u2014 8\u20144 of the Unified Code are very specific when mentioning other state or federal offenses. Nowhere is that language about \u201csubsequent federal or other states\u2019 sentence\u201d used in section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) of the Unified Code; only the word \u201cfelony\u201d is used. The word \u201cfelony\u201d does not include offenses committed in other jurisdictions contrary to the implication of Clark and People v. Palmer, 204 Ill. App. 3d 878, 562 N.E.2d 375 (1990).</p> <blockquote id=\"b716-6\" pgmap=\"716\">\u201cThe [Unified] Code defines \u2018felony\u2019 as \u2018an offense for which a sentence to death or to a term of imprisonment in a penitentiary for one year or more is provided.\u2019 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 38, par. 2-7.) \u2018Offense\u2019 is defined as \u2018a violation of any penal statute of this State.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 38, par. 2-12.\u201d Palmer, 204 Ill. App. 3d at 880, 562 N.E.2d at 376.</blockquote> <p id=\"b716-7\" pgmap=\"716\">The \u201cfelony\u201d in section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) of the Unified Code is not an offense committed in another state or federal court. Further, the trial court would not have had jurisdiction to run the federal or other state\u2019s sentence consecutively to the Illinois sentence. Only if defendant was kept in federal custody to serve his federal sentence before his previous Illinois sentence could a defendant be required to serve his Illinois sentence consecutively to his federal sentence. Had defendant been returned to state custody to serve his Illinois sentence before his federal sentence, the trial court would have no jurisdiction or authority to determine whether the federal sentence would run consecutively. Conversely, the Illinois court had no jurisdiction or authority to run the state court sentences consecutively to a federal sentence under section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h). This statute applies only to state court felony convictions committed while on state court pretrial release.</p> <p id=\"b717-2\" pgmap=\"717\">The legislature clearly delineated while on \u201cpre[ ]trial release or in pretrial detention in a county jail facility, or county detention facility.\u201d (Emphases added.) 730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20144(h) (West 2006). In that same statute, the legislature clearly set forth that a state court judge may run a state sentence consecutively or concurrently to a sentence already imposed in another state or federal court. Here, defendant was sentenced in state court on October 4, 1991, and in federal court on June 5, 1992, so that trial judge could impose neither a consecutive nor a concurrent sentence. Perhaps he stayed the sentencing judgment to clarify or decide how to run the sentences after the federal sentence was imposed.</p> <p id=\"b717-3\" pgmap=\"717\">Regardless, if the legislature, in drafting section 5 \u2014 8\u20144(h), meant a felony in another state or the district court of the United States, the legislature was capable of and should have so stated.</p> <p id=\"b717-4\" pgmap=\"717\">Moreover, the application of the presumption of consecutive state to federal court sentences makes no sense where the defendant has yet to be sentenced to federal court.</p> <p id=\"b717-5\" pgmap=\"717\">For these reasons, I would affirm the trial court.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
