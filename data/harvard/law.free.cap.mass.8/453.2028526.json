On the same day <em>Jones </em>endorsed the note to <em>Henry. </em>In the afternoon of the 2d day of May, 1809, at <em>Boston, </em>the plaintiff presented the note to <em>Whiting </em>for payment, who said he could not pay it then, or at any time, unless the plaintiff would receive the assignment of a certain note for 500 dollars in part satisfaction, which was refused. The conversation between the parties continued until after dark. Before the post-office was closed, and after the conversation above mentioned, and after the mail for that day had gone to <em>Medway, </em>where the defendant then resided, the plaintiff put a letter into the post-office addressed to the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>giving notice of the non-payment of the note in due form. The same evening the plaintiff sent his agent, with the note and a written order to the defendant, to enable the agent to receive payment of him. On the 3d day of May, at 5 * o\u2019clock in the morning, the agent presented the note and order to the defendant, and gave notice of the presentment of the note as aforementioned to the promisor, and of his neglect to pay the contents. The defendant said he was unable to pay it, or any part of it. The agent asked if the money could be paid during that day; and was answered in the negative. The writ was then served by attaching the defendapt\u2019s real estate at 25 minutes past 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, and a summons was left on the 20th day of June following. The writ bore date the same day of the attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-5\">The cause was argued upon this report at the last March term in this county by Mr. <em>Solicitor General </em>for the plaintiff, and <em>Bigelow </em>for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-6\"><em>Bigelow </em>objected to the verdict,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARW7\">that the demand on the promisor and notice to the endorser were made too soon; and he argued that the note in this case being made payable in sixty days, without saying more, must be taken the same as if made payable in sixty days <em>from the date, </em>which would exclude the day of the date; and so the note was not payable until the 3d of May. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-7\"><em>The Solicitor General </em>contended</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGOc\">that the day of the date was regularly to be included in computing the sixty days, and he cited the case of <em>Bellasis </em>vs. <em>Hester, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> and an anonymous case in 1 <em>Lord Raym. </em>480. \u2014 He also read a certificate subscribed by several of the cashiers and clerks of the banks in <em>Boston, </em>purporting that it is the custom of the banks to include the day of the date, in computing the time when a promissory note falls due, which is made payable <em>in </em>a given number of days: thus a note bearing date on the 1st of March, payable <em>\u201c in thirty days,\u201d </em>would be held due by the custom of the banks on the 30th day of March.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-8\">But he argued that notice under the circumstances of this case was waived; or that both the promisor and endorser declaring themselves unable to pay the demand was equivalent to a waiver, since no possible inconvenience arose to the defendant from a want of due notice. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-9\">* The action stood continued to this term for advisement.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\"> 1 <em>L.

In the case at bar, the note was made payable <em>in sixty days, </em>without adding, as is customary, from the date. But the intention is apparant; and the Court will supply the omission. The meaning must be the same as in sixty days from the date; otherwise a note payable in one day would be payable immediately, which would be an absurdity. No action lies against the endorser, until after the demand made <em>on </em>the day of the maturity of the note. In this case the demand was made on the day preceding, and not on the day fixed by the parties for the payment. Let the plaintiff be called.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\n<em>Plaintiff non &lt;uit.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
