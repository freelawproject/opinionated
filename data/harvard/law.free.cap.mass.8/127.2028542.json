The replication is incon sistent with, and a departure from, the declaration. And the verdict, that the defendant promised, is an absurd and insufficient finding in an action of debt on judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-9\">\n<em>For the plaintiff,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvJ\">it was contended that the subsequent promise was a revival of the old debt; and no good reason could be given why, if the cause of action was revived, the form of the action should not be revived also. If the action had been debt on the simple contract, the evidence necessary to support it would have been the same as if it had been <em>assumpsit </em>on the promise. The bankruptcy merely suspends, but does not extinguish, the debt; the new promise destroys the bar set up by the defendant; and the verdict establishes a fact which revives the old debt. Substantial justice has been done, and there is no sufficient reason why, for any objection merely technical, and having no relation to the merits, if indeed it has any weight in it, the plaintiff should be turned over to another * action, in which the verdict and judgment must be the same as in the present action. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>Holmes </em>and <em>Baylies </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-8\"><em>B.

It is not denied that the plaintiff is entitled to an action upon the promise, grounded on the original consideration of the judgment. In such an action, the defendant would have been let in to question that consideration, which he is wholly debarred from in the present action.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\"> <em>Chitty on Pleading, </em>40. \u2014 1 <em>Lawes on </em>Pleading, 526, <em>Amer. ed. </em>\u2014 1 Selwyn, 15, 219. \u2014 <em>Peake's </em>N. <em>P.

A good collateral fact was put in issue, on which a regular judgment may be entered in the action. The pleadings are very similar to those which frequently arise under the statutes of limitation. The defendant pleads what is, <em>prima facie, </em>a legal bar to the plaintiff\u2019s demand; the plaintiff replies other matter, which shows the defendant bound, as well by law as in conscience, to pay the debt; and this matter is found for the plaintiff. There remains no reason why he should not have his judgment on the verdict. The only object of the defendant is to obtain a bill of costs, and to turn the plaintiff over to another action. The case at bar is within those cited for the plaintiff; and one of them is precisely this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
