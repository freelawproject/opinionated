In this case the plaintiffs proved, that there w'as a valid title paramount to that derived from the defendants, and that this title had already given rise to an action at law, by which the plaintiffs must inevitably lose the land. It would be a very great evil to persons thus situated, if they must lie by until an actual eviction from all the land took place, and in the mean time their warrantor might become insolvent, and so their legal remedy against him would be fruitless.</p><p id=\"A4i\">was stopped by the Court.</p><p id=\"b222-9\">The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, perceiving that the Court were not inclined to set aside the verdict, had leave to discontinue, in order to bring their action after they should be evicted from the premises con veyed. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
