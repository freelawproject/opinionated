It was also contained in the policy, that it was understood that all risks of every name and nature (bad debts and illicit trade excepted) were included in the policy; that the vessel, though cleared for <em>Tonningen, </em>was intended for some port in <em>Holland, </em>or wherever else the master should deem proper, in case he could not get into <em>Holland; </em>that by illicit trade in the policy was understood an infraction of the municipal laws ; but the assured was to take the risk of <em>French </em>and <em>Dutch </em>decrees against <em>American </em>commerce; at a premium of twenty-five per cent., to return ten per cent, if from any cause the vessel should not discharge in <em>Holland, </em>or any blockaded port, and there should be no loss on the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-6\">The declaration contained a second count for 15,000 dollars paid, laid out and expended by the plaintiffs to the use of the defend ant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-7\">* The action was tried before <em>the Chief Justice, </em>who reported the following facts as appearing in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-8\">The schooner with her said cargo sailed from <em>Boston </em>on the 28th of March, 1810, and proceeded on her said voyage; and having escaped the <em>British </em>blockade of <em>Holland, </em>went so far up the <em>Maese </em>that she might have gone to <em>Botterdam, </em>to which she was then proceeding, secure from capture by any <em>British </em>cruiser or any blockading force. But the master being there informed by his owners\u2019 correspondent in <em>Botterdam, </em>that if he entered that port with his vessel, he would not be permitted to enter or land his cargo there, or in any port in <em>Holland; </em>and that his vessel and cargo would be seized and confiscated, if they were discovered by the <em>French </em>guards or custom-house officers; and there being imminent danger thereof, he immediately proceeded, with said schooner and cargo, for <em>Gottenhurg, </em>to ascertain whether his cargo could be sold there to advantage, and if not, to what market in the north of <em>Europe </em>it would be best to carry it. He arrived at <em>Gottenhurg </em>on the 13th of June, and remained there until the 21st of the same month; when he left <em>Gottenhurg, </em>with the schooner and cargo, to proceed for a market in the Baltic. On the day follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ing he was captured by a <em>Danish </em>privateer, and carried into <em>Copenhagen, </em>where he arrived on the 26th of said month, and where the vessel and cargo were libelled as prize, and after an acquittal at the Lower Court, were condemned on the appeal. Some money was expended by the plaintiffs in claiming the cargo at <em>Copenhagen. </em>The plaintiffs had property on board, in the articles mentioned in the policy, to the amount thereby insured. Those articles were the produce of a <em>Dutch </em>colony, and commanded a higher price in the <em>Boston </em>market, because such property was thought more secure from condemnation in <em>Holland </em>than similar articles not the produce of a <em>Dutch </em>colony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-5\">The counsel for the defendant contended on the trial: \u2014 First, that by the true construction of the policy upon the * facts proved in the case, the voyage insured terminated in <em>Holland. </em>Secondly, that if the master was authorized to leave the coast of <em>Holland, </em>yet by the true construction of the policy upon the facts proved, the voyage insured terminated in <em>Gottenburg.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-6\">These points were overruled by <em>the Chief Justice, </em>and a verdict was taken for the plaintiffs for 16,405 dollars 60 cents. Whereupon the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a new trial for the misdirection of the judge on the points aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-7\">If the direction aforesaid was erroneous, the verdict was to be set aside, and a new trial granted\"; otherwise' judgment to be rendered on the verdict for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-8\"><em>Hall </em>and <em>Dexter </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_3G\">By the <em>port of discharge </em>in the policy must be understood the port, at which the vessel may be able to discharge. The insurance was to some port in <em>Holland, </em>\u2019unless the vessel was unable to gain such port, being prevented by a blockading force. But not being so prevented, the risk terminated on the safe arrival of the property in the river <em>Maese. </em>The leaving that port exposed the property to another risk from the blockading squadron, and was a deviation not from necessity, but merely from apprehension of danger, which is no excuse for a deviation. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-9\">But admitting the departure from <em>Holland </em>to have been from necessity, and that the policy covered the property to <em>Gottenburg, </em>the voyage must clearly be held to be at an end at this latter place. The policy contemplated but one port of discharge, that is any port where the cargo might be safely discharged, and this without any regard to the state of the market at such port, whether good or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>bad. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> This expression, port of discharge, is novel, as applied to a port in a foreign country, although usual in relation to the return voyage to the <em>United States, </em>in which cases it has never been understood that the vessel has a right to range from port to port to find a convenient market for her cargo. A voyage insured must have some limits either * of time or place. But if we are wrong in considering <em>Gottenburg </em>the end of this voyage under the policy in question, the voyage had no limits. The vessel might have gone to every port in <em>Europe, </em>and still have been protected by the policy. Such a construction is unreasonable in the extreme.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-5\"><em>Prescott </em>and <em>Jackson </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A676\">By port of discharge in the policy was intended the port where the vessel should begin to discharge. If the expression had been, as is not unfrequent, port or ports of discharge, we should contend that the cargo might have been partly discharged in one port and partly in another. If the intention of the parties to this policy had been to confine the voyage to one port, and oblige the master there to unlade, such port would have been named, instead of the general phrase, port of discharge, as the intention of the voyage is well known at the vessel\u2019s departure. By being able to get into <em>Holland, </em>must be understood an ability to get in for the purposes of the voyage, not merely that there should be no physical impossibility. The certainty of a total loss of the property, had the vessel proceeded to <em>Rotterdam, </em>was tantamount to the seizure by a blockading force. There was no opportunity, afforded while the vessel was in <em>Holland, </em>to learn the state of the markets, or to determine in what port to discharge. It was therefore within the fair and reasonable construction of the policy, that the vessel should have liberty to go to <em>Gottenburg, </em>or any other port, to obtain the necessary information, and that having obtained it, she should still be protected by the policy in proceeding to the port elected as the port of discharge. There was then no deviation, either in going to <em>Gottenburg, </em>or in proceeding from thence to a suitable market.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b440-10\"><em> Richardson </em>vs. <em>Maine Fire and Marine Insurance Company, </em>6 <em>Mass Rep 102.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> <em>Lee &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Gray, </em>7 <em>Mass.

But our opinion is, that by <em>getting into Holland, </em>as used in this policy, must be understood getting in for some beneficial purpose, as the sale and delivery of the cargo, which was known to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>be the sole object of the voyage. The master had a right, and it was his duty, after receiving the information which he had from the correspondent of the plaintiffs at <em>Rotterdam, </em>to depart from the <em>Macse, </em>and seek some other port to discharge his cargo, as it would have been his duty to do, in case he had been boarded and warned to depart by a blockading squadron or ship, on his approaching the river. It would have been as wicked as imprudent for him under the circumstances, to have pursued his route to <em>Rotterdam. </em>This objection therefore cannot prevail. The <em>second </em>objection is, that even if the master had a right to leave <em>Holland </em>under the existing circumstances, yet that the policy having limited the voyage to one port only, the vessel must have discharged at <em>Gottenburg, </em>and that the voyage contemplated by the policy must cease there. The determination of this objection depends on the construction to be given to the words \u201c port of discharge.\u201d As it appears that the policy was made some time after the vessel had sailed, it is presumable that no particular port of destination had been fixed upon previously to her sailing, and that it was left to the discretion of the master or supercargo to what port he should go. If he had broken bulk, or begun to unlade at <em>Gottenburg, </em>that must have been considered he port of discharge, and the voyage would have ended there within the policy. But we think, and in this opinion we are confirmed by that of several eminent underwriters of whom we have inquired, that when property is insured to a port of discharge, the assured has a right to obtain advice at his port of arrival respecting the markets, and having informed himself, has a right to proceed to such port as promises the best sales, and is still protected by the policy ; not being obliged to discharge his cargo at the first port he makes.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
