Concerning which question the facts were, that <em>Barrett </em>had, at the time of the service of the writ upon him, no goods, effects, or credits of <em>Cook </em>in his possession, excepting as he, <em>Barrett, </em>was administrator of the goods and estate of <em>Peter Barrett, </em>deceased; that, previous to the death of the said <em>Peter, </em>the defendant <em>Cook </em>had commenced a suit against him, to recover the value of certain hides, which suit was pending at the time of the trustee\u2019s answer ; and that the estate of the said <em>Peter Barrett </em>was insolvent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AexW\">* <em>Hoare,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB0\">for the trustee, argued that an administrator, inasmuch as he derived his authority from the law, is like a public officer, concerning whom this Court has repeatedly decided that he cannot be holden as trustee of one who has claims upon him in his official capacity. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> One inconvenience is peculiar to the case of an administrator of an insolvent estate. While he is under attachment as the trustee of a creditor of the estate, the final adjustment and distribution of the estate is delayed, to the injury of all the other creditors. The funds in the hands of an administrator are frequently the proceeds of real estate sold by him, under a license of court. Surely these proceeds cannot be considered as <em>goods, effects, </em>and <em>credits intrusted to and deposited in the hands </em>of the administrator by a creditor of the estate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-13\"><em>Dana, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcRt\">contended that an administrator was truly -the debtor of a creditor to his intestate, and as such was liable to be holden by this process. The inconvenience alluded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>as arising in the probate office, is not so great as the depriving a plaintiff of the remedy which the law has given him; nor is it greater than the cace of one who, by the terms of his contract, is entitled to a long credit. In that case the process is continued until the time of payment arrives. So here the proceedings may be stayed until <em>Cook's </em>action is decided, and his dividend ordered by the judge of probate. This will operate a much less inconvenience, than by discharging the trustee in this case, to deprive the plaintiff of a remedy against his debtor\u2019s effects and credits in the hands of an administrator.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b208-14\"> <em>Wilder </em>vs. <em>Bailey, </em>3 <em>Mass.
