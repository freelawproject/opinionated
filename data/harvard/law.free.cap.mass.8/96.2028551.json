Ward, </em>.Esquire, sheriff of the county of <em>Worcester. </em>At the return term in the Court of Common Pleas, the defendants pleaded in abatement to the writ, that the said <em>Sibley </em>was not a member of the said first parish , on which plea issue was joined, and a verdict rendered for the plaintiffs. Judgment being rendered on the verdict, the plaintiffs appealed, and in this Court submitted the cause to the opinion of the Court upon certain facts agreed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">The facts stated were, in substance, that <em>John Cole, </em>late of said <em>Sutton, </em>deceased, being seised of the demanded premises, on the third day of February, 1807, made his last will, and therein, among other things, devised as follows, viz.: <em>\u201c </em>I give and devise to <em>the South Parish in Sutton, </em>to be applied to the use of schools, and to be kept by the inhabitants forever, and the income applied solely for that purpose, all that my messuage and tenement I now live on, together with the buildings situate, lying, and being in the South Parish in <em>Sutton,\u201d </em>bounded as in said will is described ; and after-wards the said testator died, and his said will was duly proved, approved, and allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\">Previous to the 28th day of October, 1743, th.e town of <em>Sutton </em>constituted one parish; but on that day all the land in said town lying north of a line drawn three miles southwardly from the north line of the town, and parallel thereto, was, by a vote of the legislature of the then province, made a separate parish or precinct, and in the same vote the remaining part of said town is called <em>the first parish * in Sutton, </em>which said parish is commonly known by the name of \u201c <em>the South Parish in Sutton.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-8\">On the 25th of June, 1794, the legislature passed an act incorporating certain individuals therein named, inhabitants of said town, together with their estates, (whereof the said <em>Gibbs Sibley </em>is one, and living within the limits of the said first parish,) without reference to the part of the town in which they respectively dwelt, into a religious society, by the name of <em>\u201c </em>the first congregational society in <em>Sutton.\u201d </em>The said act also provides that all the members of the society thereby incorporated shall be exempt from taxation, for the support of public worship, in any other society in said town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-9-pl-split\">If, upon these facts, the Court should be of opinion that the said <em>Gibbs Sibley </em>was an inhabitant of the said first parish in Sutton. the tenants agreed to suffer judgment to go against them by default, but if the Court should be of a different opinion, the demandants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>agreed to become nonsuit, and that the tenants should have judgment for their costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-5\"><em>Blake, </em>for the demandants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq1\">contended that the act of 1794, creating the congregational society, did not dissolve or merge the preexisting first parish or precinct; and that <em>Sibley, </em>although by the act made one of the new society, did not thereby cease to be an inhabitant and membet of the original parish. A congregational society is distinguishable hem a parish or precinct, the former having ecclesiastical rights and powers only; whereas the latter has civil as well as ecclesiastical powers and rights. Thus by the statute of 1789, <em>c. </em>19, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 8, parishes and precincts have authority to raise moneys for the support of school-masters\u2014a power never vested by law in a religious society.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-6\"><em>Bigelow </em>and <em>Lincoln </em>for the tenants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b85-7\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Azj\">The question brought before us in this action is whether <em>Gibbs Sibley </em>is, upon the facts shown, an inhabitant of the first parish in the town of <em>Sutton. </em>And we are decidedly of opinion that he is not. The congregational society, created by the statute of 1794, is to every intent *a parish. The persons named in the act, together with their estates, are set off from the rest of the inhabitants and territory of the town, and erected into a corporation well known in this commonwealth by the name of a <em>poll parish. </em>In the language of the declaration of rights prefixed to the constitution, and of our laws, the terms <em>parish </em>and <em>religious society </em>have the same meaning and effect. Let the demandants be called.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\"><em>Demandants </em>nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
