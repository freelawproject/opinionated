On the 14th of January, 1797, the defendant paid the said <em>Eleazer </em>fifty-four dollars for the interest, and five hundred dollars more in cash, and at the same time the defendant gave the said <em>Eleazer </em>the note declared on for four hundred dollars; and the said <em>Eleazer </em>thereupon delivered to the defendant the first-mentioned note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-5\">If, upon these facts, the Cpurt should be of opinion that the note \u2022declared on was void as an usurious contract, it was agreed that the \u25a0verdict should be set aside, and a general verdict be entered for 'the defendant; otherwise that judgment should be rendered on the 'verdict already found.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-6\"><em>Ward, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcY\">argued that this note was void, as being \u25a0substituted for another, on which usury had been paid and received.
