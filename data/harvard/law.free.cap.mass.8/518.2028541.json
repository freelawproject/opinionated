Barnard, </em>of <em>Charlestown, </em>in the county of <em>Middlesex.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-10\">The cause was tried at the last November term in this county, before <em>Parker, </em>J., from whose report the, following facts appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-11\">These firkins of butter were the property of the said <em>Cook </em>in November, 1810, and he being desirous to transport them to Mr. <em>Barnard, </em>with whom he had had dealings, caused them to be bsanded with his name, and agreed with one <em>Harlow </em>to carry them to <em>Charles-town, </em>giving him written directions to deliver them to <em>Barnard </em>at the office for the inspection of butter. <em>Harlow </em>proceeded ten miles on the road, and then engaged one <em>Barron </em>to take the butter on, and delivered it to him for that purpose, giving him the written directions he had received from <em>Cook. </em>This was done without the knowledge of <em>Cook. Barron </em>employed one <em>Brown </em>to carry the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>butter, giving him the written instructions aforesaid, which he repeatedly read to him, and also furnishing him with some money to bear his expenses; <em>CooJc </em>being ignorant also of <em>Brown\u2019s </em>being employed. * <em>Brown </em>sold two firkins of the butter on the way, to pay his travelling expenses, as he said.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-5\">When <em>Brown </em>arrived in <em>Boston </em>with his load, not having carried it to the inspection office, nor having given any notice to <em>Barnard, </em>he went to the square in <em>Boston, </em>which is the usual and established market-place, and where great quantities of butter and other articles of country produce are sold; and there went to the store of the plaintiff, and offered the butter for sale, assuming the name of <em>CooJc, </em>and claiming to sell the butter as his own. <em>Dame </em>agreed to take it according to the inspection, and it was carried to the inspection office in <em>Boston, </em>and <em>Brown, </em>under the name of <em>CooJc, </em>returned to the store of <em>Dame </em>with the certificate of inspection, and <em>Dame </em>there paid him in bank bills the price of the butter, being 231 dollars 27 cents, taking a bill of parcels therefor, which <em>Brown </em>signed with his mark, the name of <em>D. CooJc </em>being added to the mark by some person in the store.\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">The defence was put upon three points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-7\">1. That from the circumstances of the case it ought to be presumed that <em>Dame </em>knew <em>Brown, </em>or with ordinary caution might have known him ; and so ought not to avail himself of the purchase. This was left by the judge to the jury, to decide upon the evidence in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-8\">2. That there was no sufficient delivery to <em>Dame </em>to complete the sale, the butter having been in the inspection office, when attached by <em>Baldwin, </em>and not in the actual possession of <em>Dame, </em>and there having been no actual delivery of it to him. The judge ruled this point against the defendant, considering the delivery at the inspection office to be for the use of the plaintiff, after the bargain to sell was made; and especially after the production of the certificate of inspection, and payment of the price, that it was constructively in <em>Dame\u2019s </em>possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-9\">3. That there was no authority in <em>Brown </em>to sell, and so no transfer of the property; which therefore remained in <em>CooJc, </em>until the attachment made by the defendant. But * the judge instructed the jury that the trust given by <em>CooJc </em>to <em>Harlow, </em>and so down to <em>Brown, </em>to transport the butter to <em>Charlestown, </em>although violated by <em>Brown, </em>would not authorize <em>CooJc </em>to reclaim the property from a <em>bona fide </em>innocent purchaser for a valuable consideration ; the sale being of an article commonly found in the market for sale; the carriers of such articles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>generally having authority to sell; and the property being exposed in the usual manner for the sale of such an article.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and a new trial being moved for by the defendant, the action stood over to this term on the motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-6\">\n<em>Whitman,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZD5\">in support of the motion, contended that there was no legal transfer of the property from <em>Brown </em>to the plaintiff. There was no sale in open market; or at least no delivery under such sale. A constructive possession by the plaintiff, which is all that the case finds, is not sufficient in a case where fraud is found. The case finds in effect that the butter was stolen by <em>Brown, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and of stolen goods there can be no legal sale, except in a market overt, <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> of which we have none in this commonwealth.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-7\"><em>Thatcher </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB3\">The question on the effect of a sale in open market is presented, in this case, under circumstances the most favorable to the plaintiff. The commodity was exposed to sale in the open and common market, and in the usual manner. The verdict, has negatived the idea of fraud or collusion, as between the buyer and seller; nor does there appear any want of reasonable caution on the part of the plaintiff. The sale was public, and the manner of the purchase by the inspector\u2019s certificate was the usual and most satisfactory mode, in which sales of the commodity are usually affected; the price was a fair one; and the article such as is usually sold in the market.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-8\">At common law all sales of articles vendible in fairs or markets overt, are not only good between the parties, but are binding on the rightful owner. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-9\">* The question then arises,\u2014is the market in <em>Boston </em>a market overt ? \u2014 A market overt is a certain place established in any town, under the authority of the supreme power, for buying and selling; and the market in <em>Boston </em>is of this character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-10\">In 1633 the following ordinance was passed by the general court of <em>Massachusetts Bay. \u201c </em>It is ordered by the authority of this court, that there shall henceforth be a market kept at <em>Boston, </em>in the county of <em>Suffolk, </em>upon the fifth day o.f the week, from time to time.-\u2019 <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> And the market place in <em>Boston </em>is recognized in sun dry ancient laws of the colony and province. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-11\"><em>Brown </em>was the factor or agent of <em>Cook, </em>and if he was guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>any fraud or deception, the loss ought to fall on his employer, and not on an innocent purchaser for an adequate consideration. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b433-12\"> 4 <em>Mass.
