At the hour of eleven, or a little earlier, that evening, * the <em>said Allen </em>executed and delivered to the plaintiff a bill of sale of five eighths of the sloop and appurtenances, to hold to him in mortgage, and upon condition for his security and indemnification against certain notes and endorsements, in which the plaintiff had become liable for the said <em>Allen; </em>and with authority to sell and dispose of his interest in the said sloop for the purpose of paying the said notes, accounting for any surplus, &amp;c. This transfer, as far as the bill of sale could effect it, was made at <em>Allen\u2019s </em>house in <em>Salem, </em>and the vessel then lay at <em>Manchester, </em>where she was employed in receiving a freight, under the care of one <em>Burbeck, </em>who testified that he had been master of her for eight years on shares, the vessel having been occupied as a coaster. For the last five years he had kept and settled his accounts with <em>Allen, </em>who acted as ships husband, the plaintiff not having been known to him as a part owner, otherwise than by the enrolment. \u2014 At one minute after twelve o\u2019clock in the night time between the said 16th and 17th days of said April, according to the return made by the defendant upon the said writ of attachment, he attached and seised the said vessel at <em>Manchester, </em>aud continued in possession of her until replevied by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">\u2014 The vessel, after remaining a few days at <em>Manchester, </em>came with her freight, laden on board there, to <em>Salem; </em>and immediately upon her arrival, the plaintiff went on board, and notified his claim to the sole property of' the vessel, and demanded the possession of her. This being refused, he caused her to be replevied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">It was admitted at the trial, on the part of the defendant, that the plaintiff had been obliged to pay the said notes and endorsements, in which he had become liable for the said <em>Allen, </em>and had not been indemnified respecting them ; and on the part of the plaintiff, that the demand of the said <em>Webb </em>and <em>Beadle, </em>in their writ of attachment, was just and recoverable against the said <em>Allen.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-8\">\u2014 And it was agreed, between the parties, that the dispute was to be considered as between <em>bona fide </em>creditors of <em>Allen; </em>and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>he absconded, * and became notoriously insolvent in the morning of the said 17th of April.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-5\">The jury were directed to find for the plaintiff, if they believed that the bill of sale was executed by <em>Allen, </em>in point of time, before the said attachment; the question of the legal effect of the bill of sale, and the right of the plaintiff to recover, under the circumstances of this case, being saved by the judge at the request of the defendant. The action stood continued to this term upon the judge\u2019s report; and now,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-6\"><em>Story, </em>of counsel for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATY\">contended that the bill of sale to the plaintiff was wholly inoperative for want of a delivery, and consequently the property not passing out of <em>Allen, </em>the attachment on the part of <em>bona fide </em>creditors was valid and sufficient to hold the vessel against the plaintiff\u2019s bill of sale. Delivery is as necessary between part owners as upon a sale of the whole, where, as was the case here, the vendor has the actual possession; and this rule extends to mortgages. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> In this case <em>Allen </em>had not only the sole possession, but also a sole qualified property, as he was the bailiff of <em>Putnam\u2019s </em>three eighth parts. Yet possession was not attempted to be taken under the bill of sale until several days, although the vessel was in a neighboring port, and so known to be by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-7\">But we contend further that replevin does not lie in this case; because there was no tortious taking from the possession of the plaintiff, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-8\">The <em>Court </em>interrupted <em>Story, </em>observing that this point was not open to him upon the pleadings in the case; and that, for a recovery in the action on his part, it would be necessary for him to show the property of the five eighth parts in question to have been in <em>Allen </em>at the time the defendant made the attachment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-9\"><em>Pickering </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANm\">At the common law the property in personal chattels passed on the execution of a bill of sale; and the bankrupt laws have no operation here; *but the plaintiff in this case did every act that could reasonably be required of him towards perfecting his title under <em>Allen\u2019s </em>conveyance. It does not appear that he knew, or even had the means of knowing, that the vessel was at <em>Manchester. </em>From the nature of her employment in the coasting trade she must naturally be constantly changing her place. Upon her arrival at the port of <em>Salem, </em>the place of residence of all the parties, and this within a few days, he demanded the possession, to which he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>entitled; and being resisted, he immediately sued out his writ of replevin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-5\">But we contend that; as a joint owner with <em>Allen, </em>he was under no obligation to take possession. The possession of <em>Allen </em>was his possession. <em>Burbeclc </em>was equally the agent of both, and his actual possession must have been as the servant of both the owners. The enrolment was necessarily in the possession of the master in behalf of one owner as much as of the other; and upon the execution and delivery of the bill of sale, the possession, as well as the property, was virtually transferred from <em>Allen </em>to the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\"> See <em>Abbott on Shippings B. </em>1, <em>pt. </em>1, \u00a7 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b245-11\"> [See the note to <em>Badger </em>vs. Phinney, 15 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>359. \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b246-6\">Sedgwick, J.s</author>\n<p id=\"AvW\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In this case it is very clear that the bill of sale from <em>Allen </em>to the plaintiff, being upon sufficient consideration, was valid as between the parties to the instrument. The only question is. whether it be so against <em>bona fide </em>creditors of <em>Allen, </em>such as <em>Webb </em>and Beadle, under a process issuing in whose favor the defendant claims to hold, are admitted to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The conveyance of the sloop <em>Lydia </em>from <em>Allen </em>to the plaintiff was not absolute, but conditional, by way of mortgage, with a power to sell, to secure him against certain liabilities which he had incurred for the debts of <em>Allen, </em>this latter not being actually indebted to him at the time. Whether if, under these circumstances, <em>Allen </em>had been suffered to continue possession of the vessel jointly with the * plaintiff, such possession would have been inconsistent with the deed, or otherwise fraudulent against creditors, it is not necessary now to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">If a ship be at sea, a transfer by bill of sale, without delivery, is good as against all persons; and the reason is, that as, between the parties, the contract is binding in all cases; and the subsequent possession of the vendor avoids it as to third persons, only because it is an indication of fraud ; which reason cannot apply in a case where delivery is impossible. We see no reason why the exception should not extend to protect contracts relating to ships which are at home, but in a port distant from the place where the contract is made. In such case the vendee should take possession within a reasonable time. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Whether that was done in this instance, the facts stated do not enable us to decide. We are of opinion that the distance between <em>Salem </em>and <em>Manchester </em>is immaterial; and we know not how long the vessel remained at the latter place, except that it was only a few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">But there is one circumstance, upon which we are satisfied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the plaintiff is entitled to recover. The vessel was seised by the defendant in an hour after the execution of the bill of sale by <em>Allen. </em>She was then the property of the plaintiff, his title being liable to be divested by his <em>subsequent </em>loches. The possession of the defendant was, therefore, in its inception wrongful; and we are of opinion that the plaintiff, in suffering that possession to continue for a few days, was not guilty of such negligence as thereby te have forfeited his claim. Indeed, it must be a strong case, in which wrong by sufferance shall be matured to right. It will be observed, that immediately on the vessel\u2019s arrival at her home in <em>Salem, </em>the plaintiff went on board her, and attempted to take possession. <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\"><em> [Ingraham vs. </em>Wheeler, 6 <em>Con. </em>283\u2014284.
