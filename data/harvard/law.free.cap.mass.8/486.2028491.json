Within two days after the above transaction, and before any of the goods were removed from the store, but after the service of the summons was made upon <em>Peabody </em>in this action, certain creditors of <em>Kinsman </em>sued out writs of attachment against him, and thereupon caused the store to be broken open, and the goods therein to be attached, and they were in * the possession of the officer at the time of the answers. The assignment purported to be made in consideration of the insolvency of <em>Kinsman, </em>his disposition to make a just division of his property among his creditors, and one dollar paid him by <em>Peabody. </em>But nothing was in fact given or promised to him as a consideration.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-5\"><em>Selfridge, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aou\">contended that the process of foreign attachment does not lie, except where the goods, effects, &amp;c., cannot be come at to be attached by the ordinary process of law. But here the plaintiff might have seized the goods, as well as those other creditors of <em>Kinsman, </em>who afterwards caused them to be attached. If the deed was fraudulent, and therefore void against creditors, the property of the goods remained in <em>Kinsman, </em>and <em>Peabody </em>was merely his servant, or the keeper of the goods. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-6\"><em>Shaw </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amqj\">The trustee was answerable at the time of the service of this process upon him. He had the custody of the goods. They had been, in the very words of the statute, \u201c intrusted and deposited \u201d in his hands. After the service of the summons upon him, the property was bound thereby; and he not only had a right to keep the possession of them, but it was his duty so to do. He will have his remedy over for them, against the officer who now holds them.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\"> See 5 <em>Mass.
