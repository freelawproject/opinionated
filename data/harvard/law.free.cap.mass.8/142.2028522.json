Sen., died in the year 1804, intestate, and seised of the demanded premises; and his real estate, after payment of the debts and charges of administration, exclusive of his widow\u2019s dower, was appraised at the sum *of 3925 dollars. He left six children, viz., <em>Elijah Crane, Ruth Barker, Sarah Bird, Mary Wales, Rebecca Crane, </em>and <em>Abigail Gill, </em>together with the said children of his son <em>Thomas, </em>his heirs at law. The said <em>Thomas Crane, </em>Jun., on the 29th of April, 1774, being then more \u25a0than 21 years of age, by his deed of that date, in consideration that his father and mother had, at his request, and as, and for his advancement in his said father\u2019s and mother\u2019s estate, advanced and paid him the sum of \u00a3133, 6s. <em>8d. </em>lawful money, (equal to 444 dollars 44 cents,) released and quitclaimed to his said father and mother, and their heirs and assigns, forever, \u201c all such right, estate, title, interest, and demand whatsoever, as the said <em>Thomas Crane, </em>Jun., had, or ought to have, in or to all the estate, real or personal, of the said <em>Thomas Crane </em>and <em>Mary Crane, </em>that now is, or may be hereafter, by any ways or means whatsoever, that would otherwise be mine by heirship; \u201d The said deed being made, and the said money paid, with the knowledge of the family of the said <em>Thomas, </em>Sen. \u2014 A similar deed, and for the like consideration, was afterwards made by the said <em>Elijah Crane. </em>\u2014 The estate of the said <em>Thomas Crane, </em>Sen., after his decease, and after payment of his debts, &amp;c., was, in the year 1807, by a warrant from the judge of probate for this county, divided among his children and heirs, (except the said <em>Elijah, </em>and the children and heirs of the said <em>Thomas, </em>Jun.,) who entered and became possessed of the same, agreeably to said division.\u2014 The tenant <em>Tucker </em>derives his title and possession from the said children and heirs of <em>Thomas Crane, </em>Sen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-5\">Upon these facts it was agreed that if, in the opinion of the Court, the demandants were entitled to recover in any form of action, the tenant should suffer judgment to go against him by default; otherwise the demandants were to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-6\"><em>Whitman, </em>for the tenant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuJ\">insisted that the demandants were barred, 1st. By the release of their father, <em>Thomas Crane, </em>Jun., above recited; and, 2d. Also by the proceedings of the Probate Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AqX\">* Richardson, for the demandants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8ka\">contended that they were not estopped by the distribution made by order of the Probate Court.

Here both were agreed; and it is apparent that the advancement was not near the proportion that would have accrued to <em>Thomas. </em>It could operate only as a partial advancement; and it was the duty of the Probate Court to ascertain the proportion of <em>Thomas\u2019s </em>share that had been advanced him, and to direct the com missioners to make the division accordingly.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\"> 4 <em>Mass.
