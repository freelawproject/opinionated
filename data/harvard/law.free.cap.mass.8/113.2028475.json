At the end of the minutes of the term was this entry, \u2014 \u201c The Court adjourned without day, on the 10th day of December, A. D. 1807. <em>Joseph Allen, </em>Clerk.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">Upon inspecting the return on the execution, the judge ruled that the same could not go in evidence, and directed a nonsuit to be entered, subject to the opinion of the whole Court, upon the attachment, judgment, and return upon the execution, all which were made part of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">[The judgment referred to in the judge\u2019s report was recovered by the present demandants against <em>William Stearns </em>and <em>Solomon Stearns. </em>\u2014 The officer\u2019s return upon the execution issued thereon is as follows: \u2014 \u201c <em>Worcester, ss. </em>January 8th, 1808. I caused three disinterested and discreet men, being freeholders in said county, to be appointed, and chosen, and sworn, as the law directs, viz., <em>A. B., </em>chosen by creditor\u2019s attorney, <em>Thomas Weald, </em>Esq.; <em>C. D., </em>chosen by <em>William Stearns, </em>one of the.debtors ; and <em>E. I'., </em>appointed by me for the third, \u2014 to appraise real estate shown to them to satisfy this execution; and they appraised the <em>above described premises </em>at the sum of, &amp;c., to satisfy this execution and all fees; and after deducting fees and costs of levying, recording, &amp;c., viz., the sum of, &amp;c., there will remain the sum of, &amp;c., to satisfy this execution in full. \u2014 Also I have given seisin and possession to the creditor\u2019s attorney, viz., <em>Thomas Weald, </em>Esq., by delivering the same described premises to him, the said attorney. I do therefore return this precept fully satisfied.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">The cause was argued at this term upon the judge\u2019s report by <em>Bigelow </em>for the demandants, and by \u00ab7. <em>Prescott </em>and <em>Dana </em>for the tenant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-9-pl-split\">\n<em>Bigelow</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcLH\">moved for a new trial, alleging that the evidence offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>by the demandants, and rejected by the judge, was sufficient to maintain their action. There was a regular attachment of the demanded premises at the suit of the demandants, a judgment duly rendered for them in that suit, *and an extent of an execution issued thereon. \u2014 The principal question is on the time of the extent, whether it was within thirty days from the date of the judgment, so that the previous attachment shall have holden the premises, and the claim of the tenant under a conveyance from the judgment debtor, made after the attachment and before the extent, be thereby barred. On this question the demandants contend that the thirty days are to be reckoned from the rising of the court at the close of the term. Until that time a defendant, who has been defaulted, has a right by statute, [1784, c. 28, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 7,] on payment of costs, to have the same day in court as if his default had not been recorded. Whenever, upon motion to the court, judgment is made up on a previous day, and execution is awarded, a minute of the fact is always made; and in such case the thirty days will commence from the day of entering up judgment. But nothing of this kind appears in the case referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\">To the objection, that it does not appear that the judgment creditors elected to extend their execution on the lands of their debtors, it is answered that their receiving seisin by their attorney is sufficient evidence of their election; and this fact furnishes an answer also to the second objection, that it is not certified that the premises were shown to the officer or appraisers. \u2014 It is agreed that it does not appear to which of the judgment debtors the premises belonged; and the natural presumption is, that they were held in common by the two. The fourth objection is, that the premises were not set off by metes and bounds. To this it is answered, that in the certificate of the appraisers, which precedes the officer\u2019s return, the boundaries of the premises are described with great minuteness and accuracy, and the officer adopts the description, and makes it part of his return.\u2014As to the fifth objection, Mr. <em>Heald, </em>to whom seisin was delivered, was the attorney of record to the creditors in the action, which is sufficient; but if a special authority for the purpose were necessary, it must *be presumed that he had it, since the sheriff recognized him as sufficiently authorized, and such special power, if produced at the levy, would not appear in the sheriff\u2019s return of the execution. \u2014 The sixth objection is abundantly answered by the fact stated in it. Had there been personal estate wherewith the execution might have been satisfied, the creditors would certainly not entangle themselves with real estate subject to redemption for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>twelve months, with so much uncertainty of ever realizing their debt, when they could in a few days have realized the cash for the amount of their execution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-5\"><em>Prescott </em>and <em>Dana.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOx\">Judgments relate to the first, day of the term, unless from something on the record it appears that they cannot have that relation. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Now, there is nothing in the record in this case, that can carry the judgment farther forward in the term than the third day of it, when the default took place; and the execution was not extended until more than thirty days after that third day. \u2014 It does not sufficiently appear from the return of the officer, that the judgment debtors, whose land was taken, had an opportutunity to elect an appraiser. Certainly one of them only had such opportunity; and there is nothing in the return which show s that he was the owner of the land, upon which the levy was made. Nor upon a new trial could this objection be cured by parole evidence. \u2014 The title of the judgment creditor being derived wholly from the return of the sheriff, that return ought to contain a perfect description of the premises; and to reply upon a reference to the doings of the appraisers for such description would be too loose a practice to rest the title to real estate upon. \u2014 There was no evidence of Mr. <em>Heald\u2019s </em>being the attorney of the creditors, authorized to receive seisin of the lands, except what arose from his commencing and managing their action in court, which we think implies no authority for such a purpose. Such authority ought to be under seal, and to be recorded, with the other proceedings, in order to make a complete title to the creditors. * The forms prescribed by the statute ought to be rigidly adhered to, or titles to real estate will become very uncertain. \u2014\u2022 The statute of 1783, <em>c. </em>57, &lt;\u00a7&gt; <em>2, </em>authorizes the extending of an execution upon real estate only in cases where the creditor can find no personal estate to satisfy the execution; but here was a large amount of personal property secured by attachment, and which must have been in the hands of the officer at the time of the extent. It is difficult to account for this conduct of the creditors on any principles consistent with fairness, and not strongly implying a desire to oppress and entangle an unfortunate debtor.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b102-8-pl-split\"> 3 <em>Burr. </em>1596, <em>Swann </em>vs. Broome,\u2014 <em>Tidd\u2019s Practice, </em>855 \u2014 4 <em>Co </em>7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The action standing continued <em>nisi </em>for advisement, the opinion of the Court was delivered at the following March term, in <em>Suffolk, </em>to the following effect, by</p>\n<author id=\"b102-7\">Parsons, C.

The defendant appeared by attorney, but was defaulted on the second day of December; and the levy was made on the eighth day of January, 1808. If the judgment be considered as entered on the first day of the term, or on the day when the defendant made default, the thirty days had expired before the levy; otherwise if the judgment be taken as entered on the last day of the term. \u2014 A judgment may be entered on motion during the term, in which case the time of entering it is minuted; but when no day is minuted when judgment is entered, by the ancient usage of this Court, and also of the Common Pleas, judgment is entered on the last day of the term, against the presumption of the common law. Formerly, on the last day of each term, an order was passed to enter judgment, where the party was entitled to judgment, and to continue all actions undetermined. But of late years this order has become a standing rule and practice of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">As the levy was withir thirty days of the last day of the term, this objection cannot prevail, although a conveyance after the attachment, and before the levy, had been made. But as no such conveyance appears from the judge\u2019s report, the levy ought to have been admitted in evidence, as being good against the debtors, and those holding under them by a conveyance after the levy, in the same manner as if no previous attachment had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The second objection is, that it does not appear from the levy, that the creditors elected to extend their execution on the lands of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the debtors. \u2014This objection is not founded on fact; the creditors\u2019 attorney having chosen one of the appraisers, and having received seisin from the sheriff. \u2014 Under this objection it was also said, that it does not appear that the lands levied on were shown to the officer or appraisers, or seisin received by any person duly authorized by the creditors. \u2014 But the sheriff certifies that Mr. <em>Heald </em>acted as their attorney ; and the claim of the creditors * to the land by virtue of the levy is a ratification of his acts as their attorney, if there had been no precedent authority given. Also the sheriff returns expressly, that he was their attorney; and there is no attempt to falsify the return.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Another objection is, that it does not appear that the lands were taken for want of personal estate of the debtors; and this objection is fortified by the return on the original writ of the attachment of personal estate of considerable value. \u2014 But, although there may have been sufficient personal property attached, which might have been seised on the execution ; yet the creditor may unquestionably elect to waive his attachment, and to levy on the lands of the debtor. He may doubt the debtor\u2019s title to his goods, and may not incline to indemnify the officer, or to expose himself to a subsequent lawsuit. And the debtor ought not to complain of his own neglect to pay his just debt. Besides, the extent upon his lands will, <em>ipso facto, </em>discharge the attachment of his goods, so that he may at his own convenience raise the money by the sale of them, pay his debt, and take back his land. \u2014 This objection therefore is disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Another objection is, that the sheriff did not deliver seisin of the lands extended upon by metes and bounds. \u2014 This objection is not founded on fact. The land is described by courses and distances, the angular points being each distinguished by a stake and stones, or by reference to other boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7-pl-split\">The last objection made is, that it does not appear from the re turn, which of the debtors owned the land levied on. \u2014 As to a stranger, as the tenant in the present action appears to be, it is immaterial which of the debtors, or whether both of them, were seised of the land. An appraiser was appointed by <em>William Stearns, </em>one of the debtors. If both the debtors were seised of the land, an appointment of an appraiser by one of them was sufficient. If the debtors agreed in their appointment, then this appraiser was * appointed by both; if they disagreed, then the sheriff must have appointed ; and he might appoint a man chosen by either of the debtors. If <em>William </em>was the sole owner, then the choice of an appraiser was right, and <em>Solomon, </em>the other debtor, had no right to interfere. If the tenant in this action, on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>trial of the issue, should not prove to be a stranger, but should derive his title from <em>Solomon, </em>as having been sole seised, he will not be bound by the levy ; and the seisin acquired by the demand-ants will be wrongful, and they cannot recover against him. But if his title be derived from <em>William </em>and <em>Solomon, </em>as seised together, or from <em>William </em>alone, he will be bound by the levy, and must fail, unless his title accrued before the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">It is the opinion of the Court, that the nonsuit be set aside, and a new trial be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
