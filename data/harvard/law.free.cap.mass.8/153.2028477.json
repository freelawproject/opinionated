But the coroner actually took a bond in the sum of 800 dollars, the plaintiff\u2019s damage in the writ, upon which the goods were attached, having been laid at 400 dollars; and this had probably misled the coroner.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-12\"><em>S. D. Parker </em>appeared for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGm\">and moved for a rule upon the plaintiff, to show cause why judgment should not be entered that the plaintiff take nothing by his writ, and a return of the goods be awarded to the defendant; because the bond was not taken according to the * command of the writ, nor pursuant to the directions of the statute. \u2014 And he argued that the writ of replevin being a conditional precept, the officer had no authority to serve it, unless the condition was legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>complied with. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Nor was this a captious or merely formal objection ; for if the defendant should hereafter have occasion to bring ai&gt; action on the bond, this very point might be made in the defence, and he might be wholly deprived of the security to which by law he is entitled.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-5\">Harrington, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-hU\">cited the case of <em>Morse </em>vs. <em>Hodsdon &amp; Al., </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> as answering all the objections, and curing the difficulty stated for the defendant.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\"> 3 <em>Mass.

The bond in this case, being for more than twice the value of the goods replevied, will always be subject to reduction on a hearing in equity. It was certainly sufficient to justify the officer in serving the writ of replevin; and indeed it may have been true that the defendant himself insisted on a larger bond than the writ directed, alleging that the goods were greatly undervalued in the writ. Whether this was the case or not, the bond being in too large a sum can never operate to the defendant\u2019s injury. The service was legal, and the defendant can take nothing by his motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
