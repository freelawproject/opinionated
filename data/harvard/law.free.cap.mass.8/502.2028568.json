This offer was within a reasonable time after the plaintiff received the intelligence of the restraint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-10\">A verdict was taken by consent for the plaintiff, as for a total loss, which was to be set aside, and a nonsuit entered, if the Court should be of opinion, that upon these facts the plaintiff had not a right to abandon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-14\"><em>Jackson, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8t\">argued that the memorandum added to the policy in the case, gave the assured an absolute right to abandon, when the property insured shall have been detained ninety days. The clause was intended to avoid all question of the actual state of the fact at the time, to fix the rights and duties of the parties by the detention for the space of ninety days. One good effect contemplated from this agreement is, that the right of abandonment being put out of question, the underwriter may without hesitation accept the abandonment, and take measures for preventing a waste and loss of the property insured, which often happen when any uncertainty attaches to the right of abandonment. The plain import of the memorandum is, that if after the expiration of ninety days from the capture, the property shall still be detained, the right of abandonment shall be fixed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-16\"><em>Dexter </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_F\">The memorandum in question was introduced into our policies from the present state of commerce, when detentions are so frequent without legal cause ; and its object was to restrain for a time the right of * the assured to abandon for that cause, which he would otherwise have had immediately. A very improper effect had grown out of insurances without this restriction; by which underwriters became in fact answerable for the badness of markets. It was intended by the clause in question to protect the underwriter in some measure from this injurious effect; and in no way to enlarge or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>extend the right of the assured to abandon. If the intention had been, as is contended, for the plaintiff, the clause would have been in the affirmative.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b420-5\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AfX\">The only question before us in this case, is whether the plaintiff had a right to abandon, at the time when his offer was made and refused. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel has argued that the right of abandonment was enlarged by the memorandum .at the foot of the policy. But we are satisfied that the right is thereby restrained. The assured is not to abandon for the cause of detention until ninety days after the capture; nor at the expiration of that period, unless the facts then existing give him a right to abandon. We are therefore all of opinion that the plaintiff had not a right to abandon, when he made the offer to the defendants; and that the verdict must be set aside, and the plaintiff become nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\"><em>Plaintiff </em>nonsuit.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\"> See 4 <em>Cranch\u2019s Rep. </em>29, 202.\u20143 <em>Binney\u2019s Rep. </em>287. \u201410 <em>East, </em>329.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
