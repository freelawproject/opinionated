Of </em>course no one would take the <em>risk; </em>and 'we have only to hope that Captain <em>Hoyt </em>will get information of this decree, previous to his entering the river, and run for <em>Tonningen, </em>which at present is open, as far as we know ; although it is said <em>Denmark </em>would issue a similar decree respecting their ports, which will in a great measure cut up the <em>American </em>commerce. The cargo of the <em>AHadne </em>was insured five or six weeks ago. The last premium given to <em>Varel </em>was 25 guineas, to return five per cent, for safe arrival. No freight will bear this premium. We beg. leave to repeat our hopes and wjshes, that your ship may arrive in safety ; and as Captain <em>Hoyt </em>informs us his freight is to be remitted to us, we shall have great pleasure in informing you when it reaches our hands. Or as any thing relative to your ship is known to us, we shall immediately advise you. We send copy of this in quadruplicate, hoping one or other may reach you early ; that in case you can get insured with you, and you wish it, that you may be secured from loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-10\">\u201cWe are on all occasions yours, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-11\">\n<em>\u201c Thomas Dickason &amp;f Co.\u201d</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-12\">The defendant called Mr. <em>Seth Sweetser </em>as a witness, who testified that he was the insurance broker on this occasion; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the said <em>Joseph Hoyt, Jun., </em>applied in behalf * of his father, the plaintiff, to get insurance for 10,000 dollars on the said ship and freight, <em>viz., </em>7000 dollars on the ship, and the residue on the freight from <em>Falmouth, </em>in <em>England, </em>to any port in <em>Europe; </em>that the said <em>Sweetser </em>inquired if the said <em>Joseph, Jun., </em>knew to what port the ship was bound ; that he said he did not, but added that perhaps the ship might go to the south of <em>Europe, </em>to <em>Spain </em>or <em>Portugal, </em>though he thought that not probable; he thought it more probable that she would go to <em>Tonningen; </em>that she was cleared out for <em>Hamburgh ; </em>that <em>Sweetser </em>inquired if any letter or information had been received from the ship ; that the said <em>Joseph, Jun., </em>said he knew of none. <em>Sweetser </em>was positive that he made this last inquiry, and received the said answer ; that the said <em>Joseph, Jun., </em>did not leave written, but only verbal proposals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">The plaintiff called the said <em>Joseph Hoyt, Jun., </em>as a witness, who testified that he applied to the said <em>Sweetser, </em>to get insurance for his father, as stated by Sweetser; that the plaintiff had ordered him to get 15,000 dollars insured, if to be had for about 15 per cent., but told him not to get more than 10,000 dollars insured, unless it could be effected at less than 20 per cent.; that <em>Sweetser </em>supposed that a policy might be effected at 20\" per cent., and engaged to make application to the underwriters; that the said <em>Joseph, Jun., </em>went home and informed his father of the result of his application to Mr. <em>Sweetser; </em>and that he presented written proposals to <em>Sweetser </em>at the time he applied for the insurance, but was not certain that he left them. He was very positive that he never did inform <em>Sweetser </em>that perhaps the ship might go to the south of <em>Europe, </em>&amp;.C., and he had no recollection of <em>Sweetser\u2019s </em>enquiring if any information or letter had been received from the ship ; but he thought it probable that <em>Sweetser </em>inquired where the ship was bound, and that he answered, that she cleared out for <em>Hamburgh.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">Whereupon the judge directed a nonsuit; to which direction \u25a0the plaintiff filed exceptions, and the action stood continued to this term upon the said exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ade\">* And now, <em>Putnam </em>and <em>White, </em>of counsel for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFrX\">moved that the nonsuit be set aside, and a new trial granted, contending that it was the proper province of the jury to have settled the facts, about which there was contradictory evidence at the trial. To them also it belonged to consider and determine whether the letter, which was voluntarily produced by the plaintiff, was material to the issue ; and if they should find it so, it was still for them to decide ; and this was a question very inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>esting to the plaintiff, whether the neglect to exhibit it to the broker, was fraudulent on the part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-5\">The first point was too well established to need argument. As to the letter itself, it contained information of the political rumors of the day, which, in point of fact, turned out to be false ; but if true, as they were of a public nature, the underwriters were as well bound to know them as the assured. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> The presumption was, that the master of the ship would hear the reports, and that he would thus be deterred from entering the River Jade; and so it was not material to show the letter on that account. But whether the concealment was or was not material, the question whether it was fraudulent or not ought still to be referred to the jury, that if they should be satisfied that there was no fraud, the plaintiff may at least recover his premium under the second count in his declaration. The intention of the party is what must in all cases constitute fraud, and that is certainly proper for the jury to decide upon. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> It ought to operate strongly in the minds of a jury, in this case, that the plaintiff\u2019s property at risk was 26,000 dollars, yet that he insured but 10,000 dollars. If he was fraudulent, he must have been stupidly insensible to the care of his own interests</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJCe\">Livermore, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AZrx\">was stopped by the Court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> 3 <em>Burr. </em>1910, <em>Carter </em>vs. <em>Boehm.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\"> <em>Doug. </em>13, <em>in notis. </em>See, also, 1 <em>New.

The letter, which * the plaintiff concealed, contained information very material in estimating the risk. The plaintiff must have been aware of this, if he had capacity to enter into a contract. The underwriter had a right to the information. The withholding it from him must be considered fraudulent, and the insurance was therefore void. And being avoided for such a cause, the plaintiff is not entitled to a return of his premium.</p>\n<p id=\"AYGj\">\n<em>The nonsuit is confirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
