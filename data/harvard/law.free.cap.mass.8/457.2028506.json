The Common Pleas, after notice to the town of <em>Roxbury, </em>and hearing the parties, were of opinion that the said road had become useless by the laying out of the turnpike, and therefore ordered that it should be discontinued.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-14\"><em>Whitman, </em>for the inhabitants of <em>Roxbury,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anac\">took two exceptions to the record \u2014 1. That the Common Pleas adjudged the way described in the petition to be <em>useless, </em>and grounded thereon the order for its discontinuance; whereas the statute <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> gives them authority to discontinue a way only when they shall be satisfied that it is not <em>expedient </em>that the same should be continued any longer. 8. That the Common Pleas could not discontinue the way, as being rendered * useless by the location of a turnpike road, as was the case here; it being against the princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>pies oi the laws authorizing turnpikes, that existing roads should be discontinued on account thereof.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-5\"><em>Richardson </em>for the commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b380-16\"> <em>Stat. </em>1797, <em>c. </em>30</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b381-6\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AnN\">The adjudication of the Common Pleas substantially conforms to the provision of the statute. The expression, that the road in question had become useless, has certainly as great strength, and is of as extensive import, as the expression used in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">As to the second exception, the Court will not go into the ques- , tian of the expediency or inexpediency of the discontinuance. That belongs wholly to the court below. But it may be observed, that the Common Pleas did not, in the case before us, discontinue the way merely because the turnpike had been laid out; but, because in consequence of the laying out of the turnpike, the way had become useless; and they were certainly competent to draw this conclusion. The respondents can take nothing by their writ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
