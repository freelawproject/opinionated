It was also proved that, previously, in the forenoon of the same day, a summons in the suit of <em>James Brackett, </em>against the said <em>Cleverly, </em>had been left at his house by <em>Lemuel Brackett, </em>declaring an attachment, <em>&amp;c., </em>in common form. It appeared also, from the testimony adduced at the trial, that the gelding was worth 50 dollars, and that the heifers were worth 15 dollars each.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-9\">The judge expressed his opinion to be, that in attaching personal property to secure a debt, the creditor and officer, if sufficient had not been taken before the delivery of the summons, were justifiable in proceeding afterwards, before a return of the writ, to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>further attachment: <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> but if sufficient had been previously taken, then a further attachment, after delivery of the summons, or any proceeding oppressive in fact to the supposed debtor in the writ of attachment, were not to be justified. No attachment of the gelding being returned, and the delivery and acceptance of the * gelding as a security upon the agreement of the parties in the former suit being vacated by the determination of the creditor to make an attachment upon his writ, the judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the foregoing facts reported by him; the defendants moving for a new trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-5\">T. <em>B. Adams, </em>of counsel for the defendant <em>Lemuel Brackett,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZS\">considered the case of the two defendants as standing on very distinct grounds. His client, he insisted, had done no more than his official duty compelled him to do. He attached the chattels of <em>Cleverly, </em>as his precept commanded him, and he made due return of the writ and of his service of it. If <em>James Brackett </em>should appear to have made himself liable to the plaintiff\u2019s action, by any irregularity in his conduct, it would seem to savor greatly of hardship to apply the same considerations to <em>Lemuel, </em>who had conducted himself with propriety, in every view, except that he had happened to be seen in company with one who had committed a trespass.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-6\"><em>S. D. Parker, </em>who appeared for the other defendant, <em>James Brackett,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQc\">argued that his whole statement, taken together, was a sufficient justification. He received the gelding as collateral security for his debt; and, it being insufficient, he caused the heifers to be attached, as he had a good right to do. Nor did the attachment vacate the partial security he had previously obtained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-7\"><em>Whiting, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0AD\">insisted that the directions of the judge at the trial were correct, and, the jury being the proper judges of the evidence, there was no cause to set the verdict aside, and send the parties to another trial.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b133-10\"><em> </em>[Such a proceeding would seem to be quite irregular.\u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b133-8\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AiS\">The brief statement filed by the constable in this case is defective, inasmuch as it does not show the disposition which he made of the c\u00e1ttle which he attached. His posterior conduct may have been such as to make him a trespasser <em>ah initia. </em>As we shall send the action to another trial, he will have opportunity to amend it.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">* As to the defence set up by the other defendant, we are of opinion, that after he had received the gelding as a pledge for his demand against the plaintiff, he could not lawfully attach other property for the security, without first returning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>pledge ; for he could not know how far the pledge was competent to his full security. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> By thus unlawfully attaching the heifers, therefore, he committed a trespass. And if the constable knew of the gelding\u2019s having been pledged as it was, he also was a trespasser in attaching the heifers.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">It is not easy to suppose such a state of the case, as would entitle the plaintiff to damages for both the gelding and heifers. Yet the jury have here found the defendants guilty of the whole trespass charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">As the case is much involved, and the whole testimony furnished at the trial was very slender, we order the verdict to be set aside, and a new trial to be had; but, as the subject of the dispute is of inconsiderable value, we hope the parties will adjust the business out of court, and that we shall hear nothing more of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\n<em>New trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\"><em> </em>[There seems to be no reason why he might not lawfully have * attached in this case, as well as in the case of a mortgage of real estate. \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
