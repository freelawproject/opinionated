Dyer </em>was appointed administrator of said <em>Popkin\u2019s </em>estate ; and, having obtained license to sell the real estate of his intestate for the payment of his debts, sold the equity of redemption to <em>Abel Wheelock, </em>by whom the same was conveyed to <em>Bumstead, </em>the tenant; that he, the said <em>Bumstead, </em>on the 19th of Sept, 1810, paid to <em>Capen, </em>the mortgagee, the whole sum due by the mortgage, the same never having been paid by the mortgagor or his administrator ; and that the said <em>Thomas Popkin </em>was never seised of the premises, or any part thereof, since the execution of the said mortgage deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>To this plea the demandant, after oyer of the several conveyances mentioned therein<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> replies that on the 19th of * September, 1810, before she demanded her dower, and. more than one month before the \u25a0 commencement of this action, the said <em>Capen, </em>the mortgagee, then having the sole right and interest in the said mortgage deed, did personally repair to the office of the register of deeds for the county of <em>Suffolk, </em>where the said mortgage deed was recorded, having received satisfaction and payment of all the sums due on the mortgage, and did then and there, in the margin of the record of said mortgage deed, acknowledge that he had received full satisfaction and payment for the premises therein mortgaged, and did quitclaim all his right, title, and interest therein, and did then and there desire that the said record might be discharged, and did then and there sign said dis-. charge and acknowledgment; and said mortgage deed was thereupon cancelled and discharged according to the law in that case made and provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">To this replication the tenant demurs generally, and the demand-ant joins in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-6\"><em>Parker, </em>for the tenant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9X\">cited the case of <em>Fowler </em>vs. <em>Shearer, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> in which it was decided by this Court that a wife may bar herself of dower, by joining her husband in a deed of conveyance, relinquishing her claim to dower, and putting her seal to the deed; and to show that such a release in a mortgage shall enure to the purchaser of the equity of redemption, he referred to the case of <em>Masury </em>vs. <em>Putnam, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> decided by this Court in the county of <em>Essex, </em>November term, 1793.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-7\"><em>Thurston, </em>for the demandant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Att\">agreed that the release by her, set forth in the plea, would bar her as respects the mortgagee, and as long as the mortgage deed was in force. But the release of the dower was conditional, as well as the principal conveyance, and the discharge of the mortgage by the mortgagee or his assigns, was a fulfilment of the condition, and a cancelling of the mortgage. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> The tenant\u2019s claim is as the assignee of the administrator of the mortgagor; as such, his right was to redeem the land by paying the money due, and thus extinguishing the *mortgage. This he did, and at the same time annulled the effect of the demandant\u2019s release of her right of dower, which was collateral and coextensive with the mortgage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>But if the tenant were considered as the assignee of the mortgagee, still the demandant has a right to redeem. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> Neither does it appear that the tenant ever entered under the mortgage. The tenant, however, was not the assignee of the mortgagee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\">The conveyances, under which alone the tenant claims, both recognize the claim of dower now set up by the demandant. He purchased the land subject to it, and he paid a consideration accordingly. In fact he redeemed as the assignee of <em>Dyer, </em>the administrator of the mortgagor ; and if <em>Dyer </em>had paid the mortgage, would it be contended that the demandant\u2019s claim would not have revived ? The tenant resists that claim against all equity, since by the terms of his own purchase it was reserved ; and if his plea vs supported, great injustice is done to the demandant.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\"> The deeds from <em>Dyer </em>to <em>Wheelock, </em>and from him to <em>Bumstead, </em>purport a convey, anee of the land, <em>\u201c </em>subject to a mortgage made thereon by said deceased, and other rights claimed, <em>viz., </em>dower by the widow of said <em>Thomas Popkin, </em>deceased.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\"> 7 <em>Mass.

It would be singular, if when the tenant had paid the money due on the mortgage, and supposed that he had thus perfected his estate, by extinguishing the only encumbrance he knew to exist upon it, he should by that act revive the claim of the demandant, which she had before solemnly renounced under her hand and seal, and which, as he was under no obligation, it cannot be presumed he meant to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">But the facts produce no such absurdity. When the tenant purchased the equity of redemption, it belonged to him to pay the money due on the mortgage, and thus rid his estate of that encumbrance. Having all the equitable interest in himself, when he had paid the money due by the mortgage, the legal estate followed the equitable interest, and he became seised of the whole fee simple. If this were not the plain, legal operation of the transaction, the law would * construe the discharge of the mortgage by the mortgagee a release of the legal estate by him to the tenant, who had become lawfully possessed of the equitable interest, and from whom the consideration for that discharge flowed, rather than such a mischief should follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\n<em>Replication adjudged bad.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
