The plaintiff objected to the admission of such parole evidence, without producing to the jury one of the original advertisements, or a copy thereof. The chief justice overruled the exception, and admitted the evidence, and directed the jury that the evidence was legal and proper to authorize them to find the issue on trial in favor of the said executor, without the production of such original advertisement, or an original copy thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">A verdict being accordingly rendered for the defendant, the action stood continued <em>nisi </em>for the consideration of the said objection ; and at the following March term in <em>Suffolk, </em>the opinion of <em>the Court </em>was delivered to the following effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">By the statute of 1788, c. 66, \u00a7 I, it is provided that every executor or administrator, undertaking the trust, shall cause notifications thereof to be posted up, within three months, in the town where the deceased was resident and had his habitancy at the time of his death; and shall give such further notice as the Court of Probate shall direct: \u201can affidavit of the executor or administrator, made and filed in the same Probate Court, within seven months after undertaking that trust, accompanied with an original notification, * (or a copy thereof,) recorded in the probate office, shall be admitted as evidence of the time, place, and manner notice was given. By \u00a7 3, of the same act, no executor or administrator shall be held to answer to the suit of any creditor of his testator or intestate, unless the same shall have been originally commenced within three years (extended to four years by statute of 1791, <em>c. </em>28) from his giving bond for the faithful discharge of his trust; with certain exceptions, not bearing on the case at bar, provided such executor or administrator shall have given the public notice required by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In the case before us, the defendant proved that he had posted the notifications prescribed by the statute, but it did not appear that he had made and filed an affidavit of such posting in the probate office. This particular provision of the statute was introduced for the convenience of the executor or administrator. Other evidence of the fact may properly be received, and, if satisfactory to the jury, is of the same avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\"><em>Judgment on the </em>verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
