Perhaps it would be better in * all cases to hold the libellant strictly to those charges. But such has not heretofore been the practice of the Court; and where, as in this case, there is an appearance for the respondent, such strictness may be less necessary. _ The evidence is admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">\n<em>Divorce decreed</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
