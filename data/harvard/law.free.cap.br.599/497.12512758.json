After filing an Amended Answer to Count I of the Amended Complaint and a Motion to Dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint (collectively \"Second Motion to Dismiss\") and an Amended Answer to Count II of the Amended Complaint (\"Amended Count II Answer\"), Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss the Adversary Proceeding (\"\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss\").

Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 3, 2015, Defendant filed her Chapter 7 voluntary bankruptcy petition (5:15-bk-02377-RNO). On September 8, 2015, Plaintiffs initiated this Adversary Proceeding (5:15-ap-00144-RNO) by filing a five-count Adversary Complaint (\"Complaint\"). The Complaint sought non-dischargeability of Plaintiffs' claim pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(6), objected to Defendant's discharge citing various subsections of \u00a7 727(a), and requested attorney's fees and costs incurred in bringing the Complaint. On September 25, 2015, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss (\"First Motion to Dismiss\") the Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 13, 2016, after both Plaintiffs and Defendant filed briefs, a hearing was held on the First Motion to Dismiss. On October 21, 2016, I entered my Opinion and Judgment (\"October 21 Opinion\") which denied Defendant's First Motion to Dismiss as to Plaintiffs' Count I \u00a7 523(a)(6) claim.\n   <em>\n    In re Florimonte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344718\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/558/703/#p708\">\n    558 B.R. 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 708-09 (Bankr.

On December 8, 2016, Defendant filed another motion to dismiss which she superseded on December 20, 2016, by filing her Second Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). On January 4, 2017, this Adversary Proceeding and Defendant's main Chapter 7 bankruptcy case were reassigned to the Honorable John J. Thomas in the interests of judicial economy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After both Plaintiffs and Defendant again filed briefs, Judge Thomas denied Defendant's Second Motion to Dismiss, holding that Plaintiffs' Count II claim was supported by sufficient allegations. Additionally, Judge Thomas directed Defendant to file, by March 9, 2017, an answer to Count II of the Amended Complaint. On February 28, 2017, Defendant filed her Amended Count II Answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 29, 2019, Defendant's counsel, Thomas J. Jones, Esquire, filed a Motion to Withdraw (\"Motion to Withdraw\") at the request of Defendant. Subsequently, a hearing on the Motion to Withdraw was scheduled for February 5, 2019. Before this hearing could be held, Defendant, now in her own\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   capacity, filed her\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss on January 30, 2019. At the February 5, 2019 hearing, Judge Thomas denied the Motion to Withdraw and directed Plaintiffs to file a response to the\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss within seven days. On February 12, 2019, Plaintiffs filed an Answer &amp; Motion to Strike the\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 13, 2019, due to the untimely passing of Judge John J. Thomas, the case was reassigned to me. After reviewing the docket, I find that Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss is ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Del. Jan. 6, 2011). Plaintiff, Chase Bank, responded by arguing the law of the case doctrine because the Delaware district court, under Judge Farnan, had already denied a similar, if not identical, motion a few years prior. In the subsequent proceeding, Judge Stark agreed with Chase Bank's argument and held that there was no reason to depart from Judge Farnan's earlier rulings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%2045132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Christianson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p816\">\n    486 U.S. at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p816\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

After a thorough analysis under Rule 12(g)(2) and Rule 12(h)(2)(B), the court held that Rule 12(g)(2) did not bar the defendant's Rule 12(c) motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156844\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/801/429/#p433\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156844\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/801/429/#p433\">\n    at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, without specifically citing the law of the case doctrine, the court also held that it would not \"reconsider issues that it addressed fully at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage,\" which implies the applicability of the doctrine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156844\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/801/429/#p433\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Villescas v.

Additionally, I find that Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss\n   does not affect my prior findings as to the plausibility of Count I in the Amended Complaint. Therefore, my October 21 Opinion denying the First Motion to Dismiss as to Count I of the original Complaint is the law of the case, and I will deny Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss as to Count I of the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Count II in the Amended Complaint was originally Count III in the original Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Compl. 6-7, ECF No. 1\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Am.

Even though I granted Defendant's First Motion to Dismiss as to Count III of the original Complaint in my October 21 Opinion, Op. 9-10, ECF No. 37, Judge Thomas entered an order which denied Defendant's Second Motion to Dismiss as to Count II of the Amended Complaint because Count II of the Amended Complaint stated a claim which was supported by sufficient allegations, Order 2, ECF No. 48. I also conclude that, under the law of the case doctrine, the\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss does not affect the sufficiency of the allegations in Count II of the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As mentioned above, courts do have the discretion to revisit prior decisions of its own or of a coordinate court.\n   <em>\n    Christianson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p816\">\n    486 U.S. at 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224266\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/800/#p816\">\n    108 S.Ct. at 2178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
