Broadly speaking, the Complaint seeks the return of a deposit of $ 14,330,000.00 received by Debtor as part of the sale of Debtor's property, where the money was subsequently transferred to other parties as part of a series of complicated transactions involving one of Debtor's members. These subsequent transactions-unrelated to the sale of Debtor's property-form the foundation of Plaintiff's avoidance claims, fraudulent transfer claims, and claims seeking disallowance of creditor proofs of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     The Debtor\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to Debtor filing for bankruptcy, Chaim Miller was one of Debtor's members. Complaint \u00b6 1. The only other member of Debtor was Chun Peter Dong, who was Debtor's managing member.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. However, Miller sometimes acted on behalf of Debtor with Samuel Sprei, his business partner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 41-42, 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Debtor's sole asset was a vacant eighty-four unit condominium located at 45-49 John Street, New York, New York (the \"Property\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Debtor had purchased the Property in 2014 for the sum of $ 60,000,000.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Debtor financed its purchase of the Property with three mortgage loans in the aggregate principal amount of $ 49,500,000.00 (the \"Madison Mortgage Loans\") from affiliates of Madison Realty Capital (\"Madison\"), a lender with which Miller had financed several other real estate transactions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Zhu Buy-Out and the Agreement to Sell the Property\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the same time, Miller and Sprei also were involved in other real estate dealings unrelated to Debtor. In 2014, Miller and Sprei contracted to complete a $ 31,000,000.00 buy-out of the membership interests of Miller's other partner, Defendant Bo Jin Zhu, in four limited liability companies unrelated to Debtor, each of which owned a separate commercial property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. In May 12, 2014, Miller and Sprei entered into a contract (the \"Zhu Buy-Out Contract\") with Zhu's assignee, Defendant Renatus Portfolio Company, LLC (\"Renatus\"), to buy-out Zhu's interests in limited liability companies that owned the following four real properties: 97 Grand Avenue, 203-205 North 8th Street, 32-34 Fifth Avenue,\n   and 29 Ryerson Street (collectively, the \"Buy-Out Properties\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under the Zhu Buy-Out Contract, Miller and Sprei paid an initial deposit of $ 7,000,000.00 against a total buy-out price of $ 31,000,000.00; the balance was to be paid at a closing scheduled for August 11, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. As this August closing date neared, counsel for Miller and Sprei negotiated an extension of the closing date with Renatus to September 15, 2014 in consideration of an additional deposit of $ 1,500,000.00 (the \"Extension Payment\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While the extension was for the benefit of Miller and Sprei, the Extension Payment was actually made by another individual-Defendant Joseph Brunner-using funds from two entities controlled by Brunner: Defendant Silver Gold Group LLC (\"SGG\") and non-party Brooklyn Realty Holdings, LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 77. By the end of August 2014, counsel for Miller and Sprei were unable to raise the remainder of the purchase price needed to consummate the Zhu Buy-Out Contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Thereafter, Miller and Sprei attempted to obtain the necessary funds by, among other things, contracting to sell the Property and refinancing three of the Zhu Buy-Out Properties, as well as another property controlled by Miller.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Sprei and counsel for Debtor ultimately negotiated an Agreement of Purchase and Sale (\"PSA\") to sell the Property to HS 45 John LLC (\"HS 45\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49. The PSA provided for a down payment totaling $ 14,330,000.00 (the \"PSA Down Payment\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. However, the PSA did not require that the PSA Down Payment be placed in escrow, a fact which was unknown to Debtor's other members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 19, 2014 (the \"Contract Date\"), Miller executed the PSA with HS 45 on behalf of Debtor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. The total purchase price was $ 64,500,000.00, including the PSA Down Payment and an amount equal to the unpaid outstanding mortgage indebtedness not to exceed $ 47,000,000.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52, 54. Miller executed the PSA without the knowledge or consent of either Dong, Debtor's managing member, or Debtor's other investors who collectively held a 41 percent membership interest in Debtor (the \"41% Investors\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. On the very same day the PSA was executed, Miller and Sprei took the PSA Down Payment and transferred all but $ 1,000,000.00 (the \"Adjusted Down Payment\") to Riverside Abstract Company (\"Riverside\") to fund the Zhu Buy-Out; the remaining $ 1,000,000.00 was previously transferred directly to Defendant Meridian Capital Group LLC (\"Meridian\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 54, 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When Dong and the 41% Investors learned of the unauthorized PSA, Miller and Sprei provided Debtor's other members with a fabricated letter to conceal their theft of the PSA Down Payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. The letter (the \"Quick Title Letter\") was purportedly from Quick Title Search, LLC (\"Quick Title\"), signed by Abraham Teitelbaum, and addressed to Miller.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It stated that Quick Title \"is still holding on behalf of Harry Miller the proceeds from a 1031 exchange in the amount of $ 12,453,980.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sprei later testified that the Quick Title Letter was simply a hoax, as Quick Title never held any of the proceeds of the PSA Down Payment and never had any dealings with Miller or Sprei.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also testified that the Quick Title Letter was created by a \"friend\" without the knowledge of any of Quick Title's employees or principals, including Mr. Teitelbaum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sprei further testified that he provided Dong and the 41% Investors with the Quick Title Letter to \"soothe\" the \"Asian Group\" (i.e., Debtor's other members) who were alarmed at the unauthorized sale of the Property and the prospect\n   that Miller and Sprei might \"run off\" with the PSA Down Payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To provide additional funds for the Zhu Buy-Out, Miller and Sprei also arranged for mezzanine financing from Madison on three of the Zhu Buy-Out Properties and a fourth property which Miller controlled (the \"Collateral Properties Financing\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. The Collateral Properties Financing netted Miller and Sprei the sum of $ 16,073,911.00 in addition to the PSA Down Payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Disbursement of the Adjusted Down Payment and Collateral Properties Financing to the Ultimate Beneficiaries\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Central to the allegations of the Complaint is the disposition of the funds collected by Miller and Sprei for the Zhu Buy-Out, including the PSA Down Payment. In addition to the Adjusted Down Payment given to Riverside, $ 16,073,911.98 was also transferred to Riverside from the Collateral Properties Financing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. In total, Riverside held $ 29,403,911.98 (the \"Total Buy-Out Proceeds\") in order to effectuate the Zhu Buy-Out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Once received by Riverside, the funds were disbursed to a variety of individuals. The Total Buy-Out Proceeds were transferred by Riverside as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   a) $ 19,672,687.23 to Herrick Feinstein, LLP (\"Herrick\"), in its capacity as counsel for Renatus, under the Zhu Buy-Out Contract (the \"Herrick Escrow\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   b) $ 2,827,312.77 to Mega International Commercial Bank (\"Mega Transfer\" and the \"Mega,\" respectively);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   c) $ 2,850,000.00 back to GWFG, as HS 45's attorneys' fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   d) $ 2,000,000.00 to the Congregation (the \"Congregation Transfer\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   e) $ 500,000.00 to Meridian;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   f) $ 500,000.00 to Reliable Abstract Co., LLC (\"Reliable\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   g) $ 583,570.98 remained in escrow with Riverside;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   h) $ 242,000.00 to Image Capital, LLC;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   i) $ 227,341.00 to Riverside; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   j) $ 1,000.00 to the title closer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Once received by these parties, the funds were sometimes further disbursed to others. For example, an officer of Renatus directed Herrick to distribute the Herrick Escrow to: a) Treff &amp; Lowy, PLLC (\"T &amp; L\"), a law firm, in the amount of $ 5,600,000.00 (the \"T &amp; L Transfer\"); b) $ 1,000,000.00 to Defendant Abraham Mandel; and c) $ 13,072,687.23 to SGG (the \"SGG Transfer\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.

This is particularly crucial given that there was a great deal of confusion caused by the conduct of Miller and Sprei in the days leading up to the HS 45 bankruptcy. This is something that the Court experienced firsthand in the contentious litigation in that bankruptcy case involving Miller and Sprei. Given the fact that Plaintiff makes a prima facie allegation that the transfer to Reliable was part and parcel of the fraudulent transfers at issue in this case, the Court considers it premature to evaluate the statement in question until a more fulsome factual record has been presented to the Court. Complaint \u00b6 62(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In the next argument, Zhu argues that the safe harbor of Section 546(e) of the Bankruptcy Code applies to most of the causes of action related to the Mega Transfer of $ 2,827,312.77. Zhu Motion at 8-12 (citing safe harbor to seek dismissal of all but the intentional fraudulent transfer causes of action under Section 548(a)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code ). The safe harbor provision under\n   Section 546(e) of the Bankruptcy Code provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Notwithstanding [S]ections 544, 545, 547, 548(a)(1)(B), and 548(b) of [the Bankruptcy Code], the trustee may not avoid a transfer that is a margin payment, ... or settlement payment ..., made by or to (or for the benefit of) a commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, financial participant, or securities clearing agency, or that is a transfer made by or to (or for the benefit of) a commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, financial participant, or securities clearing agency, in connection with a securities contract ..., commodity contract ..., or forward contract, that is made before the commencement of the case, except under section 548(a)(1)(A) of [the Bankruptcy Code].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20546\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Zhu argues that the safe harbor applies here because Mega qualifies as a financial institution, that the ownership interests in the Zhu Buy-Out qualify as securities, and that proceeds of the Zhu Buy-Out were partially transferred to Mega.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zhu Motion at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   But any dismissal of this case based on the safe harbor is premature. Section 546(e) provides defendants with an affirmative defense, and unless this affirmative defense is \"clearly established on the face of the complaint,\" invocation of the safe harbor does not defeat a plaintiff's otherwise valid complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Picard v. Merkin (In re Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Sec.

N.D. Ohio June 16, 2009) ). The Court cannot conclude on these facts, construed in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, that the safe harbor affirmative defense has been clearly established. The Complaint does not establish, for example, that the ownership interests in the Zhu Buy-Out qualify as securities. Moreover, Plaintiff's opposition here raises questions about whether the sole purpose of the Mega Transfer was to satisfy Zhu's pre-existing debts from the Crown Mansion Loan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opposition at 29-30. The Complaint specifies that after the Mega Transfer, the UCC-1 filing statement filed against Zhu was terminated, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that Mega knew about or participated in the transfers at issue in this case. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 60-62, 71-74. Further development of the record will allow the Court to determine if there were multiple purposes underlying these transfers, as Zhu contends. Zhu Reply at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court also notes that the state of the law on the safe harbor provisions in this Circuit is in flux. After the conclusion of briefing in this case, the Supreme Court issued an opinion that effectively overruled a number of precedents cited in Zhu's papers regarding the safe harbor provisions.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merit Mgmt.

The Court looks forward to additional briefing on the issue at an appropriate time in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Zhu next argues that the sale of the Property for $ 73,000,000 in the HS 45 bankruptcy case served to satisfy any\n   claims that Plaintiff had for fraudulent transfers of Plaintiff's property against Defendants. Zhu Motion at 17. If Plaintiff's fraudulent transfer claims were satisfied by this transaction, recovery of the fraudulent transfers in this action would constitute an impermissible double recovery under Section 550(d) of the Bankruptcy Code. Under section 550(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor in possession may recover \"only a single satisfaction under [ section 550(a) ].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Section 550(a) in turn provides that \"to the extent that a transfer is avoided under [S]ection 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, 553(b), or 724(a) [of the Bankruptcy Code], the trustee may recover, for the benefit of the estate, the property transferred, or, if the court so orders, the value of such property ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). \"Thus, although the trustee can sue many defendants, his total recovery is limited to the initial transfer or its value.\"\n   <em>\n    Sec.

S.D.N.Y. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Zhu's Section 550(d) argument misses the mark in at least two ways. First, Zhu's argument does not comport with the plain language of Section 550(d). Section 550(d) only applies where transfers have already been avoided and recovered under Section 550(a) and one of its triggering sections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re CNB Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782361\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/440/31/#p45\">\n    440 B.R. 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45-46 (W.D.N.Y. 2010) (\"Under the plain language of [ Section 550(d) ], [t]he trustee is entitled to only a single satisfaction under [ Section 550(a) ].... But the amounts recovered by the Trust in settlement from other parties are independent of the amount of [the defendant's liability] ....\") (citations and internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Second, even if Plaintiff's claims had been settled away as part of the HS 45 plan of reorganization and global settlement, Zhu has not sufficiently proven that he deserves the relief he seeks. Simply put, Zhu has not articulated how the sale in the HS 45 bankruptcy case satisfies the claims in this case. Zhu Motion at 17 (arguing that the claims in this case have been satisfied by the HS 45 plan and settlement but citing nothing in support of that proposition). The plan and settlement in that case involved many parties and many claims. It is unclear to the Court, based on the record and arguments presented here, that the HS 45 plan or settlement satisfied the claims in this adversary proceeding. There is nothing in the Complaint or in Zhu's submissions to demonstrate that Section 550(a) provides a basis for dismissal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     Dismissal in Favor of Reliable's Underlying Proof of Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   One Defendant, Reliable, argues that the Court should dismiss the causes of action against it in favor of litigating its underlying proof of claim separately. Reliable Motion at 8-11. In support of Reliable's argument, it cites\n   Section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and the Court's inherent power to control its docket. While the Court does possess equitable powers, it does not think it is appropriate to grant the requested relief. Dismissing the causes of action against Reliable in favor of adjudicating these issues in a claims litigation process does not simplify the litigation before the Court, it merely repackages the dispute. Moreover, a separate claims litigation process for Reliable is inefficient given that there are common issues of law and fact in this case among all Defendants that must be decided regardless of whether Reliable's proof of claim is approved in whole or in part. Complaint \u00b6 62. The Court sympathizes that Reliable has been litigating these issues for some time before this adversary proceeding was filed and indeed even before Plaintiff's bankruptcy. Reliable's desire for closure, however, does not trump the Bankruptcy Code's overarching goal of efficiently administering the estate of a debtor. This is one instance where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (Paramount Pictures 1982).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n    <em>\n     Dismissal of Counts Seeking Disallowance of Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Last but not least, Defendants seek dismissal of the disallowance causes of action because Defendants, other than Reliable, have not filed proofs of claims in this case and thus those causes of action are premature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zhu Motion at 18; Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 517-19.

(In re Vivaro Corp.)\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338414\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/524/536/#p551\">\n     524 B.R. 536\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 551 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2015) (\"If the absence of fair consideration is properly alleged, then the court may presume insolvency and the burden shifts to the defendants to rebut it.\") (applying New York law).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    In any event, the fact that some or all of the funds fraudulently transferred away from Debtor ultimately made its way back to Debtor pre-petition would not necessarily prevent a recovery in this action. One of the cases cited by Zhu indicates the existence of a circuit split on this issue.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kingsley v. Wetzel (In re Kingsley)\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556933\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/874/#p877\">\n     518 F.3d 874\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 877-78 (11th Cir. 2008). The Seventh Circuit, for example, has held that it is irrelevant, for purposes of calculating damages, that funds fraudulently transferred from the debtor were ultimately returned to the debtor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nostalgia Network, Inc. v. Lockwood\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376191\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/717/#p720\">\n     315 F.3d 717\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 720 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"If it was gratuitous, the fact that some or for that matter all of it may later have seeped back to the debtor does not legitimize the transfer.\"). The Seventh Circuit's position has been favorably cited by courts in this district.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tronox Inc. v. Kerr McGee Corp. (In re Tronox Inc.)\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3666732\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/503/239/\">\n     503 B.R. 239\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 332 n.121 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2013).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    Two arguments made by Defendant Meridian do not seek dismissal: 1) that Plaintiff's claims should be capped in amounts above the value of allowed claims; and 2) that these proceedings should be stayed until the proofs of claim in this case are fully adjudicated.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Meridian Motion at 8. Both of these arguments seek procedural relief that is best addressed at a status conference in the first instance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
