In addition, the bankruptcy court, sua sponte, dismissed the chapter 7 trustee's complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) \"for failure to state plausible claims\" under \u00a7\u00a7 544 and\n   551.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the bankruptcy court did not commit error either by denying the relief sought by the chapter 7 trustee or by dismissing the complaint. For the reasons set forth below, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts relied upon by the bankruptcy court are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Pre-Petition Events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Eduardo Rivera Mercado (the \"Debtor\") acquired real property in Orocovis, Puerto Rico (the \"Property\") in 2002. In 2014, he executed a note in the amount of $ 104,923, and granted a mortgage (the \"Mortgage\") on the Property in favor of Metro Island Mortgage Inc. (\"Metro Island\"). Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (\"BPPR\") is the current holder of the note and Mortgage. Neither Metro Island nor BPPR ever presented the Mortgage to the Puerto Rico Property Registry (the \"Property Registry\") for recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Bankruptcy Filing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Debtor filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in December 2015. On his schedules, he listed a \"50% interest\" in the Property (which he valued at $ 136,000) and claimed a homestead exemption under Puerto Rico law of \"100% of [the] fair market value\" of the Property. He also listed BPPR as holding a claim in the amount of $ 99,926 secured by the Property, and he indicated his intention to retain the Property and \"pay pursuant to contract.\" BPPR filed a proof of claim asserting a secured claim in the amount of $ 99,373.86 based on a \"mortgage loan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Debtor received a chapter 7 discharge in March 2016. In December 2017 (one month after the Trustee filed the complaint commencing the subject adversary proceeding), the Debtor filed a motion seeking an order compelling the Trustee to abandon the Property, indicating that the Property \"serves as collateral over a mortgage loan duly registered in the Property Registry of Puerto Rico,\" and that there was \"no liquidation value\" to benefit the estate. No objections were filed, and the bankruptcy court granted the motion on January 4, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Adversary Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In November 2017, the Trustee filed a two-count complaint against BPPR. In Count I, the Trustee raised two grounds for avoiding the Mortgage. First, he asserted that the Mortgage, which was not presented to the Property Registry for recording before the bankruptcy filing, was a post-petition transfer of an interest in real property which he could avoid under \u00a7 549(a). Alternatively, the Trustee argued that, as the mortgage lien was not properly perfected against the Property as of the date of the Debtor's bankruptcy filing, he was entitled under \u00a7 544(a) to avoid the lien \"as a hypothetical lien creditor and a bona fide purchaser who perfected his right as of the date of the filing[.]\" In Count II, the Trustee asserted that, as the Mortgage was voidable under either\n   \u00a7 544 or \u00a7 549, the lien was \"preserved in favor of the [e]state\" under \u00a7 551.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. BPPR's Answer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its answer, BPPR admitted most of the factual allegations (including that the Mortgage \"was never filed before the Property Registry before the filing of the petition\"), but denied any allegation that there was a \"post-petition transfer,\" a \"lien to be avoided,\" or an \"enforceable mortgage.\" BPPR also raised numerous affirmative defenses, including that the Debtor's execution of the Mortgage in May 2014 \"was not a post-petition transfer\" and \"did not create a lien that may be avoided.\" It also asserted as an affirmative defense that the complaint failed to include the Debtor, who had claimed a homestead exemption with respect to the Property, as \"an indispensable party.\" BPPR did not pose an affirmative defense under Rule 12(b)(6) that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In February 2018, the Trustee moved for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), contending that the relevant facts were uncontested and he was entitled as a matter of law to avoid the unrecorded Mortgage under either \u00a7 549 or \u00a7 544, and preserve it for the benefit of the estate under \u00a7 551. Again, the Trustee asserted two alternative grounds for avoiding the Mortgage. He first argued that, although the Mortgage was never presented to the Property Registry prior to the filing of the petition, it could be presented to the Property Registry \"at any time.\" Therefore, he contended, the Mortgage \"represent[ed] a post-petition transfer of property without authorization of the [c]ourt\" which he could avoid under \u00a7 549. Beyond quoting \u00a7 549, the Trustee did not provide any legal support for his argument that the unrecorded Mortgage constituted a post-petition transfer of property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the alternative, the Trustee argued that the unrecorded Mortgage was \"unperfected\" under Puerto Rico law as of the petition date and, therefore, it was voidable under \u00a7 544. In support of this argument, he cited two cases he claimed were \"identical\" to the present one. First, he cited\n   <em>\n    Segarra v. Banco Popular de P.R. (In re Matienzo Lopez)\n   </em>\n   , Adv. Pro. No. 16-00123, Docket No. 42 (Bankr. D.P.R. Aug. 23, 2017) (hereinafter, \"\n   <em>\n    Matienzo Lopez\n   </em>\n   \"), where the court ruled, without discussion, that the bank's unrecorded mortgage was avoidable under \u00a7 544 and preserved in favor of the estate pursuant to \u00a7 551. Second, he relied on\n   <em>\n    DeGiacomo v. Traverse (In re Traverse)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071936,5917431\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/19/\">\n    753 F.3d 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (1st Cir. 2014) (hereinafter, \"\n   <em>\n    Traverse\n   </em>\n   \"), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled, in a case that originated in Massachusetts, that a trustee could avoid and preserve a creditor's \"unperfected lien\" on the debtor's property for the benefit of the estate. As to his cause of action under \u00a7 551, the Trustee, again citing\n   <em>\n    Traverse\n   </em>\n   , asserted that he was entitled to preserve the \"unrecorded lien\" for the benefit of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Trustee requested that the bankruptcy court enter a judgment: (1) determining that the Mortgage was an \"avoidable transfer\" pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 544 and 549; (2) preserving the \"mortgage lien\" in favor of the estate pursuant to \u00a7 551; and (3) granting \"any other remedy\" the bankruptcy court deemed appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. BPPR's Opposition to Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   BPPR opposed the motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the Trustee's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Traverse\n   </em>\n   was misplaced\n   in light of contrary legal authority. Specifically, BPPR cited\n   <em>\n    Segarra v. Schwarz Reitman (In re Schwarz Reitman)\n   </em>\n   , Adv. Pro. No. 15-00020 (MCF), Docket No. 56 (Bankr. D.P.R. Nov. 29, 2016) (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    Schwarz Reitman\n   </em>\n   \"), in which the bankruptcy court ruled that the trustee was \"unable to utilize [\u00a7\u00a7] 544 and 551 [to avoid an unrecorded mortgage in Puerto Rico] because those sections [only] apply when there is [an] unperfected security interest in property,\" and, under Puerto Rico law, an unrecorded mortgage is a nullity. The\n   <em>\n    Schwarz Reitman\n   </em>\n   court also determined that\n   <em>\n    Traverse\n   </em>\n   was inapplicable because it was based on the effect of an unrecorded mortgage under Massachusetts law. BPPR pointed out that the Trustee \"did not acknowledge or distinguish\" the court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Schwarz Reitman\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On June 15, 2018, the bankruptcy court, without a hearing, entered the Order denying the Trustee's request for judgment on the pleadings and sua sponte dismissing the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Segarra Miranda v. Banco Popular de P.R. (In re Rivera Mercado)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511914\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/224/#p229\">\n    587 B.R. 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229 (Bankr. D.P.R. 2018). The bankruptcy court concluded that the unrecorded Mortgage did not constitute a \"transfer\" which could be avoided and preserved under \u00a7\u00a7 544 and 551. The court observed that, under Puerto Rico law, \"the recording of a mortgage is a necessary prerequisite to the creation of a valid lien,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511914\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/224/#p229\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511914\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/224/#p229\">\n    at 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and \"a mortgage is [non]existent unless it is registered.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511914\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/224/#p229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511914\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/224/#p229\">\n    at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In a lien theory jurisdiction, such as Puerto Rico, the mortgagee does not obtain title transfer of the real property. In fact, the lender must record the mortgage deed in the Property Registry to acquire a security interest over the real property. P.R.

However, an unperfected mortgage deed does not entitle the mortgagee the right to foreclose on the property in Puerto Rico.

We must consider whether both rulings are part of this appeal. Although the Trustee's notice of appeal and statement of the issues focused on the dismissal of the complaint without mentioning the denial of the motion for judgment on the pleadings, his subsequent filings in the appeal make it clear that he intended to appeal both rulings. Moreover, BPPR acknowledged both rulings in its brief and, therefore, it has not been misled by the notice of appeal. Consequently, this appeal encompasses both the denial of the motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) and the dismissal of the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bellas Pavers, LLC v.

As discussed below, the court in\n   <em>\n    Schwarz Reitman\n   </em>\n   held that the trustee cannot avoid and preserve an unrecorded Puerto Rico mortgage. Moreover, although another bankruptcy judge in the District of Puerto Rico initially held that a chapter 7 trustee could avoid and preserve an unrecorded Puerto Rico mortgage, he subsequently reversed his position and, thereafter, has consistently held that the trustee could not avoid and preserve an unrecorded Puerto Rico mortgage under \u00a7\u00a7 544 and 551.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    (i)\n    <em>\n     Schwarz Reitman\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Schwarz Reitman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the judge ruled that a chapter 7 trustee could not avoid and preserve an unrecorded Puerto Rico mortgage under \u00a7\u00a7 544 and 551.

As noted earlier, because Massachusetts is a title theory state, an unrecorded mortgage in Massachusetts still provides a lender with an interest in the real property-a lien within the meaning of \u00a7 101(37) -albeit an unperfected one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9185116\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/315/636/#p640\">\n    315 B.R. 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2004). In stark contrast, in Puerto Rico, a mortgage does not provide the mortgagee with title to the mortgaged property, and an unrecorded mortgage is \"nonexistent\" and a \"nullity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%2030%2C%20%C2%A7%202607\">\n    P.R.

Therefore, an unrecorded mortgage in Puerto Rico does not provide a lender with an unperfected lien or security interest in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Consequently, contrary to the Trustee's assertions, the relevant Massachusetts and Puerto Rico mortgage laws are not \"identical,\" and the Trustee has failed to demonstrate that the bankruptcy court erred in declining to follow\n   <em>\n    Traverse\n   </em>\n   or distinguishing the facts of\n   <em>\n    Traverse\n   </em>\n   from those presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) The Trustee Ignores\n    <em>\n     Schwarz Reitman\n    </em>\n    and Its Progeny\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Trustee's argument is also flawed because he overlooks\n   <em>\n    Schwarz Reitman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rosas Garcia\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Lopez Cancel\n   </em>\n   . These cases unequivocally hold that an unrecorded mortgage in Puerto Rico is \"nonexistent\" and does not give rise to a property interest. Although the Trustee cursorily acknowledges in a footnote in his brief that some \"contrary decisions exist,\" he does not attempt to distinguish this recent case law in any way, nor does he recognize the differences between Massachusetts and Puerto Rico law which drive the holdings in those decisions. Rather, he simply states that he \"disagree[s]\" with the bankruptcy court's reliance on \"those contrary decisions.\" It is the Trustee's burden to demonstrate that the bankruptcy court erred in its analysis. He has failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err in ruling under Rule 12(c) that the Trustee did not state a plausible claim for avoiding the unrecorded Mortgage under \u00a7 544 and preserving it under \u00a7 551.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Applying the Standard for Avoidance Under \u00a7 549\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Trustee also argues that the Mortgage was avoidable as a post-petition transfer under \u00a7 549. Section 549(a) provides that \"the trustee may avoid a transfer of property of the estate ... that occurs\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the commencement of the case; and ... that is not authorized under this title or by the court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20549\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). According to the Trustee, because BPPR could present the Mortgage to the Property Registry \"at any time,\" the Mortgage \"represents a post-petition transfer of property without authorization of the [c]ourt.\" This argument also lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As discussed at length above, recording is a \"constitutive\" act for a mortgage in Puerto Rico and, therefore, a mortgage is ineffective-and does not transfer a property interest or create a lien on the property-until it is presented to the Property Registry for recording.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soto-Rios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193180,3850503\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/112/\">\n    662 F.3d at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . BPPR\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   presented the Mortgage for recording at the Property Registry-neither before the commencement of this case, nor after. Therefore, no post-petition transfer could ever have occurred as required by \u00a7 549. Even if BPPR could, \"at any time,\" in the future present the Mortgage to the Property Registry for recording, the occurrence of any such act is purely speculative and does not transform the pre-petition execution of the Mortgage into a post-petition transfer made without authorization of the bankruptcy court. The Trustee cites no authority for the proposition that a mortgage presentation or recording that has yet to occur and may never occur falls within the meaning of a post-petition transfer contemplated by \u00a7 549.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20549\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Therefore, the bankruptcy court did not err in ruling under Rule 12(c) that the Trustee failed to state plausible claims for avoiding the unrecorded Mortgage under \u00a7 549 and preserving it under \u00a7 551.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Therefore, it follows that a determination under Rule 12(c) that the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the uncontested facts is essentially a determination that the plaintiff has failed to establish plausible claims for relief, which is the basis for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cox v.

As such, the bankruptcy court did not err in concluding that the Trustee failed to state a colorable claim for relief under \u00a7\u00a7 544, 549, and 551, and dismissing the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err in ruling that the Trustee failed to state plausible claims for avoiding the unrecorded Mortgage under \u00a7 544 and 549 and preserving it under \u00a7 551.
