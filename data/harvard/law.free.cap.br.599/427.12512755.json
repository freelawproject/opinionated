Kirby (\"Mr. Kirby\") appeals from the bankruptcy court's order (the \"Order\") granting summary judgment in favor of 21st Mortgage Corporation (\"21st Mortgage\") on his complaint alleging that post-discharge communications from 21st Mortgage were attempts to collect a discharged debt in violation of \u00a7 524(a)(2)'s discharge injunction and the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (\"FDCPA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Kirby asserts that the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of 21st Mortgage because: (1) there were genuine issues of material fact which required a trial; and (2) 21st Mortgage failed to establish that its post-discharge\n   correspondence did not violate the discharge injunction as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Discerning no error, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Kirby and his wife (the \"Kirbys\") previously owned real property in Brewer, Maine (the \"Brewer Property\"), subject to a mortgage lien securing a promissory note held by 21st Mortgage. When the Kirbys defaulted on their obligations under the note, 21st Mortgage commenced a state court foreclosure action against them, and the case was promptly transferred to the Foreclosure Diversion Program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The day before the initial mediation session scheduled for August 28, 2014, the Kirbys commenced a voluntary bankruptcy case by filing a petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In their bankruptcy schedules, the Kirbys disclosed their interest in the Brewer Property\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and listed 21st Mortgage as the holder of a $ 343,619 claim secured by a lien on the Brewer Property. The Kirbys' schedules also reflected their intent to retain the Brewer Property and \"to explore modification.\" The Kirbys did not reaffirm the debt to 21st Mortgage. They received chapter 7 discharges pursuant \u00a7 727(a) (relieving them of personal liability for the debt to 21st Mortgage) on December 4, 2014. As 21st Mortgage concedes, it received notice of the entry of the Kirbys' discharges, and the bankruptcy case was closed shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the entry of the Kirbys' discharges, the parties resumed mediation under the state court Foreclosure Diversion Program. Between December 2014 and October 2015, the parties engaged in extensive efforts to mediate an alternative to foreclosure. During this ten-month period, the parties participated in three court-sponsored mediation sessions, and the Kirbys pursued other loss mitigation options with 21st Mortgage. Ultimately, the parties were unable to reach a resolution and the case was returned to the foreclosure docket. In October 2016, the state court entered a judgment of foreclosure in favor of 21st Mortgage, and the Brewer Property was sold at a foreclosure auction in February 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   But matters did not end there. In March 2017, the bankruptcy case was reopened at Mr. Kirby's request and Mr. Kirby filed a two-count complaint seeking damages against 21st Mortgage on account of his claims that post-discharge written correspondence sent by 21st Mortgage regarding the defaulted loan violated the discharge injunction imposed by \u00a7 524(a)(2) of the Code and certain provisions of the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Events and Correspondence During the Mediation Period\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The majority of 21st Mortgage's post-discharge communications were sent between\n   December 2014 and October 2015, while the parties were engaged in mediation and loss mitigation efforts (the \"mediation period\"). During this period, 21st Mortgage sent nineteen written communications-eight letters relating to Mr. Kirby's request for a loan modification, nine periodic mortgage statements, and two other \"mortgage servicing\" notices. All of these communications were addressed to Mr. Kirby in the care of his bankruptcy counsel, J. Scott Logan, at Attorney Logan's place of business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The specific correspondence is described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Monthly Mortgage Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During the mediation period, 21st Mortgage sent nine monthly mortgage statements, each of which set forth an amount due and a due date, indicated that a late fee would be charged if the payment was not received, and included a payment coupon. At the top of the second page, the statements provided: \"This is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose.\" (\"Collection Notice\"). Each statement also contained the following bankruptcy disclaimer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    NOTICE\n   </strong>\n   : Please be advised further that this letter constitutes neither demand for payment of the captioned debt nor a notice of personal liability to any recipient hereof who might have received discharge of such debt in accordance with applicable bankruptcy laws or who might be subject to automatic stay of Section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. This letter is being sent to any such parties merely to comply with applicable state law governing foreclosure of liens pursuant to contractual powers of sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. ARM Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In January 2015, 21st Mortgage sent a notice (the \"ARM Notice\") regarding changes to the interest rate on the adjustable rate mortgage. The notice included the current and estimated new interest rates and monthly payments, a payment amount and due date, the loan balance, and the remaining loan term. The letter contained a Collection Notice, but did not include a bankruptcy disclaimer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. PMI Disclosure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Also in January 2015, 21st Mortgage sent an annual private mortgage insurance disclosure (the \"PMI Disclosure\"), informing Mr. Kirby of his rights under federal law regarding the cancellation or termination of his private mortgage insurance. It contained a Collection Notice and the same bankruptcy disclaimer as that contained in the mortgage statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Loss Mitigation Letters\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In April 2015, while mediation was ongoing, the Kirbys submitted a \"Making Home Affordable Program Request for Mortgage Assistance\" application requesting a loan modification (the \"RMA application\"). 21st Mortgage sent four letters relating to the application and a fifth letter informing the Kirbys that they did not qualify for a loan modification because the Brewer Property was not their primary\n   residence. Then, in response to the Kirbys' request to continue mediation and discuss further loss mitigation options, 21st Mortgage sent a letter offering a short sale as a possible alternative to foreclosure. After the Kirbys appealed the denial of their RMA application, 21st Mortgage sent one letter acknowledging their appeal and another reporting that it was upholding its decision. All of these letters contained a Collection Notice and a similar bankruptcy disclaimer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Please be advised further that this letter constitutes neither demand for payment of the captioned debt nor a notice of personal liability to any recipient hereof who might have received a discharge of such debt in accordance with applicable bankruptcy laws or who might be subject to automatic stay of Section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\"Bankruptcy Disclaimer\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Post-Mediation Correspondence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After mediation and loss mitigation efforts proved unsuccessful and the case was returned to the foreclosure docket, Mr. Kirby's counsel sent a letter to 21st Mortgage dated October 6, 2015 asking 21st Mortgage to \"refrain from any further contact with the Debtor\" (the \"Cease and Desist Letter\"). In that letter, Attorney Logan also maintained that 21st Mortgage violated the discharge injunction by sending a mortgage statement dated September 14, 2015, but he did not contend that any of the other 18 communications sent during the mediation period violated the discharge injunction. After receiving the Cease and Desist Letter, 21st Mortgage continued to send written communications, although no communications related to the defaulted loan were sent following the February 2017 foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Escrow Account Disclosure, Short Sale Letter, and PMI Disclosure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Between October 2015 and November 2016, 21st Mortgage sent: (1) an annual escrow account disclosure statement (the \"Escrow Account Disclosure\") listing current and new payment information, the escrow account activity for the current year, and a projection for the next year; (2) a letter regarding a possible short sale as an alternative to foreclosure (the \"Short Sale Letter\"); and (3) another PMI Disclosure. All of these communications included the Bankruptcy Disclaimer and were addressed to Mr. Kirby in the care of his counsel. Both the PMI Disclosure and Short Sale Letter contained a Collection Notice, but the Escrow Account Disclosure did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Cash-for-Keys Letter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On January 4, 2016, 21st Mortgage's counsel, Eleanor L. Dominguez, sent a letter directly to the Kirbys at their Saco address (the \"Cash-for-Keys Letter\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was the first correspondence sent directly to the Kirbys. The letter provided, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Your former attorney, J. Scott Logan, Esq., has given me permission to contact you directly in this foreclosure action. As you know, mediation efforts in this matter were unsuccessful and the above referenced matter will likely be scheduled for trial soon. At trial, my client, MidFirst Bank,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   will seek a foreclosure judgment. In Maine, lenders may seek borrowers for any deficiency between the ultimate sales price of a foreclosed property and the fair market value of\n   the same.\n   <em>\n    Because you have both been discharged in bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   , my client would like to offer you a Consent Judgment with a waiver of deficiency and Cash-for-Keys assistance rather than proceed to trial. For MidFirst, it saves the time and expense of a trial. For you, you do not have to worry about ever being pursued for a deficiency and you will receive up to $ 1,000.00 payable after foreclosure sale and inspection, if you agree to the conditions set forth in the\n   <strong>\n    attached\n   </strong>\n   Cash-for-Keys Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (emphasis added). Although the letter did not contain a pro forma bankruptcy disclaimer, it acknowledged that the Kirbys had each received a bankruptcy discharge. The letter was accompanied by a draft consent judgment of foreclosure and order of sale; however, the record reflects that Mr. Kirby's counsel did not include the draft judgment and order of sale in either the exhibits to the complaint or as part of the summary judgment record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Right to Cure Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In March 2016, Attorney Dominguez sent a Notice of Mortgagor's Right to Cure (the \"Right to Cure Notice\") to Mr. Kirby at both the Saco and Brewer addresses, notifying him that he was in default, that he could cure the default by making certain payments, and that 21st Mortgage intended to foreclose on the mortgage if he did not cure the default. The Right to Cure Notice contained a Collection Notice and the following bankruptcy disclaimer on the last page:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   To the extent your original obligation was discharged, or is subject to an automatic stay of bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code, this notice is for compliance and/or informational purposes only and does not constitute an attempt to collect a debt or to impose personal liability for such obligation. However, a secured party retains rights under its security instrument, including the right to foreclose its lien.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The State Court Pleading\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In July 2016, 21st Mortgage filed a pleading in the state court foreclosure action (the \"State Court Pleading\"), which provided on the last page: \"Defendants are already liable for costs and attorney's fees associated with the enforcement of the note and mortgage.\" In the proceedings below, however, Mr. Kirby only submitted the final page of the State Court Pleading on which the allegedly objectionable language appeared and, therefore, the precise nature of the document and the context in which this statement appeared are not apparent from the summary judgment record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Adversary Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mr. Kirby's complaint contained two counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Count I, he alleged that 21st Mortgage's post-discharge communications were coercive attempts to collect a debt in violation of the discharge injunction and that he was entitled to actual damages (including costs and attorney's fees) and punitive damages pursuant to \u00a7 105(a). In Count II, Mr. Kirby asserted that 21st Mortgage's post-discharge communications were unlawful debt collection practices under the FDCPA. In his prayer for relief, he asked for actual damages and a sanction of \"up to $ 1,000.00 per violation[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   21st Mortgage filed a motion for summary judgment (the \"Summary Judgment Motion\"), asserting that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that, as\n   a matter of law, its actions did not violate the discharge injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   21st Mortgage acknowledged that it had notice of Mr. Kirby's discharge and had sent a total of 22 post-discharge communications regarding the defaulted loan,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   but contended that none of those communications improperly harassed or coerced Mr. Kirby to pay a discharged debt in violation of the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In his objection to the Summary Judgment Motion (the \"Objection\"), Mr. Kirby argued that 21st Mortgage, having notice of the entry of his discharge, sent at least nine and \"possibly as many as twenty-six\" mortgage statements and \"at least ten other communications\" which \"demanded payment\" from him in violation of the discharge injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   He did not raise any factual disputes regarding the substance of the written communications identified in the Summary Judgment Motion or the circumstances under which they were sent. Rather, he argued that there were material \"issues\" in dispute as to whether the disclaimer language \"insulate[d]\" 21st Mortgage from liability for discharge injunction violations. Additionally, he contended that any mitigating effect of the bankruptcy disclaimers was offset by the numerous other \"demands for payment\" made by 21st Mortgage, such as the Cash-for-Keys Letter, the Right to Cure Notice, and the State Court Pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In support of his Objection, Mr. Kirby submitted two (almost identical) affidavits of his counsel, Attorney Logan,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   which primarily listed the communications prepared and/or sent by 21st Mortgage or its counsel, including the Cash-for-Keys Letter, the State Court Pleading, and 21st Mortgage's internal mortgage servicing notes. Mr. Kirby also submitted his own affidavit with no exhibits attached. That affidavit was notarized and provided, in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   I, Gregory Kirby, hereby state and affirm, under penalties of perjury, the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   1. I received multiple communications from 21st Mortgage after my bankruptcy discharge that asked for money.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   2. My wife and I received a letter from Attorney Dominguez offering to waive a mortgage deficiency in exchange for consenting to foreclosure judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   3. Attorney Dominguez's letter was confusing and upsetting to me and my family because we believed we had discharged our personal duties to pay the mortgage in our bankruptcy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   4. My wife and I received a pleading in the foreclosure suggesting that we remained obligated to pay 21st Mortgage's legal fees, after the bankruptcy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In his response to the Defendant's Statement of Material Facts, Mr. Kirby admitted all of the material facts as set forth by 21st Mortgage, but stated that the bankruptcy disclaimers were not \"prominent.\" He also filed an Opposing Statement of Material Facts, which mirrored the averments contained in Attorney Logan's affidavit and primarily cited Attorney Logan's affidavit for evidentiary support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Bankruptcy Court's Order and Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On June 26, 2018, the bankruptcy court entered the Order granting the Summary Judgment Motion, and also issued an accompanying written decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirby v. 21st Mortg. Corp. (In re Kirby)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512088\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/456/\">\n    589 B.R. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Me. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The bankruptcy court articulated the discharge injunction standard under \u00a7 524(a)(2) as follows: \"In order to prove a violation of the discharge injunction, a debtor must show that the defendant (1) had notice of the discharge, (2) intended the actions which violated the discharge, and (3) acted in a way that improperly coerced or harassed the debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512088\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/456/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 463 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bates v. CitiMortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175394,12187754\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/300/\">\n    844 F.3d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (1st Cir. 2016) ). Noting there was no dispute that 21st Mortgage received notice of Mr. Kirby's discharge and intended the post-discharge actions which allegedly violated the discharge injunction, the court stated that \"the only unresolved question is whether this conduct was 'improperly coercive or harassing under an objective standard.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 464. Examining each of the post-discharge communications sent by 21st Mortgage, the court held that none of the post-discharge communications were improperly \"coercive\" or \"harassing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 469.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   With regard to the mortgage statements, the bankruptcy court observed that they \"might be confusing to a layperson\" as they stated an amount due and a due date, that late fees would be added if payment was not made, and that they were an attempt to collect a debt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 466. The court concluded, however, that the bankruptcy disclaimers adequately informed the recipient that 21st Mortgage was not attempting to collect a debt from the recipient or to hold the recipient personally responsible for the debt if he had been discharged in bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court also found it compelling that: (1) 21st Mortgage sent the statements to Mr. Kirby's counsel, rather than to Mr. Kirby, \"during the course of ongoing loan modification negotiations\"; (2) 21st Mortgage stopped sending mortgage statements immediately upon receiving the Cease and Desist Letter; and (3) Mr. Kirby's counsel did not send the Cease and Desist Letter until after the mediation process concluded, which indicated \"he did not perceive the statements to be any danger or threat to his client.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 466. Under these circumstances, the bankruptcy court ruled, the mortgage statements did \"not constitute discharge injunction violations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The court similarly concluded that the Loss Mitigation Letters, the Short Sale Letter, the ARM Notice, and the Escrow Account Disclosure did not violate the discharge injunction because they contained bankruptcy disclaimers, were sent to Mr. Kirby's counsel, and were sent during settlement negotiations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 466-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As to the Cash-for-Keys Letter, the bankruptcy court determined that the letter was \"inadmissible\" because it was only before the court by way of Mr. Kirby's and Attorney Logan's affidavits. The court ruled that those affidavits were \"defective\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   because they were not based on the affiants' personal knowledge and because Attorney Logan's affidavits were not properly notarized.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 467-68. Consequently, the court declined further consideration of the Cash-for-Keys Letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Lastly, the bankruptcy court considered the Right to Cure Notice, stating that the \"vast majority\" of the notice contained information that a foreclosing mortgagee must, under Maine law, include in a right to cure letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 468 (citing, among other things,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Me.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%2014%2C%20%C2%A7%206111\">\n    Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, \u00a7 6111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1-A) ). Because strict compliance with the statutory requirements is required for a valid foreclosure, the court concluded, 21st Mortgage was \"required\" to send the Right to Cure Notice before foreclosing on the Brewer Property and, therefore, it did not violate the discharge injunction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Me.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%2014%2C%20%C2%A7%206111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the bankruptcy court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   21st Mortgage did communicate with Mr. Kirby and his wife following the entry of a discharge in his bankruptcy case[ ]. However, the vast majority of the written communications which were properly presented to the court on 21st Mortgage's motion for summary judgment were sent to Mr. Kirby's bankruptcy counsel and given the context of those communications they do not objectively constitute coercive or harassing actions in violation of the protections of the discharge injunction. Of the two communications which were sent directly to the Kirbys, only one-the [Right to Cure Notice]-was appropriate for this court to consider upon the motion for summary judgment. For the reasons set forth above, the [Right to Cure Notice] was not a violation of the discharge injunction either. Therefore, 21st Mortgage's motion for summary judgment will be granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Me.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%2014%2C%20%C2%A7%206111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Me.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%2014%2C%20%C2%A7%206111\">\n    at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Mr. Kirby timely filed a notice of appeal with respect to the Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Mr. Kirby\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Mr. Kirby argues that the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of 21st Mortgage because: (1) there were genuine issues of material fact as to the coercive nature of the post-discharge correspondence; and (2) 21st Mortgage failed to establish that its post-discharge correspondence did not violate the discharge injunction as a matter of law. He claims to have raised genuine issues of material fact through Attorney Logan's affidavits that identified the many communications from 21st Mortgage, evidencing \"a pattern of coercive behavior,\" and maintains that the bankruptcy court erroneously deemed the affidavits to be inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   He further asserts that the bankruptcy court erroneously determined that all of the communications had bankruptcy disclaimers, and argues that any mitigating effect of the bankruptcy disclaimers was offset by the numerous other \"demands for payment\" made by 21st Mortgage. According to Mr. Kirby, the \"cumulative effect\" of all the communications sent by 21st Mortgage was coercive and harassing, even if the individual communications alone were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    II. 21st Mortgage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   21st Mortgage counters that its post-discharge communications did not violate the discharge injunction because they were sent: (1) to comply with Maine state law; (2) to engage in \"good faith mediation negotiations\"; and/or (3) in furtherance of\n   \"routine mortgage servicing and foreclosure processing.\" Moreover, it notes that the majority of its communications were sent to Mr. Kirby's counsel, rather than to Mr. Kirby, and all but one communication included bankruptcy disclaimers indicating that Mr. Kirby was not personally liable for any discharged debt. Therefore, 21st Mortgage contends, when considering the totality of the circumstances, the bankruptcy court correctly ruled that the post-discharge communications did not improperly harass Mr. Kirby for, or attempt to coerce him into, payment of a discharged debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Employing the summary judgment and discharge injunction standards set forth above, we now consider: (1) whether Mr. Kirby demonstrated that there were genuine issues of material fact which precluded the entry of summary judgment as to the alleged discharge injunction violations; and (2) whether the bankruptcy court erred in ruling that 21st Mortgage's post-discharge correspondence did not violate the discharge injunction as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether Mr. Kirby Demonstrated Genuine Issues of Material Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In his Objection, Mr. Kirby asserted there were \"factual disputes\" precluding summary judgment as to: whether the post-discharge communications contained \"prominent\" bankruptcy disclaimers, whether the Cash-for-Keys Letter was an \"offer [to] waive[ ] a discharged debt,\" and whether communications sent after the Cease and Desist Letter \"exacerbate [21st Mortgage]'s conduct.\" None of these alleged \"factual disputes\" are questions of\n   <em>\n    material fact\n   </em>\n   -but merely legal arguments in support of his contention that the communications were coercive and harassing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The underlying factual record-the content of the communications and to whom and when they were sent-are not in dispute. Likewise, even if Mr. Kirby's affidavit was admissible, the content of the affidavit does not raise any factual disputes. No additional documents were attached to the affidavit, and whether Mr. Kirby was \"confus[ed] and upset[ ]\" by 21st Mortgage's communications is not the question. The only question is whether, under the objective standard articulated by the First Circuit, the record supports a finding that the discharge injunction was violated. Therefore, Mr. Kirby's so-called \"factual disputes\" do not present a trial-worthy issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Although Mr. Kirby pointed to no other alleged factual disputes, we would be remiss\n   in failing to consider whether there is a genuine factual dispute as to the number of communications sent. 21st Mortgage asserted that it sent nine post-discharge mortgage statements, but in his Objection, Mr. Kirby stated that 21st Mortgage \"printed and apparently sent ... 22 monthly statements.\" At first blush, this contradiction seems to create a factual dispute. But Mr. Kirby offered no evidentiary support for this assertion, as required by Rule 56(c)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite his acknowledgment in his Objection to the Summary Judgment Motion that discovery was complete, he did not submit copies of the additional 13 monthly statements 21st Mortgage allegedly sent. Instead, he offered as part of the summary judgment record only 21st Mortgage's computerized \"collection notes\" which reflected that additional mortgage statements were internally \"printed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Mr. Kirby failed to demonstrate a genuine factual dispute regarding the number of post-discharge mortgage statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, Mr. Kirby failed to present \"specific facts, in suitable evidentiary form, to establish the presence of a trialworthy issue\" which would have precluded the entry of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.

Whether 21st Mortgage Violated the Discharge Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   It is undisputed on appeal that 21st Mortgage had actual knowledge that Mr. Kirby received a discharge under \u00a7 727 and that, after receiving notice of the discharge, it sent 24 communications to Mr. Kirby or his counsel and filed a pleading in the state court foreclosure action. Consequently, the first two elements of the discharge injunction standard under \u00a7 524(a)(2) -that the creditor had notice of the discharge and intended the actions which violated the discharge-are satisfied. Our focus, therefore, is on the third element - whether, under an objective standard and considering the facts and circumstances surrounding the communications, the post-discharge communications improperly coerced or harassed Mr. Kirby into paying the discharged debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175394,12187754\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/300/\">\n    844 F.3d at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering whether the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred \"give rise to an inference of coercion\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schinabeck v.

Nineteen of the post-discharge communications were sent while the parties were actively engaged in mediation to negotiate an alternative to foreclosure. After the conclusion of the mediation process in October 2015, 21st Mortgage and its counsel sent five additional written communications, but ceased all correspondence after the foreclosure sale in February 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Although Mr. Kirby argues that the sheer volume of the communications amounts to coercion, even if the individual communications do not, the surrounding circumstances and context in which the communications were sent eliminated any coercive or harassing effect of the post-discharge communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Because of the unique circumstances presented by the parties' involvement in the mediation process, we consider the post-discharge communications in two categories-those that were sent during the mediation period and those that were sent after the conclusion of the mediation period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Communications Sent During Mediation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The facts and circumstances surrounding the 19 written communications sent to Mr. Kirby in the care of his counsel during the mediation period-nine mortgage statements, the ARM Notice, the PMI Disclosure, and eight Loss Mitigation Letters-are clear from the record and are undisputed. Mr. Kirby wanted to retain the Brewer Property and, therefore, voluntarily initiated and participated in the state court-sponsored mediation program in order to explore alternatives to foreclosure. Although his requests were ultimately denied, Mr. Kirby actively pursued loan modification and other loss mitigation options with 21st Mortgage. At no time during the nearly year-long mediation period did Mr. Kirby or his attorney allege that 21st Mortgage's correspondence violated the discharge injunction or ask 21st Mortgage to cease its written communications. Attorney Logan waited until the conclusion of the mediation to send the Cease and Desist Letter, in which he only alleged that one of the 19 communications sent during the mediation period (a mortgage statement) violated the discharge injunction. Upon receipt of the Cease and Desist Letter, 21st Mortgage immediately stopped sending the monthly mortgage statements and the only communications sent thereafter were either informational in nature or related to the foreclosure process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In addition, all of the post-discharge communications sent during the mediation process were sent to Mr. Kirby's counsel and not directly to Mr. Kirby, and all but one of them contained unambiguous bankruptcy disclaimers informing Mr. Kirby that if he had received a bankruptcy discharge, 21st Mortgage was not attempting to collect a debt from him personally and the correspondence was for informational purposes only. The ARM Notice, which did not have a bankruptcy disclaimer, merely informed Mr. Kirby of changes to the interest rate on his adjustable rate mortgage. Communications that do not contain a bankruptcy disclaimer are not per se violations of the discharge injunction where it is evident from the circumstances that there is no coercion or harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4115893\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/31/#p41\">\n    529 B.R. 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41 (Bankr.

Such is the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Although neither the inclusion of a bankruptcy disclaimer nor sending the letters to counsel, standing alone, insulates 21st Mortgage from liability, these facts become more compelling where, as here, the parties were also engaged in extensive efforts to mediate an alternative to foreclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not only were the parties participating in mediation through the state court foreclosure diversion program, but Mr. Kirby also initiated communications with 21st Mortgage when he submitted requests for a loan modification. Several courts have recognized that when a debtor, after the entry of his discharge, initiates communications with the creditor in order to explore alternatives to foreclosure so that he can retain the property, certain communications from the creditor (including those designed to inform the debtor of the payment amounts necessary to bring the mortgage current) are \"logical\" and do not violate the discharge injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ladebush v.

Although it contained new payment information and a payment due date, it did not indicate that it was an attempt to collect a debt, make any demand for payment, or threaten any adverse consequences. It was sent to Mr. Kirby's counsel, rather than to Mr. Kirby, and it contained an unambiguous bankruptcy disclaimer. We conclude, therefore, that the record does not establish that the Escrow Account Disclosure improperly coerced and harassed Mr. Kirby in violation of the discharge injunction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Whitmarsh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704235\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/383/735/#p736\">\n    383 B.R. 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736 (Bankr.

Although the failure to produce a complete copy of the letter does not render it inadmissible, the incomplete letter carries little evidentiary weight in the absence of the documents referenced therein.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greener v.

We need not address whether the Maine statute applies in this case, however, as we conclude that the plain language of the Right to Cure Notice demonstrates that it was an act to enforce 21st Mortgage's foreclosure rights rather than an attempt to collect a debt as a personal liability. The notice informed Mr. Kirby of the amount of the default, that he could cure the default by making certain payments, and that 21st Mortgage intended to foreclose on the mortgage if he did not cure the default. Moreover, the Right to Cure Notice contained an unambiguous bankruptcy disclaimer. Under these circumstances, the Right to Cure Notice was a permissible communication by a secured creditor in reference to the enforcement of its rights against a property\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   , rather than personally against Mr. Kirby.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bibolotti v.

Tex. May 15, 2013) (describing an analogous letter as \"precisely the type of communication the discharge injunction allows secured creditors to use in order to enforce their rights against a property\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   , rather than personally against a debtor\") (citations omitted). We conclude, therefore, that the record does not establish that the Right to Cure Notice improperly coerced and harassed Mr. Kirby in violation of the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    (e) The State Court Pleading\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Finally, Mr. Kirby argues that the bankruptcy court erred by failing to consider whether the filing of the State Court Pleading violated the discharge injunction, specifically pointing to the statement in the State Court Pleading that \"Defendants are already liable for costs and attorney's fees associated with the enforcement of the note and mortgage.\" However, as noted above, the document submitted as part of the summary judgment record included only the final page on which the allegedly objectionable language appeared, rendering it impossible to discern the precise nature of the document and the context in which this statement appeared. Mr. Kirby's failure to submit the entire pleading as part of the summary judgment record is fatal to his claim that the State Court Pleading violated the discharge injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, any error by the bankruptcy court in failing to address the State Court Pleading is harmless. We cannot conclude, based on the last page of the\n   State Court Pleading, that its overall effect was to harass or coerce Mr. Kirby into paying a discharged debt in violation of the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   We conclude that Mr. Kirby failed to demonstrate genuine issues of material fact which would have precluded the entry of summary judgment. Additionally, we conclude, based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the post-discharge communications contained in the summary judgment record, together with the substance of those communications, that Mr. Kirby did not establish that the correspondence in question, whether viewed individually or cumulatively, coerced or harassed him to pay a discharged debt in violation of the discharge injunction. Therefore, the bankruptcy court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of 21st Mortgage, and we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    All references to specific statutory sections are to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    (the \"Bankruptcy Code\" or the \"Code\").
