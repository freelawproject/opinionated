INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 6 and 11, 2019, this Court held a hearing (the \"\n   <em>\n    Hearing\n   </em>\n   \") on the motion for relief from judgment (the \"\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   \") filed by All-Tex Staffing &amp; Personnel, Inc. (the \"\n   <em>\n    Debtor\n   </em>\n   \"). [Adv. Doc. No. 115]. There was opposition to the Motion. Specifically, Sarah Romo Torres (\"\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   \") filed an objection and motion to strike the Motion. [Adv. Doc. No. 118]. Additionally, an objection and motion to strike was filed by Momentum Staffing Solutions, LLC (\"\n   <em>\n    Momentum\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Staffing\n   </em>\n   \") and Sylvia Romo (\"\n   <em>\n    Romo\n   </em>\n   \"). [Adv. Doc. No. 116].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only one witness, Archie Patterson (\"\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   \"), the Debtor's owner and president, testified at the Hearing. The Court admitted Exhibits A, C, D, E2 (pages 1-6 only), F, G, K, L, and M offered by the Debtor. After listening to the testimony, reviewing the exhibits, and hearing closing arguments, the Court took this matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052 and 9014, the Court now issues these Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law to explain why it has decided to deny the Motion. To the extent that any Finding of Fact is construed to be a Conclusion of Law, it is adopted as such; and to the extent that any Conclusion of Law is construed to be a Finding of Fact, it is adopted as such. The Court reserves the right to make additional findings and conclusions as it deems appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1. The Debtor is in the business of providing temporary labor services to customers in the Houston metropolitan area. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Doc. No. 1-1 at 8 of 60]. On or about November 8, 2016, the Debtor filed a lawsuit against Torres styled\n   <em>\n    All-Tex Staffing &amp; Personnel Inc. v. Sarah Romo [Torres],\n   </em>\n   Cause No. 2016-77306, in the District Court of the 281st Judicial District in Harris County, Texas (the \"\n   <em>\n    State Court Lawsuit\n   </em>\n   \"). [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Doc. No. 1-1 at 1 of 60].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the State Court Lawsuit, the Debtor brought the following causes of action against Torres, a former employee: breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, tortious interference of contracts\n   and business relationships, unfair competition, breach of computer security crimes, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, breach of the Texas Theft Liability Act, and conspiracy. [Adv. Doc. No. 1-1, at 45-60 of 60]. The Debtor alleged that Torres-in violation of the confidentiality, non-solicitation, and non-compete agreements that she signed while an employee of the Debtor-misappropriated the Debtor's trade secrets and other confidential information and solicited the Debtor's customers for a competing business-namely, Momentum Staffing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Torres had been an employee of the Debtor from approximately January 2013 to November 2016. [Adv. Doc. No. 31, Apr. 27, 2017, Hrg. Tr. 10:7-10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2. On February 26, 2017, the Debtor filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. [Main Case Doc. No. 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3. On April 11, 2017, the Debtor removed the State Court Lawsuit to this Court, and the Clerk of Court assigned the State Court Lawsuit adversary number 17-03210. [Adv. Doc. No. 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   4. On April 25, 2017, the Debtor filed a Corrected Application for Temporary Restraining Order, Temporary Injunction and Permanent Injunction and Amended Complaint (the \"\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Adv. Doc. No. 10]. The Amended Complaint added Momentum Staffing and Romo as defendants. Romo is Torres' mother. Romo owns Momentum Staffing, which provides temporary labor services to customers in the Houston area-i.e., Momentum Staffing is in the same business as the Debtor. The Amended Complaint alleged that Torres had worked for Momentum Staffing since March of 2016, which overlaps with the time period she worked for the Debtor (i.e., Torres worked for the Debtor from January of 2013 to November of 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   5. On April 27, 2017, the Court held a hearing on the Debtor's request for a temporary restraining order contained in the Amended Complaint. At that hearing, Torres, who was representing herself\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , testified that Momentum Staffing is her mother's (i.e, Romo's) business and that her mother was running Momentum Staffing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Torres denied providing any advice to anyone with Momentum Staffing, or assisting or working with her mother at Momentum Staffing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Torres also denied assisting\n   with the formation of Momentum Staffing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, Torres testified that she has \"no tie\" to Momentum Staffing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   6. On May 3, 2017, the Court held a continued hearing on the Debtor's request for a temporary restraining order. At the beginning of the hearing, Torres-who had retained counsel by this point-invoked her right under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201623\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to recant the testimony she gave at the April 27, 2017, hearing. At the May 3, 2017, hearing-in direct opposition to her prior testimony at the April 27, 2017, hearing-Torres testified that she had assisted her mother (i.e., Romo) with Momentum Staffing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also testified that she had periodically helped her brother (who also is employed by Momentum Staffing) with work for Momentum Staffing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Torres testified that she had written \"ghost emails\" for her brother to at least two entities-i.e., Torres actually composed the emails but the emails were composed in such a way such that the recipients of those emails were to believe that her brother wrote and sent them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Torres further testified that during the time period she was employed by the Debtor, she had told one of the Debtor's clients (Prefco Distribution) about the staffing company her mother had opened,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and she also\n   testified that she had told another client of the Debtor (Lonestar Heat Treat) about Momentum Staffing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, her testimony from the April 27, 2017, hearing that she had \"no tie\" to Momentum Staffing was patently false. In addition to the testimony just described, Torres also testified at the May 3, 2017, hearing that she had never been employed by Momentum Staffing or received a paycheck from this entity, but rather that she had received money from her mother, Romo, since the termination of her employment with the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Torres denied taking any property of the Debtor with her when her employment there was terminated, including any I-9 forms of the Debtor's employees, and she further testified that the officers and directors of Momentum Staffing are Romo, and no one else.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the conclusion of the May 3, 2017, hearing the Court continued the hearing to May 30, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   7. On May 26, 2017, Momentum Staffing and Romo filed an Answer. [Adv. Doc. No. 41]. Also on May 26, 2017, Torres filed an Answer and a counterclaim for attorneys' fees. [Adv. Doc. No. 42].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   8. On May 30, 2017, Torres filed her First Amended Answer. [Adv. Doc. No. 44].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   9. The Court held the continued hearing on May 30, 2017. After hearing testimony from two additional witnesses and closing arguments, the Court requested additional briefing from the parties and continued the hearing until June 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   10. At the continued hearing on June 7, 2017, the Court heard additional argument from the parties and then took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   11. On June 30, 2017, the Court denied the Debtor's request for a temporary restraining order. [Adv. Doc. No. 52]. The Court thereafter scheduled trial for February 28, 2018. [Adv. Doc. No. 64].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   12. On December 18, 2017, counsel for Torres filed a notice of settlement, stating that the parties had reached a resolution of the claims in the adversary proceeding (The agreement which the parties eventually signed, which was admitted as\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit L\n   </strong>\n   at the Hearing, is hereinafter referred to as the \"\n   <em>\n    Settlement Agreement\n   </em>\n   \"). [Adv. Doc. No. 100].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   13. On February 15, 2018, the Debtor filed a motion to compromise pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Motion to Compromise\n   </em>\n   \"), requesting that the Court approve the Settlement Agreement. [Main Case Doc. No. 63].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   14. On February 23 and March 1, 2018, the Court held hearings on the Motion to Compromise. At the conclusion of the March 1, 2018, hearing the Court orally granted the Motion to Compromise and orally granted a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. On March 7, 2018, the Court entered an order memorializing its ruling regarding the Motion to Compromise. [Main Case Doc. No. 68]. Attached to the March 7, 2018, order was a copy of the Settlement Agreement, which was deemed to have taken effect on March 1, 2018. In pertinent part, the following terms comprise the Settlement Agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. The Defendants were to pay the Debtor a total of $ 200,000.00; $ 10,000.00 of which was to be paid within 14 days following the entry of the order approving the Motion to Compromise, with the remaining funds to be paid in a series of four larger lump payments and also 60 smaller monthly payments;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   B. The Defendants entered into a non-compete agreement in which they agreed not to solicit or conduct business with 20 named companies that were listed on an attachment to the Settlement Agreement; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   C. The Defendants were required to provide a letter to the Debtor stating that Defendants had agreed not to solicit or conduct business with the 20 named companies, and the Debtor was permitted to share this letter with the 20 named companies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   15. On March 8, 2018, the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal in the adversary proceeding, dismissing all causes of actions brought by the Debtor and stipulating that the adversary proceeding be dismissed with prejudice, [Adv. Doc. No. 108], and on April 11, 2018, this Court entered an order dismissing the adversary proceeding with prejudice. [Adv. Doc. No. 113].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   16. Sometime during the first week of April of 2018, Patterson discovered that Torres' LinkedIn profile represented that she was the president and CEO of Momentum Staffing, and that she had been in those roles since May\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   of 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus,\n   according to her LinkedIn profile, Torres was the president and CEO of Momentum Staffing during the same time-approximately May 2016 to November 2016-that she was employed by the Debtor. The representation made in Torres' LinkedIn profile directly contradicts the testimony Torres provided at the April 27 and May 3, 2017, hearings; specifically, Torres testified then that the officers and directors of Momentum Staffing were Romo and no one else. [Finding of Fact No. 6]. Even though Patterson learned about this LinkedIn profile during the first week of April of 2018, neither Patterson nor the Debtor's counsel of record made this Court aware of this information nor of the fact that the LinkedIn representation directly contradicted the testimony that Torres gave at the hearings held on April 27 and May 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   17. On April 24, 2018, the Debtor filed a \"Motion to Dismiss Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Case\" (the \"\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   \"). [Main Case Doc. No. 79]. Paragraph four of the Motion to Dismiss represented that \"[t]he Debtor has resolved the issues with Sarah Romo [Torres], Momentum Staffing and Sylvia Romo.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 of 4, \u00b6 4]. The Debtor made this representation despite discovering in the first week of April of 2018 that Torres' LinkedIn profile was representing that she currently was, and had been since May of 2016, the president and CEO of Momentum Staffing. Stated otherwise, the Debtor informed this Court that it no longer had any disputes with Torres despite knowing that her LinkedIn profile directly contradicted her testimony at the hearing in April and May of 2017 that her mother (Romo) was Momentum Staffing's only officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   18. Based upon the representations made by the Debtor in the Motion to Dismiss, this Court dismissed the bankruptcy on May 23, 2018. [Main Case Doc. No. 81]. In its dismissal order, the Court also required the Debtor to file its final operating report within 20 days and pay all fees due to the U.S. Trustee within 30 days. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   19. On June 27, 2018, this Court set a status hearing in the Main Case to address why the Debtor had failed to comply with the Court's order of May 23, 2018-i.e., why the Debtor had not timely filed its final operating report. [Main Case Doc. No. 83]. The status hearing regarding why the Debtor had not timely filed its final operating report was held on July 11, 2018. At the status hearing, Reese Baker (\"\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   \") (counsel for the Debtor) and Patterson appeared. Baker gave testimony regarding the status of the final operating report. Neither Baker nor Patterson informed the Court about Torres' LinkedIn profile-that Patterson had known about since the first week of April of 2018-representing that Torres was the president and CEO of Momentum Staffing and had held these positions since 2016. Stated differently, neither Baker nor Patterson informed this Court that they believed that Torres perjured herself at the April 27 and May 3, 2017, hearings when she testified that Momentum Staffing's only officers were her mother, Romo. Also at the status hearing, Christine March from the U.S. Department of Justice represented that, based on operating report filed by the Debtor earlier in the day on July 11, 2018, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Main Case Doc. No. 85], the Debtor owed $ 8,251.00 in quarterly fees to the Trustee. The Debtor subsequently paid the quarterly fees to the U.S. Trustee, and the Debtor's case was closed on August 3, 2018. [Main Case docket entry of Aug. 3, 2018].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   20. On November 12, 2018, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3),\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Debtor filed the Motion, alleging-in direct contrast to her testimony at the April 27 and May 3, 2017, hearings-that Torres asserts that she has been president of Momentum Staffing, as evidenced by her LinkedIn profile, since that company's inception in May of 2016. [Adv. Doc. No. 115]. The Debtor contends that Torres' testimony at the May 3, 2017, hearing greatly influenced the Debtor's willingness to settle and the terms it was willing to accept in settlement, as the Debtor believes that Torres' denial of her involvement with Momentum Staffing increased the difficulty the Debtor faced in proving its claims set forth in the Amended Complaint. The Debtor now requests that the Court (1) vacate its March 7, 2018, order in the Main Case approving the Settlement Agreement; and (2) vacate its April 11, 2018, order in the adversary proceeding that dismissed the adversary proceeding with prejudice. Stated differently, the Debtor wants this Court to invalidate the Settlement Agreement and allow the Debtor to prosecute the claims that it set forth in the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   21. On November 30, 2018, the Defendants filed the Objections. [Adv. Doc. Nos. 116, 118]. In the Objections, the Defendants argue that: (1) this Court has no jurisdiction to hear the Motion and it therefore should be stricken; (2) even if this Court has jurisdiction, the Debtor is not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b) ; and (3) intervening equities exist that require the denial of the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   22. On December 17, 2018, the Debtor filed a reply in support of the Motion, replying to each of the arguments made in the Objections. [Adv. Doc. Nos. 119, 120].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   23. On February 6, 2019, the Court held the Hearing. Patterson was the only witness. In pertinent part, Patterson testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. Patterson learned during the first week of April 2018 that Torres' LinkedIn profile represented that she was currently the president and CEO of Momentum Staffing, and had been in those roles since May of 2016, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 19:14-21, 20:3-8, 25:17-19, 29:16-18, 70:9-13];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   B. The Debtor has already received approximately $ 22,000.00 from the Defendants pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 55:13-20];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   C. Patterson admitted that there was no guarantee that the Debtor would prevail in the litigation against the Defendants, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 60:6-8];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   D. Patterson admitted that in addition to the Debtor believing that it did not have enough evidence against Torres to be successful in continuing in the lawsuit against her, there were also \"other factors\" that caused the Debtor to settle with the Defendants, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 61:11-62:6]. These other factors included, at least in \"some part\" according to Patterson, the cost involved in continued litigation, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 52:2-5], and that to continue to litigate the issues with the Defendants would be a substantial cost for the bankruptcy estate, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 59:24-60:2]. Further, Patterson admitted that the difficulty of collecting against the Defendants-in the event the Debtor won a money judgment-was a \"very strong factor\" in entering into the Settlement Agreement, and that the Settlement Agreement provided certainty in payment to the Debtor for its alleged damages, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 60:6-20]. Finally, Patterson admitted that the Debtor recognized the risk that the Defendants might successfully prove that the employment agreement between Torres and the Debtor was unenforceable and that the Debtor could fail in its attempt to prove up substantial damages, and that these were both factors that weighed in favor of the Debtor's decision to settle, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 65:25-66:10];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   E. Patterson admitted that under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Debtor benefitted from an immediate recovery, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 67:5-9];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   F. Patterson also admitted that without the Settlement Agreement, the Debtor believed that it did not have any assurance that it would receive any damages from the Defendants, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 67:14-18];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   G. Patterson admitted that after the Settlement Agreement was entered into, the dispute was settled and the Debtor was able to dismiss its bankruptcy, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 68:24-69:2];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   H. Patterson admitted that the approval of the Settlement Agreement allowed the Debtor immediate access to funds so that it could move forward to propose a plan of reorganization, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 69:7-25] ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   I. Patterson admitted that the Settlement Agreement allowed the Debtor \"to focus not so much on the courts and more on developing [ ] business,\" [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 72:4-6]; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   J. Patterson admitted that the amounts paid by the Defendants pursuant to the Settlement Agreement were critical to the operations of the Debtor at the time that the Debtor entered into the Settlement Agreement, [Adv. Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 72:11-20, 73:13-17].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   24. After Patterson testified, and this Court heard closing arguments from all counsel, the Court took the matter under advisement. Counsel requested time to submit briefs, and the Court granted this request. These briefs were subsequently filed. The Court has reviewed these briefs and now issues its ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CREDIBILITY OF WITNESSES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court finds that Patterson was a credible witness and, therefore, gives significant weight to his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

When the moving party physically possesses the evidence it considers the underlying reason for the Rule 60(b) motion but then delays in filing the Rule 60(b) motion, this weighs in favor of finding that the delay in filing the Rule 60(b) motion was not reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

Therefore, this factor weighs in favor of this Court finding that the Motion was not filed within a reasonable time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Debtor has cited two cases as persuasive authority from other circuits as support that the Motion was filed timely under the reasonableness standard. [Adv. Doc. No. 141, \u00b6\u00b6 19 &amp; 20]. However, this Court finds these cases unpersuasive and inapplicable to the circumstances surrounding the Motion. In\n   <em>\n    Venture Indus. Corp. v. Autoliv ASP, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the court noted that the non-movant \"makes no colorable claim that it was prejudiced by [the movant's] delay\" in filing the Rule 60(b) motion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790844\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/457/1322/#p1328\">\n    457 F.3d 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Here, the Court finds that there is not only some but quite a significant amount of prejudice to the Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section E.4. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Venture Indus. Corp.\n   </em>\n   is easily distinguishable from the Motion presently before the Court. In\n   <em>\n    Dunlop v. Pan Am\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the court ruled that the appellants, who had filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Rule 60(b) motion after \"understandably rel[ying] on repeated assurances by the [U.S.] Secretary [of Labor] that the federal settlement would not bar their state claims,\" had filed the motion timely because it was within \"four months of the N.Y. State Division's dismissal of appellants' state claims.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142342\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/1044/#p1051\">\n    672 F.2d 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1051 (2d Cir. 1982). The\n   <em>\n    Dunlop\n   </em>\n   case could not be more distinguishable from the circumstances surrounding the Motion before the Court. Specifically, the Debtor was, and has been, represented by the same seasoned counsel, both in the main case and this adversary proceeding, since the inception of each proceeding, respectively. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Main Case Doc. No. 1 &amp; Adv. Doc. No. 1]. Unlike the appellants in\n   <em>\n    Dunlop\n   </em>\n   , who did not have counsel and were relying on the U.S. Secretary of Labor which investigated and pursued an action under federal employment laws against the appellants' former employer, the Debtor is not and has not represented itself\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   in this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the Debtor has all along had counsel representing it and could have-and should have-filed the Motion in April of 2018 right after Patterson learned of the information on Torres' LinkedIn profile. Therefore, the Court finds these cases unpersuasive and wholly inapposite to the circumstances surrounding the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that the Debtor has not provided any good reason for the delay in filing the Motion and that this factor weighs in favor of this Court finding that the Motion was not filed within a reasonable time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Practical Ability of the Litigant to Learn Earlier of the Grounds Relied Upon\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   There was no testimony at the Hearing regarding whether it was possible for Patterson to learn, prior to the first week of April of 2018, that Torres' LinkedIn profile represented that she had been the president and CEO of Momentum Staffing since May of 2016. Because the Debtor has the burden in prosecuting the Motion, the Court finds that the Debtor has failed to carry this burden. Patterson needed to give testimony that, as a practical matter, he had no ability to discover the existence of the LinkedIn profile prior to entering into the Settlement Agreement-and such testimony he simply did not give. Moreover, as discussed above, the Debtor could have (and should have) raised the issue of Torres' LinkedIn profile well before the\n   filing of the Motion in November of 2018 because Patterson was aware of the facts he now relies upon since the first week of April of 2018. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 16, 23]. Further-also as noted above-Patterson has failed to provide the Court with any explanation for the delay. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of this Court finding that the Motion was not filed within a reasonable time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Prejudice to Other Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Here, there is no question that setting aside the Settlement Agreement and reopening the adversary proceeding would prejudice the Defendants. Momentum Staffing has already paid approximately $ 22,000 to the Debtor pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, [Finding of Fact No. 23], and even though Patterson testified that the Debtor could immediately return the $ 22,000 to Momentum Staffing, if this Court grants the Motion, Momentum Staffing will have been without the benefit of this $ 22,000 for several months. Further, also under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Defendants agreed (1) not to solicit or conduct any business for a period of 60 months with 20 companies listed in an addendum to the Settlement Agreement; and (2) to provide a letter to the Debtor that it had agreed not to solicit or conduct business with these 20 companies and that the Debtor could share this letter with these companies. [Finding of Fact No. 14]. For the last 11 months, the Debtor has benefitted from these provisions in the Settlement Agreement and the Defendants have suffered because of these provisions; indeed, the Debtor has been able to solicit the business of these 20 companies without any competition from Momentum Staffing. To now void the Settlement Agreement would allow the Debtor to have its cake and eat it, too: it will have gotten a huge head start on its competition with respect to business development and yet also be able to prosecute its claims against the Defendants now that it has recovered from its financial woes of a year ago. Such a result would assuredly prejudice the Defendants, who have been timely abiding by the terms of the Settlement Agreement since the Court approved the Settlement Agreement. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of this Court finding that the Motion was not filed within a reasonable time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Summary of the Rule 60(c) Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In sum, in analyzing all four factors, this Court finds that all of them weigh heavily in favor of a finding that the Motion was not filed within a reasonable time. Accordingly, because this Court finds that the Motion was not filed within a reasonable time as required by Rule 60(c)(1), the Court finds that the Motion must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

When the Debtor filed its Motion to Dismiss on April 24, 2018, its position was that \"[t]he Debtor has resolved the issues with Sarah Romo [Torres], Momentum Staffing and Sylvia Romo.\" [Finding of Fact No. 17]. And, importantly, the Debtor took this position despite already knowing at the time that Torres' LinkedIn profile represented that she had been president and CEO of Momentum Staffing since May of 2016, which directly contradicted her testimony from 2017. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 5, 6, 16, 17]. Now, however, the Debtor takes the position that it does still have issues with Torres on the grounds that it did not have knowledge about the LinkedIn profile representations when it entered into the Settlement Agreement and therefore should be allowed to prosecute the claims against her that it would have prosecuted if settlement had not been consummated. This current position is clearly inconsistent with the position that the Debtor took on April 24, 2018, when it filed the Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    [See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 17]. Indeed, this inconsistency is particularly egregious because at the\n   time the Debtor represented that it had resolved all issues with the Defendants (including Torres), the Debtor knew about Torres' LinkedIn profile which the Debtor now complains contains representations that it could have used to prosecute the claims against her set forth in the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Court Accepted the Debtor's Previous Position That It Had Resolved All Issues with the Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The second element of judicial estoppel requires that \"the court must have accepted the previous position.\"\n   <em>\n    Kane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5896371,3735309\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/380/\">\n    535 F.3d at 385-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Debtor Had Motive to Conceal the Fact that It Had Discovered Torres' LinkedIn Profile at the Time the Debtor Filed the Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Additionally, this Court finds that the Debtor had motive to conceal the fact that it had discovered Torres' LinkedIn profile\n   at the time the Debtor filed the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   First, the Debtor wanted to wrap up all issues in the bankruptcy case so that it could dismiss the case, one result of which would be that the Debtor would no longer be required to pay quarterly fees to the U.S. Trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, dismissing the bankruptcy case also allowed the Debtor to avoid the costs of continued litigation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   a fact Patterson admitted at the Hearing. [Finding of Fact No. 23]. Third, the Settlement Agreement greatly benefitted the Debtor in the short term. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Defendants were precluded from doing business with 20 companies, which opened the door for the Debtor to pick up new clients or solidify its relationships with existing clients who might otherwise have taken their business to Momentum Staffing. [Finding of Fact No. 23]. The Defendants were also to pay the Debtor a lump sum of $ 10,000.00 within 14 days following the entry of the Settlement Agreement, and have since paid the Debtor an additional $ 12,000.00. [Finding of Fact Nos. 14, 23]. Patterson testified that the money paid to the Debtor was critical to the Debtor's business during the period of time the Debtor was still in bankruptcy, as those funds allowed the Debtor to move forward with a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization at a time when dismissal of the case was not anticipated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Finding of Fact No. 23]. Fourth, Patterson testified that there was no guarantee that the Debtor would prevail in litigation against the Defendants, and that under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Debtor benefitted from an immediate infusion of cash. [Finding of Fact No. 23]. Fifth, Patterson further testified that in the event the Debtor won a money judgment, the difficulty of collecting against the Defendants was a \"very strong factor\" in entering into the Settlement Agreement, and that the Settlement Agreement provided certainty in payment to the Debtor for the alleged damages. [Finding of Fact No. 23]. Sixth, without the Settlement Agreement, there was no assurance that the Debtor would recover any damages from the Defendants. [Finding of Fact No. 23]. Seventh, Patterson admitted that the Defendants might successfully prove that the employment agreement between Torres and the Debtor was unenforceable and that the Debtor would therefore fail in its attempt to prove substantial damages, and that both of these factors weighed in favor of the Debtor's decision to enter into the Settlement Agreement. [Finding of Fact No. 23]. Eighth, and finally, the Settlement Agreement allowed the Debtor \"to focus not so much on the courts\" and instead to turn its attention to developing business. [Finding of Fact No. 23]. Thus, this Court finds that the Debtor had ample motive to conceal the fact that it had discovered\n   Torres' LinkedIn profile at the time the Debtor filed the Motion to Dismiss: the Debtor had too much to gain in the short term by concealing its discovery of the LinkedIn profile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For all the reasons set forth above, this Court finds that all of the elements of judicial estoppel are satisfied. Accordingly, the Debtor is estopped from now taking the position that the Settlement Agreement should be voided and that the Debtor should be allowed to prosecute the claims against the Defendants set forth in the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

If the Debtor had to prove only Torres' misconduct by a simple preponderance of the evidence, the Court believes that it would have met its burden in that instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, that is not the standard that governs here and the Court finds that the Debtor has not met the clear and convincing standard for several reasons. First, the Debtor should have called Torres to testify about the LinkedIn profile, as the mere introduction of this profile does not in and of itself rise to the level of constituting clear and convincing evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Torres needed to be asked, under\n   oath, questions related to her LinkedIn profile. One of the following scenarios would necessarily have occurred: (1) Torres would have had to concede that she perjured herself to this Court at the hearings on April 27 and May 3, 2017, and admit that she was in fact the president and CEO of Momentum Staffing in 2016; (2) she would have had to invoke the Fifth Amendment and therefore decline to answer questions posed to her; or (3) she would have had to otherwise explain the contents of her LinkedIn profile and convince this Court that she had not committed perjury. Second, Torres' mother, Romo, should have been called to testify as well. Romo should have been asked under oath whether Torres has been president and/or CEO of Momentum Staffing since May of 2016, and whether Torres has been running Momentum Staffing. Third, in order to meet the clear and convincing standard, the Debtor should have considered calling clients of Momentum Staffing and questioned whether they had ever worked with Torres in May through November of 2016 in her capacity as president and CEO. Although the Debtor was given ample opportunity to prove its case by doing the above, it chose not to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, this Court finds that the Debtor has not met its burden of proving any misconduct of the Defendants by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Additionally, even if the Debtor had established by clear and convincing evidence that any of the Defendants had engaged in fraud or other misconduct, the Debtor has failed to show that such fraud or misconduct prevented the Debtor from fully and fairly presenting its case (i.e., from fully and fairly prosecuting the claims in the Amended Complaint). Although it is true that at the point in time the Debtor was negotiating the Settlement Agreement with the Defendants (i.e., in March of 2018), the Debtor was not aware of the representations in Torres' LinkedIn profile, the Debtor discovered shortly thereafter-during the first week of April of 2018-that Torres' LinkedIn profile was representing that Torres has held the roles of president and CEO of Momentum Staffing since May of 2016. At this point, the Debtor could have informed the Court and requested that it vacate its order approving the Settlement Agreement and also vacate its order dismissing the adversary proceeding. However, instead of immediately informing the Court of Torres' LinkedIn profile, the Debtor chose to sit on this information for seven and a half months, until November of 2018, when it then filed the Motion informing this Court of the LinkedIn profile and of its wish to undo the Settlement Agreement. Under these circumstances, the Debtor cannot say that the alleged misconduct of Torres prevented the Debtor from fully and fairly prosecuting the claims set forth in the Amended Complaint. Indeed, Patterson testified that there were several reasons that the Debtor settled, and that the Debtor's belief that it could not prove Torres' misconduct was only one of these reasons. He also testified that the Debtor settled because: (1) the prosecution of the lawsuit\n   to conclusion was going to be very costly; (2) even if the Debtor recovered a judgment, the Defendants were probably judgment proof; and (3) the Debtor needed cash infusions quickly for its business, and the Settlement Agreement generated such funds for the immediate future. [Finding of Fact No. 23]. Stated differently, the Debtor really settled for purely economic reasons: it needed cash quickly and it believed firmly that the Defendants were judgment proof; moreover, and just as important as the infusion of cash, the Debtor was able to prevent Momentum Staffing from competing for business as a result of obtaining the Settlement Agreement. Such circumstances undermine the Debtor's position now that Torres' misconduct prevented it from fully and fairly prosecuting this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The dispute at bar underscores the maxim that \"two wrongs don't make a right.\" Here, Torres lied under oath at the hearing on April 27, 2017, but then came back in May of 2017 to \"come clean\" and speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. But, as her LinkedIn profile suggests, it seems-at least by a preponderance of the evidence-that she did not come totally clean on the issue of who Momentum Staffing's officers were. Her conduct has therefore apparently been wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   However, the Debtor's actions have also been wrong. Even though it learned about the LinkedIn profile during the first week of April of 2018-i.e., even before this Court signed the joint stipulation of dismissal in the adversary proceeding and the order dismissing the Main Case, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 15, 18]-the Debtor deliberately held off on informing this Court about the representations made in the LinkedIn profile that Torres has been president and CEO of Momentum Staffing since May of 2016. Instead, the Debtor accepted the benefits of the Settlement Agreement-including cash payments that the Debtor desperately needed to fund its operations and the non-compete provision that allowed the Debtor unfettered access to 20 clients and prospective clients without any competition from Momentum Staffing-and told the Court that it had resolved all issues with the Defendants. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 17]. Only when it was in the Debtor's economic interest seven months later did it file the Motion informing this Court that Torres' LinkedIn profile contradicted her testimony from 2017, and begin complaining that it would never have settled if it had known about this LinkedIn profile during settlement negotiations. The Debtor's position now is hard to swallow, and this Court-exercising its discretion-will not do so.\n   <em>\n    Diaz v. Methodist Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7410938\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/46/492/#p496\">\n    46 F.3d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496 (5th Cir. 1995) (\"The decision to relieve a party from final judgment is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Rather, the Court finds that the Motion was not timely filed as required under Rule 60(c). Alternatively, even if the Motion was timely filed, the Court finds that the Debtor is judicially estopped from now taking the position that it wants to prosecute the claims set forth in the Amended Complaint when previously it represented to this Court in the Motion to Dismiss that it had resolved all claims with the Defendants. Finally, in the alternative, even if the Motion was timely filed and judicial estoppel does not apply, the Court finds that the Debtor has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the Defendants engaged in fraud or other misconduct and that this fraud or misconduct prevented the Debtor from fully and fairly prosecuting the claims set forth in the Amended Complaint. Stated differently, the Settlement Agreement and the corresponding\n   orders approving the Motion to Compromise and dismissing the adversary proceeding were not unfairly obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   An order denying the Motion will be entered simultaneously herewith.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Torres, Romo, and Momentum Staffing will be collectively referred to as the \"\n    <em>\n     Defendants\n    </em>\n    .\" The objections filed by the Defendants will collectively be referred to as the \"\n    <em>\n     Objections\n    </em>\n    .\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The Debtor subsequently filed three more amended petitions in the State Court Lawsuit.

Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg.

Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 25:17-19, 29:16-18]. Ultimately, it is a distinction without a difference, as Torres was employed by the Debtor until November of 2016. Stated differently, it appears that Torres was working for both the Debtor and Momentum Staffing in 2016, a circumstance which the Debtor contends violated the employment agreements that Torres had with the Debtor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    Specifically, Patterson testified as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n    Q: Okay.

Doc. No. 131, Feb. 6, 2019, Hrg. Tr. 19:14-21, 20:3-8].\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    Later, Patterson testified as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n    Q: When was the first printout from the LinkedIn page?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n    A: The first part of April.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n    Q: So you knew about these alleged misrepresentations since April of 2018?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n    A: Correct.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-218\">\n    [Adv.

Tr. 70:9-13].\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    The Court finds it disingenuous that the Debtor's Post-Hearing Brief asserts that the Debtor did not discover until July of 2018 that Torres' LinkedIn profile represented that she had been president of Momentum since May of 2016, [Adv. Doc. No. 141, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 21, 22, &amp; 37], when Patterson himself testified, as shown immediately above, that he first learned of this information in early April of 2018.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    Hereinafter, any reference to a \"Rule\" refers to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    At the time of the Settlement Agreement, the Debtor intended to file a proposed plan, and therefore needed immediate access to funds in order to facilitate obtaining confirmation of a plan. However, eventually, after the Settlement Agreement was consummated and the terms took effect, the Debtor decided not to attempt to obtain a confirmed plan but rather to request this Court to dismiss the case-which the Court did.

Indeed, the last quarterly fee payment that the Debtor had to make was $ 8,251.00, [Finding of Fact No. 19], and given the Debtor's tight cash flow during this period of time, it was definitely a benefit to the Debtor to have its case dismissed in order to avoid further U.S. Trustee fees.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    Such litigation costs would necessarily have included preparing and prosecuting a plan, which could have drawn objections from various creditors, not the least of which was the IRS (with whom the Debtor eventually achieved a settlement).

Tr. 75:7-14].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    The Debtor ended up not going forward with a plan, but rather seeking a dismissal of the case due to resolving its disputes not only with the Defendants but the IRS. Thus, the Debtor was able to use the funds it received from the Settlement Agreement for its business operations and development rather than having to spend these funds on obtaining a confirmed plan of reorganization.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    There is no question that the Debtor did not prove any fraud or misconduct by the other two Defendants (i.e., Romo and Momentum Staffing) by either a preponderance of the evidence standard or by clear and convincing evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    In fact, the Court gave counsel for the Debtor this very opportunity.

I will inform the Court that I had tried to subpoena for appearances today Sylvia Romo, Sarah Romo [Torres], and then another person that works there, Nellie Moreno.

There is, I think, perjury and there are several cases I can bring the Court's attention of. The demonstration of perjury is a fraud on the Court that is a basis for setting aside a judgment.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n    The Court: Okay. Well, yeah, I just want to make sure here. Let me - my question, okay, let me put the question this way. I'll give you an option. Do you want to stop and say that you are done in your case-in-chief or do you want me to issue an order requiring any persons to come and give testimony that you've tried to subpoena and keep the Record open and continue? Or do you want me to take a break and you can visit with Mr. Patterson, I mean?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-234\">\n    Mr. Baker: We'll stand on the Record.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-235\">\n    [Adv.
