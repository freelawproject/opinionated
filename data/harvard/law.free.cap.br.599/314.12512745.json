Shah, M.D. and Apex Katy Physicians, LLC (\"Apex\n   Physicians\") filed a Motion to Reopen Apex Long Term Acute Care-Katy, L.P.'s (\"Apex LTAC\") bankruptcy case, which was closed in 2013, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20350\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging fraud on the Court on the part of Robert D. Remy, Dr. Stephen Koch, Adeel Zaidi, and various other parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Shah and Apex Physicians argue that Remy filed fraudulent financial statements in this case, making it likely that assets were hidden from the estate and have not been properly distributed in accordance with the Court's confirmation order. Remy argues that Shah and Apex Physicians are precluded from reopening the case because the Motion was filed after the 180-day deadline in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   had elapsed and because they have failed to establish \"cause\" to reopen the case.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1). On January 7, 2010, the Court confirmed Apex LTAC's Second Amended Chapter 11 Plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 212). The terms of the Plan created the Apex LTAC Distribution Trust (the \"Trust\") which received all of Apex LTAC's assets on the effective date. (ECF No. 212 at 7). On March 13, 2013, William G. West, Jr., the Distribution Trustee for the Trust, filed an expedited motion for entry of a final decree closing the chapter 11 case. (ECF No. 560 at 1-2). On March 14, 2013, the Court entered a Final Decree closing the case, finding Apex LTAC's bankruptcy estate was fully administered. (ECF No. 561 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Business Relations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2007, Adeel Zaidi and A.K. Chagla sought to recruit investors for the purchase of real property in northwest Houston with the end goal of building a hospital. (ECF No. 566-5 at 3). Through Prestige Consulting, Inc., a company Zaidi and Chagla owned at the time, they formed (i) Apex Physicians, (ii) Apex LTAC, and (ii) and Apex GP, which acted as Apex LTAC's general partner. (ECF No. 566-5 at 3). Apex Physicians served as Apex LTAC's landlord. (ECF No. 566-5 at 3). Prestige Consulting was hired to staff and manage Apex LTAC, and Abeer Saqer, one of Prestige's directors, was hired to serve as Apex LTAC's interim chief executive officer. (ECF No. 566-5 at 4). Shah was one of a group of initial investors recruited by Zaidi. (ECF No. 566-5 at 3). Shah ultimately served as Apex Physicians managing member, and a company owned by Shah became the majority owner of Apex Physicians. (ECF No. 566-5 at 3). The goal was to operate Apex LTAC as a long-term acute-care hospital; however, the enterprise was not a success. (ECF No. 566-5 at 3). This failure led to Apex LTAC's bankruptcy and subsequent lawsuits between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Previous Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2009, Apex Physicians filed suit in state court against Adeel Zaidi, A.K. Chagla,\n   Apex Katy Physicians-TMG, LLC, Abeer Saquer, and related entities (the \"Apex Hospital Project Lawsuit\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 564 at 2; ECF No. 566-5 at 5). Apex Physicians and Shah allege that as a result of this lawsuit, \"it became apparent that fraudulent financials, including a false financial statement had been filed in this bankruptcy matter on behalf of the debtor's general partner Apex Katy Physicians-TMG, LLC ('Apex GP').\" (ECF No. 564 at 2). On May 13, 2011, Saqer and her company, I-Care International LLC, entered into a settlement agreement with Shah and Apex Physicians with respect to claims in the Apex Hospital Project Lawsuit. Subsequently, on May 4, 2015, Shah and Apex Physicians initiated another state court lawsuit against Saqer and I-Care, \"claiming they [had been] fraudulently induced into the Settlement Agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 566 at 3). The state court granted summary judgment in favor of Saqer and I-Care on December 19, 2016. (ECF No. 566-3 at 2). Subsequent attempts by Shah and Apex Physicians to appeal the summary judgment in the second lawsuit were denied. (ECF No. 566-4 at 2; ECF No. 566-5 at 3; ECF No. 566-6 at 2-5). Remy alleges that it was not a party to this litigation. (ECF No. 571 at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 31, 2016, Shah and Apex Physicians filed a third state court lawsuit, naming Remy as a defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 565 at 3). According to Remy, the lawsuit alleged that he breached his legal and ethical duties as an attorney, including directing the preparation of Apex GP's purportedly fraudulent financial statement. (ECF No. 565 at 3). On February 6, 2018, the state court granted in part and denied in part Remy's Motion for Summary Judgment in the case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 561-1). Subsequently, on March 9, 2018, Shah and Apex Physicians amended their complaint to add Saqer and I-Care to the litigation. (ECF No. 566 at 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 566-7). On November 13, 2018, the state court granted Remy's No-Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment against Shah and Apex Physicians and dismissed with prejudice all claims filed against Remy by Shah and Apex Physicians. (ECF No. 571-3 at 1). The state court lawsuit remains pending pursuant to Shah and Apex Physicians' Motion to Stay. (ECF No. 566-9 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to Reopen\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 18, 2018, Shah and Apex Physicians filed a Motion to Reopen this bankruptcy case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 564). Shah and Apex Physicians argue that the case should be reopened to examine allegedly fraudulent financials created by Robert Remy, Dr. Stephen Koch, Adeel Zaidi, Abeer Saqer, A.K. Chagla, and Gary Toche. (ECF No. 564 at 4). Specifically,\n   Shah and Apex Physicians claim that because the Court relied on \"fraudulent financial statements\" to distribute Apex LTAC's remaining assets, \"the case must be reopened to determine what assets were intentionally excluded and by whom.\" (ECF No. 564 at 4). Shah and Apex Physicians rely on an affidavit prepared by Naqi Ali Sanjanlal\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   to argue that \"the financial statement ... advanced by Apex GP during the bankruptcy proceedings is false and was prepared at the direction of attorney Robert Remy ....\" (ECF No. 564 at 2). In the alternative, Shah and Apex Physicians ask the Court for \"a declaration that [the] assets and related claims have been abandoned by the bankruptcy estate,\" and that the statute of limitations for any claims related to the alleged fraudulent financial statements have been tolled. (ECF No. 564 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 9, 2018, Robert Remy filed his response in opposition to Shah and Apex Physicians' Motion to Reopen. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 565). Remy argues that the case should not be reopened because there is no evidence that Apex GP's financial statement was filed, reviewed, or relied on in this case. (ECF No. 565 at 1). In Remy's view, Shah and Apex Physicians fail to identify how the financial statement is false, and lack evidence showing that the Distribution Trustee saw or relied on the financial statement in pursuing assets of Apex LTAC's estate. (ECF No. 565 at 4). Remy insists that Sanjanlal's affidavit and testimony, relied upon by Shah and Apex Physicians to show fraud on the Court, is mischaracterized and in fact directly contradicts Shah and Apex Physicians' assertions that the financial statements are fraudulent. (ECF No. 565 at 5-8 (citing portions of the affidavit, in which Sanjanlal declares that he did not, nor was he asked to, misrepresent, mischaracterize or change the financial statements)). Remy further argues that no \"cause\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20350\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) exists to reopen the case. (ECF No. 565 at 5-12). In the alternative, even if it was proper to reopen the case, Remy insists that there exists no legal basis for tolling claims and it would be improper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to abandon undisclosed assets. (ECF No. 565 at 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 9, 2018, Abeer Saqer and I-Care International, LLC filed a response in opposition to Shah and Apex Physicians' Motion to Reopen. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 566). Saqer and I-Care, while incorporating Remy's Response in full, also separately object to Shah and Apex Physicians' Motion on the basis that it attempts to circumvent the settlement agreement previously entered into by the parties in the Apex Hospital Project Lawsuit and upheld in the second lawsuit. (ECF No. 566 at 2). Saqer and I-Care characterize the Motion to Reopen as an attempt \"to delay and impeded discovery, court orders, and a final resolution\" in the pending state court matter. (ECF No. 566 at 2). Specifically, Saqer and I-Care allege that Shah and Apex Physicians filed the Motion to avoid deposition requests in the pending state court matter. (ECF No. 566 at 5). On September 9, 2018, Dr. Stephen Koch also filed a response opposing Shah and Apex Physicians' Motion to Reopen. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 567). Dr. Koch's response joined in the responses previously filed by Remy, Saqer, and I-Care. (ECF No. 567 at 1, 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 24, 2018, the Court ordered the parties to file additional pleadings on\n   whether\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   precludes the reopening of the case. The parties subsequently filed briefs on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Shah and Apex Physicians reason that \u00a7 1144 does not apply and therefore does not preclude reopening the case, because they do not seek to revoke the confirmation order. (ECF No. 570 at 2). Instead, Shah and Apex Physicians contend that they seek to reopen the case so that the Trustee may then pursue claims against Remy, and other parties, and \"distribute the recovered assets[ ]\n   <em>\n    in accordance with\n   </em>\n   the confirmation order ....\" (ECF No. 570 at 2) (emphasis added). Shah and Apex Physicians further argue that reopening the case is within this Court's discretion, because there exists no alternate forum given that the state court dismissed certain causes of action pursuant to this Court's jurisdiction of the claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). (ECF No. 570 at 4). In the alternative, Shah and Apex Physicians insist that the Court \"deem Apex LTAC's causes of action against Robert Remy tolled and abandoned.\" (ECF No. 570 at 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Remy's response largely tracks his previous arguments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 571). Remy notes that Shah and Apex Physicians have provided no evidence that the financial statements were fraudulent, nor that they were relied on \"by any person or for any reason.\" (ECF No. 571 at 1). He highlights that Shah and Apex Physicians have failed to show \"cause\" as to why the case should be reopened, and further that the passage of time weighs heavily against reopening the case. (ECF No. 571 at 2). Remy insists that even if the case were to be reopened, there exists no legal basis for tolling the statute of limitations and that abandoning such claims would be improper. (ECF No. 570 at 3). Finally, Remy, contrary to Shah and Apex Physicians' argument, maintains that the allegations are a direct attack on the Court's confirmation order, and therefore barred under \u00a7 1144's 180-day limitation. (ECF No. 570 at 2). Specifically, Remy alleges that the allegations fit within the statutory goals of \u00a7 1144, \"because they allege a broad conspiracy by several participants in the Debtor's plan confirmation process to mislead this Court and the Debtor's creditors.\" (ECF No. 571 at 11). Thus, the allegations are directed ultimately to fraud in the procurement of the confirmation order. (ECF No. 570 at 11). Dr. Koch, Saqer, and I-Care joined in Remy's response. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 572;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 573).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The District Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(ECF No. 564 at 5-6). Rule 9024 incorporates Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60 and generally applies the rule to bankruptcy cases. However, there are important exceptions written into Rule 9024. For the purposes of this Opinion, the most important exception arises under subpart 3 of Rule 9024, which states that, \"a complaint to revoke an order confirming a plan may be filed only within the time allowed by \u00a7 1144, \u00a7 1230, or \u00a7 1330....\" FED.

Rule 60(b) states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b):\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (4) the judgment is void;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is not longer equitable; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (6) any other reason that justifies relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   FED.

Rather, Shah and Apex Physicians seek to \"reopen the bankruptcy estate to allow the trustee to pursue [ ] claims against Remy, and possibly others ...and [subsequently] distribute the recovered assets, in accordance with the confirmation order ....\" (ECF No. 570 at 2).

As of that date, as provided for in the confirmation order and Plan, all assets, including any\n   potential causes of action known or unknown and any assets disclosed or undisclosed were vested in the Trust and were to be prosecuted by the Distribution Trustee.
