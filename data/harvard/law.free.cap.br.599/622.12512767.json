Debtor made this payment from his personal account even though McM, Inc. (formerly McMartin Family Partnership) was the lessee. Morrison accepted the check and assumed Debtor-or any entity in which Debtor held an interest-had the right to farm the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Within a week or two after Debtor remitted the 2017 rent check to Morrison Family Trust, Debtor informed Morrison he was establishing a new entity to sublease the Farmland and proposed transferring the lease to Elkhorn Farms, LLP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Morrison agreed to the sublease as long as the terms were the same as those in the existing lease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Morrison insisted that Debtor draft the new agreement with the same terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   McM, Inc. filed a voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on February 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 22, 2017, Morrison Family Trust formally leased the Farmland to Elkhorn Farms. Specifically, Morrison on behalf of Morrison Family Trust and Kenneth H. Johnson and Al R. Johnson on behalf of Elkhorn Farms executed a two-year (2017 and 2018 farming seasons) cash lease agreement to rent the Farmland. Ex. 2. Aside from the modified term of the lease and the new lessee, the remainder of the provisions of the agreement are identical to those in the agreement between Morrison Family Trust and McMartin Family Partnership, including the $ 22,000 annual rate for the use of the Farmland. Ex. 2. Elkhorn Farms drafted the lease using the Morrison Family Trust/McMartin Family Partnership lease as a template.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 26, 2017, Elkhorn Farms paid Debtor $ 22,500. Ex. 4. The check Elkhorn Farms issued to Debtor notes it is for \"Land Rent Reimbursement\" in the memo line. The payment stub attached to the check lists the description of the Farmland, which matches the legal descriptions of the Farmland in the cash lease agreement between Morrison and McMartin Family Partnership and the cash lease agreement between Morrison and Elkhorn Farms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. 1, 2, 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Debtor filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on September 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

First, Morrison asserts that Debtor received a direct benefit in exchange for his payment because Debtor \"wrote the rent check and was leasing the land in his own name since there was no prohibition on sub-leasing in the written contract.\" Doc. 31 at 1. Under this theory, Morrison argues Debtor received reasonably equivalent value because he received the right to farm the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The evidence belies this assertion. The lease was not in Debtor's name, and Morrison presented no evidence of a sublease between Debtor and McM. Simply put, Debtor did not receive the use of the land upon his payment to Morrison. McM did. Although it is understandable that Morrison did not appreciate the legal distinctions between Debtor and the various McMartin entities, the distinctions matter. Debtor received no direct consideration in exchange for his $ 22,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Alternatively, Morrison argues that Elkhorn Farms farmed the land and reimbursed Debtor for the 2017 land rent payment, making Debtor and his bankruptcy estate whole. More specifically, Morrison claims that Debtor received reasonably equivalent value through the indirect benefit of the $ 22,500 rent reimbursement payment from Elkhorn Farms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In response to this defense, the Trustee asserts that the determination of reasonable equivalence must be made as of the time of the transfer, and the transfer must be given in exchange for something Debtor received from Morrison-quid pro quo. He also claims that Morrison must show Debtor contemplated the direct (or indirect) benefit he ultimately received (reimbursement from Elkhorn Farms) at the time Debtor paid McM's $ 22,000 lease obligation to Morrison. In other words, the Trustee argues that the value Debtor received ($ 22,500) must have been in contemporaneous exchange for Debtor's ($ 22,000) payment to Morrison and must have arisen from the original bargain. He repeatedly characterized the connection between Debtor's payment of McM's lease obligation to Morrison and the payment to Debtor from Elkhorn Farms on the sublease as mere \"happenstance.\" As support for this characterization, the Trustee emphasizes that when Debtor wrote the check to Morrison Family Trust, Elkhorn Farms did not exist, and there was no agreement that Debtor would receive anything in return. The Trustee repeatedly insisted that Morrison must prove Debtor had a plan to bring reasonably equivalent value back to Debtor at the time of the transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Trustee's arguments fail for several reasons. First, the Trustee focuses his argument on Debtor's intent at the time of the payment to Morrison, and Debtor and Morrison's bargain at the time of this transfer, rather than considering the transfer and the rent reimbursement from the perspective of unsecured creditors. \"In contrast to actual fraud, a claim for constructive fraud focuses on the effect the transfer had on the debtor's financial condition without regard for the debtor's state of mind or intentions.\"\n   <em>\n    Angell v.

In\n   <em>\n    BFP\n   </em>\n   , a Chapter 11 debtor argued that the price received at a mortgage foreclosure sale was less than reasonably equivalent value for the property. The Supreme Court focused on property value at the time of the sale. As a result of the Court's decision in BFP, courts typically ignore post-transfer appreciation or depreciation in their analysis of value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v.Coyne, Schultz, Becker &amp; Bauer, S.C.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Pawlak\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160300\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/483/169/#p185\">\n    483 B.R. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185 (Bankr. W.D. Wis. 2012) (citation omitted). Notably, the Supreme Court did not articulate any requirement that a reasonably equivalent benefit be received by a debtor at the time of the transfer as the Trustee argues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this case, there is no dispute regarding property value because both the transfer and the benefit (reimbursement) were in cash. There is no evidence that the value of money changed in the two months between the transfer to Morrison and the indirect benefit via land rent reimbursement Debtor received. Most of the cases the Trustee cites do not stand for the proposition that the exchange of transfer for benefit must take place on the same date or at the same time. This is particularly true in those cases in which the debtor received an indirect benefit for the transfer-as presented by the circumstances in this case. Accordingly, the Trustee's argument that the transfer and reimbursement are not sufficiently contemporaneous is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, the Court is not persuaded by the Trustee's argument that there is no evidence showing Debtor transferred $ 22,000 in exchange for a benefit to Debtor. Specifically, the Trustee argues that Debtor's $ 22,000 payment to Morrison for McM's land rent obligation was not given in exchange for Elkhorn Farms' $ 22,500 payment to Debtor. He asserts that the transfer and return benefit to Debtor were not the \"quid pro quo\" of the other, but rather, merely \"happenstance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To the extent the Trustee suggests that Debtor must receive a direct benefit from Morrison in exchange for the transfer of $ 22,000, this argument is rejected. Courts routinely find that an indirect benefit in exchange for a transfer may satisfy the reasonably equivalent value requirement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Richards &amp; Conover Steel, Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9486751\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/267/602/#p608\">\n    267 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   612-14 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Polaroid Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3963040\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/472/22/#p67\">\n    472 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   67 ;\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.

In evaluating reasonably equivalent value, the Court finds it appropriate to consider all the evidence related to the transfer to Morrison and to compare this sum to the total benefit Debtor received either directly or indirectly in exchange for the transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Richards &amp; Conover Steel, Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9486751\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/267/602/#p608\">\n    267 B.R. at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he court must examine 'all aspects of the transaction and carefully measure the value of all benefits and burdens to the debtor, direct or indirect.' \" (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Based on the evidence received at trial, Debtor and various entities in which he owned an interest leased land from Morrison. Debtor signed a lease of the Farmland on behalf of McMartin Family Partnership, later known as McM. On February 2, 2017, Debtor paid $ 22,000 to Morrison to satisfy McM's lease obligation. A week or two after Debtor transferred $ 22,000 to Morrison, Debtor informed Morrison he was establishing a new entity to sublease the land Morrison leased to McM. Debtor proposed transferring the lease to Elkhorn Farms. Morrison agreed. Although the founders of Elkhorn Farms did not complete the incorporation registration with the North Dakota Secretary of State until April, they began the incorporation process in early 2017 (not later than February 16, 2017). On March 22, 2017, Morrison and Elkhorn Farms signed a cash rent lease agreement relating to the Farmland-the same real property as the lease Debtor signed on behalf of McMartin Family Partnership. In other words, Debtor made a cash lease payment in February 2017 for the same land Elkhorn Farms formally leased in March 2017. On April 26, 2017, Elkhorn Farms issued a check to Debtor for $ 22,500. The memo line provides that the payment is for Land Rent Reimbursement. The payment stub attached to the check includes a land description matching the land description of the Farmland Morrison leased to McMartin Family Partnership and Elkhorn Farms. After considering all these facts, the Court is satisfied that Debtor received $ 22,500 in exchange for the $ 22,000 land rent payment Debtor paid to Morrison on behalf of McM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Additionally, the Trustee argues that the $ 22,000 transfer was not in exchange for the $ 22,500 rent reimbursement from Elkhorn Farms because they were not quid pro quo of the other, and Eighth Circuit law requires a quid pro quo exchange. The Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel in\n   <em>\n    In re Richards &amp; Conover Steel, Co.\n   </em>\n   suggested that an indirect benefit may be the quid pro quo of a transfer. It found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A transfer is in exchange for value if one is the quid pro quo of the other. 2 David G.
