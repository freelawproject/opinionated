Chavis (\"Chavis\"), in her capacity as co-beneficiary of the probate estate of Bobbie F. Wynder (the \"Estate\"). The Complaint seeks a determination that an indebtedness owed by Leroy Mangrum, Jr. (\"Mangrum\") to the Estate is nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) because of Mangrum's alleged defalcation while serving as attorney-in-fact for Bobbie F. Wynder (\"wynder\") pursuant to a general power of attorney. The debt at issue originates from a judgment initially entered by the Circuit Court for the City of Hampton, Virginia (the \"Circuit Court\"), holding in relevant part that Mangrum violated \u00a7 1612 of the Virginia Uniform Power of Attorney Act ( Va. Code. Ann. \u00a7 64.2-1600\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ) when he cashed in an annuity belonging to Wynder valued\n   at $ 116,330.64 (the \"Annuity\") while serving as her attorney-in-fact, and that he must restore those funds to the Estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 1 at 262-63;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    at 284-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This adversary proceeding constitutes a core proceeding over which this Court has jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(I) and 1334(b).

The following constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52, as incorporated into the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure by Rule 7052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Leroy and Doris Mangrum filed a joint voluntary petition for relief under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on December 17, 2016. Chavis timely initiated this adversary proceeding by filing the Complaint on February 13, 2017. Mangrum answered the Complaint on March 16, 2017 (the \"Answer\"), and generally denied all of its material allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer at 1, ECF No. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At a pre-trial conference held on April 28, 2017, counsel for Chavis represented that the Circuit Court's judgment was on appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court thus continued the pre-trial conference generally pending the outcome of the appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Cont. Generally at 2, ECF No. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After receiving notice of the opinion and order entered on March 1, 2018, by the Supreme Court of Virginia, which affirmed the Circuit Court in part, the Court reconvened the pre-trial conference on April 20, 2018. Counsel for both parties advised the Court that the only issue remaining in this case was whether Mangrum possessed the requisite culpable state of mind to prove defalcation under \u00a7 523(a)(4). The Court thus limited the scope of the proceedings to the narrow issue of Mangrum's mental state and invited the parties to file simultaneous briefs on that issue. Instead, on May 31, 2018, Chavis filed a motion for summary judgment, and Mangrum filed a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At a hearing held on July 20, 2018, the Court denied both motions because there remained a genuine issue of material fact with respect to Mangrum's state of mind for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Denying Summ. J. Mot., ECF No. 31 ; Order Denying Mot. to Dismiss, Adv. Pro. No 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, Mangrum was the only witness examined by either party. No objections were lodged to Mangrum's testimony. The Court also admitted without objection all exhibits offered by the parties into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following the trial, the parties filed supplemental briefs at the Court's invitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mangrum testified at trial as to his decades-long relationship with Wynder and the events specifically related to the matter before the Court. During his testimony, Mangrum proved himself to be an excellent oral historian who was confident in his recollections of the past. Even though Mangrum's advanced years appeared to contribute to some difficulty in organizing his thoughts and speech, his testimony was detailed, consistent, and indicative of a strong long-term memory. Having listened to Mangrum's testimony and assessed his candor and demeanor, the Court finds him to be genuine and credible. This finding is further supported by the underlying state court record, which speaks to Mangrum's integrity and good character.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Ex. 1 at 104, 263. In these findings of fact, the Court weaves together the excerpts of testimony from the state court record admitted into evidence and Mangrum's testimony at trial to establish a chronology spanning approximately six decades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mangrum testified that he first met Wynder in approximately 1955, when he was dating Wynder's sister who later became his wife.

In its letter opinion, the Circuit Court expressly acknowledged Mangrum's good character. Pl's Ex. 1 at 263. This Court agrees with the Circuit Court's observation.

Accordingly, this final consideration offers a safe harbor to a debtor who consciously disregarded or was willfully blind to the risk that his conduct would turn out to violate his fiduciary duties if the ordinary \"law-abiding person\" would have also engaged in the same conduct given the circumstances and magnitude of the risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Mangrum's State of Mind\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   To determine whether Mangrum's breach of his fiduciary duties was the product of reckless conduct, the Court must examine whether Mangrum was aware of the existence of the Virginia Uniform Power of Attorney Act or even more generally that laws exist to govern the conduct of an attorney-in-fact. If the evidence demonstrates that Mangrum was aware of his fiduciary duties to Wynder, the Court must then determine whether he consciously disregarded or was willfully blind to the risk of violating that duty when he cashed in the Annuity. Only upon a finding of conscious disregard or willful blindness would the Court proceed to determine whether the risk that surrendering the Annuity would violate Mangrum's fiduciary duties was substantial and unjustifiable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court begins with the threshold inquiry: whether Mangrum was subjectively aware of his fiduciary duties. Chavis asserts that Mangrum's testimony at trial before this Court\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   does not suggest any state-of-mind incapacity on the part of Mr. Mangrum. To the contrary, it reveals a gentleman who knew full well what he was doing in his role as attorney-in-fact for [Wynder]. He simply did not then (and does not now) think it was wrong ... But his own assessment of what was right and what was wrong is of no consequence in light of the State Court Rulings - - which are not subject to reversal by this Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Pl.'s Post-Trial Br. at 12. The Court agrees with Chavis in part. The Court finds that when cashing in the Annuity, Mangrum \"knew full well what he was doing\" to the extent he understood that cashing in the Annuity would result in proceeds. The Court further agrees that Mangrum did not believe surrendering the Annuity was wrong. The central theme of Mangrum's testimony was that he simply followed Wynder's instructions, and that forms the basis for his sincerely held belief that he acted properly as her attorney-in-fact. To frame his belief rhetorically: how could he have committed any wrongdoing if his actions on Wynder's behalf were based on instructions from Wynder herself?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court disagrees with Chavis, however, that Mangrum's \"own assessment of what was right and what was wrong\" is of no consequence. Although Mangrum's perception of right and wrong was inconsequential in determining liability under state law, Chavis' argument ignores that Mangrum's state of mind is critical to the matter before this Court because\n   <em>\n    Bullock\n   </em>\n   demands the Court assess his subjective beliefs, understanding, and knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A debtor's subjective awareness of his fiduciary duties may be inferred from his knowledge and sophistication.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baggett v.

Moreover, the POA itself does not contain any mention of, or implied reference to, the provisions of Virginia law that establish the duties imposed upon an attorney-in-fact. The POA was drafted by a nonlawyer who, even assuming she understood the legal ramifications of the document she prepared, properly refrained from providing any legal advice concerning the POA to Wynder or Mangrum. Accordingly, there is no indication that the fiduciary duties imposed upon attorneys-in-fact were addressed in the course of the preparation of the POA or in the POA itself to put Mangrum on notice of his fiduciary duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Also, while Mangrum is undoubtedly a valued and respected member of his family and community, the Court finds that Mangrum is a layperson with respect to legal and financial matters who did not possess the acumen necessary to appreciate his duties as attorney-in-fact. Mangrum's lack of sophistication was revealed in his testimony regarding the bank's initial failure to honor the POA, which demonstrated only a vague understanding of the issue presented or the nature of the additional\n   documentation the bank requested. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Mangrum had any prior experience as an attorney-in-fact or in any other fiduciary capacity. Further, there is also nothing in the record to suggest that Mangrum had any prior professional experience, legal training, or other education that would have familiarized him with the responsibilities of a fiduciary. Although the POA granted Mangrum broad powers to control Wynder's financial affairs, the Court does not believe that is how Mangrum understood his role. Mangrum's testimony instead suggests his understanding of his role was more limited: to perform Wynder's intentions when her diminished physical health made it difficult or impossible for her to do so herself. This limited perception of his role as attorney-in-fact contributed to Mangrum's failure to appreciate his fiduciary status. For these reasons, the Court finds that Mangrum lacked the knowledge or experience to inform him of his fiduciary duties or even to equip him with the instinct needed to investigate the potential legal consequences of assuming the role of attorney-in-fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, a debtor's conduct following a violation of his fiduciary duties also provides insight into his state of mind.\n   <em>\n    Aiello v.

Mangrum's conduct after he surrendered the Annuity shows none of the hallmarks of someone who was aware of his fiduciary obligations and thus understood the risk that his conduct might violate a fiduciary duty. Far from it. Mangrum did not attempt to conceal that he cashed in the Annuity or wall Wynder off from her financial affairs to avoid revealing his conduct. Instead, he met regularly with Wynder-who all agree remained sharp and interested in her affairs despite the decline in her physical health-concerning her finances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To be sure, another person in Mangrum's position might have known of the fiduciary obligations attendant to the role of attorney-in-fact, but what any other person may have known or what Mangrum\n   <em>\n    should have\n   </em>\n   known about his fiduciary status is of no moment. Mangrum's demeanor and the whole of his testimony convince the Court that he is a well-meaning layperson who was subjectively unaware of the fiduciary duties associated with his role as attorney-in-fact. The logical consequence is that Mangrum could not consciously disregard or be willfully blind to a risk that his conduct might violate a fiduciary duty of which he was unaware. Having concluded that Mangrum neither consciously disregarded nor was willfully blind to a risk that his conduct would turn out to violate a fiduciary duty, the Court need not assess the nature of the risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This is not a case where a bad actor is attempting to use bankruptcy as a shield for improper conduct. While there is no doubt Mangrum violated Va. Code \u00a7 64.2-1612 by cashing in the Annuity or that Mangrum is liable for his state law violation absent bankruptcy protection, the state law violation alone does not establish nondischargeable defalcation under \u00a7 523(a)(4).\n   <em>\n    Bullock\n   </em>\n   imposes a culpable state of mind requirement that Virginia law does not.
