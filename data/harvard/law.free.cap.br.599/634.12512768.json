Guzm\u00e1n Rivera (\"Dr. Guzm\u00e1n\"), in courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico to recover unpaid pension benefits, as well as other forms of relief. Seeking a breathing spell from this litigation, the Pension Trust filed a chapter 11 petition on January 11, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 6 and 7, 2018, motions to dismiss the chapter 11 case were filed by Yali Acevedo, on her own and on behalf of 180 plaintiffs in a case before the Court of First Instance, San Juan; Francisco Abreu, on his own and on behalf of six other plaintiffs in a case before the Court of First Instance, Aguadilla; and Edda D. Gonz\u00e1lez-V\u00e1zquez, a plaintiff in a case before the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico (collectively, the \"Appellees\"). The Appellees, who are participants under the Pension Plan, asserted that the Pension Trust was not a \"person\" eligible for bankruptcy relief because it was not a \"business trust\" under the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   They alleged that the Pension Trust did not engage in \"income generating activities\" or \"business activities\" and, therefore, was not a business trust eligible for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. The Pension Trust opposed the motions to dismiss, claiming, among other things, that it was a business trust because it had attributes of a corporation and engaged in business activities. According to the Pension Trust, the court needed to consider the \"totality of the circumstances,\" including the terms of the Pension Trust document, the business activities in which the Trust engaged before the Pension Plan was terminated, and the economic landscape that led to its financial decline. The Pension Trust likened its post-termination activities to those an insolvent corporation would undertake in liquidating its assets in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case and stated that the bankruptcy case was commenced \"\n   <em>\n    specifically to effectuate the orderly liquidation of the business trust\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The bankruptcy court scheduled an evidentiary hearing on the two motions to dismiss and, in a pre-hearing order, identified the \"key legal issue\" in determining the Pension Trust's eligibility as \"whether the Pension Trust is a business trust.\" After the evidentiary hearing, at which the only witness was Dr. Guzm\u00e1n, the president\n   of the Pension Trust's board of trustees, the bankruptcy court dictated into the record its findings and rulings and granted the motions to dismiss, indicating that it would issue a written decision at a later date. That written decision was the Dismissal Order in which the court determined that the Pension Trust was not a business trust and, therefore, was ineligible to be a debtor. Noting that the Bankruptcy Code does not define the term \"business trust\" and that no uniform standard has developed in the case law in the First Circuit and elsewhere, the bankruptcy court determined the relevant factors for evaluating whether an entity is a business trust are: (1) \"whether the trust was created for the purpose of carrying [on] a business, as opposed to the preservation of the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   \"; (2) \"whether the trust has the attributes of a corporation\"; (3) \"whether the trust engages in business-like activities\"; and (4) \"whether the trust has a profit motive.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Catholic Sch.

D.P.R. 2018) (citations omitted). The bankruptcy court did not engage in a detailed analysis of each of these factors, but ruled that the Pension Trust was not a business trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Pre-Bankruptcy Events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Establishment of the Pension Trust and the Pension Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Pension Trust was established on November 26, 1979 by a Deed of Trust. The Pension Plan was attached to, and incorporated into, the Deed of Trust. The Settlor of the Pension Trust was the Superintendent of the Catholic Schools of the Archdiocese of San Juan (the \"Settlor\" or the \"Superintendent\"). The Settlor also was denominated in the Pension Plan as its \"Sponsor.\" Pursuant to the terms of the Pension Plan, the Settlor was responsible for the appointment of a \"Retirement Committee\" (hereinafter sometimes the \"committee\") of at least seven members who would be \"under the control and direction of the Settlor and be accountable to it [sic].\" Pursuant to the Pension Plan, the Settlor also was responsible for the appointment of trustees to take possession of Plan property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Deed of Trust incorporates by reference defined terms in the Pension Plan. The Pension Plan defines the term \"Participant\" as \"any employee or their beneficiaries of a participating employer who has acquired or may acquire rights in the plan,\" and the term \"Beneficiaries\" as \"the person or persons, natural or juridical [sic] designated to receive any benefits payable pursuant [to] this document upon the death of the participant,\" as well as \"each and every one of the beneficiaries or heirs after the death of the participants.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The term \"Participating Employer\" is defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ( [i] ) the Office of the Superintendent of Catholic Schools of the Archdiocese of San Juan and any school that is under the supervision of the Superintendent and chooses to participate in the plan,\n   (ii) any successor to the property of any of them, (iii) any other Catholic school under the supervision of the Superintendence [sic] of their respective diocese or superintendence [sic] of Catholic schools that assumes in writing the obligation of this plan, and (iv) any agency and/or branch office of the Catholic Church of Puerto Rico, but in each case subject to the approval of the plan sponsor or their successor [sic].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Pension Plan provides that it was created by the Superintendent \"for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the participating employers and/or their beneficiaries,\" and that \"[u]nder no circumstances shall any trust property be used or any contribution made by the employer[s] under the terms of this plan for purposes other than the exclusive benefit of the employees and their beneficiaries ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also provides that it applies \"to current and future employees of participating employers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Deed of Trust provides that \"the Trust shall consist of such funds as shall from time to time be deposited with the Trustee by the Settlor and its employees in accordance with the term of the Plan ....\" The Pension Plan in turn provides that: \"The custody and control of all the assets constituting part of the fund shall be held by the trustee[s] and neither the Settlor nor any participant shall have any property right on it [sic], except that participants are entitled to receive those payments and distributions that are set forth herein.\" Thus, a board of trustees (hereinafter sometimes the \"trustees\" or the \"board\") administers the Trust and oversees its compliance with the terms and conditions of the Deed of Trust and the (now terminated) Pension Plan. The Deed of Trust requires the trustees to discharge their duties with respect to both the Trust and the Pension Plan \"solely in the interest of the participants and their beneficiar[ies].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The March 2016 Termination of the Pension Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Article 18 of the Pension Plan contains provisions relating to its termination and the liquidation of assets of the Pension Trust. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A. The Settlor reserves the right to terminate this plan in its entirety at any time, for any reason, or no reason at all subject to the previous approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and/or the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, as well as the majority of participating employers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   B. This termination shall be effective if the committee and the trustee[s] receive a termination permit from the Secretary of the Treasury. In such case, each participant shall take possession of all rights, title and interests of accrued benefits acquired under the plan as provided in Section D of this article.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   C. The trustee shall execute each and every one of the legal documents required to achieve the termination of the trust as provided herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   D. When the termination of the plan has been approved, the plan trustees shall proceed to liquidate the trust fund and to apportion the assets in accordance\n   with the priorities established by the regulations of Title IV of ERISA ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   If the assets available for distribution are not sufficient to cover all claims within one of the established priorities, these funds will be prorated and distributed equitably....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 14, 2016, Plan participants were informed that pension payments would cease as of June 30, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, in fact, payments did cease. Unlike the Pension Plan, there was no evidence or argument that the Pension Trust was ever terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As noted above, following termination of the Pension Plan, hundreds of Plan participants (including the Appellees) filed complaints against the Pension Trust and other entities, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the Archdiocese of San Juan, in various local and federal courts seeking to recover pension payments allegedly owed as well as other forms of relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Bankruptcy Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Motions to Dismiss and Opposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On January 11, 2018, the Pension Trust filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On February 6, 2018, Ms. Yali Acevedo and Mr. Francisco Abreu, on their own and on behalf of other plaintiffs in cases in the Puerto Rico courts, filed a motion to dismiss the chapter 11 case, asserting that the Pension Trust was ineligible to be a debtor in a bankruptcy case because it was not a \"business trust\" under \u00a7 101(9)(A)(v).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ms. Edda D. Gonz\u00e1lez-V\u00e1zquez also challenged the Pension Trust's eligibility to file a bankruptcy petition by filing a motion to dismiss the case. She maintained the Pension Trust could not be considered a business trust because it was \"not created for a business purpose,\" had \"no ongoing income generating activities,\" and because its formation document \"prohibit[ed] the transferability of [ ] beneficial interests.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On February 20, 2018, the Pension Trust filed a single opposition to both motions to dismiss, alleging that it was a \"business trust\" and squarely fell within the definition of a \"corporation\" set forth in \u00a7 101(9)(A)(v).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Thereafter, the Appellees filed a response to the Pension Trust's opposition raising additional arguments, including: (1) the Pension Trust was \"legally prohibited\" from conducting further business upon termination under Article 18(D) of the Pension Plan; (2) the Pension Trust \"neglected its duty to distribute the funds among the employees\"; and (3) the Plan's termination was \"illegal\" because the Trust did not\n   \"obtain the previous approval by the Puerto Rico Secretary of Treasury\" as required by the terms of the Pension Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The March 6, 2018 Bankruptcy Court Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing on the two motions to dismiss on March 6, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties introduced the Deed of Trust and the Pension Plan as a joint exhibit, and Dr. Guzm\u00e1n testified. A four-part proffer of the direct testimony of Luis Carrasquillo, a certified public accountant, was considered by the court. The bankruptcy court determined that the only relevant portion of the proffer was Section D, in which Mr. Carrasquillo concluded: \"In my opinion, the Trust has all the attributes of an insolvent corporation eligible for bankruptcy relief.\" The bankruptcy court remarked, however, that Mr. Carrasquillo offered no facts to support his opinion. The court admitted the proffer into evidence but gave it little weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Testimony of Dr. Guzm\u00e1n\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Dr. Guzm\u00e1n was the sole witness to testify. He testified that he was appointed as a member of the board of trustees in 2011 and was elected president in 2012. He described his duties and responsibilities as president as organizing and presiding over meetings, preparing minutes and agendas, receiving information from the Plan administrator, communicating with other board members, recommending candidates to become members of the board, and participating in board determinations regarding the administration of the Pension Plan and its assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Financial Difficulties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dr. Guzm\u00e1n testified that at the time he became president of the board, the Pension Trust was experiencing financial difficulties, particularly with respect to the \"investment\" of Pension Plan funds, as the fund was a \"limited fund\" which only received contributions from \"participating employers.\" In practice, the Pension Trust would turn over its funds to an investment company and, according to Dr. Guzm\u00e1n, \"the worst problem [the trustees] had to face was the matter of the investment of the funds of the [P]lan.\" According to Dr. Guzm\u00e1n, the Pension Trust had invested funds with \"UBS\" \"for more than ten years,\" but it \"had to leave UBS.\" He stated: \"[W]hat UBS was really doing was bleeding us because they were charging us commissions for all the money that the fund invested.\" Dr. Guzm\u00e1n testified that, following numerous meetings, the board decided to withdraw funds from UBS and transfer them to Popular Securities, where the board believed it could obtain \"safer profits\" at less cost. The Pension Plan experienced further financial hardship, however, due to a significant decline in the number of participating employers making contributions to the Plan. Dr. Guzm\u00e1n testified that, although the Pension Plan previously had about 76 participating employers, mostly Catholic schools, that number had decreased to 43 due to school closings. He added that participating employers were precluded from withdrawing from the Pension Plan, but \"the reality is that schools have shut down and disappeared as participating employers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Employees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Dr. Guzm\u00e1n testified that during his tenure as president, the Pension Trust had two employees. One was a full-time plan \"administrator\" whose primary responsibilities were to \"control [ ] the payments\" made to and by the Plan and \"bill participating employers\" for their contributions. The other employee was a part-time administrative assistant who was responsible for preparing all necessary forms and submitting them to the appropriate government agencies. Dr. Guzm\u00e1n testified that these employees were \"paid with the funds of the plan itself; that is, from the revenues that the fund receive[d] from participating employers[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) Termination of Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Dr. Guzm\u00e1n also testified about the \"termination\" of the Pension Plan. When asked whether \"the plan terminated in March 2016,\" he responded: \"Exactly.\" He stated that \"the participating employers [we]re ... the only ones who can decide whether the plan will continue or be closed\" and that, after holding two meetings, the participating employers \"decided to terminate the plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of the termination, payments to beneficiaries under the Plan ceased in June 2016. He stated, however, that notwithstanding the termination of the Plan, the board of trustees continued its efforts to collect the contributions still owed by participating employers. He also testified that, although the Pension Trust received no \"new contributions\" after termination, the trustees successfully collected some of the accounts receivable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    (d) Trustees' Duty to Invest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Dr. Guzm\u00e1n testified that the board of trustees had a duty \"to invest and reinvest the trust['s assets]\" and it was his understanding that \"[the board] had to invest to make the fund grow.\" He testified that the trustees were to \"discharge [their] duties with respect to the funds of the trust with diligence and prudence\" and that \"business be conducted to achieve the objectives of the trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    (e) The Bankruptcy Filing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Dr. Guzm\u00e1n, while admitting a lack of familiarity with bankruptcy, opined that the Trust was insolvent and, in his words \"broke,\" and that the filing of a bankruptcy petition was the most \"equitable\" way to \"divide up\" the assets remaining in the Pension Trust and distribute them to the Pension Plan beneficiaries. He also indicated that the trustees' efforts to distribute the remaining funds to the beneficiaries were thwarted due to litigation commenced by beneficiaries, and because \"a group of plaintiffs [we]re carrying out an attachment of the funds of the plan[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    (f) Cross-Examination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On cross-examination, Dr. Guzm\u00e1n admitted that the Pension Trust had no \"inventory of goods for sale,\" \"machinery or equipment for manufacturing,\" \"real estate,\" or \"intellectual property.\" He testified that the Trust's only assets were approximately $ 1.6 million-consisting of \"money contributed by the participating employers\" and \"dividend[s] and/or interest[ ]\"-and approximately $ 1.7 million in\n   \"accounts receivable\"-representing amounts still owed by participating employers. He stated that the Pension Trust has a board of trustees, but it does not have any stockholders and it pays no dividends. It does not have any loans from third parties or lines of credit. Dr. Guzm\u00e1n agreed that, under the terms of the Plan, participants and beneficiaries cannot \"assign [ ]or transfer, encumber in any way, [or] dispose of any of the benefits to which that person is entitled[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Dr. Guzm\u00e1n confirmed that, pursuant to the Deed of Trust and the Pension Plan, \"the obligation of the trustee[s] would be to receive the monies from the sponsoring employers, to deliver the monies to the investment company, and from that money in the investment companies, or accounts, to pay the beneficiaries and participants of the plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   He testified that the Trust was a \"not for profit\" organization, that the only \"original source of income\" was from employer contributions, and that the trustees were responsible for the \"administration\" of the Trust funds. He stated that the \"purpose\" of the Trust was to \"preserve\" Trust funds, and \"to make it [sic] grow,\" so that there would be \"money [ ] there to pay\" benefits to employees and the Trust's operational expenses. Dr. Guzm\u00e1n agreed that the trustees' main obligation was to \"receive monies from the sponsoring employers, to deliver the monies to the investment company, and from that money in the investment companies, or accounts, to pay the beneficiaries and participants of the [P]lan[.]\" He rejected the suggestion that the Trust was akin to an \"estate trust\" or an \"inheritance estate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Pertinent Provisions of the Deed of Trust and Plan\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Contributions from Participating Employers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To \"finance\" the Pension Plan, participating employers paid contributions to the trustees. Specifically, under the Plan, the participating employers agreed to \"contribute the necessary funds through [sic] the trustee[s] for the operation and administration of the [P]lan, and that these funds should be part of the trust property, which will be maintained and managed by the trustee[s] for the benefit of employees and their beneficiaries[.]\" The Pension Plan required all participating employers to make contributions as calculated by the committee and provided that those contributions were to be made \"to accumulate the necessary reserves to cover monthly pension expenses that are payable to participants\" of the Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amounts contributed by the participating employers were to be \"used solely and exclusively by the [Pension Trust] for exclusive purposes for the benefit of participants and/or beneficiaries.\" The participants did not contribute to the Pension Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) The Pension Trust's Assets\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The assets of the Pension Trust were mainly the contributions made by participating employers under the terms of the Pension Plan, but also could include, according\n   to the Plan, \"income, interest, dividends, profits, earnings or donations of any kind which became Trust property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Article 13 of the Pension Plan, entitled \"Establishing the Trust,\" provided that the trustees would hold \"custody and control of all the assets\" of the Pension Trust and \"neither the Settlor nor any participant shall have any property right on it [sic], except that participants are entitled to receive those payments and distributions\" in accordance with the Pension Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) The Board of Trustees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Pension Trust is governed by a board of trustees, which is tasked with \"manag[ing], invest[ing] and reinvest[ing] the Trust\" pursuant to its terms and \"mak[ing] payments of benefits from the Trust ... pursuant to the instructions of the Retirement Committee ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Article III of the Deed of Trust, entitled \"Powers of Trustees,\" directs that all of the trustees' actions shall be taken \"by majority\" vote. It also mandates that the trustees \"discharge their duties\" with respect to the Pension Trust and the Pension Plan \"solely in the interest of the participants and their beneficiar[ies],\" \"with the care, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character with like aims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    (d) Power to Invest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Deed of Trust requires the trustees to make investments on behalf of the Pension Trust. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   The Trustees shall invest and reinvest the Trust [assets], without distinction between principal and income thereof, in such bonds, notes, debentures, mortgages, preferred or common stocks, pooled investment funds, or in such other properties real or personal, and/or securities of any kind, class, or character as the Trustee[s] may deem suitable[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Moreover, the trustees are required to \"diversify[ ] the investment of th[e] Trust so as to minimize the risk of large losses[.]\" The Deed of Trust, however, provides that the trustees will \"not be liable for any loss resulting, directly or indirectly, from any action taken by them to carry out the suggestions from the Committee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Deed of Trust further authorizes the trustees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   To invest and reinvest the Trust Estate, to collect the income, rents, issues, profits and increase therefrom, to sell upon any terms, give options to purchase, assign, lease, exchange, convert, encumber, pledge, and mortgage; to alter and change the investment thereof from time to time at its discretion; to improve, manage, protect, subdivide, and partition any real estate forming part of the Trust; to dedicate to public use and vacate all or any part thereof; to compromise, adjust and settle all claims to or\n   against the Trust ...; to grant options to lease and to lease for any term ...; to make leases upon such terms and conditions as may be deemed by it to be proper; to renew, cancel, amend and/or extend leases and consent to the assignment and modification of any lease ...; and to vote personally or by proxy any shares of stock which may at anytime be

It stated that the issue of whether \"the [P]lan was validly terminated\" was \"irrelevant to the ultimate decision because what is more critical is whether or not the debtor is a business trust[.]\" After hearing closing arguments from the parties, the court issued a bench ruling setting forth the positions of the parties, a summary of the testimony presented, the applicable law, and the court's application of the law to the facts of this case. The court ultimately concluded: \"The debtor trust is not a business trust, and thus, is ineligible to file a bankruptcy petition.

The Pension Trust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Pension Trust argues that the bankruptcy court erred in ruling that the Trust was not eligible to file for bankruptcy. It claims that the bankruptcy court: (1) incorrectly found that the purpose of the Trust was solely to preserve the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   , instead of maximizing it; (2) failed to consider evidence that showed the Trust has the attributes of a corporation and was created for the purpose of carrying on a business operation to maximize its funds; (3) failed to consider the financial hardships that had a detrimental effect on the Trust's business activities; and (4) only considered the time period after the Pension Plan was terminated, rather than examining the totality of the circumstances, including the \"decades of business activities that the Pension Trust engaged in prior to termination.\" The Pension Trust does not challenge the standard articulated by the bankruptcy court for determining whether the Pension Trust is a business trust. Rather, it alleges that all of the factors identified by the bankruptcy court were satisfied and that the bankruptcy court gave undue consideration to the alleged \"lack of transferability of assets.\" Based on the foregoing, the Pension Trust asks that \"the Dismissal Order be revoked.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Appellees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Appellees counter that the bankruptcy court correctly ruled that the Pension\n   Trust was not a business trust. According to the Appellees, the Pension Trust is not a business trust because it was not created for a business purpose and is not engaged in any business activities. They claim that the \"passive act of sitting on a corpus consisting of invested moneys\" cannot be considered a business activity, and that Dr. Guzm\u00e1n's testimony confirmed that the Pension Trust \"was, at best, an investment vehicle for the [P]ension [P]lan up until June 2016.\" They also assert that the Pension Trust cannot be a business trust because the Deed of Trust \"prohibits the transferability of the beneficial interests.\" This is significant, they claim, because the Internal Revenue Code (which sets forth the characteristics of a business trust for federal tax purposes) \"lists transferability among the six elements it uses to characterize a trust as a business trust.\" According to the Appellees, the Pension Trust is \"nothing more than a 'wasting asset' irreversibly declining in value as a function of time.\" They ask us to affirm the Dismissal Order as the Pension Trust does not qualify as a business trust entitled to bankruptcy relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \"Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b), the Panel may hear appeals from 'final judgments, orders, and decrees[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Fleet Data Processing Corp. v.

As explained in\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Terrell\n   </em>\n   , a principal reason for doing so was the view that state probate law provides an adequate framework for the administration of insolvent estates. The continued use by Congress of the word \"person\" in the law's eligibility provision indicates Congressional agreement with this reasoning. In denying general eligibility to trusts, Congress presumably viewed trusts, even those of the intervivos variety, as being much like estates in that they are typically enmeshed in an estate plan and are under the control of state probate courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   A trust which is not part of a settlor's estate plan presents different considerations. A probate court is not its traditional\n   forum. Its beneficiaries are investors in a business enterprise rather than recipients of a settlor's largess. Congress obviously recognized these differences when in 1926 it amended what was then \u00a7 1(8) of the prior Act to allow bankruptcy relief for \"any business conducted by a trustee or trustees wherein beneficial interest or ownership is evidenced by certificate or other written instrument.\" This opened the door to the traditional Massachusetts business trust. Because of the restrictive language, eligibility continued to be denied to a trust whose creating instrument was the only document evidencing beneficial ownership.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pope &amp; Cottle Co. v.

The Commission's Report ... makes it clear that the Commission viewed this documentary requirement as a needless technicality.... The failure of Congress to spell this out further in a committee report seems inconclusive in comparison to the wording of the statute itself.

The bankruptcy court articulated the relevant factors developed from those set forth by the New Hampshire bankruptcy court in\n   <em>\n    In re BKC Realty Trust\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Woodsville Realty Trust\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    In re Gonic Realty Trust\n   </em>\n   , and the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    In re Secured Equipment Trust\n   </em>\n   , 38 F.3d at 90 (\"[R]egardless of whether generating a profit is a necessary element of a business trust, petitioners cannot dispute that many courts have found the presence or absence of a profit motive influential in their determination of whether the trust at issue was a business trust.\"). Absent First Circuit authority, the bankruptcy court properly developed and applied a standard that incorporated required elements utilized by both circuit and bankruptcy courts in the\n   cases discussed above. Additionally, the standard was consistent with the two-part standard employed by the court in\n   <em>\n    Dille\n   </em>\n   that synthesized the existing factors used by courts engaging in a multi-factor review. The factors it utilized were warranted and useful for making a determination as to whether the Pension Trust is a business trust for eligibility purposes. The New Hampshire bankruptcy court's practical three-part test was well-reasoned, combining traditional trust principles with the less restrictive totality of the circumstances approach. Accordingly, conducting de novo review, we conclude the bankruptcy court did not err in adopting the standard used to resolve the issue of whether the Pension Trust satisfied its ultimate burden of demonstrating that it was a business trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gulfcoast Irrevocable Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206005716\">\n    2012 WL 6005716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (finding trust agreements established prima facie showing that the family trusts were designed as an estate planning purposes but affording the debtors an opportunity to present evidence to the contrary);\n   <em>\n    Gurney's Inn Corp.

The Pension Trust's \"Temporal Aspect\" Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The Pension Trust challenges the bankruptcy court's determination that the Trust was not a business trust, contending that all of the factors articulated by the bankruptcy court were satisfied and the bankruptcy court erred in its analysis. It asserts the bankruptcy court erred by resting its determination on the Pension Trust's\n   <em>\n    post-termination activities\n   </em>\n   \"rather than giving weight to the decades of business activities and business-like decision-making processes undertaken during the pre-termination period.\" According to the Pension Trust, the bankruptcy court imposed a \"temporal constriction\" in its analysis by limiting its consideration to the Trust's activities\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The Pension Trust's argument is unpersuasive for two reasons: (1) the bankruptcy court did not impose a \"temporal constriction\" in its analysis; and (2) regardless of whether the court looks at the Pension Trust's activities on the petition date or over the course of its existence, the Pension Trust did not qualify as a business trust at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <strong>\n    1. No \"Temporal Constriction\" by the Bankruptcy Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Although the Pension Trust argues that the bankruptcy court limited its consideration to the Trust's post-termination activities, a reading of the Dismissal Order does not show that the bankruptcy court imposed the \"temporal constriction\" suggested by the Pension Trust. First, although the bankruptcy court did not identify every provision of the Trust documents on which it relied, it expressly stated that its decision was based on \"due consideration of the [P]ension [T]rust documents, the Pension Plan, the uncontested facts as the parties presented the same to the court, and the applicable law[.]\"\n   <em>\n    In re Catholic Sch.

Additionally, in concluding that the Pension Trust was not a business trust, the court reasoned that: (1) the Trust was established to secure payment to beneficiaries; (2) its purpose was to preserve the principal of the contributions made by the participating employers and the interest generated by the principal; and (3) the purpose of the Trust was not to generate a profit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511746\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/584/82/#p87\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These determinations necessarily required the bankruptcy court to consider the Pension Trust and Pension Plan documents and the totality of the circumstances, and none of its conclusions were limited to the activities of the Trust after termination. Similarly, there is no indication in the Dismissal Order that, when\n   considering whether the Trust engaged in business-like activities, the court limited its consideration to\n   <em>\n    post-termination\n   </em>\n   activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511746\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/584/82/#p87\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rather, the Dismissal Order reflects that the bankruptcy court considered all of the business activities identified by the Pension Trust, but concluded that they \"were not corroborated by the trust deed, the pension plan, nor the testimony of Dr. Guzm\u00e1n.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511746\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/584/82/#p87\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511746\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/584/82/#p87\">\n    at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not improperly limit its consideration to the Trust's post-termination activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Relevant Date for Determining the Pension Trust's Status as a Business Trust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Although there is an abundance of case law on the question of what constitutes a business trust for bankruptcy purposes, the cases do not address the \"temporal aspect\" of the court's determination-i.e., what is the appropriate date or time period for the bankruptcy court to consider when determining the trust's status as a business trust. Eligibility for bankruptcy relief is generally determined as of the petition date. Thus, in this case, determination of whether the Pension Trust is eligible for bankruptcy relief as a business trust does not hinge on the termination date of the Pension Plan. The pre-petition termination of the Pension Plan was not determinative of the Pension Trust's eligibility to be a debtor. The bankruptcy court, without expressly ruling, correctly determined the eligibility of the Pension Trust at the petition date as it accepted evidence of Trust activities after the termination of the Pension Plan.\n   <em>\n    In re Catholic Sch. Emps.

Applying the Bankruptcy Court's Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Purpose of the Pension Trust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   The record reflects that the Trust was created to administer the Pension Plan and to manage, invest, and distribute assets received from participating employers in the Pension Plan. The Deed of Trust provides that, at all times, the Trust's assets are held for the exclusive benefit of the Plan participants and their beneficiaries, and the Pension Plan provides that it was created \"for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the participating employers and/or their beneficiaries[.]\" The Trust's assets primarily consisted of contributions from participating employers, although it also included any \"income therefrom.\" The Deed of Trust required the trustees to make \"payments of benefits from the Trust\" and to pay the \"reasonable expenses of the plan and trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   There is no question that the trustees were required by the Deed of Trust to invest and reinvest the Trust's assets. The Deed of Trust provided: \"The Trustees shall invest and reinvest the Trust [assets] ... in such bonds, notes, debentures, mortgages, preferred or common stocks, pooled investment funds, or in such other properties real or personal, and/or securities of any kind, class, or character as the Trustee[s] may deem suitable[.]\" The trustees also were required, however, to \"diversify[ ]\" their investments \"so as to minimize the risk of large losses[.]\" Therefore, the Trust was not created for a business purpose, let alone\n   <em>\n    primarily\n   </em>\n   for a business purpose. Rather, the Trust documents reflect that the Trust was intended as a \"passive\" investment vehicle. Moreover, the trustees passively managed the Trust assets as the participant employers' contributions were invested in UBS and Popular Securities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Dr. Guzm\u00e1n testified that the Trust was a \"not for profit\" organization, the only \"original source of income\" was from employer contributions, and the trustees were\n   responsible for the \"administration\" of the Trust funds. He also testified that the \"purpose\" of the Trust was to \"preserve\" Trust funds, and \"to make it grow,\" so that there would be \"money [ ] there to pay\" benefits to employees and the Trust's operational expenses. This testimony supports the conclusion that the purpose of the Trust when it was created was the preservation of the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   so that the Trust had the funds to distribute pension payments to Plan participants when directed to do so by the committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   The Pension Trust, of course, asserts that the Trust was created primarily for a business purpose, arguing the Deed of Trust \"mandates the trustees to increase and maximize the funds 'in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character with like aims.' \" According to the Pension Trust, this \"clear mandate\" demonstrates the \"business purpose of the Trust geared towards asset maximization.\" While it can be inferred that the purpose of investing the Trust's assets was to increase their value through positive investments returns, nowhere in the Deed of Trust does it require the trustees to \"increase and maximize\" funds. In fact, the Deed of Trust requires the trustees to take a low-risk investment approach by diversifying their investments to minimize the risk of large losses. Moreover, the Deed of Trust does not require the trustees to invest \" 'in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character with like aims,' \" as asserted by the Pension Trust. The Pension Trust has taken the quoted language out of context. The Deed of Trust requires the trustees to discharge their duties \"with the care, prudence, and diligence ... that a prudent man ... would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character with like aims.\" This does not mean the trustees were required to aggressively invest the Trust's assets with the primary goal of maximizing interest and dividends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   The cases upon which the Pension Trust relies are distinguishable from this case. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Jin Suk Kim Trust\n   </em>\n   , the court determined that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   [F]rom the moment of its inception, Kim managed the Debtor to maximize its profits and the value of its assets in order to enhance the overall wealth of her family. She managed it, and the real estate assets it acquired, the same way she ran her other businesses, without regard to trust principles, including traditional trust principles of prudent, diversified investment and protection of trust res.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674396\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/464/697/#p704\">\n    464 B.R. at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Rubin Family Irrevocable Stock Trust,\n   </em>\n   the court held that the trust, which was established as an estate-planning vehicle, qualified as a business trust because its\n   <em>\n    primary\n   </em>\n   purpose was to generate profits.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206155606\">\n    2013 WL 6155606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9. In reaching this decision, the court noted that the trustees \"continually put hundreds of thousands (at times even millions) of dollars' worth of the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   at great risk in the course of chasing after profits\" and employed a \"high risk, high reward\" approach to investing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. The court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   In light of all this risk-taking with the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   , it would defy reason to conclude that the primary purpose of the Trust Debtors is to 'protect and preserve' it. If the protection and preservation of the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   were the Trust Debtors'\n   <em>\n    primary\n   </em>\n   purpose, then they would\n   <em>\n    invest much more conservatively\n   </em>\n   than they have done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The courts in these cases emphasized the profit-making goal of the business trust and the objective of distributing that profit to the business owners as returns on their investment. Here, the investment\n   purpose of the Trust was \"incidental\" to the Trust's primary purpose of collecting contributions from participating employers, and preserving those contributions for distribution to the Plan participants in the form of pension payments. Although the Pension Trust also sought to generate income, it was only authorized to do so, and, in fact, did so, by engaging in \"passive\" forms of investment (such as common stock or other securities, certificates of deposit, and the like), rather than in active forms of investment (like real estate development activity and high-risk investments).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re St. Augustine Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6106924\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/109/494/#p496\">\n    109 B.R. at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, as Dr. Guzm\u00e1n's testimony established, the Pension Trust yielded to the expertise of UBS and Popular Securities. Moreover, \"[t]he mere fact that [a] settlor intended to enhance the assets through commercial activity does not equate th[e] entity with a corporation, and [ ] bring it within the scope of \u00a7 101 ( [9] ).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6106924\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/109/494/#p496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). As one court noted: \"The distinction, between a business enterprise trust and a [ ] trust that has incidental business activity, is that the business enterprise trust at the outset is organized by a group of investors who are seeking to not only operate a business but profit from it from the employment of their invested risk capital.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Westgate Vill. Realty Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6517149\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/156/363/\">\n    156 B.R. at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not the case here as the participants and their beneficiaries were not investors. Indeed, they did not contribute to the Pension Plan at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Substantial Attributes of a Corporation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Courts have not articulated a uniform list of factors to consider when assessing whether a trust has substantial attributes of a corporation to qualify as a business trust. Rather, they tend to look at the specific characteristics of the trust and determine whether, based on a totality of the circumstances, the trust has a sufficient number of the attributes of a corporation. One of the most significant considerations for the court when determining whether a trust has the attributes of a corporation is \"whether the trust's beneficiaries were investors and hence expecting a profit from operations just as in any other private business.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D'Agostino,\n   <em>\n    The Business Trust and Bankruptcy Remoteness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Woodsville Realty Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6095484\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/120/2/#p4\">\n    120 B.R. at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that the trust was not a business trust because it lacked the attributes of a corporation, including the \"lack of outside 'investors' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   The Pension Trust argues that it has the following attributes of a corporation: (1) it engages in business-related activities; (2) it is governed by a board of trustees which \"is akin to a Board of Directors\" with \"ample powers to manage and [m]ake decisions in favor of maximizing the funds for the benefit of pensioners, employers and beneficiaries\"; (3) the Deed of Trust authorizes the trustees to hire personnel; and (4) the Deed of Trust limits the trustees' liability for actions taken in accordance with its terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   As the Pension Trust asserts, the Deed of Trust reflects that the Pension Trust is governed by a board of trustees, the trustees are authorized to hire, and, in fact, hired personnel, and the Deed of Trust limits the trustees' liability. That is not, however, the end of the inquiry. The record also reflects that the Trust lacks many of the other commonly recognized attributes of a corporation. Dr. Guzm\u00e1n testified that the Pension Trust has no \"inventory of goods for sale,\" \"machinery or equipment for manufacturing,\" \"real estate,\" or \"intellectual property.\" The Trust's only assets were approximately $ 1.6 million-consisting of \"money contributed by the participating employers\" and \"dividend and/or interest[ ]\"-and approximately $ 1.7 million in \"accounts receivable\"-representing\n   amounts still owed by participating employers. It does not have any loans from third parties or lines of credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Most importantly, however, the Trust is completely funded by the participating employers. There are no outside investors and the Plan participants and beneficiaries make no contributions to the Trust. The participants are not investors who contribute capital to the Trust with the expectation of receiving a return on their investment from the operation of a business. The participants and their beneficiaries do not hold anything equivalent to a stock certificate and are prohibited from transferring or assigning their beneficial rights. They are not equity investors or contributors to capital. Therefore, the Trust is more akin to a traditional trust which has been formed for the purpose of effecting, preserving, and protecting a gift or contribution, rather than a profit-generating corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   The Pension Trust argues that the bankruptcy court erred in giving too much \"weight\" to the \"lack of transferability of assets\" of the Pension Trust and in concluding that there was a lack of transferability. This argument is unpersuasive because it confuses the transferability of\n   <em>\n    assets\n   </em>\n   with the transferability of\n   <em>\n    beneficial interests\n   </em>\n   under the Pension Plan. The Pension Trust is correct that the bankruptcy court found that the \"transferability of Trust\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   is limited to qualified persons,\" but is not entirely prohibited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Catholic Sch.

But the bankruptcy court did not identify the transferability of\n   <em>\n    assets\n   </em>\n   as a factor in its analysis; rather, the court stated that a trust must have the attributes of a corporation, \"especially the transferability of\n   <em>\n    interests.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511746\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/584/82/#p87\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511746\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/584/82/#p87\">\n    at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Both the Deed of Trust and the Pension Plan expressly prohibit the transfer or assignment of\n   <em>\n    beneficial interests.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, some courts have held that the transferability of\n   <em>\n    beneficial interests\n   </em>\n   is one of the more important attributes of a corporation that a trust must have to be considered a business trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Parade Realty Tr.\n   </em>\n   , 134 B.R. at 11 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Woodsville Realty Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6095484\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/120/2/#p4\">\n    120 B.R. at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   The bankruptcy court correctly ruled that while the Pension Trust exhibited several of the attributes of a corporation, based on a totality of the circumstances, the Pension Trust did not have enough of such attributes to qualify as a business trust. Significantly, in addition to lacking capital contributions by the Plan participants and the transferability of beneficial interests, the Pension Trust lacked one of the other most important characteristics of a corporation-it did not engage in business-like activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Treasure Island Land Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6536443\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/2/332/#p335\">\n    2 B.R. at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that, although the trust \"share[d] several characteristics with a corporation,\" it was not a business trust because it did not actively engage in any business activity).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Engages in Business-Like Activities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   The Pension Trust argues that, prior to its termination, it was engaged in business activities that were consistent with \"asset maximization\" as evidenced by its investment of \"sizeable amounts\" with various \"money makers\" which investments were \"pooled together with the Participating Employer[s'] contributions [to] maximize the Trust's assets[.]\" In addition, the Pension Trust asserts that its \"commercial activities\" included: (1) \"investing in capital markets, managing portfolios, [and] supervising investments\"; (2) \"keeping a payroll for regular employees for its support and routine maintenance\"; (3) \"conduct[ing] business which require[d] specific accounts with the IRS, Puerto Rico Treasury Department and the State Insurance Funds\"; (4) \"serv[ing] as an account receivable division to collect from [P]articipating [E]mployers\"; (5) \"invoic[ing] on a regular monthly basis\"; and (6) \"manag[ing] and contract[ing with] professionals such as attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, and money managers.\" Although the record reflects that the Pension Trust was authorized to make investments and employ professionals, and Dr. Guzm\u00e1n testified that the trustees transferred money to UBS and then to Popular Securities to invest, the other asserted \"commercial activities\" are not supported by the testimony of Dr. Guzm\u00e1n or any other part of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   As discussed above in connection with the \"primary purpose\" analysis, although the record reflects that the Trust sought to generate income by transferring funds to various investment companies, the trustees were only authorized to engage in passive forms of investment (such as the purchase of common stock or other securities, certificates of deposit, and the like), rather than in active forms of investment (like real estate development activity and high-risk investments). \"The mere fact that [a] settlor intended to enhance the assets through commercial activity does not equate th[e] entity with a corporation, and [ ] bring it within the scope of \u00a7 101 [9].\"\n   <em>\n    In re St. Augustine Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6106924\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/109/494/#p496\">\n    109 B.R. at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

Without transferability, the trust herein fails to fall within the realm of a business trust.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-280\">\n    134 B.R. at 11 (emphasis added);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Woodsville Realty Tr.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6095484\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/120/2/#p4\">\n     120 B.R. at 5-6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating that while transferable \"certificates\" evidencing the beneficial interests of the trust are not required, \"transferability\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    is still relevant to the concept of an entity akin to a 'corporation' for federal Bankruptcy Code purposes). In any event, although the bankruptcy court identified the transferability of beneficial interests as one of the most significant attributes of a corporation that a trust must have to qualify as a business trust, the Dismissal Order does not reflect that the bankruptcy court gave that factor considerable weight in making its determination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
