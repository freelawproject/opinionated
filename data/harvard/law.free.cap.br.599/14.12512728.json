Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Trilogy Health Services, LLC (\"Trilogy\") obtained a state court judgment\n   against Misty M. White (\"White\") in the amount of $ 208,159.94 (the \"State Court Judgment\"). Now, Trilogy moves for summary judgment on Count One of its Complaint, asserting that the State Court Judgment is a non-dischargeable debt under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). Trilogy's argument primarily rests on the doctrine of issue preclusion, but there's a problem: The State Court Judgment does not contain sufficient findings and conclusions that would allow this Court to determine whether the debt is dischargeable. More importantly, Trilogy has not met its initial burden of demonstrating that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact. Therefore, the Court will deny Trilogy's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and General Order 05-02 entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, referring all bankruptcy matters to this Court. This is a core proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B)(2)(A) and (I). Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201408\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1409.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Trilogy runs an assisted living, long-term care, transitional care, and skilled nursing facility, known as Highland Oaks Health Campus (\"Highland\"). Thomas A. Erwine (\"Erwine\") was a resident at Highland, but is now deceased. During his residency, Erwine received social security income, income from his pension, and annuity income. He also owned three parcels of real property and a mobile home situated on the property (the \"Real Property\"). White was Erwine's daughter. She was also his attorney-in-fact, and she managed his financial affairs while he was a resident at Highland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties do not dispute that: (1) White was the recipient of multiple cash withdrawals from Erwine's accounts in the amount of $ 76,185.25 from January 1, 2011 to March 21, 2014; (2) White transferred $ 54,323.81 of Erwine's income to herself and others, and she would spend Erwine's money on trips, vacations, and gifts for herself, her family, and her pets; (3) White wrote several checks from Erwine's account to herself, her husband, and to \"cash\" in the amount of $ 20,000; (4) White used her power of attorney to open two credit cards in Erwine's name and reactivate a third card and ran up significant balances on each card shortly before Erwine's death; and (5) on September 26, 2012, while Erwine was a resident at Highland, Erwine transferred the Real Property to White for $ 1.00, even though the Morgan County Auditor valued the Real Property at $ 39,270.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   White never paid Trilogy in full for the services and care provided to Erwine at Highland, even though she was aware of the debt owed to Trilogy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trilogy filed an action against White in the Morgan County Court of Common Pleas (the \"State Court Case\") on April 20, 2015, and the court entered summary judgment in favor of Trilogy on February 17, 2017 in the amount of $ 208,159.94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   White filed her petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on April 13, 2018. Trilogy filed this adversary proceeding against White on May 24, 2018, claiming that the State Court Judgment is a non-dischargeable debt under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) and (a)(4). On February 21, 2019, Trilogy filed its\n   <em>\n    Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 41) (the \"Motion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the Motion, Trilogy asks this Court to except the State Court Judgment from White's discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). White filed her\n   <em>\n    Memorandum Contra to Plaintiff Trilogy Health Service's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 47) (the \"Response\") on February 26, 2019, and Trilogy filed its\n   <em>\n    Reply in Support of its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 48) (the \"Reply\") on March 5, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable to adversary proceedings by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056, provides that a court \"shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of \"informing the ... court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the [record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). The mere allegation of a factual dispute is not sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment; to prevail, the non-moving party must show that there exists some genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Arguments of the Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the Motion, Trilogy contends that the State Court Judgment is a nondischargeable debt under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) by virtue of the doctrine of issue preclusion. Even if the State Court Judgment has no preclusive effect in this case, Trilogy maintains that it is entitled to summary judgment because there is no genuine dispute of material fact that White engaged in constructively fraudulent transfers, which constitutes \"actual fraud\" under section 523(a)(2)(A). White raises a plethora of arguments in her Response,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   but primarily argues that issue preclusion is not appropriate because the State Court Judgment does not make specific factual findings and is open to speculation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Trilogy moves for summary judgment on its nondischargeability claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A).

Code Ann. \u00a7 1336.04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A)(2), and \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) encompasses fraudulent transfer schemes. Trilogy is correct that a fraudulent transfer can serve as the basis for a \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But aside from the State Court Judgment, which again is too vague for purposes of applying issue preclusion, Trilogy has not pointed to any evidence in the record showing that it sought and obtained a judgment against White on a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ohio%20Rev.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201336.04\">\n    Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. \u00a7 1336.04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A)(2) does not necessarily require a showing of actual intent to commit fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Blood v. Nofzinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"570242\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/162/545/#p560\">\n    162 Ohio App. 3d 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-3859\">\n    2005-Ohio-3859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=834%20N.E.2d%20358\">\n    834 N.E.2d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369 (Ohio Ct. App. 2005). Conversely, a claim under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) based on \"actual fraud\"\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   require proof of fraudulent intent.\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1586-87. In order to prevail, Trilogy must show that White possessed fraudulent intent. But Trilogy has not pointed to any evidence in the record demonstrating an absence of genuine dispute regarding this issue. Therefore, Trilogy has not met its initial burden, and is not entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Trilogy's Motion is not well-taken. Accordingly, is it hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Trilogy has not made clear the amount that White failed to pay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    One of White's arguments is that Trilogy lacks standing. Although White makes little attempt at developing this argument, the Court feels compelled to note that Trilogy, a creditor of White by virtue of the State Court Judgment, clearly and unequivocally has standing to prosecute this dischargeability action against White.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
