Tancredi, Unites States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2004, the plaintiff, Lucille St. George (\"Ms. St. George\" or \"Plaintiff\"), and William\n   Nappo (\"Mr. Nappo\") were divorced. Since then, the parties have been involved in interminable litigation in a variety of cases both here and in the Connecticut Superior Court. After the marriage, in 2005, Mr. Nappo's corporation, R.E.T. Capital Corporation (\"RET\"), prevailed in an\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit in New York and received, after fees and expenses, approximately $ 225,000.00. Mr. Nappo directed that money to be paid in a loan to the debtor, Hampton Ventures, LLC (\"Debtor\"), a single-member limited liability company owned by Karen Nappo (\"Ms. Nappo\"), Mr. Nappo's current wife. In return, the Debtor gave RET a promissory note for $ 225,000.00 (\"Note\"). The Debtor used that money in 2005, along with other financing, to purchase a commercial building located at 1098-1110 New Britain Avenue, West Hartford, CT (\"Property\") for $ 650,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Upon learning of the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit from a 2013 deposition of Mr. Nappo, the Plaintiff filed suit in the Connecticut Superior Court, claiming,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a constructive trust over the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the Debtor subsequently filed for protection under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 2018, the Plaintiff filed the present adversary proceeding (\"Adversary Proceeding\") in this Court against the Debtor and the Chapter 7 Trustee, Anthony S. Novak (\"Trustee,\" collectively \"Defendants\"), claiming a constructive trust over the Debtor's main asset, the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Additionally, the Plaintiff filed a proof of claim (\"Claim 6-1\") in the amount of $ 1,582,517.00 on the basis of her constructive trust claim, which amount was meant to encapsulate an attributed value of the Property ($ 774,900.00) and estimated rents received by the Debtor from May 4, 2005 to August 9, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee objected to Claim 6-1 (\"Objection\"), arguing that the Plaintiff has no right to a constructive trust under applicable law. The Trustee also requested that the Adversary Proceeding and the proceedings on the Objection be consolidated for trial. The Court, with the consent of the parties, has done so and conducted a consolidated trial of these matters on March 4, 5, and 6, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After reviewing the law and the evidence, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden to warrant the imposition of a constructive trust on the Property. On that basis, the Court also sustains the Objection and, accordingly, disallows Claim 6-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over these matters pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and derives its authority to hear and determine these matters on reference from the District Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b)(1). The Objection is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), has previously determined that the Adversary Proceeding before the Court is a core proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A), (E), and (O).

UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court notes the following undisputed facts and procedural history of these matters and the related cases:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A. The Debtor and the Property\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   1. The Debtor is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   2. Ms. Nappo is the sole member and owner of the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   3. Ms. Nappo is the current wife of Mr. Nappo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   4. On May 4, 2005, the Debtor purchased the Property for $ 650,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   5. The Debtor paid the purchase price through two mortgages totaling $ 400,000.00, with the remainder paid through $ 225,000.00 obtained from RET as a loan and $ 25,000.00 in undisclosed funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   6. Mr. Nappo is the sole owner of RET.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   7. RET was administratively dissolved by the State of New York in 2002 but remains in wind-down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   8. RET received the $ 225,000.00 through the successful prosecution of an\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit in New York. After receiving the funds, Mr. Nappo directed that they be loaned to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   9. In return for the $ 225,000.00, Ms. Nappo, on behalf of the Debtor, executed the Note payable to RET. The Note was payable in 2015 at 1.5% interest per annum, with the maturity date extendable by five years to 2020 by mutual consent, which was exercised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   10. The Debtor never granted RET a mortgage over the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   11. The Debtor subsequently refinanced and consolidated the first two mortgages with Webster Bank, N.A., which currently holds the mortgage lien on the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B. The Bankruptcy Case:\n   <em>\n    In re Hampton Ventures, LLC\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1. The Debtor filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on July 27, 2018 (MC ECF No. 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   2. After John J. O'Neil, Jr. resigned as trustee, Bonnie C. Mangan was appointed as successor trustee on August 6, 2018 (MC ECF No. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   3. In the schedules it filed, the Debtor listed assets of $ 778,870.60, with $ 760,500.00 of that amount attributed to the Property (MC ECF No. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   4. Bonnie C. Mangan subsequently resigned as trustee, and was replaced by the Trustee, Anthony S. Novak, on August 27, 2018 (MC ECF No. 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   5. The Trustee then sought to sell the Property on September 20, 2018 and applied to employ a real estate broker to do so (MC ECF No. 36), which the\n   Court approved without prejudice to the Plaintiff's claims (MC ECF No. 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   6. On October 5, 2018, the Plaintiff filed Claim 6-1\", in the amount of $ 1,582,527.00, which amount included the value of the Property and the rents derived from it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   7. The Plaintiff then initiated the Adversary Proceeding on November 16, 2018 against the Debtor, claiming a constructive trust over the Property (MC ECF No. 49). The Plaintiff filed her amended complaint on December 21, 2018 to add the Trustee as a defendant (AP ECF No. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   8. The Trustee initially moved to sell the Property free and clear of liens and interests for $ 625,000.00 to Draymore and Flynn Properties, LLC (\"Motion to Sell,\" MC ECF No. 60). The Trustee subsequently noticed a higher and better offer of $ 725,000.00 from Juniper Home Care, LLC (MC ECF No. 81), which is the offer currently pending in the Motion to Sell and proposed Notice of Sale (MC ECF No. 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   9. The Trustee filed the Objection to Claim 6-1 on February 4, 2019 (MC ECF No. 87), claiming,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the claim should be disallowed because the Plaintiff is not entitled to a constructive trust on the Property under applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   10. The Court held hearings on the Trustee's Motion to Sell to Juniper Home Care, LLC for $ 725,000.00 on February 7, 13, and 26 and March 1 and 6, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   11. On February 11, 2019, the Court ordered the Trustee and the Plaintiff to consider and brief whether the pending Adversary Proceeding needed to be decided before the Property could be sold (MC ECF No. 109). After receiving briefing from the parties, the Court determined it must decide this Adversary Proceeding to determine whether the Property was property of the estate or belonged to the Plaintiff before the Court could authorize a sale (MC ECF No. 121).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   12. The Court consolidated the trial on the Adversary Proceeding and the Objection and received evidence on March 4, 5, and 6, 2019. The testimony taken from the hearings held on the Motion to Sell was incorporated into the record of the Objection and Adversary Proceedings and vice versa, by agreement of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   13. The Court has substantially contemporaneously with this Memorandum issued a Ruling and Order approving the Trustee's Motion to Sell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   C. The Divorce Case:\n   <em>\n    Nappo v. Nappo\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   1. The Plaintiff and Mr. Nappo were divorced on May 6, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   2. The docket reflects near-constant litigation in the intervening years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   3. In connection with proceedings before the Superior Court, the Plaintiff and Mr. Nappo submitted financial affidavits, both before and after the divorce was finalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   4. Although Mr. Nappo listed his 100% ownership of RET on his financial affidavits, he initially listed the value as $ 0. That valuation reflected RET's patent insolvency, attributable in large part to a multimillion-dollar environmental clean-up claim pertaining to its oil and gas operations at Mott Basin in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   5. Mr. Nappo initially did not disclose the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit (which was pending at the time of the divorce), the receipt of a net litigation recovery from it in 2005, the transfer of the proceeds to the Debtor, or the Note on his financial affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   6. During a deposition in 2013, for the first time, Mr. Nappo revealed the existence of the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit, the proceeds from it, and the loan of the proceeds to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   7. The Note and its face value of $ 225,000.00 is listed on Mr. Nappo's financial affidavits as RET's asset from September 5, 2014 onward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   8. The divorce decree ordered the Plaintiff and Mr. Nappo to report any change in income to the other within two weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   9. The divorce decree also ordered that all of Mr. Nappo's business interests, including RET, would remain his. The decree allocated to the Plaintiff: survivor benefits from Mr. Nappo's pension, alimony, half the proceeds of a bond, three real properties, cash, two cars, any inheritance she might receive, and the proceeds of a Merrill Lynch account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   10. In a June 15, 2017 memorandum of decision on various post-judgment motions, the Superior Court found that the second Ms. Nappo was \"now provid[ing] the bulk of [Mr. Nappo's] support.\" The Superior Court also found that Mr. Nappo frequently deposited funds into his bank account that he received from Ms. Nappo and \"that the amounts of these deposits ... are typical of the continuing financial support provided [Mr. Nappo] by [Ms. Nappo].\" The Superior Court determined that these funds constituted income for alimony purposes because they were gifts. Finally, the Superior Court determined that funds Mr. Nappo received from Ms. Nappo that she, in turn, derived from the Property \"are properly taken into account in determining his income.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   D. The Jen-Dale Constructive Trust Case:\n   <em>\n    RET Capital Corp. et al. v. Jen-Dale, LLC et al.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   1. On May 12, 2011, RET and Mr. Nappo filed suit against Jen-Dale, L.L.C. (\"Jen-Dale\") and Jennifer Merritt, its 99% owner. Ms. St. George owned the other 1% of Jen-Dale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   2. Jennifer Merritt is Ms. St. George's and Mr. Nappo's daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   3. Jen-Dale had executed a promissory note to RET in the amount of $ 500,000.00 with 9% interest per annum in 1997, which Jen-Dale and Jennifer Merritt did not pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   4. On September 2, 2014, the Superior Court found for the plaintiffs in that case. The Superior Court ordered the imposition of a constructive trust and resulting trust, such that ownership in Jen-Dale was changed from 99% ownership by Jennifer Merritt and 1% ownership by Ms. St. George to Ms. St. George and Mr. Nappo each having a 50% interest. The court reasoned that such was warranted because interest on the note was meant to provide for Ms. St. George and Mr. Nappo in their retirement. The court also ordered the Plaintiff and Mr. Nappo to share income from Jen-Dale equally, with their grandchildren receiving the remainder upon the death of each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   5. The docket reflects dozens of entries revealing continued disputes after entry of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   6. Ultimately, Jen-Dale's property in Avon was sold in 2016 in foreclosure; Jen-Dale received $ 88,750.98 from the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   7. Much, if not all, of the $ 88,750.98 has been allegedly wrongfully disbursed by Mr. Nappo, who claims offset rights for legal expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   8. The Jen-Dale LLC Irrevocable Trust, Jen-Dale's successor, remains in possession of a promissory note dated May 31, 2016 from RET, wherein RET promises to pay $ 60,000.00 to the Jen-Dale LLC Irrevocable Trust in 2021 with interest at 3% per annum. That note is subject to possible extension to 2026.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   E. The State Court Hampton Ventures Constructive Trust Case:\n   <em>\n    St. George et al. v. Hampton Ventures, LLC et al.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   1. The Plaintiff and Jeffrey Nappo\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed suit against the Debtor, Mr. Nappo, and Ms. Nappo in Superior Court on April 10, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   2. In the amended complaint filed January 8, 2018, the Plaintiff seeks constructive trusts over half or all of the Debtor, the Note, and the rental income of the Property. She also claims fraud, unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy, negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraudulent conveyance, theft, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   3. On July 3, 2018, the Superior Court ordered that \"[a]ll discovery [is] to be completed by August 2, 2018. No exceptions will be entertained by the court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   4. The case has been stayed as to the Debtor since August 8, 2018 by virtue of the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   5. The Chapter 7 bankruptcy case was filed on the eve of jury selection in the Superior Court case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   6. In lieu of stay relief, the Court and the parties have proceeded with an expedited trial of the Adversary Proceeding, so that the Plaintiff's claimed interest in the Property might be determined before any disposition on the Trustee's Motion to Sell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   IV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   A.

When property has been acquired in such circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial interest, equity converts him into a trustee.... The imposition of a constructive trust by equity is a remedial device designed to prevent unjust enrichment.... Thus, a constructive trust arises where a person who holds title to property is subject to an equitable duty to convey it to another on the ground that he would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to retain it.... A claimant entitled to restitution from property may obtain restitution from any traceable product of that property, without regard to subsequent changes of form....

The Plaintiff has cited to no case-and the Court has found none-that states such a party needs to disclose a full listing of assets and liabilities of a company owned, including potential and pending causes of action or efforts to contest liabilities. Such a rule would be patently unworkable, as a larger corporation might have hundreds or thousands of such contingencies at any given moment of which the shareholder himself knows nothing. That RET is solely owned by Mr. Nappo does not justify this Court creating new Connecticut state jurisprudence or reading into the tea leaves what Connecticut's appellate courts have not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Here, although much of Mr. Nappo's testimony was not credible, he did credibly testify in this Court that, at the time of the divorce, (1) RET had a pending\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit in New York, seeking the return of overpaid taxes and (2) RET faced multimillion-dollar liabilities based on environmental issues at Mott Basin in New York. Therefore, at the time of the divorce, RET was undeniably insolvent and, both to the potential tax recovery and assault on environmental liabilities, were not subject to a known outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   It is of no moment that RET later prevailed in 2005 in the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit, netting RET approximately $ 225,000.00, and had the potentially multimillion-dollar liability associated with Mott Basin overturned in court proceedings. At the time of the divorce, it was truthful and accurate that RET was insolvent. Because the financial affidavits required only that he list his ownership interests in businesses and their values, Mr. Nappo's listing of his 100% ownership of RET at a value of $ 0 was not a false statement and, therefore, Mr. Nappo did not commit fraud, whether actual, constructive, or by nondisclosure, pertaining to the existence of the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20428\">\n    312 Conn. at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20A.3d%201076\">\n    93 A.3d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Nanos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"394839\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/97/529/#p532\">\n    97 Conn. at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Mr. Nappo Had No Duty to Disclose the Proceeds from the\n    <em>\n     Ad Valorem\n    </em>\n    Suit under Connecticut Law or the Divorce Decree\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Plaintiff also argues that Mr. Nappo had a duty to disclose the proceeds from\n   the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit because it constituted \"income\" to him, which he was required to report under both the divorce decree and Connecticut law.

The Plaintiff would have this Court believe that RET was only authorized to wind up its affairs but then failed to cite to the\n   <em>\n    very same statute\n   </em>\n   , which expressly allows a dissolved corporation to invest in a bond, which according to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Bus.%20Corp.%20Law.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    N.Y.

As such, the proceeds of the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit, which RET then invested into the Note, cannot be income to Mr. Nappo because title remains in RET. The Plaintiff has also failed to advance any legal authority under Connecticut, New York, or federal law that Mr. Nappo constructively received income from RET in its delayed wind-up. Therefore, Mr. Nappo did not fail to disclose income under either Connecticut law or the divorce decree and, thus, did not make a false statement pertaining to his income. Accordingly, Mr. Nappo's did not commit fraud pertaining to his income, whether actual, constructive, or by nondisclosure, by not disclosing the proceeds of the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit or the Note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20428\">\n    312 Conn. at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20A.3d%201076\">\n    93 A.3d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Nanos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"394839\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/97/529/#p532\">\n    97 Conn. at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Debtor Was Not Unjustly Enriched\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Plaintiff also argues that the Debtor was unjustly enriched because it benefited on account of the Property, it has not paid the Plaintiff any sum for that benefit, and such ownership has been to her detriment. The Trustee argues that the Debtor has no relationship or duties to the Plaintiff and, therefore, owes her nothing\n   at law or equity. The Court agrees with the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   First, in order to prove that the Debtor was unjustly enriched, the Plaintiff must prove that Mr. Nappo failed to disclose the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit and its proceeds. The Court has already determined that Mr. Nappo had no duty to disclose those things. This alone is fatal to the Plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim as pleaded. Nonetheless, the Court also determines that (1) any failure to disclose was not to the Plaintiff's detriment, (2) the Plaintiff has failed to prove that Ms. Nappo conspired with or aided and abetted Mr. Nappo in the alleged failure to disclose, and (3) even if there was detriment to the Plaintiff, RET received value via the Note, which is a filed claim against the Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate (Proof of Claim 3-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Even if William Nappo Had a Duty to Disclose, the Failure to Do So Was Not to the Plaintiff's Detriment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Plaintiff has alleged that she was harmed by the nondisclosure of the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit and its proceeds. Such is simply not credible. The Court has already found that, at the time of the dissolution, RET was patently insolvent. Even if Mr. Nappo had provided a full accounting of RET's books and pending and potential causes of action, its value would still have been $ 0 because, at the time, its liabilities outweighed its assets. In the divorce decree, the trial judge believed that Mr. Nappo was hiding assets and\n   <em>\n    still\n   </em>\n   ordered that he retain all of his business entities. As such, the Court finds that even if Mr. Nappo had disclosed the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit then-pending in New York, the state court still would have ordered Mr. Nappo to retain RET because he accurately listed its value at $ 0.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Additionally, the Court finds that the failure to pay the Plaintiff is nondetrimental because the Plaintiff may be entitled to payment from the Note. The Note, which is the subject of RET's Proof of Claim 3-1, has not been challenged and is currently slated to receive a dividend as an unsecured prepetition claim. Although the Court makes no finding that the Plaintiff is entitled to any portion of the Note-nor could it because Mr. Nappo and RET are not parties-the Plaintiff may yet prove her case against Mr. Nappo and RET in state court. Accordingly, any allegation of detriment to the Plaintiff is speculative at this point in time and cannot sustain a claim of unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of New Hartford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5765271\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/433/#p466\">\n    291 Conn. at 451-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=970%20A.2d%20592\">\n    970 A.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    The Plaintiff Has Failed to Prove that Karen Nappo Conspired with or Aided and Abetted William Nappo\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Plaintiff claims that Ms. Nappo, while aware of Mr. Nappo's duty to disclose, conspired with and aided and abetted him in violating that duty.

Aside from the undisputed facts that Ms. Nappo was Mr. Nappo's girlfriend at the time of the corporate dissolution and was the sole member and owner of the Debtor, the Plaintiff presented no evidence that Ms. Nappo had any role in Mr. Nappo's nondisclosure of the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   suit or its proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Furthermore, Ms. Nappo credibly\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified to having her own money and the state court found that she has largely been supporting Mr. Nappo. Ms. Nappo credibly testified to the circumstances surrounding her purchase of the Property, namely, that she had ended her career at Aetna and was looking to invest in real estate, a field her father had engaged in for many years. It is certainly true that, as part of the purchase price, the Debtor used money obtained from RET at Mr. Nappo's direction, but this circumstance does not lead this Court to conclude that Ms. Nappo conspired with or aided and abetted Mr. Nappo in unlawful nondisclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Macomber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5750503\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/277/617/#p635\">\n    277 Conn. at 635-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=894%20A.2d%20240\">\n    894 A.2d 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Efthimiou\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8457937\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/268/499/#p505\">\n    268 Conn. at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=846%20A.2d%20222\">\n    846 A.2d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Even if William Nappo Had a Duty to Disclose and the Failure to Do So Was Not Harmless, RET Capital Corp.

These circumstances could certainly be considered benefits, albeit small, because RET's proof of claim under the Note is slated to be paid a dividend. The Plaintiff, however, also argues that Mr. Nappo and Ms. Nappo have benefited from the rents received from the Property. Such an argument ignores that the Debtor has incurred risks and costs in maintaining the Property and-more importantly-Mr. Nappo and Ms. Nappo are not the Debtor. Although the Plaintiff has argued that Mr. Nappo maintains dominion and control over the Debtor, she failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove that argument. At best, the Plaintiff has proved that Mr. Nappo has occasionally helped Ms. Nappo with her operation of the Debtor and that Ms. Nappo has used her income from the Debtor to support Mr. Nappo. That Ms. Nappo supports Mr. Nappo is not controversial in any way because: (1) they are married and (2) the Superior Court previously found that Ms. Nappo was supporting Mr. Nappo in a manner typical of their relationship and adjusted his alimony to include funds received from her that she, in turn, derived from her ownership of the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In any event, the benefits the Debtor has derived certainly do not equal the full value of the Property. The money received from RET constituted only about a third of the purchase price, as the Debtor took out two mortgages to finance it. Additionally, funds have been expended over the thirteen years the Debtor controlled the Property for maintenance, improvements, and operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Considering that the Debtor did not merely take the money but issued a Note to RET, the Court finds that any failure to pay the Plaintiff for these benefits was not unjust because the Debtor gave value for the funds it received.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of New Hartford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5765271\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/433/#p466\">\n    291 Conn. at 451-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=970%20A.2d%20592\">\n    970 A.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even though that value (1) has not been paid back, (2) came with a favorable interest rate, and (3) will not see a full recovery because it is an unsecured debt, the Court will not use the lens of hindsight to retroactively find unjust behavior in what may have been a bad investment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In short, the Plaintiff has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) Mr. Nappo committed fraud, whether actual, constructive, or by nondisclosure; (2) Ms. Nappo conspired with or aided and abetted Mr. Nappo; (3) the Debtor unjustly failed to pay the Plaintiff; or (4) such failure to pay was detrimental to the Plaintiff. Each of these findings, on its own, is fatal to the Plaintiff's constructive trust\n   claim.

In light of the fact that these goals can be compromised by the imposition of a constructive trust, bankruptcy courts are generally reluctant to impose constructive trusts without a substantial reason to do so.... Bankruptcy courts in this Circuit are no exception....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Although we do not disturb the general rule that constructive trusts must be determined under state law, we believe it important to carefully note the difference between constructive trust claims arising in bankruptcy as opposed to those that do not, as the equities of bankruptcy are not the equities of the common law.... In the typical non-bankruptcy case, a constructive trust claim is intended to prevent one who failed to meet an obligation or committed fraud or other misconduct from becoming unjustly enriched. The Chapter 7 context, however, is fundamentally different. The trustee marshals the assets of the estate under judicial supervision, for distribution according to federal law, under circumstances in which unsecured creditors receive fair but not full returns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    Superintendent of Ins. v.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Court is not unsympathetic to the Plaintiff. It is apparent from the long history between her and Mr. Nappo that she feels mistreated, misled, and scorned. Her anger may even be well-founded, and she may yet have remedies against Mr. Nappo, Ms. Nappo, or RET, but they are not parties to these matters. The only defendants are the Debtor and the Trustee, and the Plaintiff has not proven that she is entitled to what she claims against this Debtor (or the Trustee) in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   For the absence of doubt: to the extent an argument has not been expressly addressed in this Memorandum, the Court states that it has considered all of the evidence and all of the Plaintiff's arguments. Any of the Plaintiff's arguments not discussed have been considered and determined to be immaterial or without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The Plaintiff has not met her burden to warrant the imposition of a constructive trust on the Property and judgment shall enter for the Defendants in the Adversary Proceeding. Accordingly, the Objection to Claim 6-1 is sustained, and the claim is disallowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In the interests of justice and fairness, the Court waives the 14-day stay of its decision under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7062. The Plaintiff's claims, having been fully heard, have failed upon multiple grounds. Delays only stand to chill the pending sale, increase its costs, or risk failure, and act as a deterrence to a bona fide buyer. Without a bond or compelling grounds to stay this judgment, an automatic stay is unjustified and inequitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   This is a final decision subject to traditional rights of appeal. Subject to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002, a Notice of Appeal must be filed within fourteen (14) days after entry of judgment.

Namely, here, the constructive trust in the Adversary Proceeding complaint is sought only on the Property, which is claimed nowhere in the operative complaint in the state court constructive trust case. The Court must also observe another major difference between the state court constructive trust proceeding and the Adversary Proceeding: the relevance of Jen-Dale. The amended complaint filed in the state court proceeding is rife with references to the circumstances surrounding Jen-Dale and the alleged inequities derived from it. Nowhere-and the Court means nowhere-is Jen-Dale mentioned in the amended complaint of the Adversary Proceeding. And yet, much of the Plaintiff's case was made on the inequities that she has suffered due to Mr. Nappo's alleged usurpation of funds from the Jen-Dale. Aside from the tangential relationship Mr. Nappo had with Jen-Dale and the Debtor-and that is the most the Plaintiff has proven in this case-the Court cannot stress enough how irrelevant Jen-Dale is to the Adversary Proceeding and the Objection. What happened with Jen-Dale, to put it bluntly, while it may be demonstrable of Mr. Nappo's character, has nothing to do with whether a constructive trust should be imposed on the Property. Such was not pleaded, and the Court will not mention it further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    Through much of the Adversary Proceeding, the Plaintiff has been represented by two attorneys, Patrick Tomasiewicz and Michael Berman. Attorney Berman has stated both on the record and has admitted in a brief on the appropriate standard of proof (AP ECF No. 62) that the Plaintiff's amended complaint in this Adversary Proceeding does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    allege fraud, only unjust enrichment; however, Attorney Tomasiewicz has framed his theory of the case around Mr. Nappo's failure to disclose the\n    <em>\n     ad valorem\n    </em>\n    suit, its proceeds, and the Note. That alleged failure to disclose is a form of fraud, whether actual or constructive. Thus, it seems Attorneys Berman and Tomasiewicz have ostensibly contradicted one another in terms of the appropriate legal theory underlying this case; in any regard, the operative complaint in this Adversary Proceeding, which is not a model of clarity, makes both allegations of nondisclosure and unjust enrichment. Rather than prejudice the Plaintiff by these differing views of the theory of this case, the Court addresses both fraud and unjust enrichment, neither of which the Court finds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Although the Court believes the proper standard of proof in these matters is clear and convincing evidence because the underlying conduct alleged is fraud, the Court recognizes that the parties-and, frankly, the Plaintiff's attorneys-are not on the same page.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    note 10 of this Memorandum. As noted above, there is some ambiguity as to whether constructive trusts generally require clear and convincing evidence or a preponderance of the evidence when premised on unjust enrichment. The Court finds no need to resolve this tension because the Plaintiff has failed to prove her case by even a preponderance of the evidence, which the Court will apply to all findings for the sake of expediency.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    <em>\n     Reville\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     Ramin v.

For purposes of being comprehensive, the Court has assumed that the final three elements of this test have been met by Mr. Nappo. The Court has, of course, held that the second element has not been met through Mr. Nappo's actions, which would also mean that Ms. Nappo could not have committed civil conspiracy in this case either because the claim cannot stand alone or because the Plaintiff has failed to prove an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    Civil aiding and abetting also cannot stand absent a valid underlying cause of action.\n    <em>\n     Efthimiou v.

The Trustee, however, credibly testified that any examination of the unsecured claims was, at this point, preliminary and each would receive more scrutiny once the Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate had funds to perform a more rigorous examination. The point of the Plaintiff's questions, though, was to show that, if her constructive trust claim is meritorious, which would also defeat RET's claim, there may not be a significant pool of unsecured creditors, exclusive of insiders, to consider.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    The Second Circuit cases cited in this section make no exception for privileging one unsecured claim where the others may be insignificant by comparison.
