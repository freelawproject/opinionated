The basis of WCP's third-party cause of action is breach of contract and a claim for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The matter was tried before the Court on August 6 and 7, 2018, and taken under advisement following oral closing argument. Adv. Doc. No. 466.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Decision constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This adversary proceeding arises from a chapter 11 bankruptcy case filed by Edra Blixseth (\"Blixseth\") on March 26, 2009, in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana. Case No. 09-60452.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case was converted to a chapter 7 liquidation on May 29, 2009. Doc. Nos. 178, 179. Richard Samson (\"Samson\") was appointed as chapter 7 trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The instant action is one of a host of adversary proceedings filed in connection with Blixseth's bankruptcy. On December 7, 2009, Atigeo LLC (\"Atigeo\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) and xPatterns filed a complaint against Samson, Blixseth, Opspring, and others, raising numerous claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 30, 2010, the Court granted WCP leave to intervene as a third-party in this adversary action. Adv. Doc. Nos. 64, 67, 68. On November 3, 2010, WCP filed an answer to the adversary complaint, and asserted a third-party complaint against Sandoval, xPatterns, and Atigeo (\"Third-party Defendants\"). Adv. Doc. Nos. 154. This third-party complaint alleged that WCP had foreclosed on certain contract and account receivable rights owned by Blixseth, and thus succeeded to her interests in the same, including Blixseth's rights or claims against xPatterns, Atigeo and Sandoval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   WCP amended its complaint on May 23, 2011, to add claims against Atigeo. Adv. Doc. Nos. 193, 213 (the complaint as amended is referred to as the \"Third-party Complaint\"). In the Third-party Complaint, WCP asserted a number of claims against the Third-party Defendants, including several claims that xPatterns breached its obligations under a settlement agreement and a claim that\n   Sandoval breached his guarantee of such. Adv. Doc. Nos. 193-1 at 9-10; 213. Sandoval answered the Third-party Complaint, asserting affirmative defenses. Adv. Doc. No. 229 at 9. This is the matter that was tried in 2018 and is addressed in this Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Both xPatterns and Opspring were subsidiaries of Atigeo, their parent company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 2006, Blixseth invested $ 8 million in Opspring and $ 10 million in xPatterns.

The claim on the Guarantee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Arguments of the parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Sandoval asserts that the Letter Agreement was intended to be a fully-integrated agreement to settle all claims among the parties, and Blixseth failed to perform her obligations, thus relieving Sandoval of his liability under the Letter Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   WCP, on the other hand, argues Sandaval's Guarantee is facially unconditional. It contends that Sandoval's agreement to pay \"no matter what may happen\" obligates him to fulfill the promises in the Guarantee regardless of whether the other parties to the Letter Agreement fulfilled their obligations. Accordingly, WCP argues Sandoval necessarily waived all defenses to the payment of the first $ 5 million owed by xPatterns to Blixseth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Additionally, WCP argues that xPatterns' obligation to pay $ 10 million to Blixseth, and Sandoval's partial guarantee of such, is severable from the other terms\n   of the Letter Agreement, and it is therefore not a fully integrated agreement as Sandoval contends. According to WCP, Sandoval is not excused from fulfilling the requirements of the Guarantee as a result of the failures of Blixseth and Opspring to fulfill their obligations under allegedly separate and distinguishable provisions in the Letter Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Unconditional nature of the Guarantee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Whether the phrase \"no matter what may happen\" creates an unconditional guarantee of the xPatterns obligation by Sandoval, is a matter of contract interpretation. The California Court of Appeals has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties. The mutual intention to which the courts give effect is determined by objective manifestations of the parties' intent, including the words used in the agreement, as well as extrinsic evidence of such objective matters as the surrounding circumstances under which the parties negotiated or entered into the contract; the object, nature and subject matter of the contract; and the subsequent conduct of the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Wolf v.

The first, asserted by WCP, is that the parties intended that Sandoval would be absolutely obligated to pay to Blixseth any portion of the initial $ 5 million that xPatterns might fail to pay, regardless of any breaches by any of the other parties to the Letter Agreement. The second, asserted by Sandoval, is that the Letter Agreement was designed to provide a source of funds that xPatterns could use to pay its obligation to Blixseth and, should the funds generated be insufficient for xPatterns to meet its obligation, he guaranteed the first $ 5 million would be paid. In other words, Sandoval asserts \"no matter what may happen\" refers to the potential that the designed function and interrelated provisions of the Letter Agreement might not be realized, but that it did not mean that he would have to pay $ 5 million to Blixseth regardless of her breaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The context of the \"no matter what may happen\" language within the Letter Agreement provides some evidence of the parties' intent. The first clause of the Letter Agreement provides for $ 10 million to be paid by xPatterns to Blixseth in order to redeem Blixseth's interest in xPatterns. The second clause provides Sandoval's Guarantee of \"the first $ 5 million portion of the xPatterns Obligation ... when due, no matter what may happen.\" Sandoval guaranteed xPatterns' debt; he did not make an absolute, direct payment obligation to Blixseth. Inherent in the use of a\n   guarantee is the understanding that the underlying obligation is legally enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Sandoval's testimony provides additional evidence of the parties' intent. Sandoval testified, in line with his argument, that the parties intended the \"no matter what may happen\" language to represent a commitment by Sandoval to ensure the first $ 5 million was paid to Blixseth\n   <em>\n    in the event that the various other clauses in the Letter Agreement did not generate sufficient funds to make the payments, as they were designed.\n   </em>\n   This plausible explanation, coupled with the context of the structured payments and mutual obligations of all parties, leads the Court to conclude the parties to the Letter Agreement did not intend the Guarantee to be an absolute, independent commitment to pay $ 5 million to Blixseth despite any breaches on her part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Divisibility of the Letter Agreement provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   WCP argues, in essence, that the Letter Agreement is a single document containing two separate and divisible agreements. One agreement is that Blixseth would relinquish her interest in xPatterns in exchange for a $ 10 million debt obligation from xPatterns, $ 5 million of which Sandoval guaranteed. Regarding this first agreement, WCP asserts that Blixseth completed her end of that deal by relinquishing ownership and that xPatterns and Sandoval breached their corollary obligation to pay Blixseth on the debt obligation. As further argued by WCP, all of the other obligations of Sandoval, xPatterns, Blixseth, and Opspring would constitute a second, separate agreement under which Sandoval and Blixseth both have substantial unperformed or underperformed obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Whether multiple obligations in an agreement are divisible or severable-cases on the issue tend to use those terms interchangeably-is a question of state law.\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

Under California law, the inclusion of a severability clause is but one factor to be considered in ascertaining whether the parties intended the agreement to be divisible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Letter Agreement's introductory paragraph provides some evidence of the parties' intent, expressing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   We\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   have philosophical differences about the operations of the businesses. The purpose of this [Letter Agreement] is to provide for a reasonable separation of Opspring, xPatterns and [Atigeo] among the parties in a manner that allows for their continuation and resolves the issues between us. We therefore agree as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Ex. 13 at 1. To that end, the Letter Agreement outlines the parties' agreement in twenty-nine numbered paragraphs. The introductory language of the Letter Agreement shows the parties intended the Letter Agreement to be an entire encompassing and inclusive contract, creating a global settlement of all issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Construing the Letter Agreement as divisible, as urged by WCP, would render several provisions nonsensical. For example, paragraphs 5, 6, 7, and 8 provide that Atigeo and Sandoval would relinquish all interests in Opspring, Sandoval would resign as an employee of Opspring, and Blixseth would own all the issued and outstanding equity interests of Opspring. Absent the context supplied by paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, which provides Blixseth's corollary agreement to relinquish all rights and involvement in xPatterns, the relinquishment of rights in Opspring by Atigeo and Sandoval does not appear to have any rational basis. Rather, the Letter Agreement is a global settlement of the parties' claims in which Blixseth agreed to relinquish all rights in xPatterns and, Sandoval and Atigeo agreed to relinquish their rights in Opspring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Additionally, paragraph 14 of the Letter Agreement provides a series of releases by the parties. Blixseth released all claims against Atigeo, xPatterns, and Sandoval; Opspring released its claims against Atigeo, xPatterns, and Sandoval; and Atigeo, xPatterns, and Sandoval released all claims against Blixseth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. These releases applied \"to all claims, whether known, unknown or unanticipated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. These mutual releases also make little sense without the context provided by paragraphs 1 and 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Sandoval's uncontroverted trial testimony provides further evidence of the parties' intent. Sandoval credibly explained that the various enumerated clauses in the Letter\n   Agreement were actively negotiated and, at least from his perspective, were intended to ensure that xPatterns and Atigeo could fulfill their financial obligations to employees, creditors, and Blixseth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For example, in paragraph 9 of the Letter Agreement, Blixseth agreed to cause the Yellowstone Club to pay its $ 1 million obligation to Atigeo within 30 days of the Letter Agreement date. Ex. 13 at 3. Sandoval explained the timing of this payment was deliberately negotiated in order to allow xPatterns to pay its employees' wages during the transition and to partially fund the $ 2 million payment due to Blixseth 120 days after the date of the Letter Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Additionally, Sandoval testified that at the time the Letter Agreement was entered, Opspring had a $ 100 million \"letter of commitment\" to provide services to the U.S. Government. In order to satisfy a significant portion of the obligation to Blixseth, paragraph 4 provided that Blixseth would cause Opspring to pay to Atigeo a performance fee equal to 5% of revenue earned by Opspring, up to a maximum performance fee of $ 15 million. Given that letter of commitment from the government, Sandoval was highly confident Opspring would generate $ 100 million in revenue and the $ 5 million \"performance fee\" would be paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   According to Sandoval, it was only due to the inclusion of the various provisions designed to ensure funds were available to pay Blixseth that he agreed to guarantee the obligation. His understanding and belief at the time of entering into the Letter Agreement was that, should all parties to the Letter Agreement fulfill their obligations, the entire $ 5 million he guaranteed to Blixseth would be satisfied and, therefore, the likelihood of him being personally required to pay Blixseth was minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Having considered all the trial evidence, especially the plain language of the Letter Agreement and the uncontroverted testimony of Sandoval,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court concludes the Letter Agreement must be construed as an entire contract, rather than a divisible one. While any one of the Letter Agreement's paragraphs might be cherry-picked and construed as an independent stand-alone commitment by one party, the evidence as a whole established that Sandoval, and the other parties to the Letter Agreement, intended the Letter Agreement to be a global resolution of all issues, rather than a series of independent agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Breach of contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The next issue is whether WCP has met its burden of proving its claim for breach of contract. It is uncontested that the Letter Agreement constitutes a contract under which xPatterns agreed to pay Blixseth $ 10 million and that Sandoval personally guaranteed payment of the first $ 5 million of such obligation. While the evidence at trial showed the first $ 2 million of xPatterns' obligation was satisfied through agreed-upon offsets, it is uncontested that xPatterns failed to pay any part of the remaining $ 8 million. It is further uncontested that WCP, as the successor in interest to Blixseth's interests under the Letter Agreement, suffered damage as a result of the breaches-being deprived of millions of dollars in payments from xPatterns and/or Sandoval. The question, under California law, is whether WCP has met its burden of proving the \"plaintiff's performance [of the contract] or excuse for nonperformance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Prof'l Collection Consultants\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461951\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-5th/8/958/#p968\">\n    8 Cal.

First, Sandoval alleges Opspring earned at least $ 2 million in revenue and Blixseth failed to fulfill her obligation to cause Opspring to pay the 5% performance fee required on such revenue. Adv. Doc. No. 448 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Nicholas Rhodes, Opspring's managing director, testified during his deposition that Opspring generated revenue from a governmental contract. Adv. Doc. No. 454-2 at internal page 92.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, rather than the $ 100 million in revenue anticipated by Sandoval, only $ 2 million was generated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=214%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the Letter Agreement, Blixseth was obligated to cause Opspring to pay a 5% performance fee (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $ 100,000). That performance fee was to be made \"promptly at the end of [the] calendar quarter.\" Ex. 13 at 2, paragraph 4. WCP has provided no evidence that Blixseth fulfilled that obligation. To the contrary, WCP appears to acknowledge no performance fee was ever paid. Instead, WCP proposes to provide a \"credit\" for such unpaid fee in its calculation of the amounts owed by Sandoval and xPatterns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 171. This credit, nearly 10 years late, is insufficient to cure the breach. Thus, on the evidence, the Court concludes WCP has not proven Blixseth performed her obligations under the Letter Agreement to cause payment of the $ 100,000 performance fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Sandoval also alleges Blixseth failed to perform under the Letter Agreement by disclosing the Letter Agreement's terms and by disparaging Sandoval in prior litigation. The Letter Agreement provides that Blixseth would not \"disclose (or cause or allow to be disclosed) any terms of th[e] Letter Agreement to any third party or entity without the prior written consent\" of Atigeo. Ex. 13 at 6. It further provides that Blixseth agreed \"to not, directly or indirectly ... disparage [Atigeo], xPatterns, Sandoval,\" or other listed parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   On May 28, 2008, ten months before her bankruptcy filing, Blixseth filed a lawsuit against xPatterns, Atigeo, and Sandoval, among others.

As to nondisclosure, Blixseth did disclose a portion of the terms of the Letter Agreement. In order to properly do so, she was required to obtain Atigeo's written consent. WCP has provided no evidence that Blixseth obtained Atigeo's required consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \"Disparagement\" has been defined as a \"false and injurious statement that discredits or detracts from the reputation of another's character, property, product, or business.\" Black's Law Dictionary 538 (9th ed. 2009).
