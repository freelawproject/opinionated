The Complaint seeks to except from discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) a debt owed to Plaintiff by Debtor/Defendant Linda Johnson-Battle (the \"Debtor\") in the amount of $ 8,088.23 arising from an April 13, 2015 Stipulation of Settlement (the \"Stipulation\"). Plaintiff proceeded\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , but with the assistance of his son, who appeared at trial and participated in all pretrial proceedings. Defendant was represented by counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Plaintiff and Debtor entered into the Stipulation following a dispute between Plaintiff as landlord and Debtor as tenant. In the Stipulation, the parties compromised Debtor's alleged obligation to the Plaintiff from $ 11,289 to $ 6,000 and agreed that the Debtor would pay $ 500 per month for twelve months, with\n   Judgment to be entered in the amount of $ 11,289 (minus credits for payments) if the Debtor defaulted. Plaintiff claims that he compromised the debt to $ 6,000 based on Debtor's representations that she was a single parent with one income. Plaintiff alleged that Debtor's representations were demonstrably false because Debtor's husband lived with her at times, they remained married and he contributed to various expenses of the Debtor and their children. Debtor claims that she compromised the debt because she did not believe that she owed the entire $ 11,289 and that she made no misrepresentations to the Plaintiff about her marital status or contributions from her husband, from whom she was informally separated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The issue for this Court is whether Debtor induced the Plaintiff to enter into the Stipulation based on representations and omissions as to her marital status and her husband's financial contributions so that the debt should be excepted from discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). The Court finds that the Debtor did induce the Plaintiff to enter the April 13, 2015 Stipulation by her misrepresentations that she was a single parent with one income, and by her failure to advise Plaintiff of the contributions of her husband and that Plaintiff justifiably relied on those representations and omissions. Accordingly, the Court determines that the stipulated amount of $ 11,289, less $ 3,200.77 already paid to the Plaintiff leaving a balance of $ 8,088.23, is excepted from discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and the Standing Orders of Reference entered by the United States District Court on July 10, 1984 and amended on September 18, 2012.

The Plaintiff provided a copy of the parties' lease (the \"Lease\") as an exhibit to his response to Debtor's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, but the Lease was not entered into evidence at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will generally discuss the Lease as a matter of background, but that general discussion does not have any impact on the Court's decision. The Lease commenced on November 26, 2004 for a one-year term and became month-to-month thereafter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The property address was 24 Eaton Place (no city given), and the rent was $ 1,550 per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor and Mr. Battle each signed the Lease, and the last page of the Lease represented that six minor children, aged\n   1-1/2 years to 14 years, would occupy the leased premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff commenced the collection action/landlord-tenant action that gave rise to the underlying debt in or about 2007 based on the failure to pay three months' rent and alleged damage to the premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   That action was captioned as\n   <em>\n    Jimmy Smith v. Marvin &amp; Linda Battle\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Special Civil Part, Dkt. No. DC-39698-07 (the \"State Court Action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2008, Plaintiff obtained a default judgment in the amount of $ 11,289.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff initiated collection actions against both parties but was apparently not successful. Years later, Debtor and Mr. Battle sought to vacate the default judgment based on improper service and were successful insofar as the State Court reopened the State Court Action with a new trial set for April 13, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 13, 2015, the Plaintiff, represented by counsel, and Debtor only (not Mr. Battle), appearing\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   se, entered a Stipulation that settled the State Court Action. Both parties indicated that a mediator assisted Plaintiff and Debtor with the settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Stipulation required the Debtor to pay Plaintiff a total of $ 6,000 in $ 500 monthly installments beginning on May 16, 2015 and on the sixteenth of each month thereafter until the balance was paid in full.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Debtor defaulted in payment, the Stipulation allowed the Plaintiff, upon certification of default, to seek entry of Judgment for $ 11,289, less any payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 21, 2015, Debtor advised the Plaintiff (and his wife) in writing that she had missed the August 16, 2015 payment because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I did not have the money because of my unemployment status over the summer (I only work ten months a year).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Debtor's September 21, 2015 letter indicates that she tried to contact Plaintiff earlier (\"I sent out a letter to inform you of this prior to the check due date, unfortunately I now know that you did not receive it\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor indicates that she had already sent the Plaintiff the $ 500 payment due September 16, 2015 and asks that she be given another chance\n   to perform under the Stipulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff did not agree to do so, nor did he cash the check. Plaintiff produced as an exhibit a copy of uncanceled check number 197 dated September 10, 2015 for $ 500 drawn on Debtor's and Mr. Battle's\n   <em>\n    joint\n   </em>\n   bank account over an address of 84 North 19th Street, East Orange, New Jersey 07017 and payable to Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to evidencing this joint account, this check also indicates that both the Debtor and Mr. Battle share the same address for this purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After Debtor's default, Plaintiff pursued collection in the State Court Action in August and in September 2015 obtained a judgment and sought to garnish her wages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 24, 2015, the Debtor filed a \"Request for Wage Application Hearing\" in the State Court Action in defense of the Plaintiff's attempt to garnish her wages. Debtor's application (a filled-in form with Debtor's fill-ins underlined below) states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I,\n   <em>\n    Linda Battle\n   </em>\n   , request a hearing on the wage application in the above matter because,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    I was unable to make a payment due to being unemployed.

Debtor scheduled the Plaintiff as a general unsecured creditor on Schedule E/F for $ 9,788 out of $ 25,324 in general unsecured debt. On Schedule I, Debtor stated that she had been employed as a teacher by the Irvington Board of Education, Irvington, New Jersey for six years. Debtor scheduled a wage garnishment of $ 754 but did not identify the garnisher. The Debtor identified her residence as 84 North 19th Street, East Orange, New Jersey 07017 (the \"Property\") and scheduled her interest in this Property as \"Joint tenant,\" even though she also inconsistently stated that she is the sole owner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor produced as a trial exhibit an unrecorded first page of an August 27, 2010 Deed indicating that Debtor and Mr. Battle's son (also named Marvin) took title to the Property on or about that date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Deed identified the grantee as \"Linda Battle,\n   Married and Marvin Battle, Jr., Single.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee, Barbara A.

In that application, Ms. Johnson-Battle represents to the State Court that she was unable to make a settlement payment [in August 2015] \"due to being unemployed.\" Thus, the Debtor's trial testimony that she never said she was unemployed was directly contradicted by her statement to the State Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   While being examined by her counsel, Ms. Johnson-Battle attempted to explain this inconsistency by testifying that as a teacher, she has a ten-month employment period and is off or \"unemployed\" during the summer. She also testified that she normally had temporary employment in the summer months, but that the funding for her temporary job ran out in August 2015 and she was unemployed for that month. The Court understands the explanation but notes that being a full-time teacher is not the same as being unemployed, whether the pay period is ten months or twelve months. Further, Ms. Johnson-Battle's testimony while being examined by Mr. Smith was unequivocal - \"I've never been unemployed, sir\" - but her statement in the application to the State Court was directly to the contrary, and her explanatory testimony in this Court was less than satisfactory or compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In sum, the Debtor's statement to the State Court that she was \"unemployed\" was at least incomplete and misleading, as she was employed as a full-time teacher then, as she is now. Thus, this testimony raises additional credibility issues for the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Putting credibility issues aside for the moment, later testimony as to the timing of her representation about \"unemployment\" by both Plaintiff and Defendant made clear that this statement was made to the State Court (and Plaintiff)\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Stipulation was entered into and therefore could not have been relied upon by Mr. Smith in entering into the Stipulation. In this regard, upon questioning from the\n   Court, Plaintiff testified that the Debtor did not make a representation about her unemployment until \"later,\" i.e., not during the April 13, 2015 settlement negotiations, but rather during the summer of 2015, when she sought forbearance while not drawing her teacher's salary:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    THE COURT\n   </em>\n   : [O]ne question that I ... wanted to ask Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith, at the time that you entered into this stipulation of settlement what were the -- I know you talked about certain representations that you say were made by [Debtor], can you just summarize them for me again?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    PLAINTIFF\n   </em>\n   : Well, [Debtor] said she was living in a household with one income. [The Plaintiff digresses].... Because she was -- only had one income coming in and because I wanted to give her a break and get some of my money, I decided to enter into the consent agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    THE COURT\n   </em>\n   : So, the point about being unemployed came up after that meeting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    PLAINTIFF\n   </em>\n   : That came up after.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court notes that Plaintiff's early testimony at the August 29, 2018 trial appeared to be as to Plaintiff's understanding of Debtor's employment at the time of the settlement negotiations on April 13, 2015, but was inconclusive. Plaintiff's subsequent testimony that the Debtor's statement of her \"unemployed\" status was made \"after\" the settlement clears up that issue and is consistent with the timing of the default (August 2015) and $ 500 check date (September 10, 2015), which were both after the April 13, 2015 settlement. Thus, Plaintiff did not and could not have relied on any representation by Debtor that she was unemployed in the summer of 2015 when he entered into the April 13, 2015 Stipulation. Accordingly, that representation cannot form the basis of Plaintiff's nondischargeability claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Debtor's Marital Status and Sources of Income\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   What remains is the asserted representations and omissions by the Debtor concerning her marital status and sources of income. Debtor initially testified that she told Plaintiff during the settlement negotiations that she was separated from her husband.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, at the end of trial, she denied even making that statement during the settlement discussions in April 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Debtor gave inconsistent testimony on this issue as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Debtor further testified that Mr. Battle and she first separated in November 2011 and that \"it has been on and off ever since. He's there, he's not there but it officially started November 2011.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, she also acknowledged that Mr. Battle and she have been married for fifteen years and are still married.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   She clarified that they never divorced but have informally \"separated numerous times\" \"[w]here he lived and resided somewhere else.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, according to the Debtor and her counsel, Mr. Battle had been living in the Debtor's home after the filing of her bankruptcy petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Battle also testified that they were separated, but ultimately acknowledged that they used a joint checking\n   account that he funded at least in part and that he used the Debtor's address as his address for at least certain purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As to sources of income, the Debtor also testified that Mr. Battle gives her money as needed and in varying amounts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    PLAINTIFF\n   </em>\n   : How much money does your husband give you on a weekly or monthly basis for support of the household?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    DEBTOR\n   </em>\n   : He does not give me any money on a weekly basis and he gives me money monthly as needed. The first year that he left, he paid half of the mortgage every month. That was just the first year. Now he gives me money as I ask. We don't have as many children in the household as we did when he left.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   As I just stated, the first year he paid half of the mortgage because when he left, we had six children in the home with me. He paid half of the mortgage which would have been $ 1,000 every month but that was it. He didn't give me anything towards the bills, the food, the clothing, any expenses, just the thousand for the mortgage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   After that, half of the children have left, they're grown. There's only three children left.\n   <em>\n    He gives me money as needed. It may be $ 500 this month, $ 600 next month. I don't get a legal child support and he does not pay half the mortgage anymore.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    PLAINTIFF\n   </em>\n   : During the 2004 examination hearing you and Mr. Witherspoon communicated that your husband did not provide you with money. Is that accurate?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    DEBTOR\n   </em>\n   : I don't recall saying that. I just explained he has to give me money. He's legally married to me. We had six children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   At this point, Plaintiff had Debtor read into the record, and the Court admitted into evidence, the following excerpt from a January 18, 2017 response by Debtor's counsel (labeled \"Certification\") in support of his motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   As discovery for the 2004 examination, [Debtor] stated that Mr. Battle moved back into the same household three months after filing of the petition. She testified that they sleep in separate rooms, consider themselves to be a separate couple. [Debtor] has indicated that they have separated several times and is not sure how long Mr. Battle will be residing in her home. While Mr. Battle helps with certain bills, it's speculation on how long he will be staying in her home before he moves out again.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Debtor then resumed her testimony, acknowledging that Mr. Battle and she have never sought legal separation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   but my husband has lived with me. The last six years he's maybe lived there a year-and-a-half and that would consist of sleeping downstairs. Our youngest child is 15 years old. My husband has a three-year-old and a five-year-old because he's moved out and left me numerous times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Debtor further testified that she paid $ 500 toward the settlement from the joint account with Mr. Battle:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   I stated at one point we had no contact so that's how he would get me the money.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   He would put it into the account and I would pay the bills --\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Debtor elaborated on Mr. Battle's contact with her and his contributions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   So, when we had -- like he would come to the home but we really -- like I didn't have much to say to him at that point. That's how he handled his part. And I guess in his case it was also his way of documenting that he was giving me something if I took him to court. The joint account is still there. At this time it has a dollar and some change but at that time that was my only account so that was my primary account which is not now, but it was and it just so happens to be an account we shared.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Plaintiff also caused the Debtor to read into the record portions of the September 26, 2016 State Court hearing transcript in which the State Court was troubled by Mr. Battle's testimony about his residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Debtor testified at trial that she did not report to the Chapter 7 Trustee at the meeting of creditors on April 28, 2016 that she received money from Mr. Battle because, \"I didn't know I was required to report that.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither was any contribution from Mr. Battle disclosed on Debtor's schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Plaintiff testified on direct examination that, when the Debtor and he met with a mediator on April 13, 2015, the parties discussed \"that I take a lesser amount than the judgment because of what Mrs. Battle had said in regards to her finance, her marriage status.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiff testified that Debtor \"indicated that she was living on one income household and was separated from her husband.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   This information factored into Plaintiff's decision to compromise his claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Well, I wanted to recoup some of my money and if it was so that she was living on one income, then I'd agree to take less.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As noted, the trial testimony revealed that Mr. Battle did make contributions to the Debtor, even though they may have been sporadic and in varying amounts. The testimony also confirmed that Mr. Battle lived with the Debtor at certain times, that they were still married, that they shared a joint checking account, that Mr. Battle contributed to the household expenses \"as needed\" and that he used the Debtor's address as his. Thus, the Debtor was not a single parent with one source of income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In sum, the Court is confronted with the inconsistent, sometimes conflicting and often-changing testimony of the Debtor as to whether Mr. Battle lived with her and/or provided her with financial support -- and even whether she made any such statements during the settlement negotiations -- as contrasted with Plaintiff's consistent testimony that he entered into the settlement agreement and compromised his debt with the Debtor because she represented that she was a single parent with one income during those discussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Based on the trial testimony, the Court finds that these statements were in fact made by the Debtor and were not true, as the Debtor acknowledges that Mr. Battle made at least some contributions to her monthly expenses, even though they were on a less than consistent basis as to both timing and amount. It is similarly undisputed that Ms. Johnson-Battle did not disclose any of these contributions to the Bankruptcy Court in her schedules. Further, the Debtor remained married to Mr. Battle throughout this period (and through the trial).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Accordingly, in deciding this issue, the Court credits Plaintiff's testimony that he entered into this settlement on the basis of the Debtor's representations that she was a single parent with one income to support her household. Neither statement was true as she was married and Mr. Battle provided at least some support to the Debtor, lived with her from time to time and they shared a joint checking account. Plaintiff's reliance on those statements, after being unable to collect anything from the Debtor from 2007 to 2015, was understandable and justifiable in the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The General Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Count One of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges that the debt of Debtor to Plaintiff is nondischargeable because it was \"obtained by false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud within the meaning of ... \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\" Specifically,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) provides that a discharge under Title 11:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   (2) for money, property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to the extent obtained by -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   (A) false pretenses, false representation or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor's or an insider's financial condition;\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The burden is on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a debt is nondischargeable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grogan v.

First, Plaintiff entered into the Stipulation on the basis of Ms. Johnson-Battle's misrepresentations and omissions as to material facts; i.e., that she was a single parent with one income to support her family. The facts established at trial demonstrate that Ms. Johnson-Battle was continuously married to Mr. Battle during the relevant time period; that he made contributions to the Debtor's household expenses, often on a monthly basis, although the time and amounts of these payments varied; and that they shared a joint checking account from which various household expenses were paid, including the mortgage on Ms. Johnson-Battle's then-residence and at least one of the $ 500 settlement payments made to Plaintiff. Mr. Battle also lived with the Debtor from time to time\n   (including recently) and used the Debtor's address as his main address. Thus, Ms. Johnson-Battle's statement that she was a single parent with one income was not accurate or complete in that she was continuously married and she also did not disclose the contributions from Mr. Battle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The trial testimony further demonstrated that the Debtor knew that those statements and omissions were material and not accurate when she made (or did not make) them and evidence an intent to deceive. Their materiality is plain (and her omissions were misleading) as they were the basis of Plaintiff's compromise and they paint a sympathetic picture, combined with an inability to pay. Here, the Court finds that Ms. Johnson-Battle's inconsistent testimony as to these matters, along with her at least misleading and incomplete statement to the State Court that she was \"unemployed,\" evidences her propensity to make statements in a light more favorable to her when it benefits her position and then attempts to explain them away when an inconsistency is exposed. Ms. Johnson-Battle's denial that she made these statements rings hollow, especially given the inconsistences noted above, including her failure to include the contributions from Mr. Battle on her submissions to the Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Having determined that Ms. Johnson-Battle made these misrepresentations and omissions, the Court also finds that Ms. Johnson-Battle intended that Plaintiff rely on them in entering into the Stipulation and that Plaintiff was justified in doing so.\n   <em>\n    In re Melendez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512069\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/260/#p265\">\n    589 B.R. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 265 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2018) (and cases cited therein) (\"intent to deceive\" in a section 523(a)(2)(A) action \"may be inferred from the totality of the surrounding circumstances\"). Just as the Debtor knew that stating she was unemployed would evoke consideration and perhaps sympathy from the State Court in connection with her wage garnishment, Ms. Johnson-Battle also knew that being a single parent with one income was likely to have the effect of causing Plaintiff to compromise his claim, as he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   As to justifiable reliance, Plaintiff testified that he relied on Ms. Johnson-Battle's statements as to her single parent, single income status in entering into the Stipulation; Plaintiff entered into the Stipulation \"[b]ecause she ... only had one income coming in and because I wanted to give her a break and get some of my money....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   After litigating and unsuccessfully seeking recovery from the Debtor for almost a decade, Plaintiff was justified in relying on these statements in compromising his claim by almost half in exchange for the promise of regular payments from the Debtor, who had avoided Plaintiff's collection efforts for years. Here, in addition to the direct misrepresentations and omissions to Plaintiff as to her marital status and sources of income, the Court again finds significant that Ms. Johnson-Battle's submissions to the State Court as to her \"unemployed\" status (along with Mr. Battle's testimony as to his financial and living arrangements with the Debtor) were also severely questioned by the State Court. In short, in choosing between Plaintiff's testimony on these issues and the Debtor's denials, the Court credits the testimony of Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Finally, there is no doubt that Plaintiff was damaged by the misrepresentations as he compromised his claim by over $ 5,000 (almost 50%) and agreed to accept payments over time in entering into the Stipulation. However, the amount of these damages is less than straightforward in the circumstances of this case because the underlying\n   judgment was generally for failure to pay rent and did not appear to be based on any type of fraud or be otherwise nondischargeable (although Plaintiff did also claim his property was damaged). In any event, the underlying debt would likely be dischargeable in whole or in part if the parties had not entered into the Stipulation. However, this case involves the somewhat unusual circumstance of the misrepresentations and omissions occurring in connection with the settlement of what appears to be an otherwise dischargeable debt. Further complicating the issue is the limiting language of section 523(a)(2), which provides that the debt is nondischargeable only \"to the extent obtained by\" fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In deciding this issue, the Court relies on\n   <em>\n    In re Biondo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11661739,11662823\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/126/\">\n    180 F.3d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1999), where the Court held that a debt for legal fees (which is normally dischargeable) that had been compromised and settled on the basis of debtors' misrepresentations as to their ownership and control of certain assets was nondischargeable in its entirety under section 523(a)(2)(A). Like this case, the settlement in\n   <em>\n    Biondo\n   </em>\n   provided for a significantly reduced claim (less than 50%) if all payments were made, but that the full amount could be owed if there was a default.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11661739,11662823\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/126/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11661739,11662823\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/126/\">\n    at 129, 133-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In holding that the entire debt was nondischargeable (even though the original debt for legal fees would have been dischargeable), the Fourth Circuit determined that the fraud was in connection with the settlement agreement, which was akin to a novation, rather than the original agreement to provide legal services. Thus, the settlement constituted a refinancing or extension of credit which was obtained by the fraud and was therefore nondischargeable in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11661739,11662823\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/126/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11661739,11662823\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/126/\">\n    at 132-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Janney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5927260\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/557/476/#p479\">\n    557 B.R. 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479-81 (Bankr.
