Appellant contends that (1) his interest in a civil judgment upon his Section 1983 cause of action is not within the statutory definition of a \"claim\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and thus may not be discharged by a Section 363 sale of assets free and clear of all liabilities and (2) the Sale Order could not discharge any potential judgment against New GM because Appellant did not and, indeed, could not receive constitutionally adequate notice of the effect GM's bankruptcy would have on his civil case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Provided that the conditions specified in Section 363(f) are met, a bankruptcy court may authorize a trustee or debtor in possession to sell property of the estate \"free and clear of any interest in such property\" pursuant to Section 363(b). Although courts have not fashioned a precise definition for the term, the Second Circuit has held that successor liability claims against the purchaser in a Section 363 sale constitute \"interest[s] in such [sold] property\" that can be extinguished by a Section 363 sale if they fall within the statutory definition of a claim as set forth in 11 U.S.C. section 101(5) (\" Section 101(5)\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elliott v.

Before the Third Circuit finally overturned\n   <em>\n    In re M.

The Court agrees with the weight of lower court authority in this circuit that the fair contemplation test, rather than the discredited standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    In re M.

The Court is not persuaded by this authority, which generally addresses the question of whether a malicious prosecution cause of action constitutes the\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    of\n   </em>\n   a debtor's bankruptcy estate, an analysis that does not turn on the existence of a \"claim\"\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   the debtor as specified in Section 101(5).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5757576\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/410/182/#p193\">\n    410 B.R. 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193-94 (Bankr.

Although a favorable termination of his criminal proceedings was not assured, Appellant's decades-long quest to establish his innocence and overturn his conviction leads to the inescapable inference that the eventual occurrence of such a contingency was well within his actual contemplation prior to the petition. Appellant's Section 1983 cause of action against New GM is thus a claim against Old GM within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code, of which New GM accepted the transfer of Old GM's assets free and clear to pursuant to Section 363 and consistent with the Sale Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court next turns to Appellant's argument that he did not receive adequate notice of the bar date and sale. To comport with due process, a known creditor, whose identity can be ascertained through the exercise of reasonable diligence, is entitled to actual notice, whereas an unknown creditor is entitled to only constructive notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   159 (citing\n   <em>\n    Chemetron Corp v.

On appeal, Appellant concedes that he was not a known creditor, but argues that no form of notice would have been constitutionally adequate to apprise him that GM's bankruptcy could extinguish his right to seek relief for his deprivation of civil rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Courts have expressed concern that a lack of notice could preclude the discharge of a claim where the claimant cannot yet be identified because she has not yet had any contact with the debtor and may never incur any harm from the debtor's actions except in the future through \"[s]heer fortuity,\"\n   <em>\n    Chateaugay I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526809,6511364\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/997/\">\n    944 F.2d at 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As an example of such a situation, the Second Circuit posited a hypothetical debtor company that built many bridges pre-petition, one of which collapsed post-petition due to a defect, injuring motorists who had no notice of the defect and were unfortunate enough to be crossing that bridge at that time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526809,6511364\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/997/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   No such circumstances are presented here; Appellant was aware of the harm he had suffered and the identity of GM's employees whom he alleges conspired with state authorities to deprive him of his civil rights well before the bankruptcy filing. While viability of Appellant's Section 1983 suit was contingent on the favorable resolution of his criminal case, he was actively litigating prior to the bankruptcy\n   filing to vindicate his rights and bring that contingency to fruition and, like any other contingent creditor, Appellant could have inferred that any suits he might wish to bring against GM could be affected by its bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Citing to authority holding that incarcerated prisoners may be entitled to reasonable actual notice of forfeiture proceedings against them, Appellant also argues that, as an incarcerated prisoner, he was entitled to actual notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Armendariz-Mata v.

The cited authorities are, however, inapposite, as they deal with the question of notice to specific persons known to claim interests in allegedly forfeitable property, whose locations were known.

The bankruptcy court's decision to deny Appellant's motion to allow a post-bar-date filing of his proof of claim against Old GM is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    In re Enron Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8929628,8936750\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/419/115/\">\n    419 F.3d at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As previously explained, Appellant's understanding of the scope of the term \"claim\" in the bankruptcy context is simply incorrect as a matter of law. Appellant's expectation of recovering through civil action was a contingent claim for which he could have timely filed a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court notwithstanding his mistaken legal conclusion to the contrary. Appellant's failure to timely file his proof of claim thus was indeed based on a mistake of law and the bankruptcy court did not err in finding the mistake insufficient to excuse his failure to comply with the published bar date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Appellant's contention that he should be excused from compliance with the published deadline to file a proof of claim against GM's bankruptcy estate while he was imprisoned is also unavailing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court is mindful that it is indeed difficult to diligently supervise one's legal affairs while incarcerated and accepts Appellant's representation that his priority was to secure his own freedom before turning his attention to collecting civil damages for the harm he suffered. Appellant, however, offers no authority, and the Court's own research has disclosed none, to support the proposition that a claimant who was otherwise able to file a proof of claim should be excused from timely doing so because he was focused on more pressing priorities.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Settlement Facility Dow Corning Tr.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-10347,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201196389\">\n    2017 WL 1196389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2049210\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.

Appellant is aggrieved that he is now barred from seeking recourse against both Old and New GM for their alleged role in his arrest and subsequent prosecution. Appellant's predicament is the result of the operation of a bankruptcy system that both affords opportunities to assert timely claims against debtors and permits the sale of assets free and clear of\n   such claims. Appellant was eligible to avail himself of the claim procedure, but failed to do so in compliance with the law. While Appellant has thus forfeited his ability to seek redress against both entities, he is in the same position as any other claimant who was allegedly harmed by GM's tortious or unlawful conduct, whether serious or trivial, and did not assert his or her claim in a timely fashion. The record shows no inequitable treatment that would render the denial of Appellant's late claim filing application abusive of the bankruptcy court's discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant's motion to file a post-bar-date notice of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Bankruptcy Decision is affirmed and Appellant's appeal is dismissed.
