Tese-Milner's (\"Trustee\") motion to approve a stipulation with Urban Compass, a creditor of the debtor's chapter 7 estate. (\"9019 Motion,\" ECF Doc. # 162.) The stipulation reduces Urban Compass' claim from $ 57,540 to $ 40,000 and allows it in that amount. (\"Stipulation,\" ECF Doc. # 167.) Scott Kerner (\"Kerner\" or \"Debtor\") moved to expunge Urban Compass' entire claim. (\"Debtor's Motion,\" ECF Doc. # 149-1.) In effect, the Debtor's Motion amounts to an objection to the Stipulation. Urban Compass (\"Compass\") opposes the Debtor's Motion. (\"Opposition,\" ECF Doc. # 157.) The Trustee filed a statement concerning the Debtor's Motion. (ECF Doc. # 158.) The Debtor filed a response. (ECF Doc. # 160.) For the reasons explained below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the 9019 Motion and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the Debtor's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to filing his petition on December 7, 2017, Kerner retained Compass, a real estate brokerage firm, to sell his condominium unit (the \"Condominium Unit\"). (Opposition \u00b6 2.) Kerner and Compass executed a brokerage agreement. (\"Brokerage Agreement,\" ECF Doc. # 149-2, at 5-11.) The Brokerage Agreement (i) granted Compass an exclusive right to sell the Condominium Unit until February 22, 2018 (the \"Term\"); and (ii) provided that if the Condominium Unit was sold during the Term, Compass was entitled to a commission equal to 4% of the total sale price. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the Term, Compass introduced Jennifer Robinson-Khagan and Payam Khagan (collectively, the \"Khagans\") to Kerner as possible purchasers of the Condominium Unit. (Opposition \u00b6 3.) On or about September 30, 2017, Kerner entered into a contract (\"Khagan Contract,\" ECF Doc. # 157-1) to sell the Condominium Unit for $ 1,918,000 to the Khagans. (Opposition \u00b6 3.) Compass agreed to reduce its\n   commission to 3% of the total sale price only if the Condominium Unit was sold to the Khagans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Khagans satisfied the mortgage contingency in the Khagan Contract, and the closing of the sale of the Condominium Unit was scheduled for December 22, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The email scheduling the closing states, \"To Julie [Newdow] and Mark [Landisman] [Compass Brokers]: Please send us your invoice as soon as possible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 7, 2017, Kerner filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. The Debtor neither assumed nor rejected the Khagan Contract but instead filed a motion seeking authority to conduct an auction sale of the Condominium Unit using the Khagan Contract as a stalking horse bid. (\"Debtor's Motion to Approve Bidding Procedures in Connection with the Sale of the Condominium Unit,\" ECF Doc. # 18.) The Debtor falsely represented that the Khagans consented to the use of the Khagan Contract as a stalking horse bid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the Khagans became aware of Debtor's attempt to auction the Condominium Unit and use the Khagan Contract as a stalking horse bid, the Khagans filed an objection to the proposed auction. (\"Opposition to Auction Sale,\" ECF Doc. # 157-2.) The Khagans stated that they never consented to subject the Khagan Contract to higher or better bids at a bankruptcy auction. (Opposition to Auction Sale \u00b6 4.) In addition, the Khagans demanded the termination of the Khagan Contract and the return of their $ 191,800 down payment because the Debtor breached the Khagan Contract by failing to close the sale of the Condominium Unit by December 22, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.) The Court sustained the Khagans' objection and determined that: (i) the Debtor had no right to use the Khagan Contract as a stalking horse bid without Khagans' consent; (ii) the Debtor breached the Khagan Contract by failing to close on December 22, 2017; and (iii) the Debtor was to return the $ 191,800 down payment to the Khagans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"February 6, 2018 Order,\" ECF Doc. # 43.) The February 6, 2018 Order terminated the Khagan Contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 2, 2018, the Debtor filed a motion to dismiss his bankruptcy case. (\"Debtor's Motion to Dismiss,\" ECF Doc. # 54.) On March 8, 2018, Compass filed a motion to convert the Debtor's chapter 11 case to a case under chapter 7. (\"Compass' Motion to Convert,\" ECF Doc. # 58.) On March 28, 2018, the Court granted Compass' motion and the Debtor's chapter 11 case was converted to case under chapter 7. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"March 28, 2018 Order,\" ECF Doc. # 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Compass filed its claim for brokerage commission in the amount of $ 83,960. Because Compass agreed to reduce its commission to 3% of the sale price, the actual amount of Compass' claim is $ 57,540 (\"Claim\"). The Trustee's negotiation with Compass resulted in the Stipulation whereby Compass agreed to further reduce the Claim from $ 57,540 to $ 40,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulation.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Settlements and compromises are favored in bankruptcy as they minimize costly litigation and further parties' interests in expediting the administration of the bankruptcy estate.\n   <em>\n    Myers v.

Instead, the trustee is given a substantial degree of discretion in deciding how best to administer the estate committed to his care and his actions are measured by a business judgment standard.\" (internal citations omitted)). Moreover, courts \"will not entertain objections to the trustee's management of the debtor's estate where the trustee's conduct involves [her] good faith business judgment, is made on a reasonable basis, and is within the scope of the trustee's authority under the Code.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Belmonte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338137\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/524/17/#p29\">\n    524 B.R. 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 29 (Bankr.

E.D.N.Y. 2010) ). Here, the Debtor's Motion amounts to an objection to the Trustee's management of the estate. Because the Trustee enjoys a substantial degree of discretion and her negotiation with Compass resulted in a reduction of the Claim, the Court has little reason to second-guess the Trustee's good faith business judgment that the Stipulation is reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Settlements are Favored in Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Stipulation clearly falls within the range of reasonableness detailed in\n   <em>\n    Iridium\n   </em>\n   . First, the Stipulation provides immediate benefits to the estate as it reduces the Claim and allows the Trustee to expeditiously complete her administration of the estate. On the other hand, as explained below, the Claim is strongly supported by case law. Thus, litigation is unlikely to bring a net benefit to the estate. Second, continued litigation would undoubtedly incur additional administrative expense and reduce distributions to the two remaining general unsecured creditors. Moreover, continued litigation would diminish any surplus that the Debtor may have. Third, at the final stage of a chapter 7 case, the Stipulation promotes the paramount interests of the creditors in receiving prompt distributions from the estate without incurring further litigation expenses that would diminish the estate. Fourth, major constituencies, such as the Trustee and Compass, support the Stipulation. Lastly, the Court has no reason to doubt that the Stipulation\n   resulted from arm's length negotiation between the Trustee and Compass. Hence, the Court concludes that the Stipulation is fair and equitable and in the best interest of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Debtor Has Standing but His Motion Lacks Merit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Debtor likely has standing to challenge Compass' claim. Section 502(a) provides that \"a claim or interest, proof of which is filed under section 501 of this title ... is deemed allowed, unless a party in interest ... objects.\" The Bankruptcy Code does not define the term \"party in interest.\" In the Second Circuit, a chapter 7 debtor becomes a party in interest with standing to object to a claim \"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   if there could be a surplus after all creditors' claims are paid.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Magnesium Corp. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511654\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/583/637/\">\n    583 B.R. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

(\"Fee Application,\" ECF Doc. # 153, at 1-2.) Administrative expenses include (i) $ 39,119.50 in professional fees and expenses of the Trustee; (ii) $ 99,475 in professional fees of the auctioneer; (iii) $ 975 in fees owed to the Office of the United States Trustee; and (iv) $ 27,113.57 in professional fees of Pick &amp; Zabicki as Debtor's chapter 11 counsel. Administrative expenses total $166,683.07. After deducting administrative expenses from the cash on hand, the estate has $ 107,852.12 available for distribution to unsecured creditors. A surplus would exist even if the Compass' $ 57,540 Claim was paid in full; there would be a surplus of $ 25,153.76 after satisfying the only remaining unsecured claim filed by 515 East 72nd Condominium in the amount of $ 25,158.36. Therefore, the Court concludes that the Debtor is a party in interest with standing to challenge the Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A proof of claim is\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of the validity and amount of a claim, and the objector bears the initial burden of persuasion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED.

The Debtor, as the objector to the Claim, bears the initial burden of persuasion. The Debtor fails to sustain this burden. The Debtor argues that Compass is not entitled to any commission because it was not the procuring cause of the 363 sale and the transaction\n   with the Khagans never closed. (Debtor's Motion \u00b6 9.) This argument is unpersuasive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [i]t is a well-settled rule in this State that in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, a real estate broker will be deemed to have earned his commission when he produces a buyer who is ready, willing and able to purchase at the terms set by the seller.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Lane-The Real Estate Department Store, Inc. v.

Here, as reflected in the Khagan Contract, Compass produced the Khagans-a buyer who was ready, willing and able to purchase the property on the terms set in the Khagan Contract. \"The broker's ultimate right to compensation has never been held to be dependent upon the performance of the realty contract or the receipt by the seller of the selling price unless the brokerage agreement with the vendor specifically so conditioned payment.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawlet Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2298878\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/28/36/#p42\">\n    28 N.Y. 2d at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20N.Y.S.2d%20836\">\n    319 N.Y.S.2d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=268%20N.E.2d%20635\">\n    268 N.E.2d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Brokerage Agreement states that Compass is entitled to be paid commission when the property is sold and that the commission is due and payable at closing.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   If the Premises is sold during the Term, whether to a purchaser or to the Board that has exercised its right of first refusal during the Term or afterward (such purchaser or the Board, as applicable, the \"\n   <em>\n    Buyer\n   </em>\n   \"), you shall pay Broker a commission of four percent (4.00%) of the total sale price of the Premises. In the event that another licensed real estate broker is involved in this transaction on behalf of the Buyer, Broker shall split the commission with such cooperating broker pursuant to a separate agreement and in no event shall the commission paid by you exceed the amount set forth above.

Compass' argument is that its right to its commission accrued at the time the Khagan Contract was executed, with the commission then due and payable at the closing of the sale. Importantly, the Brokerage Agreement does not include any language conditioning Compass' commission on the consummation of the sale to the Khagans. Thus, Compass may well have been entitled to its commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. v.
