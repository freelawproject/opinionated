Berger, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In December 2017, debtors/defendants James and Stacy Holmes each borrowed $ 500 from creditor/plaintiff Ameribest Payday Loans. Each loan charged $ 75 in interest over a two-week term. Two weeks later, and periodically thereafter until they filed for bankruptcy, each debtor paid $ 575 to Ameribest and borrowed $ 500 more on the same terms as the previous loan. The last of these transactions occurred on March 24, 2018. As of that date, Debtors had paid a total of $ 1,125 in interest to Ameribest. Debtors filed their\n   joint Chapter 13 petition three days later, scheduling Ameribest as a creditor with an undisputed, unsecured, $ 1,150 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is an adversary proceeding brought by Ameribest to determine the dischargeability of the March 24, 2018, loans under \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and (a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ameribest has moved for summary judgment. For the reasons stated below, Ameribest's motion will be denied. Furthermore, given the facts of this case, Ameribest will be ordered to show cause why this Court should not (1) enter summary judgment in Debtors' favor and (2) award costs and attorney fees to Debtors under \u00a7 523(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

However, even assuming that taking out a payday loan can, standing alone, constitute a \"representation\" for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), Debtors have submitted sworn affidavits in which they state that, during the March 24, 2018 transactions, they each \"had every intention of paying the loan back in full.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because these statements create a genuine dispute of material fact as to Debtors' intent to repay the loans (i.e., Debtors' intent to deceive Ameribest),\n   Ameribest's motion for summary judgment under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   More importantly, the record contains no evidence that the transactions at issue caused Ameribest to sustain a loss. Debtors paid $ 1,150 to Ameribest at the same time they borrowed $ 1,000. The net amount owed to Ameribest-$ 1,150-stayed the same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, because the March 24, 2018, transactions included two $ 75 interest payments to Ameribest, Ameribest is $ 150\n   <em>\n    better off\n   </em>\n   than it would have been had Debtors not engaged in those transactions before filing for bankruptcy three days later.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having apparently sustained no loss, Ameribest cannot meet its burden of proof under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). Thus, it appears to this Court that\n   <em>\n    Debtors\n   </em>\n   are entitled to summary judgment under that subsection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As to the rest of Ameribest's complaint, the Court is...puzzled. The Court has previously explained to Ameribest's attorney-in a published case, no less-that \u00a7 523(a)(6) does not except debts from a non-hardship Chapter 13 discharge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Ameribest's remaining \"causes of action\" serve only to reiterate that Debtors owe Ameribest $ 1,150-the same amount that Debtors listed as undisputed on their Schedule E/F. In short, the Court can identify no reason why it should not enter summary judgment in favor of Debtors as to Ameribest's entire complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Ameribest's motion for summary judgment is hereby denied. Ameribest is further ordered to show cause, within 30 days of the date of this order, why this Court should not (1) enter summary judgment in Debtors' favor\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) award costs and attorney fees to Debtors under \u00a7 523(d). Debtors may, but are not directed to, file a reply within 20 days of Ameribest's response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    All statutory references in this order are to Title 11, United States Code (\"Bankruptcy Code\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Although there are exceptions to this principle of statutory interpretation,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , 4 Richard Levin &amp; Henry J. Sommer,\n    <em>\n     Collier on Bankruptcy\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 523.05 (16th ed. 2019) (discussing \u00a7 523(a)(5) and the \"congressional policy that favors enforcement of obligations for spousal and child support\"), those exceptions do not apply to the present case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Affidavit of James Robert Holmes \u00b6 4, ECF 22-1; Affidavit of Stacy Ann Holmes \u00b6 4, ECF 22-2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Under Kansas law governing payday loans, \"[a]ny loan made under this section shall not be repaid by proceeds of another loan made under this section by the same lender or related interest.\" Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 16a-2-404(6). To avoid running afoul of this provision that forbids loan rollover, Kansas payday lenders and borrowers engage in a kind of fiction: rather than following a new loan with repayment, the parties follow repayment with a new loan. The first set of transactions is an impermissible rollover of the old loan; the second, apparently permissible, although the net effect on the borrower's financial obligation is precisely the same either way.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    As a result of the December 2017 loans, Debtors owed Ameribest $ 1,150. Had Debtors engaged in no other business with Ameribest before filing for bankruptcy, Ameribest would have an unsecured claim for $ 1,150 (plus the contract rate of 3% interest per month from loan maturity through the petition date) and, presumably, that would be that. Instead, between December 2017 and March 24, 2018, each debtor periodically returned to Ameribest to engage in a repayment-followed-by-new-loan transaction, the net effect of which was a $ 75 interest payment to Ameribest. While Ameribest still has an unsecured claim for $ 1,150, Ameribest is better off-\n    <em>\n     by a total of $ 1,125 in interest payments\n    </em>\n    -than it would have been had Debtors simply borrowed money three months before filing for bankruptcy. By arguing that the March 24, 2018, transactions render Debtors' loans nondischargeable because they occurred three days before the filing of the bankruptcy petition, Ameribest is essentially arguing that regular interest payments from an honest debtor can render a payday loan nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). This Court categorically refuses to accept that position.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Hodges\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091666\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/407/415/\">\n     407 B.R. 415\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 418-19 &amp; n.6 (Bankr.
