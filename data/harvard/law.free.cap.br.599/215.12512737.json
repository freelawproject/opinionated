At its core, the instant appeal concerns the harmonization of two seemingly contradictory judicial findings:\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   , a finding by United States Bankruptcy Judge Stuart M. Bernstein in 2008 that Debtor Ridgemour Meyer Properties, LLC (\"Debtor,\" \"Ridgemour,\" or \"RMP\") had engaged in deceptive conduct with its attorneys, Goetz Fitzpatrick LLP (\"GF\"), which finding was instrumental to\n   the dismissal of a later state-court malpractice action brought by RMP against GF; and\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , Judge Bernstein's more recent opinion that GF was entitled to recover most, though not all, of the attorneys' fees it had billed to RMP. RMP protests that the same\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   defense that brought about the demise of its malpractice lawsuit against GF compels the denial of GF's claim for fees. GF responds that Judge Bernstein was correct in determining that the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   did not bar recovery for the entirety of the fees billed, but only for that portion that was incurred after GF was found to have engaged in joint misconduct with RMP. For the reasons set forth in the remainder of this Opinion, the Court affirms the decision of Judge Bernstein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties and the Joint Venture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties are largely in agreement concerning the underlying real estate transaction. The Court therefore adopts Judge Bernstein's summary so that it may focus greater attention on the procedural history that ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Ridgemour is a New York limited liability company whose members are owned and controlled by William Meyer (\"Meyer\") and A.J. Rotonde (\"Rotonde\"). In 2003, Ridgemour and Ginsburg Development Companies, LLC (\"GDC\") formed a joint venture, known as Pinnacle-Westchester LLC (\"Pinnacle\"), to develop and erect a high rise building in White Plains, New York. Ridgemour contributed a parcel of real property known as the \"Primary Lot\" which was subject to a mortgage in the approximate amount of $ 3,386,000 held by Merida Associates, Inc. (\"Merida\") and contract rights to purchase two other lots. Ridgemour subsequently sold another lot (the \"Jomas Lot\") to Pinnacle. Unless otherwise indicated, Property refers\n   to all of the Pinnacle real property that originated with Ridgemour.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   By 2006, if not sooner, Ridgemour and GDC became deadlocked over the future of Pinnacle. Ridgemour still hoped to develop the project while GDC sought to dissolve the joint venture. On November 22, 2006, GDC commenced an arbitration against Ridgemour, Meyer and Rotonde (the \"Arbitration\"). Ridgemour originally hired a different firm to represent its interests, but eventually retained GF. Donald Carbone, Esq., a GF partner, was in charge of the legal work performed by GF on behalf of Ridgemour.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202305765\">\n    2018 WL 2305765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Arbitration and the Misconduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On or about November 22, 2006, GDC commenced an arbitration in accordance with the Pinnacle Operating Agreement against RMP, Meyer, and Rotonde. Proceedings were conducted before Arbitrator Thomas Scarola (the \"Arbitrator\"). On June 18, 2008, after several days of evidentiary hearings, the Arbitrator sent an email to the parties (the \"June 18 Email\"), which, among other things, offered the Arbitrator's conclusion that Pinnacle should be dissolved:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [The June 18 Email] stated, among other things: RMP incurred damages due to GDC's management of Pinnacle; control of the Property should be returned to RMP to allow for its development; and the parties should be prepared to discuss the methods of dissolving Pinnacle. The email also stated that the foregoing would not preclude assigning a value to the Property contributed by RMP and compensating GDC for its investment, with such issues to be determined after hearing the parties' damage claims and defenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205574533\">\n    2013 WL 5574533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202305765\">\n    2018 WL 2305765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (\"Ridgemour was 'elated' and 'delighted' with the Arbitrator's ruling directing return of the Property back to Ridgemour.\" (citing exhibits) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties met with the Arbitrator the next day, June 19, 2008, during which time they discussed the transfer of control of the Property back to RMP, and the concomitant protection of GDC's rights through a mortgage and note.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205574533\">\n    2013 WL 5574533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ;\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour I,\n   </em>\n   413 B.R. at 104-05. That afternoon, the parties advised the Arbitrator of an agreement in principle on the remaining issues. They then set out to draft the settlement documents, which included draft deeds that reconveyed the property from Pinnacle to RMP, as well as a mortgage, a note, and an indemnity agreement in favor of GDC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here began the mischief that has prompted so much litigation. The parties reached an impasse concerning the settlement documents, and while certain documents (such as the deeds reconveying the Property back to RMP) had been deemed acceptable to both sides, the parties contemplated that all documents would be executed simultaneously at the time of the closing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour I,\n   </em>\n   413 B.R. at 105 (\"The transmittal email advised Carbone that the documents were being sent prior\n   to GDC's review to expedite the matter, and '[a]ccordingly, the documents remain subject to our client's further review, comment and approval.' \" (record citation omitted) ). In clear derogation of this understanding, on or about June 30, 2008, A.J. Rotonde of RMP signed the deeds and delivered them to a real estate attorney, Carol Dall, for recordation. Dall retained the documents in her possession for several weeks, before delivering them to the Westchester County Clerk on July 21, 2008, who then recorded the deeds on July 29, 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 107 ;\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202305765\">\n    2018 WL 2305765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Unaware of Rotonde's conduct - and, more broadly, of the deception being perpetrated by RMP and, later, RMP's counsel - the Arbitrator issued an interim award (the \"Interim Award\") dated July 9, 2008:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The Interim Award provided, in pertinent part, that [i] Pinnacle would be dissolved, [ii] ownership of the Property would be transferred from Pinnacle to the debtor [RMP], [iii] the debtor would execute a note and mortgage in GDC's favor in the sum of $ 14.629 million to secure the repayment of monies that GDC had invested or expended on behalf of Pinnacle, [iv] the amount of the note and mortgage could increase or decrease based on the disposition of the debtor's damage claims, and [v] the debtor would indemnify Pinnacle, GDC and Ginsburg from any liability arising from its efforts to develop the Property after the date of the transfer or arising from the debtor's actions prior to the date of the transfer.

However, drafting difficulties still plagued the parties throughout June and July 2008, prompting them to seek assistance from the Arbitrator several times to resolve their disputes. During all of these communications, GF attorney Donald Carbone failed to advise GDC or the Arbitrator that the deeds had been executed and transferred to RMP's real estate counsel for recordation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour I,\n   </em>\n   413 B.R. at 105-06 (discussing June 28, 2008 email from Arbitrator to parties discussing issues of ownership and control of the Property);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 106 (discussing July 3, 2008 email from Carbone complaining that GDC was attempting \"to delay the transfer of the property to RMP\");\n   <em>\n    see generally id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Both sides viewed the conveyance of the Property as something that had not yet occurred, and depended on the delivery of the mortgages and other documents.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 31, 2008, two days after the recordation, counsel for GDC learned that Rotonde and RMP had recorded the deeds, thereby reconveying the property back to RMP without any corresponding protections for GDC. Counsel for GDC immediately advised the Arbitrator, prompting Carbone to proffer the not-at-all-convincing response that such conduct was entirely in accord with the parties' jointly-held understanding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour I,\n   </em>\n   413 B.R. at 107. The Arbitrator dismissed Carbone's efforts at placation, and instead imposed the following deadlines: \"After resolving the disputed mortgage and other terms, the [A]rbitrator directed GDC to modify the documents by August 6th, and gave [RMP] until August 12th to return the signed documents and produce a letter of credit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Bankruptcy Petition and the Appointment of a Trustee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   RMP did not abide by the Arbitrator's deadline, but instead filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code late in the evening of August 11, 2008. (Bankr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dkt. # 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 25, 2008, GDC filed a motion to dismiss RMP's petition or to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee (Bankr. Dkt. # 8), and the following day it filed a motion for sanctions against RMP and GF (Bankr. Dkt. # 13-14). Judge Bernstein held a hearing on these and other matters on September 23, 2008. (Bankr. Dkt. # 36 (transcript) ). Thereafter, RMP changed counsel, and new counsel offered to dismiss the petition and reconvey the property back to Pinnacle. (Bankr. Dkt. # 37-41). GDC refused the offer unless its attorneys' fees were reimbursed by RMP, and modified its motion to seek only the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee. (Bankr. Dkt. # 44).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Judge Bernstein refused RMP's request to dismiss the petition, and held an additional two days of hearings on GDC's motion for a trustee. (Bankr. Dkt. # 54-55 (transcripts of hearings on October 14 and 27, 2008) ). On November 12, 2008, the Bankruptcy Court granted GDC's modified motion, finding that, \"GDC demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the debtor, its principals and its attorneys acted dishonestly when they secretly transferred the Property from Pinnacle to the debtor, and then hid what they had done from GDC and the arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour I,\n   </em>\n   413 B.R. at 108 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 112 (summarizing deceptive conduct).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As suggested by the above-quoted language, Judge Bernstein examined both the conveyance and the cover-up. As to the former, he found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 \"Rotonde and Carbone knew that nothing that occurred on June 18th or June 19th authorized Rotonde to sign the deeds on behalf of Pinnacle and record them for the benefit of the debtor.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 \"Carbone's contrary testimony [to the Bankruptcy Court] was incredible,\" inasmuch as it was negated by his contemporaneous communications with GDC and the Arbitrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 \"Recognizing the limits of the [June 18] Email and the June 19th hearing, the debtor's professionals hatched a scheme - they would rely on an ambiguous award, then under negotiation but not yet signed, to justify the transfer of the Property.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 \"Carbone testified, with some self-satisfaction, that he purposely drafted the Interim Award not to expressly require the simultaneous execution of the documents.\" However, the Bankruptcy Court found, his \"maneuver was ineffective to memorialize rulings that Carbone knew the arbitrator never made.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour I,\n   </em>\n   413 B.R. at 109-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Judge Bernstein found the \"more troublesome aspect of this case\" to be \"the secrecy and lack of candor shown by the debtor and its professionals.\"\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour I,\n   </em>\n   413 B.R. at 110. Not only did Rotonde - ostensibly a fiduciary of RMP - and his attorneys prepare to file and then file the deeds without telling GDC, but they \"created the opposite impression\" in their communications with the Arbitrator and GDC's counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 111 (\"The circumstances suggest that the debtor\n   was not as confident about its interpretation of the Interim Award as it was at trial, and acted out of concern that the arbitrator might change his ruling or impose new requirements during the conference call. In any event, the debtor never satisfactorily explained the delay in recordation in light of the supposed urgency.\"). Worse yet, once their deceit was revealed, RMP and its counsel pretended to comply with arbitral deadlines while preparing the Chapter 11 petition. Given Rotonde's misconduct - which occurred in spite of his fiduciary obligations to Pinnacle and GDC - Judge Bernstein found that appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee was warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 112-15. (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Dkt. # 57 (order granting application to appoint trustee) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After Kenneth P. Silverman was appointed as Trustee, GDC initiated several adversary proceedings, including proceedings against RMP and a related entity, Merida Associates, Inc. (\"Merida\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Dkt. # 59, 62;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Dkt. # 94, 104 (transfer of cases from District Court to Bankruptcy Court) ). On December 10, 2008, Judge Bernstein denied GDC's motion for sanctions. (Bankr. Dkt. # 71).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ultimately, on October 5, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed a plan proposed by Meyer, Rotonde, WPD Development Corporation (\"WPD\"), and W&amp;A Development, LLC (collectively, the \"Plan Proponents\"). In relevant part, the Plan provided that a class of unsecured creditors would receive 100% of the allowed amount of their claims plus post-petition interest at the annual rate of 2.22% until paid. (Bankr. Dkt. # 220, 246). Determination of certain unsecured claims, including the one filed by GF, was deferred to another day. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Dkt. # 259).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Westchester Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As noted, GDC had filed the Westchester Action in August 2008. Two months later, on October 29, 2008, GDC amended its complaint to include Carbone and GF as defendants. On November 10, 2008, the action was removed to this District,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ginsburg Dev. Cos., LLC v. Ridgemour Meyer Prop., LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 08 Civ. 9682 (BSJ), and on January 15, 2009, it was transferred to the Bankruptcy Court as an adversary proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Dkt. # 94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On September 24, 2009, as part of RMP's Plan, a settlement was entered into between and among GDC and its principal, the Trustee, Meyer, Rotonde, and others, pursuant to which GDC would receive $ 5.7 million in exchange for relinquishing all rights and interests to the Property. (Bankr. Dkt. # 239). In the settlement stipulation, the parties exchanged mutual releases of all claims asserted in the arbitration and related state court actions,\n   <em>\n    except that\n   </em>\n   GDC and its principal specifically did not release any claims they might have against GF and Carbone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). By minute entry dated November 13, 2009, the adversary proceeding was closed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Dkt., Entry of Nov. 13, 2009) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The matter was transferred back to Westchester County Supreme Court, where GDC continued to litigate against\n   GF and Carbone. The two defendants moved to dismiss; by order entered February 19, 2010, the trial court granted in part and denied in part their motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ginsburg Dev.

They similarly raised a claim for breach of contract, i.e., the retainer agreement, that was sourced to the State Court Defendants' \"legal representation of Plaintiffs, and inter alia, failures as set forth above in [GF's] dealings with the [Bankruptcy] Court, as more fully set forth in [\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour I\n   </em>\n   ].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Malpractice Action had repercussions for the Plan confirmation.

More particularly, the State Court Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability, while the State Court Defendants moved for summary judgment as to all claims. In connection with these motions, the State Court Defendants did not accept or concede the correctness of Judge Bernstein's findings, nor did they assume the mantle of wrongdoer in the Arbitration or the bankruptcy proceedings. Instead, they argued that accepting the Bankruptcy Court's findings as true meant accepting the Bankruptcy Court's enumeration of the State Court Plaintiffs' misconduct - and thus, to the extent the State Court Plaintiffs were relying on the Bankruptcy Court's findings, the misconduct found was misconduct in which Plaintiffs were\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 322 (referring to Rotonde as \"plotter in chief,\" and Dall as \"chief implementer\"), 326 (contending that the cover-up identified by the Bankruptcy Court was \"solely traceable to Rotonde\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Jud.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20487\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Jud.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20487\">\n    at 340-41, 1298-1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In an opinion dated September 30, 2013, and filed on October 7, 2013, the trial court granted the motion of the State Court Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See Ridgemour II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205574533\">\n    2013 WL 5574533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The State Court Plaintiffs sought summary judgment against their former attorneys on the issue of liability, citing Judge Bernstein's decision; the State Court Defendants agreed that collateral estoppel was appropriate, but argued that such estoppel would encompass as well Judge Bernstein's findings of misconduct on the part of two of the State Court Plaintiffs, RMP and Rotonde.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205574533\">\n    2013 WL 5574533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Quoting at length from the Bankruptcy Court's decision, the trial court agreed with the State Court Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Based on the foregoing, despite Plaintiffs' contention to the contrary, they (including RMP, RDC and Rotonde), as well as Defendants (who now reluctantly acknowledge wrongdoing on their part), were both found to have acted dishonestly in connection with the Property transfer and the subsequent coverup. These findings were the primary reason that resulted in the appointment of an independent trustee. As urged by Defendants, because Plaintiffs were parties in the Chapter 11 case and had a full and fair opportunity to argue their case, the findings and rulings against them by the\n   Bankruptcy Court must be given collateral estoppel effect. This court agrees.

At a hearing on July 13, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court discussed with the parties whether the\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   defense operated in a binary fashion (that is, as a full bar to any fees that GF had incurred in representing RMP) or whether GF could still recover for reasonable and necessary expenses that it performed before any wrongful conduct.

Before issuing his conclusions of law, Judge Bernstein summarized RMP's objections, several of which are repeated in this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   [RMP] contends that the entire claim should be denied in full based on\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   and collateral estoppel. It also maintains that [RMP] cannot be charged for the fees attributable to GF's representation of Meyer or computer legal research, GF's time entries are lumped or block-billed, a portion of its services were unreasonable or unnecessary, including Ellen August's time on the Arbitration and bankruptcy consultations on April 28, 29, 30, June 20, 26, July 17, August 4, 5 and 6, 2008.

Reviewing first RMP's broader argument that the trial court's dismissal of the Malpractice Action collaterally estopped GF from recovering on its claim, Judge Bernstein noted salient differences between the two litigations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   The state court did not review or rule on any of the services rendered by GF prior to late June 2008; those services were irrelevant to the Malpractice Action and its decision. The Malpractice Action asserted claims based on the filing of the deeds and the cover up. The parties did not litigate and the state court did not decide whether the services GF rendered in connection with the Arbitration prior to late June 2008 were dishonest or unreasonable or unnecessary, and collateral estoppel does not preclude the Court from deciding whether GF's fees, particularly those relating to services before the recordation of the deeds, were unreasonable or unnecessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Turning next to RMP's narrower argument that the decision granting summary judgment in the Malpractice Action precluded recovery by GF under a theory of\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   , the Bankruptcy Court was equally skeptical. The Court offered the preliminary observation that \"[t]he doctrine of\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   is more limited in contract disputes.\"\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202305765\">\n    2018 WL 2305765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (collecting cases). Then, echoing his tentative conclusions from the July 13 hearing, Judge Bernstein found that New York law \"denies 'awards for the corrupt performance of contracts even though in essence the contracts are not illegal' \" - so long as the corrupt performance \"[went] to the heart of the plaintiff's claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (first citation to\n   <em>\n    McConnell v.

Furthermore, GF had conceded that \"the issue of whether [GF] engaged in immoral conduct is\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n   \" (Bankr. Dkt. # 371). What remained, therefore, was for the Bankruptcy Court to \"[fix] the precise moment when the fee claim should be cut off based on GF's immoral acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. After reviewing the sequence of events surrounding the arbitration, and the contemporaneous communications between and among clients, counsel, and arbitrator, Judge Bernstein concluded that \"the failure to disclose the recordation of the deeds to the Arbitrator or GDC on July 22, 2008, and the affirmative efforts to keep it a secret until GDC discovered the transfers on its own call for the denial of all fees incurred after July 21, 2008.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   n.10 (\"Through July 21, 2008, GF's accrued unpaid fees and expenses relating to the Arbitration matter totaled $ 182,993.31.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court then considered GF's fees relating to the Merida litigation. Considering each of RMP's arguments seriatim, it found on the record before it that: (i) RMP had in fact retained GF to represent it in the litigation, despite the absence of a separate retention letter; (ii) there was no evidence to support a claim of fabricated bills, and thus no need for GF to produce a witness to explain billing for the Merida matter; (iii) in spite of Meyer's testimony to the contrary, which the Court found to be incredible, \"the services related to the Merida matter were performed for [RMP] or for the mutual benefit of Meyer and [RMP].\"\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202305765\">\n    2018 WL 2305765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the next 20 or so pages, the Bankruptcy Court analyzed the reasonableness of GF's fees and expenses. It rejected various claims of excessiveness advanced by RMP; in addition to picking apart the factual bases for each claim, the Court observed that RMP had paid several months' worth of GF invoices with neither a complaint of excessiveness nor a claim for credit or reservation of rights.\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202305765\">\n    2018 WL 2305765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202305765\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Moreover, many of their criticisms mischaracterize the time records by summarizing or omitting services, making it seem that the attorney did less work than the time entries reflect.\"). The Court also rejected an argument that an across-the-board reduction was warranted because GF often block-billed entries: \"Furthermore, while GF attorneys often block billed their time on any given day, the details of the services identified in the time entries, amplified by Carbone's and August's trial testimony, allow the Court to determine the precise task reflected in each time entry and make an overall assessment whether the aggregate time reflected\n   was reasonable given the nature of the work and the representation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *18.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   No party to this appeal protests the Bankruptcy Court's finding that both RMP and Carbone engaged in misconduct in connection with the Arbitration. RMP embraces that finding in the instant appeal, believing that it has preclusive effect on GF's present claim for attorneys' fees. Put\n   more colloquially, RMP believes that what was good for the goose in the state court (namely, the grant of summary judgment against it in the Malpractice Action) must, both by law and equity, be good for the gander in this Court (namely, the dismissal of GF's claim for legal fees). GF, for its part, had previously contested the Bankruptcy Court's findings, but now acknowledges that the finding of misconduct may not be relitigated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   What is more, no party to this appeal argues that GF's representation of RMP was tainted from the start, or that it was conceived with a mutual goal of deceiving GDC, the Arbitrator, or the Bankruptcy Court. To the contrary, all of the evidence in the case indicates - and all of the decisions issued thus far have concluded - that it was late in the representation, after the Arbitrator's decisions of June 18 and 28, 2008, that GF either colluded with, or aided and abetted, RMP in recording the deeds and in keeping that information from GDC and the Arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour I\n   </em>\n   , 413 B.R. at 108 (\"GDC demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the debtor, its principals and its attorneys acted dishonestly\n   <em>\n    when they secretly transferred the Property from Pinnacle to the debtor, and then hid what they had done from GDC and the arbitrator.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205574533\">\n    2013 WL 5574533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (\"Based on the foregoing, despite Plaintiffs' contention to the contrary, they (including RMP, RDC and Rotonde), as well as Defendants (who now reluctantly acknowledge wrongdoing on their part), were both found to have acted dishonestly\n   <em>\n    in connection with the Property transfer and the subsequent coverup.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   This attention to chronology is significant. Before the Bankruptcy Court, the parties focused on relative culpability, with GF maintaining (with considerable record support) that RMP was the first-in-time or principal wrongdoer. However, the Bankruptcy Court correctly identified the relevant issue as one of timing - that unless GF's misconduct went to the heart of the representation, it and Carbone would be entitled to fees incurred before its joint misconduct with RMP took place. This determination accords with New York law; it is not subject to preclusion or estoppel; and the date determined by the Bankruptcy Court as the date on which GF was\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   with RMP was not erroneous, much less clearly so. Conversely, RMP overstates the prior decisions of the Bankruptcy Court and New York State courts, as well as the prior positions of the parties. For all of these reasons, the Bankruptcy Court's order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In arriving at this conclusion, the Court does not focus on obvious factual distinctions with that case, such as the different nature of the contracts at issue, or the absence of commercial bribery in this case. Rather, the Court has considered (i) the \"direct[ness of the] connection between the illegal transaction and the obligation sued upon\" and (ii) the degree to which GF and Carbone \"resorted to gravely immoral and illegal conduct in accomplishing its performance\"\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2254133\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/7/465/#p470\">\n    7 N.Y.2d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=199%20N.Y.S.2d%20483\">\n    199 N.Y.S.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20N.E.2d%20494\">\n    166 N.E.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   What is unique about this case is that the contract at issue, the parties' retainer agreement, contemplated accretive conduct by GF over an extended period of time, rather than a single instance of conduct. As the record makes plain, at first GF discharged its contractual obligations properly, and only after receiving the Arbitrator's June 18 and 28 decisions - neither of which is alleged to be tainted by GF or RMP misconduct - did it jointly embark on a pattern of deception with RMP. What is equally unique, as this Court and the Bankruptcy Court have emphasized, is that the periods of GF\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   and GF\n   <em>\n    misconduct\n   </em>\n   under the retainer agreement can be disaggregated. As to the latter period, the connection is direct, the \"conduct in accomplishing its performance\" is egregious, and the agreement is acknowledged by all to be unenforceable. As to the former period, the connection is\n   not at all direct (inasmuch as the legal services for which GF now seeks fees are not directly or proximately connected to the later misconduct) and the legal services provided by GF were neither \"gravely immoral\" nor \"illegal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Finally, the Court does not perceive that allowing GF to recover its fees for the pre-misconduct period would violate the policy objectives identified by the New York Court of Appeals. As just noted, a substantial portion of the legal services provided by GF neither contemplated nor abetted the misconduct identified by the Bankruptcy Court. Moreover, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   is far closer analytically to RMP than GF. That is, there is no sense that GF engaged in any of the misconduct identified by the Bankruptcy Court for its own gain, but rather to advance the interests of its client RMP. And further unlike the\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   plaintiff, the fees sought by GF did not require the Bankruptcy Court to countenance \"collect[ion of] the rewards of corruption.\"\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2254133\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/7/465/#p470\">\n    7 N.Y.2d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=199%20N.Y.S.2d%20483\">\n    199 N.Y.S.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20N.E.2d%20494\">\n    166 N.E.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Accordingly, the Court agrees with the Bankruptcy Court's decision to analyze GF's claim using the\n   <em>\n    Hilgendorff\n   </em>\n   line of cases, pursuant to which the court considers the totality of the parties' relationship in assessing the length, as well as the severity, of the alleged joint misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The Court begins its preclusion analysis with three observations.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , there were certain claims of collateral estoppel, made by the parties in connection with GF's motion to reopen the bankruptcy case, that were not accepted by the Bankruptcy Court. For example, GF argued that summary judgment in the Malpractice Action meant that the Plan Proponents (which included RMP) were \"barred from further challenging the allowed amount of the GF Claim under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   \" - on the theory that RMP had had the opportunity to address, in the Malpractice Action, \"any alleged disputes regarding [GF's] entitlement to its legal fees.\" (Bankr. Dkt. # 302-1 at 7, 11). RMP responded that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   actually operated to preclude GF from reopening the bankruptcy case or persisting with its claim for fees, since GF could have counterclaimed regarding the viability and reasonableness of that claim in the state court. (Bankr. Dkt. # 306 at 3-5). The Bankruptcy Court rejected both sides' arguments in\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205395836\">\n    2016 WL 5395836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5. These arguments are not renewed on appeal, and this Court does not address them further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , RMP's principal argument to this Court for preclusion (and, as discussed later, for judicial estoppel) posits that the state court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour II\n   </em>\n   operated to foreclose RMP's claims of breach of contract arising from the retainer agreement. Acknowledging the failure of its state court efforts, RMP here seeks to make lemons into lemonade: It argues that when the state court granted the motion for summary judgment, it necessarily found that the retainer agreement with GF was invalid, thereby rendering it improper for the Bankruptcy Court to award fees based on that same agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , RMP Br. 8, 13 (\"In this matter the bankruptcy court awarded GF attorney fees pursuant to a retainer agreement\n   that was entirely rejected by the state court which, at the insistence of GF, applied the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   against RMP.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   RMP Reply 6).

At base, RMP argues that the Bankruptcy Court's earlier decision in a different procedural context, because it was adopted by a state court judge in a related but separate litigation, operated to restrict the Bankruptcy Court's authority - and, indeed, foreclosed the Bankruptcy Court from deciding GF's claim.

As noted, once the bankruptcy was reopened, the parties had argued that their respective adversaries were foreclosed even from raising a claim or a defense in that proceeding. Judge Bernstein correctly found that (i) the state court had not opined on the viability or reasonableness of GF's fees and expenses; (ii) GF had a permissive counterclaim for fees that it was not obligated to bring in state court; and (iii) determination of GF's claim was solely the province of the Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205395836\">\n    2016 WL 5395836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Further, in connection with the decision from which the instant appeal is taken, Judge Bernstein accurately identified the scope of the factual issues committed to the state court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   The state court did not review or rule on any of the services rendered by GF prior to late June 2008; those services were irrelevant to the Malpractice Action and its decision.

It is also true that the state court found both parties in the Malpractice Action to be \"wrongdoers,\" and thus\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205574533\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Significantly, however, the claims in the Malpractice Action were almost exclusively focused on the precise period of time in which Judge Bernstein had found the misconduct to have occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 225-27 (analyzing malpractice complaint). The state court made no effort comparable to Judge Bernstein's to distinguish periods of GF conduct and GF misconduct in the representation, nor was it required to. Before the state court, RMP proffered the non-starter argument that \"\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   only applies to cases involving outright criminal acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205574533\">\n    2013 WL 5574533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. RMP also sought support from the Westchester Action but, as the state court pointed out, the Westchester court had denied GF's motion for summary judgment on a claim of aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty, effectively finding the \"primary violator\" to be RMP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. Finally, RMP made a halfhearted advice of counsel defense, which the state court rejected as \"mitigated or discredited by their own exhibits they rely upon for support.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In sum, this Court agrees with the Bankruptcy Court's preclusion analysis. Issue preclusion applies to the Bankruptcy Court's finding that RMP and GF had acted dishonestly in causing the transfer of the Property and in misrepresenting or omitting the fact of that transfer in communications with GDC and the Arbitrator. However, neither issue nor claim preclusion barred Judge Bernstein from ascertaining whether that misconduct operated as a partial or a complete bar to GF's\n   recovery of legal fees, nor did it prevent him from determining the amount of fees to which GF was ultimately entitled under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Judicial Estoppel Does Not Bar GF's Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Relatedly, RMP contends that GF's statements to the Bankruptcy Court were inconsistent with statements made to the state court in the Malpractice Action and, more pointedly, that GF's espousal of\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   arguments to the state court foreclosed recovery on its claim in the Bankruptcy Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RMP Br. 12-13, 15-16; RMP Reply 5-6). Again, this Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Again, the Court begins by noting what it does not consider. The Court will not consider RMP's newly-minted claim that GF's successful summary judgment motion in the Malpractice Action estops it from now seeking any recovery based on the retainer agreement, since that argument has been waived. The Court will also not consider the collateral estoppel claims that each side made in connection with the reopening of the case, since\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour III\n   </em>\n   makes plain that neither side was successful in persuading the Bankruptcy Court to accept them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Court has compared the arguments made to the state court in the Malpractice Action and those made to the Bankruptcy Court after the case was reopened in 2016. Put simply, it sees no inconsistencies that amount to judicial estoppel. Before the state court, GF did not concede, but merely accepted for purposes of the cross-motions, the Bankruptcy Court's findings of misconduct, which GF correctly noted encompassed RMP misconduct as well. That is, GF accepted RMP's claims of misconduct and argued for dismissal of the Malpractice Action nonetheless on a theory that all of RMP's claims were subject to a defense of\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   ; GF did not\n   discuss the viability, or the amount, of its own claim for legal fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The conduct underlying the state court's decision in the Malpractice Action and that underlying GF's claim for fees are not co-extensive - not only because the conduct cited by the state court was more concentrated in time and scope, but because that very conduct was excluded by the Bankruptcy Court from its ultimate determination of GF's fees. Before the Bankruptcy Court, the parties focused more on their culpability relative to each other, and not on whether GF's representation could be divided into conduct for which the fees were recoverable under the Bankruptcy Code and misconduct for which the fees were not recoverable under the Code or the common law. As such, there is no basis to find judicial estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Clearly Err in Determining the Fees to Which GF Was Entitled\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Having addressed RMP's \"home run\" arguments, each of which sought wholesale denial of GF's claim, the Court now turns to RMP's \"singles\" argument, which focuses on whether Judge Bernstein correctly determined the amount of GF's claim. This argument, in turn, reduces to a challenge to the date the Bankruptcy Court found GF and Carbone to be acting\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   with Rotonde and RMP. Here, the standard of review is one of clear error. The Court finds no such error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   After carefully considering various permutations of the parties' claim-determination arguments - presented in motions to reopen the bankruptcy case, to disallow GF's claim, and to admit (or preclude) evidence about the legal fees incurred in connection with the claim - Judge Bernstein took four days of testimony on the issue, from witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the fees incurred and the services performed. He admitted and reviewed numerous exhibits that were contemporaneously prepared to substantiate the charges. He considered this evidence in light of undisputed legal standards regarding the assessment of attorneys' fees and expenses.\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202305765\">\n    2018 WL 2305765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   With respect to specific factual findings, the Bankruptcy Court began by determining the dates for which GF could properly recover fees. Most of the factual analysis of\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour IV\n   </em>\n   concerns this point, and after evaluating all of the evidence, the Bankruptcy Court found that \"the failure to disclose the recordation of the deeds to the Arbitrator or GDC on July 22, 2008, and the affirmative efforts to keep it a secret until GDC discovered the transfers on its own call for the denial of all fees incurred after July 21, 2008.\"\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202305765\">\n    2018 WL 2305765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10. Thereafter, the Court addressed specific challenges to GF's substantiation of its fees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Ridgemour has not challenged GF's billing rates (other than the fact that they were raised without express notice) and based on the Court's experience, they are certainly reasonable.... Furthermore, Ridgemour has not challenged the time entries as vague in the sense that it could not determine what services were provided.... Instead, Ridgemour contends that it is unreasonable to charge the Debtor for (1) Ellen August's attendance at the twelve arbitration days, (2) the bankruptcy consultations in April, June, July and August, 2008, and (3) the cost of the LEXIS and Westlaw computer time....In addition, Ridgemour argues that GF block-billed its time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Bernstein considered, and rejected, each of these challenges, and\n   concluded that GF's claim was allowed in the amount of $ 259,606.71.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   On appeal, RMP raises two challenges to the amount of fees: it disputes the date of July 21, 2008, as the date after which GF was no longer entitled to fees, and it disputes the inclusion of fees related to services provided by GF in connection with the Merida litigation. (RMP Br. 14-15, 17-18). Both challenges fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Judge Bernstein has been involved with these parties (with varying degrees of intensity, to be sure) since August 2008; he had near-contemporaneous involvement with the underlying facts and conducted two different evidentiary hearings regarding GF's conduct in the Arbitration. After evaluating the credibility of the witnesses and the available documentary evidence, Judge Bernstein concluded that July 21, 2008, was the relevant date. This Court agrees, and rather than summarize Judge Bernstein's findings, it presents them in full to evince the care that he took in arriving at his decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   Fixing a precise moment when the fee claim should be cut off based on GF's immoral acts is something that no court has had to determine until now. It requires consideration of all of the facts adduced at the trial on the Claim Objection. The state court referred to e-mails that Carbone received in late June discussing the filing of the deeds, but it was no secret that Ridgemour was anxious to file the deeds and proceed with the project. Furthermore, at least as of July 3, 2008, Carbone believed that the recordation of the deeds was tied to the completion of the mortgage documents. Carbone proposed to write to the Arbitrator on that day complaining that GDC was taking unreasonable positions regarding the mortgage documents in an attempt \"to delay the transfer of the property to [Ridgemour],\" GDC was \"hoping to have the transfer of the properties delayed,\" and \"[u]nder no circumstances should the conveyances of the properties be delayed until the conclusion of the damage hearing.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   The push to file the deeds without the mortgage in place revved up on July 16, 2008, a week after the issuance of the Interim Award. On July 16, 2008, Rotonde sent an email at 9:31 a.m. to Carbone and Robert Rattet, a bankruptcy lawyer, advising them that the deeds had been signed but had not been filed, and Ginsburg had created a \"deadlock\" regarding the mortgage and other documents and had asked the Arbitrator to intervene. Time entries on the following day indicate that Carbone participated in an inter-office conference, with a person identified as \"TF,\" \"Re Interim Order; transfer of deed,\" Carbone, Rotonde and Rattet spoke about \"the Interim Award, Deeds, etc.\", and Carbone, Rotonde and Meyer participated in a \"conference call ... re same.\" Carbone testified that he told Rotonde not to do anything with the deeds and wait until the deeds, mortgages and other documents could be exchanged simultaneously. He said that filing the deeds would just give fuel to GDC to ask the Arbitrator to reverse the prior rulings that had been favorable to Ridgemour. Rattet, on the other hand, was encouraging Rotonde to file the deeds despite Carbone's adamant opposition. Rotonde disputed Carbone's account, testifying that Carbone told him that the deeds could be recorded\n   as soon as the Interim Award was entered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   The draft deeds were in the possession of Carol Dall, Ridgemour's attorney. On July 21, 2008, she delivered the deeds for recordation, Rotonde advised Carbone of that fact in an email the same day and asked Carbone to \"call me at home if you can. I am at home.\" Carbone testified that he did not see Rotonde's email and first learned that the deeds had been delivered for recordation on July 22, 2008, after a conference call that day with the Arbitrator. However, Rotonde's email was sent at 8:41 a.m. on July 21, 2008, and Carbone's time records for July 21, 2008, included entries for \"conference call with AJ[Rotonde]/Carol [Dall] re: response to Scarola [the Arbitrator]; telephone conference with AB [apparently Aaron Boyajian, a GF real estate partner] re: same; further multiple telephone conferences with AJ re: same.\" While there were many issues to discuss, it is difficult to believe that the delivery of the deeds for recordation was never mentioned. Yet during the conference call the next day with the Arbitrator and GDC's attorneys, Carbone did not advise anyone that the deeds were about to be recorded or had been recorded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   In fact, other near contemporaneous evidence indicates efforts to cover it up. On July 25, 2008, Ellen August sent an email to Rotonde and Meyer, with a copy to Carbone, reminding them \"Merida should not be privy to anything that is happening now with regard to the transfer of the properties because we don't want Scott Wyner to relay any information to Brad Schwartz or Vuotto.\" Wyner represented Merida, Schwartz represented Pinnacle and Vuotto represented GDC. August was not involved with the transfer of the Property, and was pretty sure she wasn't the person who thought of sending the email. Carbone was her boss, it is not credible that she would have sent the email without Carbone's knowledge and blessing, and August declined to say that she had not discussed it with him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   Accordingly, I find that the failure to disclose the recordation of the deeds to the Arbitrator or GDC on July 22, 2008, and the affirmative efforts to keep it a secret until GDC discovered the transfers on its own call for the denial of all fees incurred after July 21, 2008. This conclusion is also consistent with Ridgemour's contention that GF did not do anything improper until July 21, 2008, when [Carbone] didn't tell anyone the deeds had been recorded and continued to negotiate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202305765\">\n    2018 WL 2305765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9-10. There is no error in the Bankruptcy Court's thorough evaluation of the evidence, and to the extent it differs from the state court's recitation of same, this Court aligns itself with the Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Finally, RMP mounts a cursory challenge to the Bankruptcy Court's allowance of fees for GF's work in the Merida litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RMP Br. 17-18). The challenge merits swift rejection. Judge Bernstein had abundant evidence to permit the conclusion that GF's work on Merida was within the scope of the retainer agreement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridgemour IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202305765\">\n    2018 WL 2305765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6, 11-12, and this Court will not disturb that finding. Conversely, this Court finds no evidence to support RMP's rumination that \"Merida as a separate billing was created to avoid the strictures of\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   which appeared for the first time after a hearing in which the bankruptcy court found Carbone and Rotonde to have acted together with dishonesty and deceit.\" (RMP Br. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the order of the Bankruptcy Court is affirmed; the GF claim is allowed in the amount of $ 259,606.71; and RMP is directed to pay that sum, plus post-petition interest, in accordance with the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate all pending motions, adjourn all remaining dates, and close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    The facts of the dispute are presented in greater detail in several opinions from related civil actions, and this Court refers to them using Judge Bernstein's citing conventions:\n    <em>\n     In re Ridgemour Meyer Props., LLC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4117856\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/413/101/\">\n     413 B.R. 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Bankr.
