Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issue before the Court is one of first impression: Is a 162 acre tract of real property to which record title has always been held by a limited liability company whose articles of organization have been canceled by the Oklahoma Secretary of State constitute \"property of the estate\" of the Chapter 13 debtor who is the sole member of the limited liability company? First State Bank of Duncan (the \"Bank\") which holds a first mortgage on the property, and who obtained a state court judgment in foreclosure, has moved to lift the automatic stay pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in order to complete the foreclosure proceedings by confirmation of the Sheriff's Sale of the property. The Bank is supported in the Motion by Dustin Hilliary (\"Buyer\") who purchased the subject property at Sheriff's Sale. Debtor opposes the Motion contending that the cancellation or extinction of the LLC makes the property part of her bankruptcy estate, and there is equity in the property above the Bank's mortgage which would inure to the benefit of her creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court for consideration are: (1) the Bank's\n   <em>\n    Motion for Relief From the Automatic Stay, For Abandonment of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Property\n   </em>\n   (the \"Motion\") [Doc. 30]; (2) the\n   <em>\n    Objection of Chapter 13 Trustee to Motion for Relief From Automatic Stay and For Abandonment\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 34]; (3) the Debtor's\n   <em>\n    Objection to Motion for Relief From the Automatic Stay and Order For Abandonment of Property\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41]; (4) the Buyer's\n   <em>\n    Reply in Support of Motion for Relief From the Automatic Stay, For Abandonment of Property\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 59]; (5) the\n   <em>\n    Debtor's Response to Dustin Hilliary's Reply in Support of Motion For Relief\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 60]; (6) the Buyer's\n   <em>\n    Additional Briefing in Support of Motion for Relief From The Automatic Stay, For Abandonment of Property\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 70]; (7) the\n   <em>\n    Bank's Brief in Support of Motion to Lift Stay\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 71]; and\n   <em>\n    Debtor's Supplemental Brief\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 72]. Additionally for consideration by the Court is the record of the January 15, 2019, evidentiary hearing at which time the Debtor and a representative of the Bank testified, the parties introduced evidence and counsel presented oral argument. The below constitutes the Courts Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pursuant to Fed.R.Bankr.P. 7052 and 9014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1. The I Am LLC (hereinafter the \"LLC\") filed its Articles of Organization of an Oklahoma Limited Liability Company with the Oklahoma Secretary of State on October 18, 2004. [Hilliary Ex. 4, pg. 2]\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The Secretary of State \"terminated\" the LLC's Articles on March 14, 2006, and \"canceled\" its right to do business on July 1, 2010. [Hilliary Ex. 4, pg. 1]. A Certificate of the Office of the Secretary of State of Oklahoma executed on January 7, 2019, reflects that \"\n   <em>\n    I Further Certify that THE I AM LLC, filed Cancelled in the Office of the Secretary of State on the 1st day of July, 2010, and is no longer an existing Domestic Limited Liability Company, according to our records to the date of this certificate.\n   </em>\n   \" [Debtor Ex.1]. The LLC had been canceled as of the time of the filing of Debtor's bankruptcy and has not been reinstated since.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2. On February 13, 2006, the LLC executed a Promissory Note in the amount of $ 300,000 in favor of the Bank. [Bank Ex. 3]. The Debtor (in her maiden name) signed the Promissory Note in her capacity as Manager of the LLC. At the same time, the Debtor executed a written personal Guaranty Agreement of the Promissory Note. [Bank Ex. 8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3. The Promissory Note was secured by a Real Estate Mortgage With Power of Sale executed on February 13, 2006, which was filed of record in the Office of the County Clerk of Comanche County on February 22, 2006, in Book 4935 at Page 156-157. [Bank Ex. 3]. The Promissory Note, Mortgage and Guaranty Agreement were extended several times, with the last\n   Promissory Note executed on March 13, 2015, in the principal amount of $ 238,792.85 with a maturity date of March 18, 2018. [Bank Ex. 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   4. The property was conveyed by Warranty Deed to the LLC on February 15, 2006, and was filed in the Office of the County Clerk of Comanche County on February 22, 2006, in book 4935 at page 155. [Bank Ex.1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   5. The LLC defaulted on the Promissory Note and Mortgage, and the Bank commenced foreclosure proceedings against the LLC and the Debtor as Guarantor. On July 10, 2018, the District Court of Comanche County, Oklahoma, entered its\n   <em>\n    Partial Journal Entry of Judgment,\n   </em>\n   entering an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   and an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   judgment against the defendant LLC only, in the amount of $ 228,948.08, with interest and costs accruing thereon. The Judgment further provided for the foreclosure of the Bank's mortgage on the property. [Bank Ex. 10; Hilliary Ex. 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   6. In the foreclosure proceeding, the Sheriff had the property appraised at $ 243,000.00. [Hilliary Ex. 2, pg. 4]. The Buyer purchased the property at Sheriff's Sale on September 5, 2018, for $ 265,000.00 as a credit on the judgment entered in favor of the Bank. [Hilliary Ex. 2, pg. 5; Bank Ex. 11]. Before the State Court could hear the Bank's Motion to Confirm Sale, on October 12, 2018, the Debtor filed her Chapter 13 voluntary petition for relief. [Doc.1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   7. The Debtor's Schedules listed the value of the property at \"Unknown\", although she indicates a realtor has recommended listing the property at $ 550,000.00. [Doc.14, pg. 6, \u00b6 1.4]. The Debtor testified at the evidentiary hearing that she had a real estate sales contract for the property for the purchase price of $ 405,000.00. [Debtor's Exhibit 5].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor's Amended Chapter 13 Plan proposes the sale of the property with the proceeds to pay the Bank in full at closing, with the remaining proceeds to be turned over to the Chapter 13 Trustee. [Doc. 62].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Issues Before the Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Motion for Relief from Stay encompasses the normal issues for such a motion, i.e. the Movant establishing the absence of equity in the property, and the Debtor establishing that the property is necessary for successful reorganization. That, however, is not the unique and initial question which has to be reached by the Court. That issue is whether the subject real property is \"property of the estate\" under \u00a7 541(a) so that the automatic stay attaches to it. That issue, in turn, is dependent upon whether the property is deemed owned by the LLC, whose certificate to do business was canceled by the Oklahoma Secretary of State in 2010, or whether such cancellation results in the property being owned by the LLC's sole member, Debtor Grooms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Debtor argues that the \"cancellation\" of the LLC's Articles terminated the existence of the LLC so that the subject property reverted to the Debtor and therefore constitutes \"property of the estate\" subject to the automatic stay. Conversely, the Bank and Hilliary argue that the \"cancellation\" of the LLC's Articles of\n   Organization only bars the LLC from the capacity to sue or be sued, that the only \"property of the estate\" is the Debtor's membership interest in the LLC, and that the property does not become an asset of the estate merely because of the action of the Secretary of State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Automatic Stay and Whether the Property is Property Of the Estate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 362(a)(3) provides with certain exceptions, that the filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as a stay of \"any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate\". Section 541(a)(1) defines \"property of the estate\" as \"all legal and equitable interest\n   <em>\n    of the debtor\n   </em>\n   in property as of the commencement of the case.\" (Emphasis added). It is clear that the automatic stay does not stay actions against property that is not property of the estate.\n   <em>\n    In re Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5756636\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/410/439/#p441\">\n    410 B.R. 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2009). It appears equally clear that the automatic stay protects the debtor, the debtor's property and property of the estate, but it does not protect non-debtor parties, including non-debtor insiders or their property. See\n   <em>\n    Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060954\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/491/27/#p35\">\n    491 B.R. 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35-36 (S.D. N.Y. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is well established that defining \"property of the [bankruptcy] estate\" under \u00a7 541(a) is a question of federal law, but the nature and extent of the debtor's interest in property as of the petition date, is determined by applicable state law.\n   <em>\n    Butner v.

Okla. 2010). As a general rule, a limited liability company is a legal entity distinct from its members, and the assets and liabilities of the limited liability company are separate from the assets and liabilities of its members. 18 O.S. \u00a7 2032 (\"A capital interest is personal property. A member has no interest in specific limited liability company property.\"). Rather than owning an interest in the assets of the limited liability company, a member holds a capital interest in the limited liability company. A member of a limited liability company \"has no right to demand and receive any distribution from a limited liability company in any form other than cash\" and cannot be \"compelled to accept ... a distribution of any asset in kind....\" 18 O.S. \u00a7 2028. In short, a member's bankruptcy estate has no interest in property of a limited liability company, and the estate's property interest is limited to the member's capital or distributional interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Once its articles become effective, the limited liability company becomes a separate legal entity, \"the existence of which as a separate legal entity\n   <em>\n    continues until cancellation of the limited liability company's articles of organization\n   </em>\n   and completion of its winding up, if any.\" 18 O.S. \u00a7 2004(B)(1) (emphasis added);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343696\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/556/489/#p494\">\n    556 B.R. at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under Oklahoma law, as well as under the laws of virtually every state, when a limited liability company or corporation is administratively dissolved, it is prohibited from carrying on any business other than that necessary to wind up its affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   There are several other sections of the LLC Act which must be considered in determining whether the LLC legally ceased to exist or whether it continued to constitute a separate legal entity as of the petition date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Title 18 O.S. \u00a7 2012.1 provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A. The articles of organization shall be canceled upon the dissolution and the completion of winding up of a limited liability company, or as provided in subsection B of this section, or upon the filing of a certificate of merger or consolidation if the limited liability company is not the surviving or resulting entity in a merger or consolidation....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   B. The articles of organization of a domestic limited liability company shall be deemed to be canceled if the domestic limited liability company fails to file the annual certificate and pay the annual fee provided in Section 2055.2 of this title or pay the registered agent fee to the Secretary of State due under Section 2055 of this title within three (3) years from the date the certificate or fee is due, the cancellation to be effective on the third anniversary of the due date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Title 18 O.S. \u00a7 2037 entitled \"Dissolution\" provides that a limited liability company is dissolved upon the earlier of: (1) The occurrence of the latest date on which the limited liability company is to dissolve set forth in the articles of organization; (2) The occurrence of events specified in writing in the operating agreement; (3) The written consent of all the members...; (4) At any time there are no members; provided, that the limited liability company is not dissolved and is not required to be wound up if...; and (5) Entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under Section 2038 of this title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Subsection B of \u00a7 2037 provides: \"A limited liability company\n   <em>\n    continues in existence\n   </em>\n   after dissolution, regardless of whether articles of dissolution are filed, but may carry on only activities necessary to wind up its business or affairs and liquidate its assets under Sections 2039 and 2040 of this title.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   There is nothing in the record indicating that any of the five (5) events under \u00a7 2037 giving rise to \"dissolution\" have occurred in the present case. What did occur was the \"cancellation\" of the LLC's Articles of Organization by the Secretary of State, apparently for failure to pay franchise taxes and fees. Does this \"cancellation\" action by the Secretary of State also constitute \"dissolution\" of the LLC? Debtor appears to argue that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Debtor cites 18 O.S. \u00a7 2004(B)(1) for the proposition that it \"provides that a limited liability company formed under this act is a separate legal entity, the existence of which is a separate legal entity continues until cancellation.\" [Doc 41, pg. 2-3]. Section 2004(B)(1), entitled \"Filing the Articles of Organization\" provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   When the articles of organization become effective, the proposed organization becomes a limited liability company under the name and subject to the purposes, conditions, and provisions stated in the articles. A limited liability company formed under the Oklahoma Limited Liability Company Act is a separate legal entity, the existence of which as a separate legal entity continues until\n   <em>\n    cancellation of the limited liability company's articles of organization and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    completion of its winding up, if any.\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   It appears to the Court that the emphasized language from \u00a7 2004(B)(1) provides that a limited liability company have continued legal existence until two events both occur i.e., (1) cancellation of the limited liability company's articles of organization\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (2) completion of its winding up-if any. It is clear from the record that there was no \"winding up\" of the LLC, however, Debtor argues that the \"cancellation\" of the Articles by itself was sufficient to end the LLC's legal existence. What does the case law say about \"cancellation\" versus \"dissolution\" and the legal existence of the LLC?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Debtor relies upon the case of\n   <em>\n    Holliman v. Midpoint Development, L.L.C.

Here, they argue, there has been no dissolution proceedings, only the act of \"cancellation\" by the Secretary of State. Debtor points out that the Court in\n   <em>\n    Midpoint\n   </em>\n   used the terms \"cancellation\" and \"dissolution\" interchangeably. Debtor appears to be correct in this evaluation, as\n   <em>\n    Midpoint\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8453546,3774063\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/466/1201/\">\n    466 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1204 states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   An Oklahoma L.L.C. comes into legal existence with the filing of executed articles of organization with the Office of the Secretary of State. 18 O.S. \u00a7 2004(A) and (B).

Although not explicitly stated, it is reasonable to conclude that an\n   <em>\n    L.L.C. ceases to exist when its articles of organization are cancelled.\n   </em>\n   We agree with the district court's conclusion that \"these two provisions, taken together, suggest that the legal existence of an Oklahoma limited liability company ceases to exist upon the effective date of articles of dissolution or a decree of judicial dissolution.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   None of the parties make reference to any cases addressing\n   <em>\n    Midpoint's\n   </em>\n   conflating \"cancellation\" and \"dissolution\".

There, the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals held that an LLC which was canceled by the Secretary of State before signing a contract did not have legal existence and thus personal liability was imposed upon the member executing the contract. In addressing the impact of\n   <em>\n    Midpoint\n   </em>\n   the court stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Under the Act, articles of organization are essential to LLC's formation and existence as a separate legal entity. 18 O.S. Supp.2004 \u00a7 2001 and \u00a7 2004. The Act provides for cancellation of the articles of organization in \u00a7 2012.1. Cancellation may occur either by the LLC filing notice of dissolution or by the LLC being deemed cancelled for failing to file the annual certificate or failing to pay the annual fee within three years of the due date. Section 2055.2, on which Winningham\n   relies, includes express language distinguishing a canceled LLC from one not in good standing. Winningham's argument on liability would be correct in the case of an LLC which has \"ceased to be in good standing\" under the Act.

N.D. Okla. 2016), Judge Michael was presented with the question of whether an LLC had standing to file an adversary proceeding at a time when its articles of organization as an Oklahoma limited liability company had been canceled. In granting summary judgment dismissing the bankruptcy, Judge Michael held that under Oklahoma law, cancellation of a creditor's articles of organization for failure to file its annual certificates and pay required fees meant that it had ceased to exist as a separate legal entity that could sue or be sued in the courts of Oklahoma. The Court stated at page 495 of its opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Several events can result in the articles of organization of an LLC being canceled. Relevant to this case, when an LLC has failed to file its annual certificate and pay the annual fee for three years from the due date, the articles of organization of the LLC \"shall be deemed to be canceled.\" Such cancellation is effective on the third anniversary of the due date.\n   <em>\n    The consequences of cancellation is that the LLC ceases to exist.\n   </em>\n   Once the articles of organization of an LLC have been canceled, it may apply for reinstatement in the same manner as if it were not in good standing, i.e., by filing an application along with the delinquent certificates and fees.\"(Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   the Debtor relied upon the\n   <em>\n    AT &amp; T Advertising\n   </em>\n   case in support of its position that the canceled creditor could not file the adversary.

However, the Court found one case from the State of Washington that holds that the assets of a canceled LLC do pass to the members. In\n   <em>\n    Sherron Associates Loan Fund V (Mars Hotel) LLC v. Saucier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001292\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/157/357/\">\n    157 Wash.App. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=237%20P.3d%20338\">\n    237 P.3d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363-64 (2010) the court stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   When a corporation ceases to exist, ownership of its assets passes to the shareholders once the creditors have been paid. (Citations omitted). A similar rule applies to partnerships. In the absence of a governing statute, partnership assets are owned by the partners once the creditors have been satisfied. (Citations omitted). We believe the rule for limited liability companies, a hybrid of partnerships and corporations, should be the same. In the absence of a governing statute, title to LLC-owned property passes to the owner of the canceled LLC subject to creditor claims\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Saucier argues that there is a governing statute, pointing out RCW 25.15.245(1), which states in part: \"A member has no interest in specific limited liability company property.\" We do not agree that provision is applicable to a canceled LLC. It merely states a general rule governing an ongoing LLC. Somewhat closer to being on point is RCW 25.15.300(1)(c), which requires assets to be distributed during dissolution in proportion to a member's distribution shares unless an agreement provides otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Neither of these provisions, nor any other, involves nondistributed assets. The original 1994 legislation appears to have anticipated that an LLC would go through the dissolution process and wind up its affairs by paying liabilities and distributing assets prior to cancelling its certificate of formation. However, (the LLC here) did not go through that process. There is no statute addressing a canceled LLC that was not first dissolved. Accordingly, the rule governing undistributed partnership and corporate assets also should apply to LLCs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Just as the assets and liabilities of a natural person pass to his or her estate upon death, we believe the assets and liabilities of a dead LLC passed to its owners. We find no authority that suggests assets die with the LLC. If the asset in question in this case had been the hotel rather than a judgment, we doubt that anyone would believe the hotel had become unowned merely because of the death of its owner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At the time of the evidentiary hearing of January 15, 2019, the Court advised the\n   parties of the\n   <em>\n    Sherron Associates\n   </em>\n   case quoted above and invited the submission of further briefs as to whether there was additional authority, either for or against, the proposition that cancellation of a limited liability company's articles of organization resulted in reversion of its assets to the limited liability company's members. No such case authority has been provided to the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Purchaser Hilliary attempts to strengthen its argument that the LLC continues to exist as a separate entity by considering a penumbra of Oklahoma statutes. In addition to the statutes the Court has discussed and quoted above, Hilliary points to the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   1. Title 18 O.S. \u00a7 2019(B). Section 2019 entitled \"Managers as Agents\" authorizes a member of the limited liability company to execute documents on behalf of the limited liability company, including documents providing for the acquisition, mortgage, or disposition of real or personal property. Section 2019 does not contain, as stated by Hilliary in its Brief [Doc. 70 pg. 3], any provision that makes the execution of such documents binding on the LLC notwithstanding \"the failure of the LLC to file its annual certificate of pay the annual fee\n   <em>\n    shall not\n   </em>\n   impair the validity of such deed.\" (Emphasis Hilliary's original.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   2. Title 18 O.S. \u00a7 2028(1). This Section entitled \"Form of Distribution-Asset in Kind\" provides that a member has no right to demand or receive any distribution from a limited liability company in any form other than cash. This Section is consistent with \u00a7 2032 which provides that a member's capital interest in a limited liability company is personal property, and a member has no interest in specific limited liability company property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   It is arguable that in single-member limited liability company, such as here, upon cancellation or dissolution the member need not be prohibited from taking the limited liability company's interests in kind. The problem with this argument is that upon dissolution and winding up (as opposed to cancellation by administrative action) distribution must first be made to the limited liability company's creditors before there would be any right for the asset to pass to the member. 18 O.S. \u00a7 2040(A)(1). To allow reversion of the asset to the member, as argued here by the Debtor, would appear to be inconsistent with the policy expressed by \u00a7 2040. This rationale was recognized by the Idaho bankruptcy court in\n   <em>\n    In re Aldape Telford Glazier, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5757610\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/410/60/\">\n    410 B.R. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Idaho 2009), in which the court was presented with the reverse of the situation here, i.e. there a corporate holding company d.b.a. a limited liability company that it owned sought to file bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court dismissed the case, holding that prior to the limited liability company's dissolution and winding up with distribution to its creditors including the limited liability company as an asset of the holding company constituted an impermissible \"joint petition\" with the corporate holding company. The Court noted as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   There is no provision in the Idaho Code indicating that upon dissolution, LLC property automatically reverts to the LLC members. To the contrary, (Idaho statutory citation omitted) provides that LLC property belongs to the LLC, not the individual members. A dissolution does not negate this provision or otherwise effect a transfer of LLC assets to the individual members. Rather, a dissolution triggers the winding-up process. Ultimately, members of dissolved LLC's acquire LLC property as their own if (and only if) assets are distributed to them upon the winding up, in accordance with the priority scheme laid out (in the statute). Consequently, this Court's\n   holding that LLC members cannot treat assets of a dissolved LLC as their own prior to such a distribution is inconsistent with the governing Idaho statutory provisions.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   410 B.R. at 65, n. 9 ;\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mid-American Elev.

D. Mass. 2011), the individual debtors claimed as exempt homestead property although the property was titled in the name of their limited liability company. Prior to bankruptcy the limited liability company had been administratively dissolved by the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The issue presented to the court was whether the real property titled in the name of the limited liability company was property of the estate. If it was not property of the estate, it could not be claimed as exempt. The court found that the administrative cancellation of the limited liability company's articles did not terminate the existence of the limited liability company or effectuate a transfer of the property to the debtors. The limited liability company continued to exist, and the debtors, as sole members and managers of the limited liability company, were charged with winding up its affairs, which they had not done. In finding that the limited liability company property was not property of the estate the, the court stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Given the existence of the bank account in the name of the LLC and a mortgage granted by the LLC to the (Bank), for which the Debtors may or may not be personally liable as guarantors, a mortgage which encumbers the Property, the Court finds that the Debtors' argument that the Property has reverted to them by operation of law, without the execution of a deed from the LLC to them, is without foundation in fact or in law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As recited above, and apparently agreed to by all the parties, there is no Oklahoma case law directly on point.

Nevertheless, it is a close call. In such circumstances should the court determine that there is no stay in effect there would be no recovery to any creditor other than the Bank. On the other hand, if the Debtor is given some time by way of imposition of the stay to complete the proposed sale of the property not only will the Bank be paid in full but there will also be a substantial dividend to the creditors. On February 14, 2019, the Debtor filed a Motion to Sell seeking court approval to sell the property for $ 405,000 pursuant to a Contract dated January 21, 2019, and without a stated termination date.

Unfortunately, the Debtor's testimony indicated she had little specific knowledge concerning details of the possible sale or an understanding of the obvious title issues. The recent filing of the Motion to Sell and its forthcoming hearing date gives the Court reason to be more optimistic that the sale is a realistic possibility, and affording the Debtor a relatively short period of time, at least until at or after the March 12\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing date, would be in the best interests of the creditors (including the Bank) and the bankruptcy estate.
