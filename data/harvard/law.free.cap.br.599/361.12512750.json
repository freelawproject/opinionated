(Doc. 18). The Plaintiff was present by counsel Steve Olen and Lucy Tufts and the Defendants were present by counsel Wanda Borges. The Court took the motion under advisement. The motion is now fully briefed (Docs. 26, 27). For the reasons set forth below, the motion to dismiss is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Timothy McCallan filed a petition in bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on November 18, 2016, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida, under Case No. 16-7524-CCJ. On March 30, 2017, this Court ordered Timothy McCallan's case transferred from the Middle District of Florida to this Court (Case No. 17-30961, Docs. 61, 62, 63). Plaintiff Carly Wilkins was appointed Trustee (Case No. 17-30961, Doc. 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 15, 2018, Wilkins filed a ten-count complaint against Robert J. SanFilippo, Island Vibes Tours Worldwide, LLC, and Island Punch Beverage, LLC. (Doc. 1). The first 7 counts seek to set\n   aside certain transfers as fraudulent conveyances under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 548, 550, and applicable state law. In Count 8, Wilkins seeks to set aside certain transfers as avoidable post-petition transfers pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20549\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 550. In Count 9, Wilkins alleges that the Defendants are holding property of the estate and seeks its turnover pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In Count 10, Wilkins seeks an accounting from the Defendants for all property of the estate held by them and all property transferred by McCallan, which the Trustee contends is property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant, Robert SanFilippo, is an individual who resides in New York. Defendants Island Vibes Tours Worldwide, LLC, and Island Punch Beverage, LLC, are limited liability companies controlled by SanFilippo.

Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court will divide its discussion of the issues here into three parts. In Part A, the Court will consider its subject-matter jurisdiction and its constitutional authority to decide enter a final order. In Part B, the Court will consider whether it has\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over the Defendants. In Part C, the Court will consider whether the complaint states a claim for which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1. History of Jurisdiction to Hear Bankruptcy Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before delving into bankruptcy jurisdiction and the nature of bankruptcy courts, it may be profitable to review some history. In Article I, Section 8, Clause 4 of the Constitution of the United States, Congress is given power \"to establish ... uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.\" Congress enacted several laws on the subject of bankruptcy in the Nineteenth Century, but it did not attempt to deal with bankruptcies in a comprehensive manner until it passed the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. The 1898 Act governed bankruptcies in the United States for the first three-quarters of the 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Century. While most commentators considered the 1898 Act to be a successful attempt to establish workable bankruptcy laws, over time it became necessary to modernize the bankruptcy laws. In 1978, Congress enacted the current Bankruptcy Code, which is now in effect-albeit with numerous amendments since then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   One of the improvements of the 1978 Code over the 1898 Act was the establishment of Bankruptcy Courts with broad jurisdiction to hear and determine bankruptcy cases and proceedings which were closely related. Prior to that time, Bankruptcy Judges could only decide matters which were in the Court's \"summary\" jurisdiction. \"Plenary\" matters could only be heard in district courts. It was though that the new jurisdictional scheme would streamline and modernize the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This state of affairs lasted only a few years, until the Supreme Court handed down\n   <em>\n    Northern Pipeline Construction Co., v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636621\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/50/\">\n    458 U.S. 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636621,6553077\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/102/2858/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636621\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/50/\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). Northern Pipeline, a debtor, had filed suit seeking money damages from Marathon\n   Pipeline for breach of contract. As any recovery from Marathon would fund an intended Chapter 11 Plan, the suit appeared to be well within the scope of the Bankruptcy Court's jurisdiction under the then extant jurisdictional grant. But that was not to be. The Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Marathon Pipe Line\n   </em>\n   that the jurisdictional grant to Bankruptcy Judges violated Article III of the Constitution. As Bankruptcy Judges are not appointed under Article III of the Constitution, they may not exercise \"the judicial Power of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    MarathonPipe Line,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636621\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/50/\">\n    458 U.S. 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636621,6553077\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/102/2858/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2865. In light of\n   <em>\n    Marathon\n   </em>\n   , Congress had to recast its grant of jurisdiction over bankruptcy proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Current Jurisdictional Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Marathon,\n   </em>\n   Congress enacted the present jurisdictional scheme. The Federal Court's jurisdiction over bankruptcy proceedings is defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   the district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This provision vests all bankruptcy jurisdiction in the district courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The leading case on subject matter jurisdiction in this Circuit is\n   <em>\n    Continental Nat'l Bank of Miami v. Sanchez (In re Toledo)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11592391,11636655\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/1340/\">\n    170 F.3d 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 1999). Subject matter jurisdiction over proceedings is divided into three categories: (1) arising under title 11; (2) arising in a case under title 11; or (3) related to cases under title 11.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11592391,11636655\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/1340/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11592391,11636655\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/1340/\">\n    at 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The first category, \"arising under title 11\" are those proceedings that \"invok[e] a substantive right created by the Bankruptcy Code.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11592391,11636655\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/1340/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11592391,11636655\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/1340/\">\n    at 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

The second category, \"arising in\" involves administrative matters which are \"matters that could arise only in bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1344. The third category, \"related to\" is defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The usual articulation of the test to determine whether a civil proceeding is related to bankruptcy is whether the outcome of the proceeding could conceivably have an effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy. The proceeding need not necessarily be against the debtor or the debtor's property. An action is related to bankruptcy if the outcome could alter the debtor's rights, liabilities, options, or freedom of action (either positively or negatively) and which in any way impacts upon the handling and administration of the bankrupt estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1345,\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Kemira, Inc. (In re Lemco Gypsum, Inc.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121634,10538709\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/784/\">\n    910 F.2d 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 788 (11th Cir. 1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Applying the Eleventh Circuit's jurisdictional test in\n   <em>\n    Toledo\n   </em>\n   to this case, it is apparent that the District Court has subject matter jurisdiction. Wilkins seeks to recover money and property which she alleges was fraudulently transferred from Timothy McCallan to the Defendants. This is a matter arising under title 11 as rights under Title 11 are invoked in the complaint. Wilkins seeks to set aside transfers pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 548, 549, 550, as well as turnover under \u00a7 542. Even if one were to argue that an action under \u00a7 544 requires a state law cause of action, and for that reason, cannot be considered just a right under title 11, the \"related to\" test is met because any recovery will augment the estate and thereby benefit creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The leading case from the Eleventh Circuit on fraudulent conveyances in bankruptcy courts is\n   <em>\n    Senior Transeastern Lenders v. Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (In re TOUSA, Inc.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3962504,3880461\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/1298/\">\n    680 F.3d 1298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2012). In\n   <em>\n    TOUSA\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit took a deep dive into the intricacies of a complex fraudulent conveyance case which began in Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida, was appealed to the District Court, and ultimately to the Eleventh Circuit. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that a Bankruptcy Court could set aside certain transactions as fraudulent under the Bankruptcy Code. For all the litigation involved, the Bankruptcy Court's subject matter jurisdiction to hear a fraudulent conveyance case was never questioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Similarly, the United States Supreme Court recently considered whether a Bankruptcy Court could, consistent with Article III of the Constitution, hear a fraudulent conveyance case.\n   <em>\n    Executive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%2025\">\n    573 U.S. 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073100\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2165/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20L.%20Ed.%202d%2083\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The issue there was whether a fraudulent conveyance case should be treated as a \"core\" or a \"non- core\" proceeding. The Court ultimately determined that it should be treated as non-core.\n   <em>\n    Executive Benefits\n   </em>\n   will be discussed in greater detail in Part II(A)(3) below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Granfinanciera v. Nordberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211254\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/33/\">\n    492 U.S. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6503163,6211254\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/109/2782/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211254\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/33/\">\n    106 L.Ed.2d 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), in support of their argument that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. (Doc. 18, pp. 4-5). The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Granfinanciera\n   </em>\n   held that a party who had not filed a proof of claim in bankruptcy court was entitled to a jury trial on a fraudulent conveyance suit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211254\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/33/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It says nothing about a bankruptcy court's subject-matter jurisdiction. The Defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Granfinanciera\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Bankruptcy Courts routinely hear fraudulent conveyance cases.

As a practical matter state lines cannot provide an accurate measure of the burdens that would be imposed on a defendant by requiring him to defend an action in a particular forum. There is nothing inherently burdensome about crossing a state line. Thus, determining whether litigation imposes an undue burden on a litigant cannot be determined by evaluating only a defendant's contacts with the forum state.

First, they all have minimum contacts with the United States. Second, they have made no showing of inconvenience which would rise to a constitutional level within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    BCCI.\n   </em>\n   The Defendants' argument, that\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction does not exist because of a lack of minimum contacts with the State of Alabama, is rejected because that is not the proper standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Complaint States a Claim for Which Relief May be Granted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Defendants move to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that it fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted. The Defendants argue two grounds in favor of their motion to dismiss. First, they contend that because the bulk of the transfers alleged in the complaint were made through various corporations, and not directly from Timothy McCallan, they are not fraudulent. Second, the Defendants contend that the Trustee's complaint is wholly dependant upon allegations made by Timothy McCallan and because the Court has held, on any number of occasions, that McCallan is not credible, that the complaint should fail. (Doc. 18, pp. 9-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"A complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

The difficulty with the Defendants' motion to dismiss is that they fail to accept, as true, the allegations contained in the complaint. The Trustee alleges transfers from McCallan to the Defendants were made for inadequate consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Defendants allege that none of the corporations named in the complaint, as transferors of funds or property to the Defendant, have anything to do with them. (Doc. 18, pp. 9-10). This is a mere denial of some of the allegations of the complaint. It is axiomatic that, for purposes of ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion that the Court accept as true, the facts alleged. The Trustee alleges that transfers from certain corporations are tantamount to transfers from McCallan himself. Indeed, a recurring theme throughout these proceedings is that McCallan acts through a number of\n   instrumentalities, corporations, and individuals. To be sure, the Trustee will be called upon to prove her allegations once this comes to trial. When considering a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true all of the well pleaded factual allegations of the complaint. Counts 1 to 7 adequately allege fraudulent conveyances. Count 8 alleges a voidable post-petition transfer. The Defendants make no argument that Count 8 is count is insufficient and the Court finds that the allegations are sufficient. Counts 9 and 10, seeking turnover (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) and an accounting, are in the nature of remedies rather than independent causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Defendants argue in their Reply memoranda that this Adversary Proceeding should be dismissed because some of the transfers alleged by the Trustee were beyond the statute of limitations. (Doc. 27, pp. 6-7). As that argument was not raised in the Defendants opening brief the Court will not consider it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This Court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear the complaint as these are either proceedings \"arising under title 11\" or \"related to\" proceedings under title 11. The claims alleged by the Trustee fall within the scope of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Court has jurisdiction over the person of each of the Defendants because they were served with process under Bankruptcy Rule 7004(d). This rule allows for nationwide service of process. It is undisputed that the Defendants have contact with the United States. Moreover, they make no credible argument of a constitutional basis upon which jurisdiction would fail. Their argument-that they lack sufficient minimum contacts with the State of Alabama-is without merit. The Defendants argument that the complaint fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted is without merit because they fail to assume the truth of facts alleged in the complaint. The Defendants may not \"wish away\" the Trustee's case and then proclaim victory. The Court will deny the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss by way of a separate order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Done this 8th day of March, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The Defendants have filed a number of documents in support of their argument that the corporations have been misnamed. (Doc. 27, Exhibits A-F). The proper way to solve this problem is to permit the Trustee to amend her complaint after she has had the opportunity to do discovery. Naturally, if a named defendant has nothing to do with the wrongdoing alleged by the Trustee, they can be dismissed later. The Court will not weigh the evidence at this phase of the proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
