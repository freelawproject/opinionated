The Fifth Circuit has stated that orders compelling arbitration are fact-driven and case-specific. Here, not only does this case reflect a two-party dispute over charges that represent a small percentage of the total assets of the administered estate, but the underlying bankruptcy case is already closed to begin with. That being said, it gives this Court great pause in considering sending matters derived exclusively from the Bankruptcy Code to arbitration. Nevertheless, in this particular case, the Court finds that compelling arbitration is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jose Trevino and Teresa Trevino (\"\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs or Debtors\n   </em>\n   \") filed their joint chapter 13 petition on August 25, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case was completed on September 8, 2015; Debtors received their discharge on July 21, 2016; and this Court entered a final decree on April 25, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After receiving their discharge, Plaintiffs filed the Adversary Proceeding against Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc.

Whether Plaintiffs' Motion to Reconsider is to be Considered Under FED. R. CIV. P. 54(b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   There is no specific provision for a motion to reconsider under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Fifth Circuit, a motion to reconsider may be brought under Rule 54(b) or Rule 59(e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whereas Rule 59(e) applies only to final judgments and does not permit consideration of arguments that could have been raised previously, Rule 54(b) applies to interlocutory judgments and permits a district court to reconsider and reverse its decision for any reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" Rule 54(b)'s approach to the interlocutory presentation of new arguments as the case evolves can be more flexible, reflecting the inherent power of the rendering district court to afford such relief from interlocutory judgments as justice requires.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Austin\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held that when a district court applies the more stringent Rule 59(e) standard in denying a motion to reconsider an interlocutory order, it must be vacated and remanded for the district court to reconsider the motion for reconsideration under the more flexible Rule 54(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   An order compelling arbitration is interlocutory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court was asked to reconsider the Order Compelling Arbitration, not asked to reconsider a final judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, this Court will only address the Motion to Reconsider under Rule 54(b), and not Rule 59(e), because if Plaintiffs' cannot meet the requirements of Rule 54(b), they will certainly not meet the more stringent requirements of Rule 59(e). Here, the Court finds no reason to reconsider its Order Compelling Arbitration. The Court, in its decision, went step-by-step in appraising the facts and the law. Within their Motion to Reconsider, Plaintiffs' cast heavy reliance on the recently\n   issued opinion by the Fifth Circuit,\n   <em>\n    In re Forby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   claiming that\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   establishes that the filing and prosecuting of a motion to dismiss is enough to constitute a waiver of a party's right to compel arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs further argue that Defendants waived their right to arbitrate in writing, and that because Plaintiffs' claims are primarily core claims, the Court should deny sending them to arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, none of Plaintiffs' new arguments convinces this Court to reconsider its analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether the Fifth Circuit's Holding in\n    <em>\n     Forby\n    </em>\n    Overrules Prior Circuit Precedent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Assuming arguendo that\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   is directly relevant to the issue of whether arbitration should be compelled,\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   still does not change this Court's conclusion. The Fifth Circuit has established that when there are conflicting precedents, the older rule is presumptively correct unless there is an intervening U.S. Supreme Court or en banc Fifth Circuit opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither is the case here. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   must be interpreted consistently with prior panel decisions. Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration suggests that\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   establishes a new\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule that a \"defendant invokes the judicial process and thus waives its right to arbitration by litigating and losing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss prior to seeking to compel arbitration.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   In essence, Plaintiffs argue that\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   circumvents older Fifth Circuit precedent that \"a bright-line rule is inappropriate for deciding whether a party has waived its right to arbitration.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   However,\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   was not decided en banc and there is no intervening U.S. Supreme Court case. Therefore, Forby does not overrule prior Fifth Circuit precedent, and Plaintiffs' argument that a party waives their right to arbitration by litigating and losing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss prior to seeking to compel arbitration is incorrect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Whether\n    <em>\n     Forby\n    </em>\n    changes this Court's Analysis in its Order Compelling Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   does not change this Court's analysis on whether Defendants' waived their right to arbitration. Although waiver of arbitration is a disfavored finding, the right to arbitrate-like all contractual rights-is subject to waiver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   A party may waive their right to arbitrate if they (1) substantially invoke the judicial process; and (2) cause detriment or prejudice to the other party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   The party claiming waiver bears a heavy burden.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is a strong presumption against finding a waiver of arbitration, and any doubts must be resolved in favor of arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   i.\n   <strong>\n    Whether Defendants Substantially Invoked the Judicial Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To invoke the judicial process, a party must, at the very least, engage in some overt act in court that evinces a desire to resolve the arbitrable dispute through litigation rather than arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Said another way, a party waives arbitration when it seeks a decision on the merits before attempting to arbitrate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Fifth Circuit, a finding that a motion to dismiss substantially invokes the judicial process is based on a factual determination on a case by case basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   involved alleged violations of consumer fraud and unjust enrichment that was originally filed in Illinois state court before being removed to the Southern District of Illinois.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant, in seeking a transfer to the Northern District of Texas for forum non conveniens, argued that plaintiff's claims were subject to arbitration in Texas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   After successfully transferring the case, defendant neither mentioned arbitration upon filing its 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss with prejudice, nor mentioned arbitration after replying to Forby's response to their 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court partially denied the 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss with respect to the consumer fraud claim, and partially granted the motion as to the unjust enrichment claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Almost two years after defendant initially claimed that Forby's claims were subject to arbitration, and four days after attending a Rule 26(f) conference, defendant filed its motion to stay and compel arbitration, which was granted by the district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In reversing the district court, the Fifth Circuit noted that defendant was \"fully aware of its right to compel arbitration when it filed its 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant could have easily moved to compel arbitration, even in the alternative to its motion to dismiss, but instead pursued and obtained a partial dismissal with prejudice. Taken together, the facts demonstrated that \"[defendant's] action of moving to dismiss Forby's claims with no mention of compelling arbitration demonstrated a desire to resolve the dispute in litigation rather than arbitration.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Even if the Court re-examines its Order Compelling Arbitration in light of\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   does not change this Court's analysis with respect to substantial invocation of the judicial process. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   , where defendants were fully aware of their right to compel arbitration, here, the only evidence on record demonstrates that the Motion to Arbitrate was filed shortly after new counsel appeared on Defendants' behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will not fashion similarities between one party offensively using the right to compel arbitration to transfer\n   a case, then waiting 13 months before moving to compel arbitration, with a party moving to compel arbitration a month after filing a notice of appearance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court finds that Defendants have not substantially invoked the judicial process, and therefore did not waive their right to arbitration. Notwithstanding this conclusion, the Court, in light of\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   , will reexamine the second element of whether a party waived their right to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Whether Plaintiffs Have Been Prejudiced\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs broadly use\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   to claim prejudice without specifically stating how they were prejudiced under the alleged new standards created by\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   . Further, even if\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   created a new standard of prejudice,\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   contained facts wholly distinct from the facts before this Court. Assuming arguendo that\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   did create a new standard of prejudice, under Rule 54(b),\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   does not change this Court's analysis on whether Plaintiffs have been prejudiced.

While other courts hold that sending a section 524 claim to arbitration arguably implicates matters central to the purposes and policies of the Bankruptcy Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n   in light of the facts surrounding this particular case, and the recent Supreme Court's mandate in\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   , this Court is not persuaded that a discharge injunction claim in the instant case should not be sent to arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, it is the party's heavy burden to show a clear and manifest expression of congressional intent that the Bankruptcy Code displaces the FAA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   Where Plaintiffs fail to carry their heavy burden, this Court is guided by the Supreme Court's mandate to compel arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The second policy reason behind not compelling arbitration within the context of bankruptcy-the need to protect creditors and reorganizing debtors from piecemeal litigation-is absent here for the same reasons set forth above. With the main bankruptcy case being closed, the current Adversary Proceeding involves a two-party dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n   With there being no need to protect creditors or reorganizing debtors, the Order Compelling Arbitration does not conflict with the policy reasons advanced by\n   <em>\n    National Gypsum\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Lastly, this Court must consider the undisputed power of a bankruptcy court to enforce its own orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   relied on the fact that the\n   bankruptcy court was not uniquely able to interpret and enforce the automatic stay provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   noted that \"[a]rbitration is presumptively an appropriate and competent forum for federal statutory claims,\" and there was nothing to suggest that the bankruptcy court was more qualified than an arbitrator to adjudicate a claim alleging violations of the automatic stay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   similarly ruled that a bankruptcy court is not uniquely able to interpret and enforce a discharge order because such an order is a form order that is entered in every case where a discharge is due and is not a unique order of the bankruptcy court specific to the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that arbitration of a discharge injunction goes against the undisputed power of a bankruptcy court to enforce its own orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Though the discharge injunction itself is statutory and thus a standard part of every bankruptcy proceeding, the bankruptcy court retains a unique expertise in interpreting its own injunctions and determining when they have been violated.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such,\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   held that violations of a court-ordered injunction are enforceable only by the bankruptcy court, and only through a contempt citation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This Court finds the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Belton\n   </em>\n   more persuasive. While a bankruptcy court is experienced in dealing with and interpreting its own orders, there is no evidence in the record or in the instant case that the arbitral system would not afford Plaintiffs their rights to which they are entitled to.\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, other forms of complex cases have readily been sent to arbitration. In the context of antitrust claims, the Supreme Court held that \"arbitral tribunals are readily capable of handling the factual and legal complexities of antitrust claims, notwithstanding the absence of judicial instruction and supervision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, the streamlined procedures of arbitration do not entail any consequential restriction on substantive rights, and there is no reason to assume that arbitrators will not follow the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In support of their argument that the Bankruptcy Code stands in inherent conflict with the FAA, Plaintiffs cite to\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Roth v.

Whether Defendants Waived their Right to Arbitrate in Writing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Assuming arguendo that Plaintiffs' argument regarding waiver of arbitration is relevant, their argument still does not change this Court's conclusion. Section 157 delegates to bankruptcy courts\n   the statutory authority to hear and enter final judgment on specific bankruptcy-related claims, subject to appellate review by the district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    173\n   </footnotemark>\n   Article III of the Constitution prohibits bankruptcy courts from entering final judgments on certain of those claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    174\n   </footnotemark>\n   Concerning non-core proceedings, bankruptcy courts may \"hear and determine\" such proceedings, and \"enter appropriate orders and judgments,\" only \"with the consent of all the parties to the proceeding.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    175\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without consent from all the parties, bankruptcy courts in non-core proceedings may only \"submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,\" which the district court reviews\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    176\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the FAA, arbitration is a matter of contract, and courts are commanded to enforce arbitration contracts according to their terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FAA provides that written contracts to arbitrate are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon grounds as exist at law or equity for the revocation of any contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs and Defendants consented to entry of final orders on all non-core matters by this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs raise the novel but flawed argument that Defendants' consent to this Court \"adjudicating, and hearing and determining the causes of actions raised by Plaintiffs\" effectively invalidated Defendants' right to compel arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs do not provide any support for this broad reaching proposition, and this Court will not fashion a waiver by implication in light of the directive by the FAA that written contracts to arbitrate \"shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon grounds as exist at law or equity for the revocation of any contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    181\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that Defendants waived their right to arbitration by consenting to this Court's entry of final orders on non-core bankruptcy claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiffs' Motion to Reconsider does not change this Court's analysis with regard to its Order Compelling Arbitration. In the Fifth Circuit, a waiver of arbitration, while disfavored, may be found when a party substantially invokes the judicial process and causes detriment or prejudice to the other party. Generally, a party substantially invokes the judicial process by initially pursuing litigation of claims, then reversing course and attempting to arbitrate those claims. The party claiming waiver of arbitration bears a heavy burden, and there is a strong presumption against finding a waiver. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of arbitration. Notwithstanding\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of showing that Defendants have substantially invoked the judicial process. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   , where defendants were\n   fully aware of their right to compel arbitration, here, the only evidence on record demonstrates that the Motion to Arbitrate was filed shortly after new counsel appeared on Defendants' behalf. Because there was no evidence that Defendants intentionally sat on their right to compel arbitration, Defendants have not substantially invoked the judicial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   does not change this Court's analysis when it comes to a finding of prejudice. A party opposing arbitration must also demonstrate prejudice, which relates to delay, expense, or damage to a party's legal position that occurs when the party's opponent forces it to litigate an issue and later seeks to arbitrate that same issue. In\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   , prejudice followed when a party transferred a case for the purpose of compelling arbitration, then waited 13 months before moving to compel. The facts are distinguishable here, where the Motion to Arbitrate was filed two months after Defendants filed their original answer to the complaint, and filed shortly after engagement of new counsel for Defendants. Such delay is minimal at best and does not change this Court's analysis. As such, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a prejudicial finding of delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs have not met their burden as to expense. A showing of significant litigation expenses can give rise to a finding of prejudice. Plaintiffs provide an affidavit and argue that they were required at tremendous expense to file numerous responses and replies to Defendants' briefing with respect to their motions to dismiss and other motions. However, Plaintiffs' fail to discern whether the increase in legal expenses came from a delay in the invocation of arbitration, or from other matters usually encountered in litigation. Plaintiffs' citation to\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   fails to allege specifics that helps carry their heavy burden of proof. As such, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a prejudicial finding of delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiffs have not met their burden as to damage. When a party will have to re-litigate in the arbitration forum an issue that has already been decided by the district court in its favor, that party is prejudiced. Damage may occur where parties engage in extensive pretrial activity, including full-fledged discovery, expert preparation, and trial preparation, as it gives the other side perspective on that party's strategy. Plaintiffs utilize\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   to argue that their legal position has been damaged as a result of Defendants' filing their Motion to Dismiss, yet the damage here is not like\n   <em>\n    Forby\n   </em>\n   . Here, no counterclaims have been asserted, Defendants have not taken discovery, there has been no expert or trial preparation, no affirmative defenses have been pled, and no motion for summary judgment has been filed. Plaintiffs have been unable to meet their heavy burden in showing prejudice sufficient to constitute a waiver of arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiffs argument regarding sending core bankruptcy claims to arbitration still does not change this Court's conclusion. The FAA directs courts to respect and enforce the parties' chosen arbitration procedures. This mandate may be overridden by a contrary congressional command, which can be shown by the Fifth Circuit test in\n   <em>\n    National Gypsum\n   </em>\n   . However, the party bears a heavy burden of showing a clearly expressed congressional intention that referring a matter to arbitration would conflict with the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code, and that such an intent clearly and manifestly follows. Plaintiffs have failed to meet their heavy burden here, and fail to show that referring their core matters to arbitration inherently conflicts\n   with the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs' novel but flawed argument that Defendants' waived their right to arbitrate in writing does not change this Court's conclusion. Article III of the Constitution prohibits bankruptcy courts from entering final judgments on certain claims. As a result, parties may consent to a bankruptcy court's authority to hear and determine such proceedings and enter appropriate orders and judgments. Here, Plaintiffs and Defendants consented to this Court hearing and determining such proceedings and entering appropriate orders and judgments. While Plaintiffs' argue that Defendants' consent to this Court's authority to hear and determine proceedings and enter judgments invalidated their right to compel arbitration, Plaintiffs neither provide support for their proposition, nor do they square that proposition up against the FAA's directive that written contracts to arbitrate are valid save upon such grounds as exist at law or equity for the revocation of any contract. As such, Plaintiffs failed to show that Defendants waived their right to arbitration in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' Motion to Reconsider.
