Debtor's Amended Complaint concerns the claim of CitiMortgage, which is secured against real property of the Debtor located at 6 Sherman Lane, Sicklerville, New Jersey 08081 (the \"subject property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although the Amended Complaint is notedly lacking in factual allegations, it does contain (1) the value of the subject property and (2) the amount of CitiMortgage's claim. As stated by the Amended Complaint and the appraisal attached to the Amended Complaint as an Exhibit, the value of the subject property\n   <em>\n    as of the petition date\n   </em>\n   was $216,000. The Amended Complaint also states that CitiMortgage filed a proof of claim in the amount of $294,000. Said proof of claim was filed as Claim No. 1 on July 27, 2015. The Debtor initially valued the subject property at $240,000 on Debtor's Schedule A, and listed $54,000 as the \"unsecured portion\" of CitiMortgage's $294,000 claim on Schedule D. The Amended Complaint seeks to limit the secured claim of CitiMortgage to $216,000 with the balance of the $294,000 claim to be allowable as an unsecured claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Debtor's plan provided for payment of CitiMortgage's claim in full, including payment of pre-petition arrears in the amount of $3,750. There was no language in the plan indicating an objection to the underlying claim of CitiMortgage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 23, 2017, an Order confirming Debtor's Chapter 13 plan, as modified, and setting certain deadlines was entered at Doc. No. 33 (the \"Confirmation Order\"). The Confirmation Order provided, in part, that \"[t]he claims of the following creditors shall govern as to amount, classification and rate of interest (or as otherwise noted), unless the Debtor(s) successfully objects to the claim: CitiMortgage, Inc. at Claim No. 1.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant\n   to the Confirmation Order, \"all actions to determine the priority, avoidability, or extent of liens, all actions pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507, and 522\" were to be filed within ninety (90) days of the claims bar date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Additionally, the following deadline for objections to claims was established by the Confirmation Order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Pursuant to W.PA.LBR 3021-1(c)(2), the Debtor or Debtor's attorney, if represented, shall review the proofs of claim filed and shall file objections to any disputed claims within ninety (90) days after the claims bar date or, for late filed or amended claims, within ninety (90) days after they are filed and served.

CitiMortgage raises five arguments as to why the Amended Complaint should be dismissed: (1) pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201327\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the entry of the Confirmation Order is res judicata as to all issues decided or which could have been decided prior to confirmation; (2) the deadline to commence an adversary proceeding has passed; (3) the Debtor is prohibited from modifying the confirmed plan after confirmation pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201329\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (4) the Debtor is judicially estopped from seeking a determination of secured status; and (5) the Debtor is equitably estopped from seeking a determination of secured status. For the reasons set forth below, this Court finds that (1) the entry of the Confirmation Order is res judicata as to the current adversary proceeding; (2) the deadline for commencing an adversary proceeding has expired; and (3) the debtor has failed to meet his burden to show that the confirmed plan may be modified pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201329\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court therefore does not address CitiMortgage's arguments regarding judicial or equitable estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Res Judicata Effect of Confirmation Pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201327\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 1327(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that \"the provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor, whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan, and whether or not such creditor has objected to, has accepted, or has rejected the Plan.\" The Third Circuit has repeatedly held that a confirmation order is res judicata as to all issues decided or which could have been decided at the hearing on confirmation, pursuant to \u00a7 1327.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Szostek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538849\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/886/1405/#p1408\">\n    886 F.2d 1405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1408 (3d Cir. 1989) ;\n   <em>\n    Zardinovsky v.

In\n   <em>\n    Wilson,\n   </em>\n   the debtor commenced a\n   \u00a7 506(a) adversary complaint to determine the allowable secured claim of a creditor secured against the debtor's vehicle. The debtor had not previously objected to the allowed secured claim of the creditor, and in fact the confirmed plan proposed to pay the claim at full face value.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4103509\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/409/72/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4103509\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/409/72/\">\n    at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   found that the confirmed plan had a res judicata effect as to the adversary proceeding because the plan set the value of the property by promising to pay the claim in full, and no other action was taken by the debtor within the deadlines imposed in the confirmed plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4103509\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/409/72/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the present case, the treatment of CitiMortgage's claim is controlled by the confirmed Chapter 13 plan. No objection, motion, or adversary proceeding regarding CitiMortgage's secured claim was commenced prior to plan confirmation, as part of the plan confirmation process, or within the time established by the plan and Confirmation Order. The confirmed plan provided that the claim of CitiMortgage would govern unless a timely objection was raised or a timely complaint was filed. The deadline for commencing a \u00a7 506 complaint or raising any objections to claims was ninety days from the claims bar date, as set in the confirmed plan. No adversary case or objection was filed within the time allotted, and therefore the Confirmation Order is a final judgment as to the treatment of CitiMortgage's claim. The present adversary proceeding was not commenced until August 8, 2018, more than eighteen months after the entry of the Confirmation Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Debtor argues that he could not have commenced the adversary proceeding as part of the confirmation process because the claim is based on post-confirmation activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss, Doc. No. 28 at 3 (stating that the adversary proceeding is \"predicated on the loss of value on the Subject Property during the years following confirmation\"). However, Debtor's complaint fails to include any facts to indicate that the \"devaluation\" occurred post-confirmation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, it appears from the Complaint and the record that the property was \"devalued\" as of the petition date. In either event, this Court is limited to the facts as set forth in the Complaint, and not as altered by Debtor's Response in Opposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Debtor cites to\n   <em>\n    Donaldson v.

LEXIS 120565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Pa. June 21, 2012) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It is clear from the face of the Amended Complaint and the underlying bankruptcy case that Debtor could have brought a \u00a7 506(a) adversary pre-confirmation: according to Debtor's own schedules, CitiMortgage's claim was undersecured by over $50,000. Debtor has not alleged any facts to differentiate the claim he could have brought pre-confirmation from the claim he now brings post-confirmation. Debtor's counsel indicated during oral argument on February 26, 2019 that there has been no change in circumstances that would have affected the value of the property post-confirmation. Further, Debtor's Amended Complaint alleges no facts to indicate that the \"devaluation\" actually occurred post-confirmation. It appears from the Amended Complaint, even when read in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, that the extent of the decrease in value existed as of the petition date but the Plaintiff was unaware of it until recently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As of the petition date, the Debtor knew CitiMortgage was undersecured, as evidenced by the Debtor's own schedules, which stated that CitiMortgage was undersecured by $54,000.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Schedule D. The Court considers not only what the Debtor knew, but what the Debtor should have known. Debtor attached to his complaint an appraisal valuing the subject property at $216,000 as of the petition date. Although this appraisal was obtained post-confirmation, it was well within the Debtor's power to discover the value of the subject property as of the petition date. The Debtor's Amended Complaint alleges he was \"unaware of the decline in home values in the Sicklerville New Jersey area in light of the fact that he had been living in Pennsylvania at the time of the petition filing;\" however, even assuming this is true, it is the Debtor's duty to value his property regardless of where it is located. The Debtor alone has the responsibility of correctly valuing his assets in his petition pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20521\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(i). The Debtor's bankruptcy petition was also signed under penalty of perjury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration Concerning Debtor's Schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Debtor could have brought a \u00a7 506(a) complaint against CitiMortgage prior to confirmation but chose not to do so. It appears the Debtor now seeks to commence a \u00a7 506(a) complaint because the value of the subject property was even lower than previously thought, but the relevant test is when the claim accrued, not when the Plaintiff determines that the claim has grown substantial enough to commence an action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It is apparent from the face of the complaint, the Debtor's appraisal, and the filed schedules that the Debtor had the ability to commence a \u00a7 506(a) proceeding against CitiMortgage as of the petition date. Therefore, the present \u00a7 506(a) proceeding could have been brought prior to plan confirmation, and so the Confirmation Order is res judicata as to this proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Reconsideration of Claims Under \u00a7 502(j)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Notwithstanding the res judicata effect of a confirmed plan, allowed claims can be reconsidered for cause pursuant to \u00a7 502(j) if the equities of the case so warrant.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4103509\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/409/72/\">\n    409 B.R. at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

LEXIS 5542, at *9 (Bankr. W.D.Pa. March 16, 2009). However, the\n   <em>\n    Mellors\n   </em>\n   court considered the fact that the debtors \"promptly filed their amended Plan to correct the situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Mellors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5867433\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/372/763/#p775\">\n    372 B.R. at 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the present case, the Debtor's \"cause\" for reconsideration was entirely within the Debtor's knowledge and control at the time of confirmation\n   <em>\n    and also\n   </em>\n   as of the petition date. Regardless of when the Debtor\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   discovered that CitiMortgage's claim was undersecured, the discovery could have (and should have) been made as of the petition date. This is evidenced by the fact that the Debtor's appraisal lists a valuation of $216,000\n   <em>\n    as of\n   </em>\n   the petition date, and the fact that the Debtor's own schedules list CitiMortgage as undersecured. Debtor contends that he was \"unaware of the decline in home values in the Sicklerville New Jersey area in light of the fact that he had been living in Pennsylvania at the time of the petition filing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint at 2, \u00b6 5. However, it is the Debtor's duty to file accurate schedules and value his assets correctly. Debtor completed the schedules, as is his responsibility under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20521\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(i), which were signed under penalty of perjury. There is no evidence or allegation of a sudden post-confirmation change in circumstances, such as destruction or damage to the property. Additionally, no allegation as to the extent or cause of the \"devaluation\" has been alleged in the bare-bones complaint; Debtor has not proffered any statement as to the post-confirmation value of the property. It appears then, from the face of the complaint, that the post-confirmation value of the property is the same as the value as of the petition date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The equities of the case also support disallowing reconsideration. Debtor commenced this adversary proceeding eighteen months after confirmation and nearly three years into the case when the cause of action had accrued as of the petition date. To allow reconsideration of the claim now, without adequate cause, would be to reward the Debtor for a lack of due diligence at CitiMortgage's expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Therefore, Debtor has not met his burden of showing adequate \"cause\" for reconsideration. No new facts have come to fruition post-confirmation: the Debtor alleges a general \"devaluation,\" but without additional facts this allegation is not sufficient for the Debtor to meet his burden for reconsideration under \u00a7 502(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Modification of the Plan Under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201329\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   CitiMortgage argues that \u00a7 1329(a) does not allow a debtor to reclassify an allowed secured claim, and cites to\n   <em>\n    In re Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11190213\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/253/638/#p641\">\n    253 B.R. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 641 (Bankr.

Although several cases in the Third Circuit have criticized the holding in\n   <em>\n    Cruz,\n   </em>\n   this Court need not determine whether\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   is applicable here, because\n   <em>\n    even if\n   </em>\n   modification of the plan under \u00a7 1329\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   allowed under the present facts, the Debtor does not plead sufficient facts to entitle him to such relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This Court has ruled that \"a modification of a confirmed plan under \u00a7 1329(a) must be based upon a change in circumstances that is substantial, material or unanticipated at the time of the initial confirmation.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4103509\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/409/72/\">\n    409 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   78 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Mellors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5867433\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/372/763/#p775\">\n    372 B.R. 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 770-71 ). Debtor pleads no facts regarding the amount of the post-confirmation \"devaluation\" of the subject property. Nor does Debtor plead any post-confirmation change in circumstances that caused the \"devaluation\" such as fire, destruction, etc. Stating that a general \"devaluation\" of the property has occurred, without more, is insufficient to prove a \"substantial or material\" change in circumstances. Additionally, given that Debtor knew or should have known about the diminished value of the property pre-confirmation, such a devaluation likely would not have been \"unanticipated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the relief sought by the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is granted.

The Debtor's \u00a7 506(a) claim accrued pre-confirmation and was not brought timely, and therefore the confirmed Chapter 13 Plan controls. Additionally, Debtor has not shown \"cause\" why CitiMortgage's claim should be reconsidered, nor do the equities of the case favor reconsideration of said claim. Lastly, Debtor has plead no facts to show a substantial, material or unanticipated change in circumstances that would allow him to modify the plan pursuant to \u00a7 1329.
