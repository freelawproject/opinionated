At a status conference held December 12, 2018, an issue arose concerning the applicability of the automatic stay to the removal of the state court class action lawsuit to this Court, to the motion for remand and abstention, and to the continued prosecution of the adversary proceeding following removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Resulting from Status Conference - Docket No. 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After considering the briefs filed by the parties, on February 12, 2019, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order in which the Court determined that the automatic stay did not apply to the removal of the state court class action lawsuit to this Court and did not apply to the continuation of the removed lawsuit before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion and Order - Docket No. 83. Alternatively, the Court annulled the automatic stay to validate the removal of the state court class action lawsuit to this Court and terminated the automatic stay solely with respect to the continuation of the removed lawsuit before this Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Philip J.

The Court is further convinced that the automatic stay does not apply to the Plaintiff's motion to remand the removed\n   action to state court and for abstention. The Court is persuaded, however, that the automatic stay applies to the continued prosecution of the removed state court class action lawsuit under non-bankruptcy law, regardless of whether such proceeding is conducted in the \"home\" court where the Debtor's bankruptcy case is pending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cashco commenced this bankruptcy case by filing a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on August 6, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1. On the same date, Budget Payday also commenced a Chapter 7 case in this district. Budget Payday is a Chapter 7 debtor in Case No. 18-11967-t7 pending before Judge David T. Thuma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to commencement of the Cashco and Budget Payday Chapter 7 cases, Matthew Kitts commenced an action in the Second Judicial District Court as Cause No. D-202-CV-2016-01851 (the \"State Court Action\"). The State Court Action is a class action lawsuit against the Debtor; Budget Payday Loans, Limited Partnership (\"Budget Payday\"); and Hitex, Inc. (\"Hitex\"). Hitex is not in bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 23, 2018, Debtor filed a notice of removal of the State Court Action to this Court, initiating Adversary Proceeding No. 18-1055-J (the \"Class Action Adversary Proceeding\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adversary Proceeding No. 18-1055-J - Docket Nos. 18 and 19. Mr. Kitts, as Plaintiff in the Class Action Adversary Proceeding, filed a motion for remand and abstention, which the Court stayed pending the Court's ruling on the applicability of the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Action Adversary Proceeding - Docket Nos. 10 and 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to removal of the State Court Action to bankruptcy court, the State Court certified a class as to claims against the Cashco. On February 27, 2019, the bankruptcy court in the Budget Payday Chapter 7 case entered a stipulated order granting relief from the automatic stay to permit certification of the class as to claims against Budget Payday.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulated Order Granting Stay Relief, Case No. 18-11967-t7 - Docket No. 62. On March 6, 2019, this Court entered a stipulated order certifying the class as to claims against Budget Payday.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulated Order on Class Certification, Class Action Adversary Proceeding - Docket No. 37.

Cashco was a party to the State Court Action and removed the action to the bankruptcy court in the district where the State Court Action was pending.

The State Court Action is a judicial proceeding filed against Cashco and Budget Payday to recover claims against them that arose before the commencement of their respective Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Arguments of the parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Trustee argues that the automatic stay applies to Cashco's removal of the State Court Action to this Court inasmuch as removal results in the continuation of the State Court Action. The Trustee reasons further that because removal of the stayed State Court Action violated the automatic stay it therefore is void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ellis v. Consolidated Diesel Elec. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121770,10532043\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/894/371/\">\n    894 F.2d 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372 (10th Cir. 1990) (\"It is well established that any action taken in violation of the stay is void and without effect.\") (citations omitted).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F &amp; M Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203941382\">\n    2013 WL 3941382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (concluding that removal of the state court action to federal court without first obtaining relief from the automatic stay was void). The Trustee argues, alternatively, that even if the automatic stay does not apply to the removal of the State Court Action to this Court, the stay applies to continuation of the removed action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition, the Trustee argues that it makes no difference to the applicability of the stay that the Debtor as defendant in the State Court Action removed the action to bankruptcy court. The Trustee relies upon\n   <em>\n    TW Telecom Holdings Inc. v. Carolina Internet, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192659,3847373\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/661/495/\">\n    661 F.3d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2011) and\n   <em>\n    In re Beery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3763517\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/452/825/\">\n    452 B.R. 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D.N.M. 2011) to assert that the automatic stay, which applies to a creditor's prosecution of a claim against the debtor, likewise applies to the debtor's actions to defend the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Cashco's principal argument to counter the Trustee's assertions is that removal did not constitute a continuation of the litigation but merely effectuated a change of venue. Cashco argues further that although continuation of the removed action in bankruptcy court may be subject to the automatic stay, a motion to remand is mere a response to the removal and does not amount to continuation of the removed action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    The automatic stays does not apply to removal of the State Court Action to bankruptcy court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   There is considerable authority to support the Trustee's position that the automatic stay applies to removal of the State Court Action to bankruptcy court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, this Court concludes that the automatic stay does not apply to removal of an action to the bankruptcy court, nor does it apply to a motion to remand and for abstention. This is true regardless of whether a creditor or the debtor removed the action to bankruptcy court and regardless of whether the removed claims are asserted by or against the debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The automatic stay \"is the central provision of the Bankruptcy Code\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   and \"prevents creditors from taking further action against [the debtor] except through the bankruptcy court.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758249,4034265\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1079/\">\n    575 F.3d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1083 (10th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). It provides the debtor and a bankruptcy trustee with a breathing spell from claims of creditors to further the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code; preserves the property of the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of all creditors and other parties in interest thereby helping to ensure an orderly and equitable distribution of assets; centralizes disputes concerning the debtor and property of the bankruptcy estate in the bankruptcy court unless the bankruptcy court authorizes litigation in another forum; and protects the debtor from harassment by creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The automatic stay applies to \"any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the [bankruptcy] case.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). The automatic stay also applies to the \"commencement or continuation\" of an \"action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the [bankruptcy] case.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). If applied literally, this statutory language would bar acts taken by creditors in the bankruptcy case itself. For example, the stay would apply to the filing of a proof of claim; an objection to a debtor's claim of exemption; an objection to treatment of a prepetition claim under a debtor's plan filed in a chapter 11, 12 or 13 case; and to a myriad of other things that creditors routinely file in bankruptcy cases. In fact, as the bankruptcy court pointed out in\n   <em>\n    In re Bird\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11748697\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/229/90/#p95\">\n    229 B.R. 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95 (Bankr.

Remanding the State Court Action does not constitute a \"continuation\" of the action barred by the automatic stay. Rather, remand simply restores the action to the status quo as it existed upon commencement of the bankruptcy case prior to removal. Similarly, abstention results in the action remaining in the state court from which it was removed. Unless and until the entry of an order granting relief from the automatic stay, an action that has been remanded (or from which the court abstains) will remain subject to the automatic stay. The decision whether to remand and/or abstain does not require the Court to express any opinion on the merits of the removed action and does not affect the substantive rights of any party to the litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As discussed above, removal is not subject to the automatic stay. Removal and remand/abstention are two sides of the same coin. Like removal, neither remand of an action nor abstention from hearing a state court action is subject to the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Continuation of the State Court Action after removal is subject to the automatic stay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Unlike removal and remand/abstention, the continuation of the litigation in the Class Action Adversary Proceeding following removal constitutes the \"continuation\" of an action or proceeding against the Debtor that was commenced before the Debtor filed its voluntary petition in bankruptcy. It advances the litigation and involves judicial decisions that affect substantive\n   rights and that address the merits of the dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Application of the automatic stay to the Class Action Adversary Proceeding following removal is consistent with an intended purpose of the automatic stay. The automatic stay, which arises immediately upon the filing of a voluntary petition for bankruptcy, provides the Debtor respite from ongoing litigation. If the automatic stay did not apply to the continuation of the litigation after removal, a debtor would be required, for example, to respond to interrogatories and requests for production served prior to removal, and participate in previously scheduled depositions even if such depositions were scheduled to occur after the filing of the bankruptcy. This would deprive the debtor of the breathing spell from the onslaught of pre-petition litigation afforded by the automatic stay. A debtor is not required to seek a stay of the ligation after removal but is automatically entitled to that stay under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Application of the automatic stay to the Class Action Adversary Proceeding is also consistent with the Advisory Committee's note to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9027. The Bankruptcy Rules Advisory Committee observed that where a state court cause of action is stayed, the litigation is likewise stayed following removal of the action to the bankruptcy court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

P. 9027, Advisory Committee's Note (1983) (\"If the claim or cause of action which is removed to the bankruptcy court is subject to the automatic stay of \u00a7 362 of the Code, the litigation may not proceed in the bankruptcy court until relief from the stay is granted.\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F &amp; M Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203941382\">\n    2013 WL 3941382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (the automatic stay applies to the continuation of a removed state court action subject to the automatic stay).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Substitution of the Trustee for the Debtor in the Class Action Adversary Proceeding Does not Violate the Automatic Stay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Trustee also complains that the motion to join the Trustee and the Chapter 7 Trustee in Budget Payday's bankruptcy case as parties to the Class Action Adversary Proceeding violated the automatic stay. The Court notes that the motion to join the Trustee was filed at the Court's direction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Resulting from Status Conference, Class Action Adversary Proceeding - Docket No. 15. But even if the Court had not directed the Plaintiff to file a motion to add the chapter 7 trustees, substitution of the Trustee for the Debtor (and of the Chapter 7 Trustee of Budget Payday for Budget Payday) in the Class Action Adversary Proceeding would not violate the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Once a debtor files a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, the chapter 7 trustee steps into the shoes of the debtor with respect to all pre-petition claims and lawsuits involving the debtor, and \"[o]nly the trustee has the authority and discretion to prosecute, defend and settle, as appropriate in its judgment, such cause[s] of action.\" 3 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 323.03[1] (Richard Levin &amp; Henry J.

Seeking to join the Trustee in\n   the Class Action Adversary Proceeding does not violate the automatic stay because it is not an act against the Debtor. Regardless of whether the action proceeds in the Class Action Adversary Proceeding or in the State Court Action following remand and/or abstention, the Trustee is the real party in interest with respect to the pre-petition claims against the Debtor. It is the Trustee's duty to determine whether to defend or attempt to settle the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Provided a state court action is removed to the bankruptcy court where the debtor's bankruptcy case is pending, the automatic stay does not apply to removal. Nor does the automatic stay bar a party from seeking remand and abstention following removal. Filing a notice of removal to commence an adversary proceeding and filing a motion for remand and/or abstention following removal do not constitute a continuation of the underlying litigation. Neither action requires the Court to adjudicate the merits of the underlying claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   However, once a state court action subject to the automatic stay is removed, the automatic stay prevents continued litigation of the claims in the adversary proceeding before the bankruptcy court. The automatic stay also remains in effect with respect to adjudication of the claims against the Debtor in the State Court Action in the event of a remand, unless and until the Court grants the Plaintiffs in the State Court Action relief from the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Chapter 7 Trustee's Brief on Applicability of the Automatic Stay - Docket No. 62; Debtor's Brief in Response to Chapter 7 Trustee's Brief on Applicability of the Automatic Stay - Docket No. 70; and Chapter 7 Trustee's Reply Brief on Applicability of the Automatic Stay - Docket No. 79.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <em>\n     E.g., compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Hoskins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500799\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/266/872/#p877\">\n     266 B.R. 872\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 877 (Bankr.
