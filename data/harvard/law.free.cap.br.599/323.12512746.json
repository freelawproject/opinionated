On November 23, 2018, creditor Bankers Healthcare Group [BHG] filed its\n   <em>\n    Motion to Convert Case to Chapter 11 or in the Alternative Dismiss, with Notice of Opportunity to Object.\n   </em>\n   On December 12, 2018, the debtor filed an objection to BHG's motion. On December 17, 2018, chapter 7 trustee Bianca Rucker filed a response to BHG's motion. The Court held a hearing that began on January 9, 2019, and concluded on March 11, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   David Nixon appeared on behalf of the debtor; Stanley Bond and Emily Henson appeared on behalf of BHG; and Bianca Rucker appeared on her own behalf. Patti Stanley appeared on behalf of the United States Trustee but did not actively participate in the hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court took the matter under advisement. For the reasons stated below, the Court denies BHG's motion to convert or dismiss in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The debtor is a pediatric radiologist employed by Arkansas Children's Hospital and Sheridan Radiology. She is married and has two sons. Her older son is 23 years old and attending his final year of college; her younger son is 17 years old and still living at home. The debtor's husband is not currently employed but owns a business that allows him to contribute to household expenses on a sporadic basis. The debtor claims her husband and two sons as dependents. The debtor's gross income is $ 28,948 per month. Her bankruptcy schedules state that her monthly net income is $ 16,041 and her monthly expenses are $ 16,242-a figure that includes rent for $ 2750; $ 1300 for food and housekeeping supplies; $ 300 for personal care products and services; $ 200 for a housekeeper; and $ 200 for travel and vacation expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to moving to Arkansas in 2018, the debtor lived in Florida, where she was worked as a radiologist for Sheridan Radiology, Pensacola Radiology Consultants, PA, and Orlando Hospital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In January 2014, the debtor created a professional association called Centre D'Elle, PA [the PA] for the purpose of opening a medical aesthetics spa. The debtor testified that a medical aesthetics spa (sometimes referenced as a \"med spa\") provides services such as medical grade chemical peels, micro-needling, and \"modalities to tighten skin and reduce cellulite\" such as CoolSculpting\u00ae and Z-wave machines. The debtor testified that she had planned to leave her radiology practice to perform vein procedures at the med spa once it was making enough money to allow her to quit her radiology position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To fund the business, the PA obtained loans from BHG and Suntrust Bank [Suntrust], all of which the debtor personally and unconditionally guaranteed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The med spa-Centre D'Elle-opened in July 2015. After the spa opened, the debtor continued her employment at Orlando Hospital but testified at trial that she was \"very, very involved\" with the med spa and used several weeks of her allotted vacation time from the hospital to work at the spa, in addition to working there on the nights and weekends that she was not at the hospital. Despite the debtor's efforts, the spa's clientele began diminishing in October 2016 and the spa was closed by December 2016. The debtor said that she found out that running a med spa was difficult, due in part to the high rate of turnover among aestheticians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the med spa failed, the debtor paid approximately $ 300,000 of her \"own money\" toward debts incurred by the business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial Tr. vol II, 41, Mar. 11, 2019. The record does not reflect how much of this sum was paid to Suntrust and BHG but, in any event, both lenders threatened to file suit to collect the money owed by the PA and guaranteed by the debtor. In response, on March 31, 2017, the debtor filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy case in the Middle District of Florida, indicating on her petition that her debts were primarily business debts rather than consumer debts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cook Ex. B. In December 2017, the debtor's Florida bankruptcy case was dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also in December 2017, the debtor\n   pulled her son from Ole Miss and enrolled him in a less expensive university in Florida to cut down on her expenses. In early 2018, the debtor hired an attorney to try to negotiate settlements with Suntrust and BHG. Settlement offers were exchanged with Suntrust and BHG-to no avail-and SBA began garnishing the debtor's wages to recoup the amount that it had paid on one of the Suntrust loans. Around the same time, the debtor moved to Arkansas to begin her current position at Arkansas Children's Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 16, 2018, the debtor filed her current chapter 7 bankruptcy case, indicating on her Arkansas petition-as she had on her Florida petition-that her debts were primarily business debts rather than consumer debts. On November 23, 2018, BHG filed its motion to convert the debtor's case to chapter 11 pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) or, in the alternative, dismiss her case under \u00a7 707(a) and (b). On December 12, 2018, the debtor filed an objection to BHG's motion and on December 17, 2018, the chapter 7 trustee filed her response to BHG's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Arguments of the Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   BHG's argument in favor of converting the debtor's chapter 7 case to a case under chapter 11 pursuant to \u00a7 706(b) is straightforward: as a doctor, the debtor has a high income and should not be allowed to rid herself of debts that she could afford to pay. Specifically, BHG argues that if the debtor were to reduce her voluntary retirement contributions, eliminate her travel and vacation savings, cease all gift-giving, stop paying for her older son's college tuition and expenses and stop saving for her younger son's upcoming college tuition and expenses, she would have money left over each month to pay a portion of what she owes to her creditors through a chapter 11 plan. Although BHG would prefer that the debtor's case be converted to a chapter 11, BHG moved in the alternative for dismissal of her case under \u00a7 707(a), which provides that a court may dismiss a chapter 7 case \"for cause,\" and under \u00a7 707(b), which provides that a court may dismiss a\n   <em>\n    consumer\n   </em>\n   chapter 7 case if it finds that the debtor filed her petition in bad faith or that granting relief under the chapter would constitute abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The chapter 7 trustee testified that she objects to the dismissal of the debtor's case because she has recovered assets that will result in a distribution to the debtor's creditors and she has not concluded her investigation into the debtor's affairs. Specifically, the trustee testified that the debtor has already turned over to her $ 44,991; she and the debtor are in the process of negotiating a buyback agreement for an additional $ 40,000; and the trustee has in her possession CoolSculpting\u00ae cartridges that she plans to sell for approximately $ 500 each and a Z-wave machine that she is already in the process of selling for $ 5000. In addition, the trustee testified that she intends to investigate and, if appropriate, pursue the recovery of pre-petition transfers made to the debtor's adult child and his university. The trustee opposes conversion of the debtor's case to a chapter 11 unless a trustee is appointed upon conversion, because, despite the debtor's cooperation with her thus far, she does not believe that the debtor, a busy doctor, would be an effective fiduciary for her creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The debtor argues that the Court should not exercise its discretion to convert her chapter 7 case to chapter 11 under \u00a7 706(b) because she would not benefit from the conversion and, in any event, she believes that she would be unable to fund a plan because she has already minimized her expenses as much as she can and she believes she is obligated to pay for her\n   sons' college tuition and expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also argues that there is no cause to dismiss her case under \u00a7 707(a) and that her case is not subject to dismissal under \u00a7 707(b) because she has primarily business debts and \u00a7 707(b) applies only in consumer cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Findings of Fact &amp; Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   BHG seeks to prevent the debtor from obtaining chapter 7 relief under three code provisions: \u00a7 706(b), \u00a7 707(a), and \u00a7 707(b). Although conversion under \u00a7 706(b) and dismissal under \u00a7 707(a) are potentially applicable in all chapter 7 cases, dismissal under \u00a7 707(b) is restricted to chapter 7 cases in which the debtor has primarily consumer debts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (\"the court ... may dismiss a case filed by an individual debtor under this chapter\n   <em>\n    whose debts are primarily consumer debts\n   </em>\n   ....\") (emphasis added). Therefore, the Court must determine whether the debtor in this case has primarily consumer or non-consumer debts before proceeding with its analysis. Consumer debt is defined as \"debt incurred by an individual primarily for a personal, family, or household purpose.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8). \"Consumer debt can be both secured and unsecured debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Cox v.

W.D. Wash. 2015) (the debtor's ability to pay is the logical starting point for a \u00a7 706(b) analysis because \"the whole reason for asking [for] a case to be converted is the assumption that creditors would receive more in a chapter 11 than a chapter 7.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the instant case, the debtor's updated drafts of Schedules I and J reflect that she has a monthly budgetary deficit of $ 2056-indicating that the debtor could not fund a chapter 11 plan. However, BHG argues that the debtor's budget contains expenses that are inappropriate for a chapter 7 debtor to include, such as voluntary contributions made to her 401(k) and 403(b) accounts, gift-giving expenses, an allotment for travel and vacation, as well as what BHG deems excessive expenditures for food and personal care products and services. BHG contends that these voluntary wage deductions and unnecessarily high expenditures, including those related to her older son's college tuition and expenses and the monthly savings directed\n   toward her younger son's similar future expenses, should be reduced or eliminated to bring her budget more closely in line with the national standards published by the IRS. According to BHG, if the debtor were compelled to adjust her budget, she would have sufficient disposable income to fund a five-year chapter 11 plan, resulting in a larger dividend to her creditors than they would receive if the debtor remained in her chapter 7 case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court agrees that if the debtor were forced to reduce or eliminate expenses from her budget that exceed the IRS guidelines and she was prevented from paying for her sons' respective college educations-an action that, according to the debtor's undisputed testimony, may well be in violation of a state court order-then the debtor could fund a chapter 11 plan that would result in a larger dividend to creditors than they would receive in a chapter 7 case. However, although conversion to chapter 11 would benefit creditors in theory, the Court cannot say with certitude that conversion would benefit creditors in reality, as discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although BHG accurately asserted in its motion to convert or dismiss that plan confirmation is not an issue to be decided in the context of a motion to convert under \u00a7 706(b), it is appropriate for the Court to consider the likelihood that the debtor will be able to propose a confirmable plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Parvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329625\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/538/96/#p102\">\n    538 B.R. at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Court finds it unlikely that the debtor would be able to propose a confirmable plan in the light of the fact that the debtor tried and failed to negotiate a settlement with BHG several times-before she filed bankruptcy in Florida, during a mediation conducted\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   her bankruptcy case in Florida, and again before she filed her current bankruptcy case in Arkansas. Against the backdrop of the parties' historical inability to come to a mutually satisfactory resolution, the Court finds it improbable that BHG would accept any plan proposed by the debtor unless she made the significant alterations to her budget that BHG insists upon and the debtor testified that she cannot make. As a result, if the debtor's case were converted to one under chapter 11, the Court finds it more likely than not that additional litigation between BHG and the debtor would impede or completely obstruct the confirmation of a plan-leading the debtor to seek dismissal or reconversion of her case to one under chapter 7, all of which would take time, result in added expense to the parties, and ultimately delay payment not only to BHG but to all creditors. For these reasons, the Court finds that it is not necessarily in the best interest of creditors to convert the case to one under chapter 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In any event, the debtor's ability to pay into a chapter 11 plan is not, by itself, determinative under \u00a7 706(b).\n   <em>\n    In re Decker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4283555\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/535/828/#p837\">\n    535 B.R. at 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the amended schedules, the debtor's gross income remains $ 28,948 and her net income has increased to $ 17,891 because her husband is now contributing $ 1850 per month. Her monthly expenses are $ 19,947, resulting in a budgetary deficit of $ 2056. Since filing her original schedules on August 16, 2018, the debtor has rented a less expensive home that costs $ 1450 per month and lowered some of her utility expenses. She has also discontinued paying $ 200 per month for a housekeeper. However, she has other monthly expenses that have increased-for example, her expenditures for personal care products and services have increased from $ 300 to $ 447, which the debtor testified were, in her opinion, not excessive for a household of three that includes a female doctor who is required to maintain a professional appearance consistent with that of her colleagues. Food and housekeeping supplies increased from $ 1300 to $ 1350. The debtor testified that she packs her lunch almost every day but sometimes buys a snack at the hospital. Similarly, the debtor testified that she takes coffee from home to the hospital but that she sometimes purchases additional coffee during her shift in order to stay awake. She also testified that when the family eats at a restaurant-on average, once a week-they usually spend approximately $ 10 each. Other items have been added to her budget, including an expense of $ 2500 per month to repay the chapter 7 trustee the funds that she withdrew post-petition from a 529 account to pay her older son's college tuition and expenses. In addition, because the 529 account has been depleted, the debtor's monthly budget now includes an expense of $ 2448 for her older son's ongoing college tuition and expenses and $ 833 per month for savings that are earmarked to pay similar expenses for her younger son when he starts college in approximately one year.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Although the record is unclear regarding the dates she worked for each entity in Florida, the debtor testified that she worked for Orlando Hospital in 2015 and 2016 and BHG's Exhibit 3 reflects that she was employed at Sheridan Radiology and Pensacola Radiology Consultants, PA as of April 13, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    In addition, the Small Business Administration [SBA] backed a portion of the P.A.'s indebtedness to Suntrust.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The Court presumes that when the debtor said her \"own money,\" she was referring to income that she earned as a radiologist.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Counsel for BHG represented in his opening statement that the debtor's Florida case was a consumer case.
