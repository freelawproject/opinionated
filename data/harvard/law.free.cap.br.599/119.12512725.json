Lewis's (\"the Trustee\") appeal of the Bankruptcy Court's Order, entered on January 24, 2018, in case No. 09-34404. Dennis W. Scruggs (\"Respondent\") opposes the appeal. The Court has jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). For the following reasons, the Order of the Bankruptcy Court is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     QUESTIONS PRESENTED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court awarded two claims in favor of Respondent, which form the basis of the instant appeal. Accordingly, the Court will consider:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. Whether the Bankruptcy Court erred when, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), it compensated Respondent for services Respondent provided to Debtor HT Inc. during the gap period; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. Whether the Bankruptcy Court erred when it allowed, in this Chapter 7 case, Respondent's substantial contribution administrative claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20503\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(D).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Debtor in this case is Health Trio Inc. (\"Debtor HT Inc.\") which developed and licensed software used by health insurance companies to administer claims. \"Over the years,\" however, Dr. Malik Hasan, the founder and majority shareholder of Debtor HT Inc., \"engaged in a scheme to manipulate HT Inc.'s assets and defraud creditors.\" (Rec. at 585.) Between 2000 and 2005, Hasan made cash contributions in the approximate amount of $ 16.8 million to Debtor HT Inc. None of these contributions were approved by the Board of Directors of Debtor HT Inc., nor did Hasan obtain any collateral to secure repayment of these funds. Nonetheless, at a December 2005 board meeting, the Board approved the issuance of promissory notes and a security agreement, which pledged\n   all of Debtor HT Inc.'s assets as collateral to secure repayment of all of Hasan's monetary contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Respondent is a certified public accountant who was originally employed as the chief financial officer of Debtor HT Inc. Respondent began his employment in July 2004, and his salary was $ 122,500 per year. His duties from July 2004 through February 2009 included \"managing cash receipts and disbursements, performing financial and tax accounting and reporting, managing Debtor HT Inc.'s contracts and routinely interfacing with attorneys on Debtor HT Inc.'s litigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 586.) Respondent signed the promissory notes and the security agreement as an officer of Debtor HT Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2007, Immedient Corporation-one of the three petitioning creditors against Debtor HT Inc.-obtained a judgment against Debtor HT Inc. Subsequently, Hasan demanded to be repaid for the contributions he had made to Debtor HT Inc. Hasan sued Debtor HT Inc. on the security agreement and promissory notes, and Debtor HT Inc. did not defend itself in the lawsuit. Accordingly, Hasan obtained a default judgment in the amount of $ 21.79 million. Respondent signed both an affidavit in support of Hasan's judgment and an assignment of assets to Hasan, and Debtor HT Inc. surrendered all of its assets to Hasan. \"When questioned about signing the insider foreclosure documents, [Respondent] testified he was an accountant, not a lawyer, and as an employee of HT Inc., he did what he was told.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 587.) Thereafter, Hasan formed a new entity called Health Trio LLC (\"HT LLC\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hasan purchased Debtor HT Inc.'s assets at a foreclosure sale and transferred the assets and Debtor HT Inc.'s business to HT LLC.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Most of HT Inc.'s employees began working for HT LLC as of October 1, 2007, including [Respondent] as CFO. HT LLC operated the exact same business as HT Inc. [Respondent] testified he was never terminated and never resigned as CFO of HT Inc. and that he was the only officer of HT Inc. after August 2007....[Respondent] was hired by Hasan as HT LLC's CFO from October 1, 2007 until January 2010, at the same salary he was paid by HT Inc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, Respondent testified that he had two CFO positions from October 2007\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Supp. Rec. at 116) until January 2010: one for HT LLC at his regular salary and one for HT Inc. \"for which he was not compensated.\" (Rec. at 587.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Respondent testified that he \"became concerned about his potential liability and future due to the involuntary petition litigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, Respondent sought,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , an indemnification agreement from Hasan regarding Respondent's activities as an officer, director, and shareholder of Debtor HT Inc. Respondent further testified that, when Hasan refused Respondent's requests, he resigned from his paid position at HT LLC-but not his unpaid position at Debtor\n   HT Inc.-in January 2010. The Court notes that Respondent's resignation from HT LLC did not occur until more than ten months after the involuntary Chapter 7 petition was filed against Debtor HT Inc. The Court also notes that during the gap period, even after he resigned his CFO position at HT LLC, Respondent continued to collect revenues received by Debtor HT Inc. which he delivered to Hasan, resisted the involuntary petition, and helped conceal the fact that Debtor HT Inc. had ceased operations in 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The gap period between the time the involuntary petition was filed and the entry of the order for relief lasted from February 18, 2009, until May 5, 2012. Respondent testified that, after he resigned his paid position with HT LLC in January 2010, \"he remained CFO of HT Inc. during and after the Gap Period until the Trustee was appointed in December 2012.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 588.) Respondent asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The ordinary course of business or financial affairs of HT Inc. during the Gap Period was to wind down HT Inc.'s operations, and his services as an officer of HT Inc. are compensable as a Gap Period claim. [Respondent] asserts he could have left HT Inc. and let the \"chips fall,\" to the detriment of HT Inc. and ultimately the HT Inc. bankruptcy estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Despite Respondent's admission on cross-examination by the Trustee that \"the only benefit to the Debtor [HT Inc.]...during this gap period...[was] that Dr. Hassan was continuing to receive money on his security interest [which] reduced the amount that was owed to him on the secured claim,\" (Supp. Rec. at 222), the Bankruptcy Court found that Respondent \"provided routine CFO services to HT Inc. in the Gap Period...for the benefit of HT Inc.....\", and awarded Respondent $ 46,959.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Rec. at 596.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Additionally, the Bankruptcy Court found that Respondent \"provided a substantial contribution to the chapter 7 bankruptcy estate in the post-petition period by conferring an actual, direct and demonstrable benefit to the estate in supporting the trustee's litigation claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, Respondent provided a \"six-inch three-ring binder litigation notebook for use in the investigation and prosecution of two adversary proceedings,\" which ultimately settled for a combined total of $ 1,225,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 589.) The notebook was a product of Respondent's efforts during the gap period to catalogue, identify, maintain, and preserve documents that could eventually be relevant to subsequent litigation.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The notebook was a \"roadmap\" for the Trustee. [Respondent] actively assisted the Trustee's counsel in formulating and prosecuting the...complaints [in the adversary proceedings]. The complaints were detailed and comprehensive, containing numerous claims for relief. [Respondent] had frequent meetings, located documents, answered questions, was deposed several times, and responded to e-mails with two sets of litigation counsel retained by the Trustee. He estimated he spent 750 hours in this category after the order for relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, the Bankruptcy Court awarded Respondent $ 23,250\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for making a substantial contribution to the Chapter 7 case as an administrative claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On February 2, 2018, the Trustee initiated the instant appeal arguing that the Bankruptcy Court erred in granting Respondent's gap period claim and awarding Respondent funds for his contribution to the Chapter 7 case. Respondent filed a Response (Doc. # 13) on May 11, 2018, and the Trustee filed a Reply (Doc. # 14) on May 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court reviews the Bankruptcy Court's legal determinations de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788452,3518332\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/1155/\">\n    593 F.3d 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1159 (10th Cir. 2010).

Therefore, whether a creditor is entitled to a gap claim under \u00a7 502(f) depends on whether the claim arose \"in the ordinary course of the debtor's business or financial affairs....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Trustee raises the following issues related to the Bankruptcy Court's allowance of Respondent's gap period claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   1. whether the Bankruptcy Court erred in construing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) broadly;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   2. whether the Bankruptcy Court erred in holding that Respondent held a gap claim \"arising in the ordinary course of the debtor's business or financial affairs\" even though the\n   debtor ceased its ordinary business operations over a year before the petition date;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   3. whether the Bankruptcy Court erred in holding that that Respondent held a gap period claim even though Respondent's activities during that period included:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   a. resisting the involuntary petition,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   b. concealing the fact that the debtor had ceased operating from counter-parties, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   c. performing other unusual services; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   4. whether the Bankruptcy Court erred in holding that Respondent held a gap period claim \"arising in the ordinary course of the debtor's business or financial affairs\" even though Respondent performed some of those activities prior to the petition date without compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Doc. # 12 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court concludes that the Bankruptcy Court erred in construing Respondent's \u00a7 502(f) claim broadly. In doing so, the Bankruptcy Court stretched the interpretation of a gap period claim to encompass a situation in which the services provided were not in the ordinary course of the debtor's business or financial affairs. Because the other issues raised by the Trustee are so intertwined with the issue of \"ordinary course\", the Court addresses them all as one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Meaning of Ordinary Course of Business\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Courts have noted that little authority exists directly addressing the question of the meaning of \"ordinary course of business\" in \u00a7 502(f).\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Hanson Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6105391\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/90/405/#p413\">\n    90 B.R. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413 (Bankr.

The Bankruptcy Court endeavored to derive the meaning of the term \"ordinary course of business\" by examining cases in which other bankruptcy courts either granted or denied a \u00a7 502(f) gap period claim. Accordingly, the Bankruptcy Court deduced that such claims \"fall into two categories.\" (Rec. at 591.) Specifically,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   In one category the courts have applied a strict standard and held that attorney's fees and expenses incurred in unsuccessfully defending an involuntary petition do not fall within the scope of a debtor's ordinary course of business or financial affairs. In the other category, the courts have applied a less stringent standard and awarded involuntary gap period claims to employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court ultimately concluded that the term \"['ordinary course of business'] under \u00a7 502(f) should be\n   <strong>\n    broadly construed\n   </strong>\n   in protecting creditors and parties who deal with an involuntary debtor.\" (Rec. at 590-593) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although the Bankruptcy Court's functional approach is innovative, the Court respectfully rejects the Bankruptcy Court's broad construction standard. First, the cases cited by the Bankruptcy Court in support of its position do not distinguish between \u00a7 502(f) claims based on the \"categories\" identified by the Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Baab Steel, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198552\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/495/530/#p534\">\n    495 B.R. 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2013). Second, this Court could not find any Circuit Court of Appeals authority supporting the Bankruptcy Court's interpretation. Third, the Tenth Circuit has held that statutory priorities-which include gap claims-are \"to be\n   <strong>\n    narrowly construed\n   </strong>\n   [b]ecause the\n   presumption in bankruptcy cases is that the debtor's limited resources will be equally distributed among his creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Furr's Supermarkets, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=359%20B.R.%20356\">\n    359 B.R. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir.

It appears that the Bankruptcy Court, categorized Respondent's 502(f) claim as that of a typical employee and construed \u00a7 502(f) broadly so as to encompass Respondent's claim as having been incurred in the ordinary course of HT Inc.'s, business.

From the perspective of the industry-software development companies-the challenged transaction is certainly abnormal. Facing mounting liabilities, Debtor HT Inc. dissolved and effectively reorganized as HT LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 587.) Respondent, Debtor HT Inc.'s CFO, stopped receiving payment from Debtor HT Inc. and started receiving the same salary from HT LLC. Nevertheless, Respondent did extra work for Debtor HT Inc. without a corresponding increase in salary. (Supp. Rec. at 116.) This arrangement began before the gap period started and continued after the Chapter 7 petition was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The abnormality reached an apex when Respondent-knowing that his only source of compensation was coming from HT LLC-resigned his position from HT LLC. Respondent's principle reason for his resignation was equally unusual. Respondent threatened to resign from HT LLC unless he received an indemnification agreement insulating him from liability for his actions as an officer of Debtor HT Inc. When his demand was refused, Respondent resigned from HT LLC. Nevertheless, Respondent maintained his position with Debtor HT Inc. even though that was the same position that caused him so much concern for his personal liability that he gave up his only source of income in an effort to protect himself. Although the services that Respondent provided for Debtor HT Inc. throughout the gap period may seem facially usual for a company winding up its affairs, the label \"usual\" is not justified when Respondent's services are viewed in the above-described context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Whether considered from the perspective of a software development company, in particular, or from a corporate entity, in general, the \"transaction\" between Respondent and Debtor HT Inc. is not \"of the sort commonly undertaken by companies in that industry.\"\n   <em>\n    Braunstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667681,4104062\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/108/\">\n    571 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   124 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Roth Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6517901,10517614\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/975/949/\">\n    975 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   953 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Vertical Test\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Under the vertical test, courts analyze the challenged transaction from a hypothetical creditor's point of view and ask whether it \"subjects a creditor to economic risks of a nature different from those he accepted when he decided to extend credit.\"\n   <em>\n    Braunstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667681,4104062\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/108/\">\n    571 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   125 (citing\n   <em>\n    Straightline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3620529,3583693\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/525/870/\">\n    525 F.3d at 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Burlington N.

Respondent is not the \"ordinary\" third party creditor or low-level employee who continued to work because he was unaware that HT Inc. was in financial difficulty. As the CFO for HT Inc., not only was Respondent an insider, but also, he was an insider who was complicit in the transfer of all of HT Inc. assets to Hasan. He was well aware that, at the time the involuntary petition was filed, HT Inc. was for the most part a defunct shell. Respondent, knew that HT Inc. was non-operational because all of its assets had been transferred to Hasan, thus, any expectation he had of receiving compensation for these services during the gap period was not a reasonable expectation. Additionally, the services Respondent provided to Debtor HT Inc. were qualitatively different from the services he had provided when Debtor HT Inc. was engaged in ordinary business affairs. For instance, although Respondent administered Debtor HT Inc.'s non-assignable contracts before and after the petition, after Hasan foreclosed on his security agreements and promissory notes-which was facilitated in part by Respondent-the money Respondent collected on behalf of Debtor HT Inc. never was received directly by Debtor HT Inc. (Supp. Rec. at 116-17.) In fact, the money went directly to Hasan's personal bank account because Debtor HT Inc. ceased to operate a bank account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   During cross examination, counsel for the Trustee asked Respondent the following with respect to the non-assignable Debtor HT Inc. contracts that Respondent administered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q: Okay. And then again, the only benefit to the Debtor [HT Inc.]...during this gap period as you would say, if there's any benefit at all it's simply that Dr. Hassan was continuing to receive money on his security interest and reduced the amount that was owed to him on the secured claim, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A: That's the end result of what happened, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (Supp. Rec. at 222.) Accordingly, Respondent was working primarily for the personal benefit of Hasan rather than Debtor HT Inc. or its shareholders during the gap period, which stands in stark contrast to the services Respondent performed during Debtor HT Inc.'s ordinary course of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Additionally, there were significant changes in Respondent's relationship with Debtor HT Inc. during the gap period. The gap period between the time the involuntary petition was filed and the entry of the order for relief lasted from February 18, 2009, until May 5, 2012. Respondent seeks compensation for his services to Debtor HT Inc. for the entire gap period despite the fact that he continued to receive his full compensation from HT LLC from February 18, 2009, until January 2010, when he resigned his position at HT LLC. There is no evidence that Respondent entered into an agreement with Debtor HT Inc. to be compensated for the services he provided during the gap period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent held himself out as \"an\n   uncompensated officer and employee solely for the purposes of winding up any affairs of HealthTrio, Inc. in an orderly manner.\" (Doc. # 12-1.) As such, there is no evidence that Respondent had a justified expectation of payment from Debtor HT Inc. for his services. From the perspective of the Debtor HT Inc., as well as a hypothetical creditor, therefore, Respondent voluntarily performed services for Debtor HT Inc. for free.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Respondent's status as a non-compensated service provider contrasts significantly with his relationship with Debtor HT Inc. during HT Inc's ordinary course of business. Specifically, Respondent's relationship with Debtor HT Inc. during the gap period was abnormal relative to their pre-petition relationship because Respondent (1) was not a traditionally compensated employee of Debtor HT Inc. and (2) was not being compensated by HT LLC for the services he performed related to Debtor HT Inc. as of 2010. In fact, the only way in which Respondent's relationship with Debtor HT Inc. was ordinary relative to their pre-petition relationship was that Respondent performed services for Debtor HT Inc. without a justifiable expectation of compensation from Debtor HT Inc. beginning in 2007 when Debtor HT Inc. ceased its ordinary business affairs, and he continued to do so throughout the gap period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that the services Respondent performed were not \"ordinary\" according to the horizontal and vertical tests. Therefore, those services were not performed \"in the ordinary course of business\" for purposes of \u00a7 502(f).\n   <em>\n    Braunstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667681,4104062\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/108/\">\n    571 F.3d at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
