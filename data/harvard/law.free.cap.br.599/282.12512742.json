For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the Motion to Convert with respect to Mr. Fletcher but finds that Mrs. Fletcher is ineligible to be a debtor in bankruptcy. Therefore, the Court denies the Motion to Convert as to Mrs. Fletcher and dismisses her from the Current Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On August 2, 2016, Mrs. Fletcher, by counsel, filed a voluntary petition in this Court under Chapter 13 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the \"Bankruptcy Code\"), commencing case number 16-33816-KRH (the \"Prior Chapter 13 Case\").

At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court took the matter under advisement, with the Debtors to submit supplemental briefing on whether section 109(g)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code barred Mrs. Fletcher from being a debtor in the Current Case, regardless of chapter.

Accordingly, the Court grants the Motion to Convert with respect to Mr. Fletcher. Whether Mrs. Fletcher may convert her bankruptcy case depends on whether she is ineligible to be a debtor under section 109(g)(2).

Thus, Mrs. Fletcher meets the plain language of section 109(g)(2). But under the causal approach to section 109(g)(2), the Court must look \"for a causal connection between a motion for relief from the automatic stay and a debtor's subsequent request and receipt of a voluntary dismissal\" in order to determine if Mrs. Fletcher is eligible to be a debtor in the Current Case.\n   <em>\n    In re Sole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11612597\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/233/347/#p348\">\n    233 B.R. at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A causal connection undoubtedly exists between the Motion for Relief from Stay and Mrs. Fletcher's voluntary dismissal of the Prior Chapter 13 Case.

This connection is precisely what section 109(g)(2) was enacted to prevent. The statute not only bars Mrs. Fletcher from asserting her right to convert this case but also from being a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Fletcher is eligible to convert the Current Case under section 706(a), but Mrs. Fletcher is\n   ineligible to convert the Current Case and ineligible to be a debtor in bankruptcy under section 109(g)(2). Therefore, the Court will issue a separate order granting the Motion to Convert with respect to Mr. Fletcher but denying the Motion to Convert with respect to Mrs. Fletcher and dismissing her from the Current Case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The Consent Order required certain information to appear in the notice of default, including that Mrs. Fletcher or the Chapter 13 trustee had fourteen days to either \"cure the default; file an objection with the court stating that no default exists; or file an objection with the court stating any other reason why an order granting relief from the automatic stay should not be entered.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 3(d)(i) - (iii).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Instead, on February 8, 2018, Lakeview filed a pleading entitled\n    <em>\n     Notice of Stay Termination\n    </em>\n    [Case No. 16-33816-KRH, ECF No. 50], which had no legal effect.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The Motion to Dismiss stated that the Current Case was filed on the eve of a foreclosure, necessitating the dismissal of the Prior Chapter 13 Case.

This distinction misses the mark. Section 109(g) does not distinguish between simultaneous and successive petitions. It is of no moment under section 109(g) whether the second petition is filed while the prior case is still open. Thus, the Court determines whether section 109(g) excludes the Debtors as debtors under the Bankruptcy Code without the need to consider the timing of the filing of the Current Case and the Prior Chapter 13 Case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Judge Phillips of this Court touched on the issue in\n    <em>\n     In re Brown\n    </em>\n    , but did not endorse any of the three approaches because \"[u]nder any of the three approaches to the application of \u00a7 109(g)(2) discussed herein, the Debtor would not qualify for a waiver [of the eligibility requirement] ...
