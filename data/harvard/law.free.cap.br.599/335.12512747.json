The Court concludes that Debtors' failure to pay all their direct post-petition mortgage payments is not a failure to complete all payments required under the plan. Having completed all required plan payments and performed all other obligations under the Code and Rules and there are no indicia of wrongdoing, Debtors are now entitled to their Chapter 13 discharge.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Debtors filed this Chapter 13 case on December 4, 2013. Using the mandatory Arizona Model Form Plan they filed an\n   <em>\n    Amended Chapter 13 Plan\n   </em>\n   on July 18, 2014 that proposed to pay varied amounts per month for 39 months to be distributed to their secured, priority and general unsecured creditors (\"Amended Plan\"). Dkt. No. 39. Debtors' mortgage lender RoundPoint Mortgage was to be paid pre-petition arrears of $ 15,571.89 on the mortgage on a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   basis from payments Debtors made to Trustee Brown. Section (c)(4) of the Amended Plan provided \"[u]nless stated below, Debtor is to pay post-petition payments direct to the creditor and pre[-]petition arrearages shall be cured through the Trustee.\" That same section contains a heading titled \"Post-Petition Mortgage Payments\" with two alternative boxes from which Debtors may select that read \" Debtor will pay direct to creditor;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   or Included in Plan payment. Trustee will pay creditor.\" Debtors checked the first box obligating them to make direct payments and stated that their monthly post-petition mortgage payments were $ 851.27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Amended Plan was approved on November 10, 2014 through the\n   <em>\n    Stipulated Order Confirming First Amended Chapter 13 Plan\n   </em>\n   (\"Confirmation Order\"). Dkt. No. 50. Counsel for RoundPoint Mortgage signed off on the Confirmation Order showing its approval \"as to form and content.\" Section (C)(2) of the Confirmation Order concerned RoundPoint Mortgage's claim secured by real property and stated, \"Regular post-petition payments will be made directly by the Debtors to the secured creditor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Debtors later filed an\n   <em>\n    Amended Modified Chapter 13 Plan\n   </em>\n   on July 28, 2016 (\"Amended Modified Plan\") again using the mandatory Arizona Model Form Plan. Dkt. No. 62. RoundPoint Mortgage's treatment did not change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 28, 2016, in compliance with Rule 3002.1(f), Trustee Brown filed a\n   <em>\n    Notice of Final Cure Payment for Prepetition Arrears on Mortgage Claim\n   </em>\n   indicating that all pre-petition arrears owing to RoundPoint Mortgage had been paid (\"First Cure Notice). Dkt. No. 70. The First Cure Notice supplied a history of payments by Trustee Brown to RoundPoint Mortgage and stated that it was filed to \"assist the creditor in reconciling the claim.\" It also directed RoundPoint Mortgage to file a supplement to its proof of claim indicating its agreement with whether the pre-petition default had been cured and whether the post-petition payments were current, along with an itemized statement of any unpaid amounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   RoundPoint Mortgage did not file a response to the First Cure Notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Amended Modified Plan was approved without objection on November 28, 2016 through the\n   <em>\n    Stipulated Order Confirming Amended First Modified Chapter 13 Plan\n   </em>\n   (\"Final Confirmation Order\"), which, among other things, extended the plan duration to 41 months. Dkt. No. 76. As to RoundPoint Mortgage, Section (C)(2) of the Final Confirmation Order again stated that \"Regular post-petition payments will be made directly by the Debtors to the secured creditor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Trustee Brown filed another\n   <em>\n    Notice of Final Cure Payment for Prepetition Arrears on Mortgage Claim\n   </em>\n   on April 17, 2018 (\"Final Cure Notice\"). Dkt. No. 81. The Final Cure Notice again supplied a history of payments by Trustee Brown to RoundPoint Mortgage and directed it to file a\n   supplement to its proof of claim indicating its agreement with whether the pre-petition default had been cured and whether the post-petition payments were current, along with an itemized statement of any unpaid amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 1, 2018, the creditor filed the response required by Rule 3002.1(g),\n   <em>\n    Response to Trustee's Notice of Final Cure for Prepetition Arrears on Mortgage Claim\n   </em>\n   , agreeing that the pre-petition default was cured, but stating that the post-petition payments due on and after September 1, 2017 were delinquent. Dkt. No. 82. The Response did not attach the required itemized statement of the unpaid amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to the\n   <em>\n    Trustee's 2018 Annual Status Report\n   </em>\n   , a mortgage default occurring on September 1, 2017 would be approximately 44 months into the bankruptcy case. Dkt. No. 86. The only payment shown on the 2018 Annual Report was $ 6.22 made on October 13, 2017. However, the plan payments were noted as \"current\" because Trustee Brown's office had received all scheduled payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thereafter, Trustee Brown filed the Motion, which Debtors did not oppose in writing. However, Debtors' counsel appeared at the hearing and argued that the case should not be dismissed because Debtors made all payments to be made through the Trustee. RoundPoint Mortgage did not file any papers or appear at the hearing, despite receiving notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the hearing, Trustee Brown discussed the recent emergence of decisions in other districts granting similar motions and indicated that his goal was to obtain guidance from the Court on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As noted, paragraph (C)(2) of Debtors' Final Confirmation Order provides that \"regular post-petition payments will be made directly by the Debtors to the secured creditor.\" So, the issue is whether by failing to pay these direct payments, Debtors have also failed to complete all payments required under the Plan and are therefore not entitled to a Chapter 13 discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Payments Under The Plan\"\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    Means Payments Made To The Trustee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Several recent cases dealing with the consequences of direct pay defaults in Chapter 13 cases have caused a split in authority. There is no controlling case law on this matter in the Ninth Circuit. Without clear direction on the matter, this Court is free to consider the pros and cons of each approach and to fashion a result that is consistent with the intent of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The majority position is that \"payments under the plan\" refers to any payment made pursuant to a Chapter 13 plan, regardless of whether a debtor makes such payment directly to the creditor or through the trustee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simon v. Finley (In re Finley)\n   </em>\n   , No. AP 18-4011,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204172599\">\n    2018 WL 4172599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Bankr. S.D. Ill. Aug. 28, 2018) (referring to the above cited cases relied upon by Trustee Brown as supporting the majority position). Despite the\n   <em>\n    Finley\n   </em>\n   court's holding, it refused to vacate the discharge under the facts of that case, finding that the trustee's complaint was not well taken because he knew that the debtors' statement about having made all payments was \"false\" in ample time to object to the entry of discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The minority position is found in\n   <em>\n    In re Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420626\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/15/\">\n    582 B.R. 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. C.D. Ill. 2018) (debtor's direct payments on a nonmodifiable, nondischargeable residential mortgage loan were not \"payments under the plan\" that had to be completed for debtor to be entitled to discharge). While both lines of cases are well reasoned, this Court agrees with\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   as more closely reflecting the language of the Code, the purposes of Chapter 13, and the intent behind Rule 3002.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The meaning of \"payments under the plan\" has led to conflicting interpretations. The Bankruptcy Code is silent with respect to when the \"completion ... of all payments under the plan\" occurs for purposes of discharge under \u00a7 1328(a). Keith M. Lundin and William H. Brown, CHAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY , 4\n   <sup>\n    TH\n   </sup>\n   EDITION , \u00a7 343.1, at \u00b6 2, Sec. Rev. July 22, 2004, www.Ch13online.com (last visited March 28, 2019). However, reading the words in the context of chapter 13 as a whole brings clarity to the meaning and confirms that such words should only refer to the debtor's payments\n   <em>\n    paid to the trustee\n   </em>\n   pursuant to the plan's terms. David Cox,\n   <em>\n    Don't Move the Goalposts - Section 1328 Should Not Deny Discharge to Debtor Who Completes Payments to Trustee, but Is Behind on Direct Payments\n   </em>\n   . 37 Am. Bankr. Inst. J. 20 (May 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As explained in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , \"provided for by the plan\" and \"payments under the plan\" should mean two different things. The phrase \"under the plan\" is a narrow term:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   allowing for the possibility that not all creditors holding debts provided for by the plan are receiving payments under the plan. There may be some payments made to creditors who are provided for by the plan that are not payments under the plan. The most logical line of demarcation is between payments made by the trustee from funds received from the debtor versus payments made by the debtor direct to a creditor. It follows that the resolution of the difference in phraseology is to construe the requirement under section 1328(a) of \"completion by the debtor of all payments under the plan,\" to mean the payments that the debtor is required to make to the trustee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420626\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/15/\">\n    582 B.R. at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This interpretation is consistent with how the Bankruptcy Code has been implemented and how these words are interpreted elsewhere in Chapter 13. For example, Section \"1325(b) requires the plan to provide that all of the debtors' projected disposable income 'to be received in the three-year period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make\n   <em>\n    payments under the plan\n   </em>\n   .' These payments applied to make 'payments under the plan' are the debtor's payments paid to the trustee, so that they can be distributed to allowed claimants.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(b) (emphasis added); 37 Am. Banker. Inst. J. at 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Further, as Judge Perkins recognized in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1329(a) requires that any modification of a plan after confirmation be filed \"before the\n   <em>\n    completion of payments under such plan\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201329\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). Indeed, it is \"well settled that 'completion of payments' under this provision occurs when the debtor pays\n   <em>\n    to the trustee\n   </em>\n   the full amount required by the confirmed plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420626\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/15/\">\n    582 B.R. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Thus, the payments \"under such plan\" are the debtor's payments to the trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The mandatory form plan here gave Debtors two choices with respect to their post-petition mortgage payments - either \"pay direct ... or ...Trustee will pay creditor.\" These two choices cannot mean the same thing, or why even have a choice? Thus, the logical line of demarcation is that \"pay direct\" means \"provided for by the Plan\" while \"Trustee will pay creditor\" means \"payments under the plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The very dilemma raised here (what does \"under the plan\" mean) was discussed by the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\") when it determined that the Code does not prohibit direct payments to creditors in\n   <em>\n    Giesbrecht v. Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Giesbrecht\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3809490\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/429/682/\">\n    429 B.R. 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. BAP 2010). In reaching its ultimate conclusion that the structure of Chapter 13's statutory\n   provisions do not require that all payments to creditors be made through a Chapter 13 trustee, the BAP carefully considered what \"under the plan\" means in \u00a7\u00a7 1322 and 1326,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and relied in large part on\n   <em>\n    Cohen v.

The Panel concluded that simply because Congress intended for Chapter 13 trustee's fees to be paid from plan payments did not \"inherently lead to a conclusion that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   payments must therefore be made under the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868512\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/372/40/\">\n    372 B.R. at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   While\n   <em>\n    Giesbrecht\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   do not directly address the issue presented here, the Court finds that their analyses of what \"under the plan\" means to be instructive, and similarly concludes that Section 1328 allows debtors to pay their post-petition mortgage payments \"outside the plan, so long as either the plan itself or the order confirming the plan allows it.\" That is precisely what Debtors did here - they checked the appropriate box on the model form plan to advise the creditor that they would not be paying the post-petition payments \"under the plan\" but would instead \"pay direct to [the] creditor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that the cases concluding that \"under the plan\" includes direct payments reason that \"provided for by the plan\" is an expansive concept that includes claims merely mentioned by the plan and thus \"payments under the plan\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   must be similarly wide. These cases also view the debtor, instead of the trustee, as disbursing agents under the plan and therefore direct payments are also under the plan.

The trustee might only learn of payment defaults if a motion for stay relief or other paper was filed with the Court. There is no Bankruptcy Code provision or Rule that requires a debtor to report a default on direct payments. As noted by\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , it \"is safe to say that from 1978 until very recently, countless Chapter 13 debtors received a discharge despite an uncured default in payments to a creditor made direct by the debtor, either because the trustee was unaware of the default or because a default on direct plan payments was not viewed as a basis to seek dismissal without discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420626\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/15/\">\n    582 B.R. at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Rule could have specified a penalty or consequence for a debtor with delinquent post-petition payments, but it did not.

A debtor must only certify that they have paid all domestic support obligations and completed a Personal Financial Management Course. These certifications are accomplished using Official Form 423, Certification About a Financial Management Course, and Local Form 2084-6, Certificate of Eligibility for Chapter 13 Discharge After Completion of Plan Payments. If Congress believed it important for a debtor to certify that all post-petition mortgage payments be current, it would have so stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nothing in the Code or Rules, however, suggests that Section 1328(a) should be construed in a way that would automatically\n   transform an outside-the-plan payment default into grounds for dismissal under Section 1307(c)(6) without discharge, especially when all payments to the trustee have been completed. This Court instead agrees with\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , which held that at \"most, whether a Chapter 13 debtor's failure to make direct payments warrants denial or revocation of a discharge should be determined on a case-by-case basis, under other sections of the Bankruptcy Code, taking into account the debtor's state of mind and the effect on creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    Gibson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420626\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/15/\">\n    582 B.R. at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The facts here are significantly different from other cases where a debtor's failure to make post-petition mortgage payments were grounds to revoke a Chapter 13 discharge.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221242\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/532/828/\">\n    532 B.R. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

In\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   , there was an undisclosed post-petition mortgage default of nearly $ 50,000 and, because there was a second mortgage, entry of the standard discharge would effectuate the strip-off of that second mortgage. Accordingly, the court found that discharge under those circumstances would unfairly harm the second lien holder. Here, there is no evidence, much less argument, that Debtors acted inequitably, or that secured or unsecured creditors were harmed. Indeed, Debtors appear to have made nearly four years of post-petition mortgage payments between the December 2013 filing date and September 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   This mortgage debt is already statutorily excepted from discharge by \u00a7 1328(c).

Bankr. Inst. J. 20 (May 2018) citing H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 117 (1977). The reason for a default on payments to be made directly to a secured creditor outside of the plan may have nothing to do with whether a debtor has completed all payments under the plan and has paid unsecured creditors what they would be entitled to under the plan, or, at a minimum the amount that the unsecured creditors would have received in a Chapter 7 liquidation, which is a requirement to confirm the Chapter 13 plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A secured creditor who is receiving direct payments under Section 1322(b)(5) is not materially affected by the Chapter 13 discharge.

The secured creditor also retains its interest in the subject collateral and can be paid after a foreclosure. Further, while the debtor makes the payments under the plan, the pre-petition arrears owing to the secured creditor are being paid through the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The debtor, on the other hand, may have any number of reasons for defaulting on the mortgage payments that were to have been paid outside the plan. For example, there could be a change in financial condition, such as loss of employment. Regardless of the circumstance, it is also possible, as happened here, that the Debtors make all the payments required through the confirmed plan, but a delinquency in the mortgage payments occurs after completion of the plan duration, but before the secured creditor responds to the Chapter 13 trustee's inquiry under Rule 3002.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Amended First Modified Plan\n   </em>\n   was confirmed by stipulated order on November 28, 2016 and increased the total number of months for the plan duration from thirty-one to forty-one months.

The forty-first month was scheduled to be May 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel for the secured creditor filed a Response to the Trustee's Notice of Final Cure Payment on May 1, 2018 and stated that the post-petition mortgage payments are in default for September 2017. Curiously, that date is approximately four months\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Debtors should have made their last payment to Trustee Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Trustee Brown acknowledges that Debtors made all payments that were required to be paid to his office, yet he seeks dismissal of the bankruptcy case without a discharge. This is a draconian and unfair result based on the facts of this case where Debtors have made all the payments required under the confirmed Amended Modified Chapter 13 plan and apparently did not default on their post-petition mortgage payments until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the 41-month plan was complete, i.e., the creditor's Response to Trustee's Notice of Final Cure of Prepetition Arrears on Mortgage Claim reflects a default date that was beyond the plan term. Especially because the secured creditor received the benefit of the Chapter 13 plan by receiving payments to cure arrears of over $ 15,000 on the mortgage. The secured creditor also retained, and continues to retain, its lien on the subject real property, and once this case is closed, will be able to foreclose under state law. The Court does not see how the secured creditor has been harmed in this case. In fact, the only ones who will be harmed are Debtors who have made all their Chapter 13 plan payments if they do not receive their Chapter 13 discharge. Finally, denying Debtors' discharge would be non-sensical here given that Arizona is an anti-deficiency state, meaning that the creditor of Debtors' primary residence only ever had\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   , not\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   , rights and\n   remedies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   It never would have received more distributions whether inside or outside of bankruptcy. Meanwhile, every other creditor received exactly what the Plan proposed to pay them through Trustee Brown.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court recognizes that Debtors in general may have other options, provided they are able to meet the requirements identified in the particular statute under the Code.

However, a hardship discharge is limited to a specific timeframe. \"[A]t any time after the confirmation of the plan ... the court may grant a discharge to a debtor that has not completed payments under the plan....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201328\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

The confirmed plan can last no longer than sixty months from the date of the first payment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(A)(ii). Also, the plan cannot be modified after completion of the payments under such plan. However, Debtors did not request any alternative relief, therefore, the Court will not engage in speculative analysis to determine whether such relief is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Trustee Brown argued that Debtors have defaulted on a material term of the confirmed Plan by failing to complete all required payments, rendering them ineligible for a discharge. But Debtors did pay all payments required to be paid to his office. There is no allegation, much less evidence, of gamesmanship, bad faith, or other mischief with respect to the post-confirmation mortgage payments. Further, in the event of a default, this creditor always was able to seek stay relief to recover its collateral in satisfaction of its claim. Moreover, nothing in the Code or Rules supports dismissal. Under these circumstances the Court finds dismissal without discharge to be an unnecessarily draconian result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As an alternative to seeking dismissal in future similar cases, Trustee Brown is authorized to file Notices of Completed Plan allowing Chapter 13 discharges to be entered when all payments to his office have been paid even though post-petition mortgage payments may be delinquent. Of course, creditors and Chapter 13 Trustees may always move to deny a discharge if evidence of wrongdoing, fraud or other grounds exist. Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   denying the Chapter 13 trustee's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   directing Debtors to complete and file Local Form 2084-6, Certificate of Eligibility for Chapter 13 Discharge After Completion of Plan Payments, after which Trustee Brown must file his Notice of Completed Plan allowing the Chapter 13 discharge to be entered in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter, code, and rule references are to the United States Bankruptcy Code,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -1532, and to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Rules 1001 -9037.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The actual Amended Modified Plan provision is:\n   </p>\n   <pre id=\"p-78\"><strong><em>Post-Petition Mortgage</em></strong> <strong><em>Payments</em></strong> <strong>851.27</strong> [ ] <strong>Debtor will pay direct to</strong> <strong>creditor; or</strong> <strong>[ ] Included in Plan payment.</strong> <strong>Trustee will pay creditor.</strong></pre>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Trustee Brown's First Cure Notice stated that RoundPoint Mortgage was:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    obligated to file with the Bankruptcy Court and serve a statement as a supplement to its proof of claim indicating: (1) whether it agrees that the Debtors have paid in full the amount requited to cure default on the claim; and (2) whether the Debtors otherwise are current on all post-petition payments consistent with \u00a7 1325(b)(5) of the Code.
