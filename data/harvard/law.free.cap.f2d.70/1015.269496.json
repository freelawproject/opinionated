Green was not a resident of the Middle District, but in due course service of such rule was accepted by his attorney, who entered a general appearance for him. On hearing, the referee entered an order directing Green to pay such fund to the trustee. On petition for review, the order of the referee was affirmed by the court below, whereupon this appeal was taken. In view of our case, In re Crosby Stores, Inc., 61 F.(2d) 812, affirmed in Gross v. Irving Trust Co., Trustee, 289 U. S. 342, 53 S. Ct. 605, 77 L. Ed. 1243, and other cases to like effect, the order here complained of was warranted, and accordingly it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
