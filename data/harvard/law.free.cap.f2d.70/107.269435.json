The mortgage, executed in the usual form, was given to secure a loan of $1,800, of which $800 had been repaid prior to bankruptcy. The mortgage contained a description of the property mortgaged, a provision that it should be void provided the mortgagor repaid the money borrowed with interest, and contained an agreement that until default, the mortgagor should possess the mortgaged property, and also an assent to a decree for sale in case of default. The concluding clause of the mortgage, and the certificate of acknowledgment, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">\u201cIn testimony whereof, witness the hand and seal of the said mortgagor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">\u201cJustin G. Bueh, Pres., [Seal] \u201cCharles J. Grasmiek,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-12\">\u201cSec. <em>&amp; </em>Treas. [Seal] \u201c[Corporation Seal.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-13\">\u201cTest: Maxine F. Keen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-14\">\u201cState of Maryland, City of Baltimore, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-15\">\u201cI Hereby Certify, that on this Third day of January in the year one thousand nine hundred and Thirty Three before me, a Notary Public of Baltimore of the State of Maryland, in and for the City aforesaid, personally appeared the mortgagor named in the foregoing mortgage and acknowledged the foregoing mortgage to be their act. At the same time \u00e1lso appeared Lulu J. Bueh and Eliose Bueh \u2014 Joint tennants with right of survivorship and not as tennant in common and made oath in due form of law, that the consideration set forth in said mortgage is true and bona fide as therein set forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-17\">\u201cMaugerite Herzog, Notary Public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-18\">\u201c[Notarial Seal]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-19\">For the reasons stated in the exhaustive opinion of the District Judge reported as In re Universal Storage &amp; Transfer Co. (D. C.) 4 F. Supp. 425, we are of opinion that the mortgage is in substantial compliance with the statutory requirements as to acknowledgment, and the judgment of the District Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
