Claims 7, 8, and 12 of said application were allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-25\">Of the claims on appeal, claims 10 and 13 are illustrative and read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-26\">\u201c10. A cellulose ester composition containing an aryl sulphonyl derivative of an acetylated amine.\u201d ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-27\">\u201c13. A composition of matter containing, a material having the following structural formula:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-28\">R_N_S02. Aryl. \\ R'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-31\">\u201cWhere \u2018R\u2019 is an aromatic or aliphatic nucleus, \u2018R\" is an acetyl radical and \u2018Aryl\u2019 is an aromatic nucleus, and one of the group consisting of: 'Cellulose esters and cellulose ethers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-32\">The reference relied upon is:</p>\n<p id=\"b948-33\">Schmidt, 758,335, April 26, 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-34\">The alleged invention is thus described in the examiner\u2019s statement, which description was adopted by the hoard in its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-35\">\u201cThe invention relates to plasticizers for cellulose esters and ethers and comprises the use of paratoluene sulfonyl aeetanilid or par-atoluene sulfonyl n-ethyl acetamid for that purpose. These were designated generieally as aryl sulfonyl derivatives of acetylated aromatic or aliphatic amines. The same thing is expressed by a type structural formula in Claims 13,14 and 15.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-36\">The examiner rejected the claims on appeal, as well as claim 12, upon the reference cited, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-37\">\u201cThe rejected claims cover broadly the compound including \u2014 N:(CH3CO)X, X be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>ing any aliphatic or aromatic radicle whatsoever. The facts presented do not support the patentability of such a broad of indefinite concept. It is impossible to imagine all the possible variations. Such variations must necessarily produce marked changes in the physical characteristics of the product, as evidenced by the table on page 2 of Schmidt\u2019s patent. Whether such changes would result in an operative product or one patentable over Schmidt\u2019s disclosure it is impossible to determine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">The Board of Appeals affirmed the examiner in his rejection of the claims on appeal, but allowed claim 12 on the ground that it was more restricted than claims 10 and 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The reference Schmidt is a patent for the use of aryl sulfonyl compositions as substitutes for camphor plasticizers for nitro cellulose.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Appellants insist that they are not attempting to claim an extremely broad range of sulphonyl compounds, such as is covered by the Schmidt patent, but that they are only embracing a relatively limited improvement group which may properly be covered in an improvement patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Whether the claims here involved are so broad and indefinite as to preclude their pat-entability, in view of appellants\u2019 disclosure and the reference Schmidt, is a highly technical question involving an expert knowledge of chemistry, and the well-established rule is here especially applicable that concurring decisions of the Patent Office tribunals will be followed by us unless such decisions are manifestly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Appellants\u2019 counsel in his brief has comprehensively stated the reasons which, in his judgment, demonstrate that the Board of Appeals and the examiner were in error in their conclusions; but it is not manifest to us that error was committed by them. It may be true, as appellants\u2019 counsel contends, that they could not more narrowly define their invention in claims that would properly protect their invention, but we are not convinced that this is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Appellants have been allowed three claims, and, as we do not find that the Board of Appeals was manifestly wrong in rejecting the claims here involved, its decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">HATFIELD, Associate Judge, did not participate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
