The instruction objected to was to the effect that if the jury found the transaction to be what the defendants contended it was, that is, that the purchase of the company\u2019s stock was by and for the company, and that the loan for such purchase was made by the bank to and for the company, that in that event the stock of the company so purchased would not be security for the loan so made. This for the reason no doubt that the effect of the purchase by the company of its own stock was to retire the stock. The appellant in his brief did not discuss the numerous California decisions cited by the government sustaining the rule of law stated by the court in its instruction, and only mentioned one of them. It is sufficient now to say that the point now urged was expressly waived by the able attorney, now deceased, who represented the appellant at the trial. He stated: \u201cI am not asking the court at this time to1 change its statement of law, but I did wish the court to instruct the jury as to whether or not that fact would affect any witness who did not have knowledge of the' fact that that was the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">A majority of the court think the petition should be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
