This petition to review the order of November 4,1933, presents no question of law, for that order was undoubtedly entered in the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion and for the reason that no appeal had been taken from the order of December 27, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">In this petition for leave to appeal the bankrupt does not .question the authority of the District Court to enter the order of November 4, 1933, but seeks thereby to circumvent the provisions of section 25a and obtain a review of the orders of December 27, 1930, and October 7, 1933, from which no appeals were taken. By failing to appeal under section 25a he lost his right to a review by this court of the matters involved in those orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">The petition for leave to appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
