On July 8, 1933, the plaintiffs filed a second amended petition. On the 31st day of October, 1933, the court entered an order striking the second amended petition from the files.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-29\">The plaintiffs have undertaken to appeal from the last-mentioned order. Such order was in effect an order sustaining a demurrer to the amended petition. See AEtna Life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Ins. Co. v. Phillips (C. C. A. 10) 69 F.(2d) 901 (decided March 21, 1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">No judgment was entered dismissing either the amended petition or the second amended petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">It is well settled that an order sustaining a demurrer to a petition is not a final order within the meaning of 28 USCA \u00a7 225. Dyar v. McCandless (C. C. A. 8) 33 F.(2d) 578; Missouri &amp; K. I. Ry. Co. v. Olathe, 222 U. S. 185, 32 S. Ct. 46, 56 L. Ed. 155; Darling Lumber Co. v. Porter (C. C. A. 5) 256 F. 455. The proper procedure is for the plaintiffs to elect to stand upon their petition and to let a final judgment of dismissal be entered against them. An appeal will then lie from such final order and the ruling on the demurrer may be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The order sought to be appealed from here not being a final order, this court is without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and it is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
