S. Donnelly, Esq., 728 Ford Building, Detroit, Michigan, Counsel for Adah Mae Dare.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-37\">At the hearing before us no counsel appeared representing appellee, and the case was submitted, so far as she was concerned, upon the brief filed in her behalf. This brief states that \u201cthe motion to dismiss [the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>peal] is now urged,\u201d and it is argued that the affidavit of appellee\u2019s counsel made out a prima facie ease of failure to comply with rule 153 (a) of the Patent Office, so that the burden rested upon appellant to make a showing as to proof of service and compliance with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The rule alluded to, 153 (a), reads: \u201cEvery paper filed in the Patent Office in contested cases must be served as provided in rule 154 (b). This includes all appeals in such eases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Rule 154 (b) provides different methods for serving notices \u201cfor taking testimony or for motions,\u201d the fourth method being that of \u201ctransmission by registered letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Assuming that the foregoing rules apply to appeals to this court, it is our opinion that the affidavit of counsel for appellee, to the effect that no copy was personally served upon him, or received by him, is not sufficient to overcome the presumption that a notice was, in fact, mailed to him in accordance with the rule, as stated in the excerpt quoted by the commissioner, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Accordingly, the motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The application of appellee is for registration of a composite mark which, it is alleged, has been used by her since April 3, 1930, as a trade-mark for skin cream, skin tonics, astringents, muscle oil, and oil lotions for smoothing and softening the skin.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The mark has a fanciful border surrounding an ornamental background whereon there is a silhouette of the head and shoulders of a young woman. Below the silhouette in somewhat fanciful type, arranged diagonally, are the words \u201cVirginia Dare,\u201d with what seems to be a representation of a flower beneath the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">In the notice of opposition appellant alleged the use, ownership, and registration by it of the notation \u201cVirginia Dare\u201d as a trademark for \u201csoft drinks, food flavoring extracts, syrups for making soft drinks, concentrates and emulsions, de-aleoholized wine, and wine,\u201d beginning at a date long prior to April 3, 1930. Five registrations were specifically pleaded, to wit, Nos. 88,670 of October 15,1912; 119,692 of December 11,1917; 124,841 of March 18, 1919; 125,430' of May 20, 1919, and 129,358 of February 17, 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Ownership of the first two of the foregoing registrations is alleged to have been acquired by appellant, a corporation of the state of New York, by the transfer of same, in connection with the business, to it by its predecessor in business, Garrett &amp; Co., also a corporation of the state of New York, which originally registered them, and which seems still to retain some character of rights therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">The three latter registrations were made by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">Appellant alleges that \u201cVirginia Dare\u201d is the dominant feature of its corporate name, and that confusion as to origin of appellee\u2019s goods will result from appellee\u2019s adoption and use of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">The marks are substantially similar, \u201cVirginia Dare\u201d being a prominent \u2014 perhaps the dominant \u2014 part of each.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">In addition to the registrations specifically pleaded in its notice of opposition, appellant introduced two other registrations upon which it relies, the first of these being the notation \u201cVirginia Dare\u201d for a \u201cTonic Laxative,\u201d No. 188,666, of September 2,1924, and the latter being \u201cGerm-A-Foam\u201d for \u201cAntiseptic and Deodorant Compound,\u201d No. 198,853, of May 26,1925. In connection with the latter, there was introduced, as an exhibit, a label having reading matter thereon, a portion of which is \u201cVirginia Dare Germ-A-Foam The Ideal Healing Antiseptic and Deodorant.\u20191\u2019 In this label arrangement the trade-mark \u201cGerm-A-Foam\u201d is made the prominent feature.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-18\">There is testimony in the record that Garrett &amp; Co. began using the mark, \u201cVirginia Dare,\u201d on wines manufactured by it, as early as 1891. A witness who, at the time of testifying, was an executive of Garrett <em>&amp; </em>Co., stated that: \u201c * * * we adopted the name Virginia Dare,\u2019 the association being that Virginia Dare was the first white child bom in America and tradition had it that she was bom under an old Seuppemong vine growing on Maneto Island off the coast of North Carolina, from which vine we were buying the grapes every year which went into the production of the wine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-20\">Subsequent to the federal prohibition amendment, and laws passed in pursuance thereof, appellant applied the mark to nonalcoholic beverages and materials therefor, and flavoring extracts, as named in its notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-21\">Many other registrations and exhibits were made parts of the record, but the foregoing are all that appear to require specific mention here.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-22\">In the view which we take of the case, consideration of the use by appellant of the notation \u201cVirginia Dare\u201d in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the registered trade-mark \u201cGerm-A-Foam\u201d becomes of importance, since we are of the opinion that the goods upon which \u201cGerm-A-Foam\u201d is used are of the same descriptive properties as those for use upon which appellee seeks to register the mark \u201cVirginia Dare.\u201d Malone v. Horowitz, 41 F.(2d) 414, 17 C. C. P. A. 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">It is not claimed that \u201cVirginia Dare\u201d \u25a0has ever been registered for use as a trademark upon \u201cAntiseptic and Deodorant Compound,\u201d the word \u201cGerm-A-Foam\u201d having been registered expressly for such use, but the evidence is that \u201cthe customary way of identifying [appellant\u2019s] Germ-A-Foam\u201d is by associating Virginia Dare therewith upon the label, the text of which label has been quoted supra. In other words, the label shows the product to be Virginia Dare Germ-A-Foam. This, particularly when used in connection with appellant\u2019s corporate name, \u201cVirginia Dare Extract Company,\u201d serves to denote origin of the product in appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">It has been often held by this court, following the decisions of other courts, that the right to oppose a proposed registration does not necessarily depend upon the opposer\u2019s using the proposed word as a technical trademark. California Cyanide Co. v. American Cyanamid Co., 40 F.(2d) 1003, 17 C. C. P. A. 1198; Bookman v. Oakland Chemical Co., 40 F.(2d) 1006, 17 C. C. P. A. 1213; Johnson v. Brandau, 32 App. D. C. 348; Atlas Underwear Co. v. B. V. D. Co., 48 App. D. C. 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">It is true that, in the first three cases just cited, the proposed marks were found to be descriptive of the goods to which it was proposed to apply them, and registration was denied for that reason, but the right of one who was using such words to oppose was distinctly upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In the last-named (Atlas Underwear Co.) case, however, nothing is said of the mark being descriptive, and the right to oppose registration without showing trade-mark use by opposer was upheld, numerous authorities being cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">In the case of Touraine Co. v. E. B. Washburn &amp; Co., 52 App. D. C. 356, 358, 286 F. 1020, 1022, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, in an opposition proceeding, declared: \u201cOf course, a trade-mark use of a mark is not necessary in a proceeding of this kind. If the opposer can show in any way that he would probably be damaged by its registration to the applicant he may do so. The trade-mark statute (section 6, 33 Stat. 726 [Comp. St. \u00a7 9491 (15 US CA \u00a7 86)]) is our chart. There is nothing in it which says that a person must own a trade-mark, registered or not, before he can oppose the registration of the mark to another person. All that the statute requires of him, according to our interpretation, is to prove facts which, if true, would tend to show that he would probably be damaged by the registration. Skene v. Marinello Co., 270 F. 701, 50 App. D. C. 265; McIlhenny Co. v. Trappey, 277 F. 615, 61 App. D. C. 216.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Without discussing other phases of the ease and without reference to whether other goods upon which appellant uses its registered mark \u201cVirginia Dare\u201d are of the same descriptive properties as the goods of appellee, we think the registration sought should be denied upon the use shown by appellant of the word in connection with Germ-A-Foam. Confusion of origin in the mind of the public, to the damage of appellant, would seem likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">BLAND and HATFIELD, Associate Judges, coneur in the conclusion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
