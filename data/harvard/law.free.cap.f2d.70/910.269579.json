A sheet of paper having a line upon which the same is adapted to be tom to form a stub and a savings check, said check having a printed column at one end including a plurality of consecutive transverse spaces for the entry of savings amounts, and totaling spaces at the bottom of said column, said check having instructions to transfer the totals of the column to the credit of the drawer of the cheek, said cheek being printed with a line for the signature of the drawer and with the usual data of a savings cheek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-9\"><em>\u201c2. </em>A cheek book having a plurality of stubs and cheeks detachably attached to said stubs, each stub being provided with data including a line designated balance brought forward, a line designated amount deposited, a line beneath the last named line designated total, a line beneath the last named line designated less check, a line beneath the last named line designated balance, a line beneath the last named line designated less cents for savings, and a line beneath the last named line designated balance carried forward, and a savings check and stub bound in the book under the above named stubs and cheeks, said savings check having data for writing a savings check and provided with a separate space for each preceding stub for writing the amount of the less cents for savings from each preceding stub.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">All the claims were rejected by the Examiner of the Unite.d States Patent Office upon prior art, and also upon the ground that they do not cover subject-matter which falls within Rev. St. \u00a7 4886 (35 USCA \u00a7 31), and hence cannot be protected by a patent. Each of claims 2, 3, and 4 was also held to cover an aggregation, and they were disallowed for that additional reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">Upon appeal the Board of Appeals approved all the foregoing grounds of rejection and affirmed the decision of the Examiner. Prom the decision of the Board, the instant appeal to this court was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">The references cited are a patent to Wat-rous, No. 1,370,936, of March 6, 1921, and a patent to Sterling (applicant herein), No. 1,423,744, of July 25, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">The claims themselves are clear, in their description of the alleged invention. Two types of cheeks with stubs are shown in the drawings, as figures 1 and 2, respectively. The first is an ordinary bank cheek with stub, the stub having, in addition to the usual lines showing \u201cBal. bro\u2019t forward,\u201d \u201cAmt. deposited,\u201d etc., a line, or space, for noting the amount which it is desired to have transferred from the depositor\u2019s regular checking account to his savings account. This line carries the printed words, \u201cLess Cents for Savings.\u201d Figure 2 shows a check designed for use in directing transfer of funds to the savings account. The drawing itself shows the stub portion of the sheet without printed matter thereon. The check portion of same has upon it the printed words, \u201cSave The Odd Cents,\u201d over a blank rectangle, and helow the rectangle is the printed form for use in directing transfer by the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">Exhibits of sheets and of cheek books, said to comprise samples of the ecimmercial form of the claimed invention, were placed in evidence. These show different forms of printed matter on different savings cheeks and stubs thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">In a third figure of appellant\u2019s drawings there is shown an arrangement whereby the respective checks and stubs depicted in figures 1 and 2 are bound together in a cheek book.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-17\">The physical exhibits of these complete check books presented show that the idea is to insert a \u201csavings\u201d check with its stub, after a batch of \u201cregular\u201d cheeks. In one instance the savings check follows a batch of 12 regular checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-18\">The device, it may be conceded, presents an ingenious and convenient arrangement for those desiring to do business in the manner which it suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-19\">The drawings of the patent to Watrous disclose a printed form of \u201csavings\u201d cheek and stub thereof, bound in usual cheek book form, with a number of ordinary cheeks. The printed matter on the savings sheet differs from that on the sheet of applicant, but physically the sheet is much the same. The specification of Watrous recites: \u201cMy invention contemplates the insertion at intervals in the cheek book of a novel form of savings transfer blank or form 9, having certain subject matter thereon which when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>properly filled in and signed, by a person having a cheeking account and a savings account with the bank issuing the same, becomes an order on the bank to transfer a desired sum of money from the cheeking account of the signer to his savings account. * * * <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The Ejtubs of the conventional checks of the Watrous patent do not seem to show any space or line for noting \u201csavings,\u201d nor do the stubs of his \u201csavings\u201d cheeks contain any \u201codd cents\u201d line.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The drawings of the patent to Sterling show conventional cheeks with stubs, having therebetween a \u201ccoupon\u201d for use in directing transfer of funds to a savings account. The coupon is rendered easily detachable by having the usual perforated lines between it and the stub, and between it and the check. The stub in this patent has a line for noting the amount ordered transferred by the corresponding savings coupon.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">It seems perfectly evident to us, from the disclosures of the prior art above recited, that appellant does not here present anything patentable thereover.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Considering claim 1, supra, by itself, it being confined solely to the sheet for the savings cheek and stub, the physical structure is practically the same as the corresponding physical structure of Watrous. The language printed upon the respective cheeks and stubs differs^ but we have held in a number of eases that the mere arrangement of printed matter on a sheet or sheets of paper does not constitute patentable subject-matter. In re Russell, 48 F.(2d) 668, 18 C. C. P. A. 1184, and In re Reeves, 62 F.(2d) 199, 20 C. C. P. A. 767, are eases in point, and, if arrangement of printed matter may not constitute patentable novelty, it would seem obvious that the substance or language of that which is printed may not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">It is to be borne in mind that, so far as the conventional or \u201cregular\u201d cheeks and stubs used in appellant\u2019s folder, or check book, are concerned, there is no claim for them per se. Admittedly they are old in the art. The stub of the check in appellant\u2019s own prior patent, cited as a reference, shows all the usual lines and printed matter, and, in addition thereto, a line for inserting the amount transferred to the savings account. Indeed, the conventional cheek and stub sheets of appellant\u2019s book here at issue are substantially the same as those in his prior patent, except the patent contains the \u201ccoupon\u201d feature above described.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">The only way in which the conventional check is here involved is as a feature or ele-. ment of the alleged combination claimed in claims 2, 3, and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">These three claims are for the cheek book, or folder, comprising the conventional cheeks and savings cheeks bound together, the savings cheeks inserted at regular intervals as above described. This arrangement seems to have been the essential feature of the teaching of Watrous, as expressed in the language of his specification quoted, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">The rejection of the claims upon prior art seems to us to have been correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">As for the second ground of rejection, viz., that the subject-matter does not come within the purview of section 4886, Revised Statutes (35 USCA \u00a7 31), we deem it proper to say that we understand the Board\u2019s holding thereon applies solely to the printed matter upon the sheets, and, under this interpretation, we are in agreement therewith. Such holding is in entire accord with the rule announced by this court and others, as well as by the tribunals of the Patent Office, in a number of recent eases. In re Dixon, 44 F.(2d) 881, 18 C. C. P. A. 711; In re Clark, 58 F.(2d) 455, 19 C. C. P. A. 1166; Boggs v. Robertson (Dis. Col. Sup. Ct.) 13 U. S. Pat. Q. 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">The foregoing cases and numerous eases cited therein are authorities for holding that patentable novelty cannot be predicated upon printing alone, but must reside in physical structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">The opinion in the frequently cited case of Cincinnati Traction Co. v. Pope (C. C. A.) 210 F. 443, discussed by us in the case of In re McKee, 64 F.(2d) 379, 20 C. C. P. A. 1018, has, we think, been sometimes misunderstood or misconstrued. The'street railroad transfer ticket there involved had printed matter upon it arranged so as to adapt it readily and conveniently to the definite uses described in the opinion, but the court did not rest, its decision upholding the validity of the patent upon the printing, or the arrangement thereof, but stated specifically: \u201cThe device of the patent clearly involves physical structure. The claims themselves are, in a proper sense, limited to such structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-16\">If the check and stub structure here in- \u2022 volved presented some new and useful physical form with the printed matter adjusted to such form, as was the situation with reference to the transfer ticket, a different question would confront us, in view of the doctrine of the Traction Co. Case, supra, and kindred eases, such as Rand, McNally &amp; Co. v. Exchange Scrip-Book Co. (C. C. A.) 187 F. 984; Benjamin Menu Card Co. v. Rand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>McNally <em>&amp; </em>Co. et al. (C. C.) 210 F. 285, and others which might he cited, hut such is not the situation. The general physical structure of appellant is admittedly old, and such modifications in the adjustment of printed matter thereto as he discloses are mere obvious arrangements of the printing.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">Counsel for appellant in argument before us, after asserting that \u201cWatrous ha\u00e1 no new \u2018physical structure\u2019 in the Patent Office use of the term,\u201d asks, \u201cWhy should a patent be granted to Watrous and a patent to Sterling be refused?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">There are two obvious answers to the query. First, the validity of the Watrous patent is not involved here. So far as this court is concerned, it must, in this proceeding, be taken as valid. So taking it, it constitutes an anticipation of appellant\u2019s claims as to the purely physical structure. Second, were we at liberty to proceed upon the hypothesis that the patent is invalid because not presenting patentable matter, appellant\u2019s claims should be now rejected for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">The same reasoning applies to what is said of appellant\u2019s own prior patent in comparison with his instant application.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">We do not deem it necessary to pass upon the question of aggregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">HATFIELD, Associate Judge, did not participate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
