He applied to the District Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari, but that was denied. He is now prosecuting this appeal from the denial of the writ by Judge Johnson. In the U. S. v. Chambers Case, 54 S. Ct. 434, 436, 78 L. Ed \u2014, 89 A. L. R. 1510, the Supreme Court expressly excluded from the scope of that opinion persons who were serving sentences upon final judgments. It said: \u201cWe are not dealing with a case where final judgment was rendered prior to that ratification. Such a ease would present a distinct question which is not before us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>However, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia had that exact question, here involved, before it in the case of Irvin Ellerbe v. A. C. Aderhold, Warden of the United States Penitentiary at Atlanta, Ga., 5 F. Supp. 1022, 1023, and held in an opinion filed February <em>29, </em>1934, that the repeal of the National Prohibition Act \u201cdid not void the judgment (final) of the court nor operate as a pardon.\u201d The law seems to be well settled that a repeal, after final judgment, will 'neither vacate the judgment nor arrest the execution of a sentence partly executed under that judgment. In re Kline, 70 Ohio St. 25, 70 N. E. 511, 1 Ann. Cas. 219; State v. Addington, 2 Bailey (S. C.) 516, 23 Am. Dec. 150; Ex parte Andres, 91 Tex. Cr. R. 98, 237 S. W. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">The District Judge did not err in denying the writ of habeas corpus, and his order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
