His last entry was at the port of New York in October, 1931, on returning from a visit abroad. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty to an indictment charging perjury committed within the state of Illinois in 1927 and 1928 in violation of section 23 of the Act of June 29,1906 (8 USCA \u00a7 414). His perjury consisted in falsely stating that he was unmarried in a verified petition for naturalization filed on August 29, 1927, and in repeating the same false statement under oath at a hearing on said petition on March 1, 1928.- He was convicted in May, 1932, and the Conviction was affirmed in Roberto v. United States, 60 F.(2d) 774 (C. C. A. 7). At the hearings before the immigration inspector in 1933, he again admitted the commission of the aforesaid perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-23\">It cannot be successfully contended that perjury is not a crime \u201cinvolving moral turpitude.\u201d Masaichi Ono v. Carr, 56 F.(2d) 772, 774 (C. C. A. 9). Nor does the relator deny that the above-quoted portion of section 19 is applicable to his last entry in 1931 and may include a crime committed in this country; this was settled <em>by </em>United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>v. Smith, 289 U. S. 422, 425, 53 S. Ct. 665, 77 L. Ed. 1298. He does argue, however, that the specified conditions of the statute have not been fulfilled because neither his conviction nor his admission of guilt was pri- or to his last entry. In other words, he contends that the statute requires (1) conviction prior to entry, or (2) admission prior to entry of the commission of a crime. Such a construction seems to us consistent neither with the language nor with the purpose of the statute. It will be noted that conviction is referred to as an event which has already occurred prior to entry, \u201cany alien who was convicted,\u201d while admission of guilt is referred to in the present tense, \u201cor who admits the commission, prior to entry, of a felony.\u201d 8 USCA \u00a7 155. Had it been intended to provide that the alien must admit guilt prior to entry, the natural language to have used would be \u201cor who has admitted, prior to entry, the commission of a felony.\u201d As it stands, we read the phrase \u201cprior to entry\u201d as modifying the word \u201ccommission.\u201d The obvious purpose of the statute supports this' construction. Its object is to rid the United States of undesirable aliens, and it puts in that class those who have committed crimes of moral turpitude prior to entry. This is to be proved to the officials administering the statute by conviction (if the alien \u201cwas convicted\u201d) or by his admission- (if he \u201cadmits the commission\u201d). The admission is treated as evidence of guilt tantamount to conviction, and no reason is apparent for requiring the admission to be made before entry. See United States v. Williams, 206 F. 538, 541 (C. C. A. 2). It is not the admission but the crime previously committed which makes the alien an undesirable. In several cases the construction we adopt has been assumed without discussion. United States v. Palmer, 67 F.(2d) 146 (C. C. A. 7); United States v. Day, 35 F.(2d) 284, 286 (C. C. A. 3); Howes v. Tozer, 3 F.(2d) 849, 852 (C. C. A. 1); Gomes v. Tillinghast, 37 F.(2d) 935, 936 (D. C. Mass.); United States v. Brooks, 284 F. 908, 910 (D. C. E. D. Mich.).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The appellant further contends that the alien\u2019s marital status was not a material issue in the naturalization proceeding and hence his false oath did not amount to perjury. The statute (8 USCA \u00a7 414) expressly requires the false testimony to relate to a material fact; section 4 (8 USCA \u00a7 379) prescribes the contents of the petition for naturalization, requiring the name of the applicant's wife, if he is married, and section 27 (8 USCA \u00a7 409) sets out the form of the petition, such form containing a question as to marriage. That his marital status is a material matter seems beyond question. See United States v. Dupont, 176 F. 823 (D. C. Or.); United States v. Albertini, 206 F. 133 (D. C. Mont.); United States v. Marcus, 1 F. Supp. 29 (D. C. N. J.); Roberto v. United States, 60 F.(2d) 774, 775 (C. C. A. 7), affirming the conviction of this very alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
