The only-error assigned is the refusal of the trial court to give the peremptory instruction on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The bill of exceptions discloses that a deposition was filed in evidence, but what was contained in it is not made to appear; nor is it shown by recital or otherwise that the bill of exceptions contains all the evidence. In this state of the record the assignment of error cannot be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
