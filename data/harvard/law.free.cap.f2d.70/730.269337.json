The petition is vague as to the purposes of \u25a0 the examination except as to the homestead^ and as to it appears to be based only on information derived from a newspaper article. A creditor has no absolute right to examine any one under 11 USCA \u00a7 44 (a), but the exercise of the power there granted lies in the discretion of the court. In re Andrews (D. C.) 130 F. 383; In re Weidenfeld (C. C. A.) 254 F. 677; In re National Grain Corporation (C. C. A.) 299 F. 597. The long delay and laches of the creditor and the absence of any definite and reliable showing as to what facts would be proven put this ease within the rule of discretion unabused.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-26\">The application for appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
