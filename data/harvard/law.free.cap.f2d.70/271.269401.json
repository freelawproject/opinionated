Evarts, of New York City, of counsel), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b299-22\">Before GBAHAM, Presiding Judge, and BLAND, GABBETT, and LENBOOT, Associate Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b299-23\">GBAHAM, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b299-24\">The appellant filed its application in the United States Patent Office on March 2, 1931, for the registration of a trade-mark used by the appellant in connection with the sale of a laxative prepared with chocolate. The mark sought to be registered was the compound word \u201cTasty-Lax Laxative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-25\">The Examiner required the disclaimer of the word \u201cLaxative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-26\">The appellee, Green Bros. Company, filed notice of opposition to the trade-mark registration, the ground of the opposition being that the opposer was the owner of, and had used, the trade-mark \u201cTastyeast\u201d in connection with the sale of a chocolate-coated yeast, claimed to possess certain therapeutic properties, and that said mark had been used by the opposer in its business, in interstate commerce, since May 11, 1927. The opposer also alleged that the goods of the parties were of the same descriptive properties, and that the registration which was sought would be likely to cause damage to the opposer.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-27\">The applicant thereupon moved to dismiss the notice of opposition upon the face of the record, alleging that there was no similarity of the marks, either as to sound or appearance, shown. The motion to dismiss was denied, and the applicant filed an answer denying the material allegations of the notice. Registration was refused by the Examiner of Interferences, and upon appeal this decision was affirmed by the Assistant Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-28\">The mark \u201cTastyeast\u201d was registered in the United States Patent Office on February 20, 1905, and was accompanied by a disclaimer as to the syllable \u201cTast\u201d and the word \u201cY\u00e9ast\u201d apart from the mark as shown. \u2022No testimony was taken by the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-29\">In view of the recent announcements of this court, it cannot be doubted that, so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>as this jurisdiction is concerned, the goods are of the same descriptive properties. Both products are claimed to have therapeutic and medicinal values. Whether yeast is, or is not, a laxative, as is argued by counsel, is not important, in the view we take of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The following goods have been held by us to be of the same descriptive properties: A mouth wash and general antiseptic and cold creams, and the like, Malone v. Horowitz, 41 F.(2d) 414, 17 C. C. P. A. 1252; a preparation to remove substances from toilet bowls and a liquid preparation for cleaning fabrics, Langfield v. Solvit-All Corp., 49 F.(2d) 480, 18 C. C. P. A. 1313; medicines and foods for bird and animal pets, Heger Products Co. v. Polk Miller Prod. Corp., 47 F.(2d) 966, 18 C. C. P. A. 1106; a liquid disinfectant and soap powder, The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. J. L. Prescott Co., 49 F.(2d) 959, 18 C. C. P. A. 1433; coal and fuel oil, Harlan-Wallis Coal Corp. v. Trans. Oil Co., 64 F.(2d) 122, 20 C. C. P. A. 944; sanitary napkins and antiseptic powder, Rotex Surg. Ap. Co. v. Kotex Co., 44 F.(2d) 879, 18 C. C. P. A. 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">It is argued by appellant that, inasmuch as the opposer has disclaimed the parts of its mark \u201cTast\u201d and \u201cYeast,\u201d there is no confusing similarity between the two marks, \u201cTasty-Lax\u201d and \u201cTastyeast.\u201d In view of the character of the mark which the appellant seeks to register, it will not be necessary to discuss further the question of confusing similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The mark which the appellant seeks to register, \u201cTasty-Lax,\u201d is, clearly, descriptive, and hence may not he registered, in view of the language \u201cof section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, as amended (15 USCA \u00a7 85). The common meaning of the noun \u201clax,\u201d as defined by Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (1932) is: \u201cAn aperient; a laxative.\u201d Both syllables of the compound word exactly describe the qualities of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The right, ex parte, of an applicant to register his mark, may he disposed of in an opposition proceeding. California Cyanide Co. v. American Cyanamid Co., 40 F.(2d) 1003, 17 C. C. P. A. 1198; Etablissements Rene Beziers, etc., v. Reid, Murdoch <em>&amp; </em>Co., 48 F.(2d) 946, 18 C. C. P. A. 1340; California Canneries Co. v. Lushus Products Co., 49 F.(2d) 1044, 18 C. C. P. A. 1480.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">While our conclusion is based upon somewhat different ground, we conclude that the decision of the Commissioner of Patents in refusing registration is correct, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Affirmed,</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">HATFIELD, Associate Judge, did not participate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
