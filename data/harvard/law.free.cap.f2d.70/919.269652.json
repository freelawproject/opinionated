The main differences reside in a cross-strap between the shoulder straps which is a feature illustrated in similar garments in patents to Vizzard and Dreyfus and in a pocket arranged on the bib of the overalls having an overlapping flap for the top of the pocket, quite similar to the pocket illustrated in the patent to Williamson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-31\">\u201cWhile the pocket illustrated in the present design has the flap cover extending only over a portion of the top in order to allow an open space at one side, this is clearly for the purpose of allowing a rule or instrument of some sort to be placed in the pocket which is longer than the depth of the pocket. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-32\">\u201cWe find that the differences over the Charles Williams Stores overalls are not such as would appeal to the eye and certainly in view of the other art made of record it would not involve invention to provide a cross-strap between the shoulder straps of the former construction and a pocket of the character shown, on the front of the bib of the overalls.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-33\">Counsel for appellant earnestly contend in a carefully prepared brief that, although the garment disclosed in the Williams Stores catalogue has the \u201cgeneral configuration of applicant's design, * * * it does not show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>the straps connected by a cross piece or the bib provided with a poeket having a flap portion extending short of one end thereof\u201d; that the tribunals of the Patent Office were compelled to rely upon three references in rejecting appellant\u2019s application; and that when considered as a whole, appellant\u2019s design is distinctly different from those shown in the references.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">We agree that no one reference anticipates appellant\u2019s design; that it is novel; and that as the term \u201cornamental\u201d is relative, it may be argued with some plausibility that it also possesses that characteristic. However, in order to be patentable, a design must-have required the exercise of the inventive faculties to produce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Assuming that appellant\u2019s design is both ornamental and novel, we are of opinion, nevertheless, that it is not substantially different from the prior art shown in the references, and that it did not require the exercise of the inventive faculties to produce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">We are in accord with the conclusion reached by the tribunals of the Patent Office. The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
