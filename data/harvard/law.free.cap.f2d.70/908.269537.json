Specimens of the mark which appear in the record show that it is used in conjunction with the representation of the head of a boy; the hair in said representation being colored red.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The opposer (appellee) filed notice of opposition, setting up the use of the marks \u201cHa Dees\u201d and the conventional representation of a devil\u2019s head, as applied to automobile heaters of the same class since 1927. It also set fortha three registrations which it owns \u2014 No. 241,503 of May 1,1928, No. 279',286 of January 13, 1931, and No. 272,813 of July 15, 1930. The first of said registrations is for the mark \u201cHa Dees\u201d for automobile heaters and parts or accessories therefor; the second is for the same mark applied to space heaters, generally of a type through which steam or hot water is passed to deliver heat therefrom, and parts or accessories therefor; the third is for the representation of a devil\u2019s head, having the conventional hood and horns an(l spouting fire, applied to automobile heaters and parts or accessories therefor. The notice of opposition contained the usual allegations that confusion would be likely between the goods of the parties if appellant\u2019s registration were allowed, and that appellee would be damaged by such registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">The parties took no testimony, but a stipulation of facts was made in the Patent Office, which stipulation appears in the record and is accurately summarized in t\u00a3e decision of the Commissioner as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-8\">\u201cNeither party has taken testimony; but in lieu thereof a stipulation has been submitted which is to the effect that the goods are the same in character, that the opposer was several years prior in the field in the use of its mark upon its goods, that opposer has widely advertised its goods under its marks as shown in opposer\u2019s exhibits Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and that it has sold its goods through dealers and jobbers generally fin that portion of the United States in which automobile heaters are used.\u2019 It is also stipulated that the applicant has widely advertised its goods under its mark here sought to be registered and used in connection with the pictorial representation of the head of a boy having red hair.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">It may be noted that Appellee\u2019s Exhibits Nos. 1, 2, and 3, above referred to, are, respectively, one of opposer\u2019s advertisements taken from a national trade magazine entitled \u201cMotor Service,\u201d displayed on the front of the December 15, 1929, issue thereof, one of opposer\u2019s 1929 dealer circulars, and one of opposer\u2019s 1931 dealer circulars, said circulars also being advertising matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">The Examiner of Interferences held that the two registrations of the mark \u201cHa Dees\u201d owned by appellee were so different in appearance, sound, and significance as to furnish no basis for sustaining the opposition. As to the third registration, that for the representation of the devil\u2019s head, the Examiner held that confusion would not be likely, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-12\">\u201c * \u2022 * While opposer\u2019s exhibits show that the picture of the Devil in actual use is displayed in red it seems clear to the examiner that it would not be likely to be designated by purchasers as 'Red Head\u2019 but rather by one of the terms by which this imaginary horned-ereature is known, as for example, 'Devil\u2019 or 'Satan,\u2019 and opposer\u2019s use of the notation 'Ha Dees\u2019 with this picture of the 'Devil\u2019 can only tend to impress upon purchasers the significance intended to be conveyed by the picture used by the opposer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">He then proceeded to hold that the marks do not so closely resemble each other as to make confusion likely, dismissed the notice of opposition, and held appellant entitled to register the mark, applied for.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-15\">Upon appeal from this decision of the Examiner, the Commissioner held that confusion was likely, basing his decision on a consideration of only that registration of appellee which relates to the representation of the devil\u2019s head, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-16\">\u201c * s\u2018 - * Obviously but one of opposer\u2019s registrations need be considered, and that is the one for the pictorial representation of a devil\u2019s head. The applicant\u2019s notation 'Red Head\u2019 is fairly descriptive of this mark of the opposer. The words and the pictorial representation are, to the extent they convey the same information, equivalents. Customers do not always see the marks and goods side by side for comparison. The opposer\u2019s picture of a devil\u2019s head has marked and specific differences over the applicant\u2019s notation, but confusion by oral description seems probable. One familiar with opposer\u2019s goods might well describe them as having a mark of a red head or a devil\u2019s red head upon them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Another party seeing or hearing this description might upon noting the applicant\u2019s goods with the words \u2018Bed Head\u2019 upon them readily conclude they had their origin with the op-poser. There is at least a reasonable probability of confusion in trade, and it is thought the applicant should not have adopted terms so aptly descriptive of the opposePs mark. If there is doubt it must following the usual rule be resolved against the newcomer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">He thereupon proceeded to hold that there was likelihood of confusion, sustained the opposition of appellee, and held appellant was not entitled to register the mark applied for.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">We think the Examiner of Interferences came to the right conclusion. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the words \u201cBed Head\u201d are ever used to indicate the head of the devil, and as a matter of common knowledge we would say that said words are never so used. We think that the representation of the head of the devil, as hereinbefore described, with the hood colored red, assuming without deciding that the color may be here considered, would not carry to the purchaser of goods to which the mark was applied the thought of \u201cred head\u201d as descriptive of the mark, and we think that a purchaser would not he likely, upon seeing goods with the mark \u201cBed Head\u201d applied thereto, to confuse said mark with appellee\u2019s mark. In other words, we are not of the opinion that there is likelihood of confusion in trade in the use of the two marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">It is obvious that, if appellee\u2019s said mark of the head of a devil is not confusingly similar to appellant\u2019s mark \u201cBed Head,\u201d when the former mark is used alone, it is likewise not confusingly similar to appellant\u2019s mark \u201cBed Head\u201d when the said mark of a devil\u2019s head is used as a part of a composite mark in which the registered mark \u201cHa Dees\u201d is also used.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">Appellee relies upon our decision in the case of Gilmore Oil Co., Ltd., v. Wolverine-Empire Refining Co., 69 F.(2d) 532, 21 C. C. P. A. -, wherein we held that the representation of a lion\u2019s head, together with the words \u201cLion Head,\u201d was confusingly similar with a representation of a wolf\u2019s head, together with the words \u201cWolf\u2019s Head,\u201d but, in our opinion, the ease at bar is plainly distinguishable from said case. In the case at bar the comparison is between the words \u201cBed Head\u201d or their equivalent, the representation of a red head, and the head of a devil, as hereinbefore described.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">We think it proper to observe further thdt, the marks of both parties being used upon automobile heaters, ordinarily purchased but once during the life of an automobile, purchasers of the article would naturally use a degree of care in their selection greater than would ordinarily be used in the purchase of articles which require frequent replacement. International Silver Co. v. American Silver Co., 37 F.(2d) 622, 17 C. C. P. A. 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">In our opinion the application of appellant for registration of the mark \u201cBed Head\u201d should be allowed and the notice of opposition dismissed. Accordingly, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">Beversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">HATFIELD, Associate Judge, did not participate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
