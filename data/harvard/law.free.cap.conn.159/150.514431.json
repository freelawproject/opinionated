She was represented in the proceedings by a Circuit Court public defender. On October 3, 1967, the Circuit Court committed her to an indeterminate term at the Connecticut State Farm for Women. No question was raised as to the jurisdiction of the court, and no appeal was taken. On June 27,1968, she was paroled in the custody of her parents. On August 6, 1968, she was returned to the Connecticut State Farm for Women as a parole violator. By an application to the Superior Court dated October 3, 1968, signed by Richard T. Meehan, chief public defender of the Circuit Court, as her attorney, the plaintiff sought a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that her confinement at the Connecticut State Farm for Women was illegal \u201cin that her incarceration for a period in excess of one year, is beyond the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court\u201d. The writ issued, the state\u2019s attorney for New London County appeared for the defendant, and, following a hearing, the court adjudged that the plaintiff be enlarged from custody unless, within fourteen days, an, appeal was taken by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The defendant, acting by the state\u2019s attorney, requested certification for an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-470 of the General Statutes. The court granted certification, and the present appeal was taken on behalf of the defendant by the state\u2019s attorney. Pursuant to a request for a finding and draft finding filed by the state\u2019s attorney, the court made a finding. The state\u2019s attorney has taken no further part in the appeal. An assignment of errors was filed by Walter H. Scanlon as assistant chief prosecuting attorney of the Circuit Court. The Superior Court file, which we judicially notice, discloses an appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>anee filed by the state\u2019s attorney for New London County on behalf of the defendant on October 14, 1968, and an appearance for the defendant filed by Dennis F. Gaffney, as assistant chief prosecuting attorney filed on November 1, 1968. We understand Attorney Gaffney to be assistant chief prosecuting attorney of the Circuit Court. The appearances of the state\u2019s attorney and Attorney Gaffney have not been withdrawn. No appearance for the defendant has been filed, either in the Superior Court or in this court, by Walter H. Scanlon, assistant chief prosecuting attorney of the Circuit Court who has assumed to brief and argue the defendant\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Section 54-81a of the General Statutes, as amended by No. 189 of the 1967 Public Acts, authorizes the judges of the Circuit Court to appoint public defenders to defend criminal cases in that court and provides that a public defender appointed by the judges of the Circuit Court may \u201crepresent indigent accused charged under the provisions of chapter 964 in application for writs of habeas corpus under the provisions of section 54-166\u201d. Chapter 964 of the General Statutes is the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, and \u00a7 54-166 authorizes habeas corpus proceedings by persons arrested on an extradition warrant signed by the governor. Section 54-81a conferred no authority on a Circuit Court public defender, in his official capacity, to represent this plaintiff in this application for a writ of habeas corpus. We have recently commented on the anomaly created by \u00a7 54-81a, so far as it does purport to permit the limited appearance specified. <em>Boss </em>v. <em>Hegstrom, </em>157 Conn. 403, 418, 254 A.2d 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>The application for a writ of habeas corpus which the chief public defender of the Circuit Court has filed purports to be at the relation of the plaintiff personally. Habeas corpus is a civil proceeding. As already related, the plaintiff is a minor, and it has long been the established practice, not only in this state but elsewhere, that a minor may bring a civil action only by a guardian or next friend. <em>Lametta </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>139 Conn. 218, 220, 92 A.2d 731; <em>Tulin </em>v. <em>Tulin, </em>124 Conn. 518, 522, 200 A. 819; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Jerman, </em>77 Conn. 374, 380, 59 A. 425; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Cleaveland, 76 </em>Conn. 426, 431, 56 A. 850; <em>McCarrick </em>v. <em>Kealey, </em>70 Conn. 642, 646, 40 A. 603; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Root 200; 43 C.J.S., Infants, \u00a7 103; 42 Am. Jur. 2d, Infants, \u00a7 155; see <em>Judson </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>3 Conn. 579, 584. The transcript of the proceedings in the Superior Court reveals that, at the outset of the hearing, the Circuit Court public defender stated to the court that the plaintiff\u2019s father and mother, who were present, \u201care opposed to this proceeding and would not have acted as guardians and next friend for the daughter in making this petition\u201d. Consequently, he suggested that the court appoint him as guardian ad litem, and the court indicated acquiescence, although no formal order of appointment appears. The Circuit Court chief public defender conceded in oral argument before us that it is his opinion as well as the opinion of the plaintiff\u2019s parents and of those in charge of the Connecticut State Farm for Women that the plaintiff\u2019s best interest would be served by further supervision. The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision states that \u201cthe parents apparently feel that the child would be better protected by further supervision.\u201d The chief public defender represents to us, however, that, although he did not represent her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>in the Circuit Court, the plaintiff sought his advice on her own initiative and that he felt obliged to make the application regardless of the unanimity of feeling, including his own, that it was not in the plaintiff\u2019s best interest to do so. On the plaintiff\u2019s motion, dated November 15, 1968, the Superior Court ordered her discharged from custody under bond pending this appeal, and we are told, in oral argument, that she is now married and pregnant. The circumstances strongly suggest that the officials of the Circuit Court who argue this appeal have the principal interest in the solution of the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The bringing of the action for the minor without the aid of a prochein ami was, however, an amendable irregularity which could be waived. 43 C.J.S., Infants, \u00a7\u00a7108 (b), (d); 42 Am. Jur. 2d, Infants, \u00a7\u00a7 165,166. While a guardian ad litem is technically and usually a special guardian appointed to represent an infant defendant; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>30 Conn. 282, 285; 43 C.J.S., Infants, \u00a7107; 42 Am. Jur. 2d, Infants, \u00a7 157; the trial court indicated a willingness to attempt a repair of the irregularity existing in this case by the appointment of such a guardian for the plaintiff. Since no objection is raised we will treat it as an adequate repair. <em>Apthorp </em>v. <em>Backus, </em>Kirby, 407; 410; see <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Jerman, </em>supra, 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The issue sought to be raised is that the Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to commit the plaintiff to an indeterminate term at the Connecticut State Farm for Women pursuant to either \u00a7 17-379 or \u00a7 17-360 (now \u00a7 18-65) of the General Statutes and that the sentence imposed was, because of General Statutes \u00a7 54-la, invalid as to the portion which exceeded the period of on&amp; year. In a habeas corpus proceeding based on federal constitutional claims it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>is incumbent upon tbe plaintiff to allege in his petition and prove at the habeas corpus hearing that he did not knowingly and deliberately bypass the assertion of those claims in the orderly procedure of a direct appeal. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 439, 83 S. Ct. 822, 9 L, Ed. 2d 837; <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>155 Conn. 316, 319, 232 A.2d 112; <em>Vena </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>154 Conn. 363, 366, 225 A.2d 802. The jurisdictional question now raised for the first time clearly enough existed at the time of the disposition of the plaintiff\u2019s case in the Circuit Court, and no explanation is offered as to why it was not raised in an orderly appeal procedure at that time. The question of the jurisdiction of a court to impose custody or restraint upon an individual is, however, a recognized basis for a collateral attack on the judgment of the court by habeas corpus. <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>155 Conn. 591, 594, 236 A.2d 909. The question has been fully argued before us on facts concerning which there is no dispute, and, under all the circumstances, we have, with some hesitation, decided to disregard the irregularities in procedure. See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>135 Conn. 262, 266, 63 A.2d 589, aff\u2019d, 337 U.S. 901, 69 S. Ct. 1046, 93 L. Ed. 1715.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim, in brief, is that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-la,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Circuit Court is without jurisdiction to commit a person presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>before it to confinement for a period longer than one year, and consequently it is without power to impose the indeterminate commitment which might extend to three years as provided in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-360<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (now \u00a7 18-65) and 17-379.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In the recent Superior Court case of <em>Liberti </em>v. York, 28 Conn. Sup. 9, 246 A.2d 106, and in the United States District Court case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>York, </em>281 F. Sup. 8 (D. Conn.), General Statutes \u00a7 17-360 has been held to be unconstitutional. In both cases, the minor female was charged with having committed misdemeanors the maximum penalty for which, as provided by statute in each instance, was less than the possible three-year confinement author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ized by \u00a7 17-360. The court, in each of those cases, concluded, in substance, that, since adult males convicted of the same offenses as those charged against the minor girls were subject to a maximum imprisonment for a shorter term than that provided by \u00a7 17-360, the statute operated in a manner which violated the constitutional rights of the girls to the equal protection of the law. In <em>Bourgoyne </em>v. <em>York, </em>28 Conn. Sup. 424, 425, 265 A.2d 344, the crime charged involved a possible maximum penalty of three years and the Superior Court held that, since the Circuit Court could not impose a criminal sentence exceeding one year, the indeterminate commitment was invalid beyond that maximum. In the</p>\n<p id=\"Azy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>present case the plaintiff was not charged, in the Circuit Court, with having committed any crime. She was charged, instead, with being in \u201cmanifest danger of falling into habits of vice.\u201d That is the only portion of either 17-360 or 17-379 with which we are concerned on this appeal. That portion of the statutes obviously relates to minor females who are in a category distinct from those charged with having committed a crime. Where, as here, the parts of a statute are independent and severable, the unconstitutionality of one part need not impair the other. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>126 Conn. 373, 379, 12 A.2d 192. A statute may operate constitutionally under one set of circumstances but not under another. <em>State </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>149 Conn. 216, 230, 178 A.2d 271; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sul, </em>146 Conn. 78, 81, 147 A.2d 686. The constitutionality of legislation must be tested by its effect on the one who complains of it and under the circumstances affecting him. <em>Troiano </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>155 Conn. 265, 269, 231 A.2d 536; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sul, </em>supra. Since no claim is made that any constitutional right of this plaintiff has been violated, we are not called upon to consider, nor do we consider, the constitutionality of the action of the Circuit Court which forms the basis of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Nor is there any necessity in the present case for discussing whether \u00a7 17-379 is a penal statute or whether the Connecticut State Farm for Women should be classified as a penal institution, a question similar to that concerning the Connecticut School for Boys which was presented in the case of <em>In re Appeal of Bailey, </em>158 Conn. 439, 262 A.2d 177. The question in the present case is whether, regardless of the nature of the institution, the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to commit the plaintiff to that institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>We turn, then, to the narrow issue presented, namely, whether the Superior Court erred in concluding that the Circuit Court was without jurisdiction to commit this plaintiff to the Connecticut State Farm for Women for an indeterminate term which might extend to three years. In view of our conclusion on that question it is unnecessary to discuss the further issue as to whether, if the commitment was illegal, it was valid at least to the extent of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The answer lies in the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 17-360 (now \u00a718-65), 17-379, and 54-la of the General Statutes. The Connecticut State Farm for Women was established by chapter 358 of the Public Acts of 1917. Section 9 of that chapter does not differ in any particular which is material to the present controversy from the language of what is now \u00a7 17-360 (\u00a7 18-65). Section 17-360 (as amended by Public Acts 1959, No. 28 \u00a7 201, effective January 1, 1961), which we have set forth in footnote 3, provides for a commitment <em>\u201cby any court of criminal jurisdiction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Section 17-379, which is set forth in footnote 4, first appeared as chapter 233 of the Public Acts of 1905. The statute, as adopted in 1905, provided that: \u201cAny unmarried female between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one years who is in manifest danger of falling into habits of vice, or who is leading a vicious life, may, upon the complaint of a grand juror, or of the prosecuting attorney of any town, city, or borough court, be brought before a justice of the peace, or the town, city, or borough court within whose jurisdiction she may reside or be found, and upon conviction thereof may be committed to the custody of any institution, except the Connecticut Industrial School for Girls, chartered by the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>assembly of this state for the purpose of receiving and caring for females who have fallen into, or are in danger of falling into vicious habits, until she shall have arrived at the age of twenty-one years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">In its original form therefore the statute concerned itself only with a girl found, as the plaintiff was, to be \u201cin manifest danger of falling into habits of vice, or who is leading a vicious life.\u201d The statute remained in that form, with minor changes not now material, until 1951, when 576b of the 1951 Supplement added to the category of those who might be committed, a girl \u201cwho has committed any crime.\u201d Cum. Sup. 1955, \u00a7 1568d. The statute continued in \u25a0this form, substantially unchanged, until 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In 1959, the Circuit Court was created to assume the judicial functions of justices of the peace and town, city and borough courts. Public Acts 1959, No. 28. Section 168 of that act amended the then existing statute which provided for a complaint by \u201ca prosecuting grand juror or of the prosecuting attorney of any town, city or borough court,\u201d and that the person complained against \u201cbe brought before a trial justice, or the town, city or borough court\u201d to provide for a complaint by \u201cthe prosecuting attorney of the Circuit Court,\u201d and that the person complained against \u201cbe brought before said court\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">When the Circuit Court was established by No. 28 of the 1959 Public Acts, the statutes which we now know as \u00a7\u00a7 17-360 (\u00a7 18-65) and 17-379 had been, as already indicated, a part of the statute law of Connecticut for many years. In the act creating the Circuit Court, the General Assembly provided in Public Acts 1959, No. 28 \u00a7 25 that the Circuit Court should have jurisdiction of all crimes and local offenses punishable by a maximum fine of $500 or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>maximum imprisonment of one year or both and that, in the case of a crime carrying a maximum penalty of a fine of $1000 or imprisonment for five years or both, the court could take jurisdiction if it concluded that no greater penalty than it could impose should be inflicted, otherwise it must bind the accused over to the court having jurisdiction. That jurisdiction, as amended, continues as part of what is now \u00a7 54-la of the General Statutes (as amended by Public Acts 1967, No. 630 \u00a7 12, effective June 22, 1967), the material part of which is set forth in footnote 2. The Superior Court has sole jurisdiction of any offense not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. It has concurrent jurisdiction with the Circuit Court of any offense which is within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. General Statutes \u00a7 54-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The plaintiff asserts that \u00a7 54-la limits the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to the imposition of a maximum sentence of one year and that consequently the court does not have jurisdiction to impose the indeterminate sentence provided in \u00a7 17-379. The Circuit Court is one of the lower courts which the General Assembly may create; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>157 Conn. 150, 156, 251 A.2d 49; and the powers and jurisdiction of which it may define. Conn. Const., art. 5 \u00a7 1. The question as to what jurisdiction has been conferred on the Circuit Court by the General Assembly, therefore, is answered by determining the intent of the General Assembly as found in the meaning of what it has said in General Statutes It 54-la, 17-360 and 17-379. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Vaill, </em>158 Conn. 478, 483, 262 A.2d 169. If the statute through which the General Assembly speaks is not ambiguous it is not to be modified by construction. <em>Little </em>v. <em>United Investors Corporation, </em>157 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>44, 48, 245 A.2d 567; <em>Hurlbut </em>v. <em>Lemelin, </em>155 Conn. 68, 73, 230 A.2d 36. Here, the General Assembly, in one and the same act, namely, Public Acts 1959, No. 28, has provided, in \u00a7 25, for a criminal jurisdiction of the Circuit Court then limited to a maximum fine of $500 or a maximum imprisonment of one year, or both; in \u00a7 168, that that court may commit any unmarried female between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one years who is in manifest danger of f alling into habits of vice or who is leading a vicious life to the custody of any institution, except Long Lane School, chartered by the General Assembly or incorporated under the general laws for the purpose of receiving and caring for females who have fallen into or are in danger of falling into vicious habits; and, in \u00a7 201, it reenacted, with an amendment not now material, \u00a7 17-360 (\u00a7 18-65), set forth in footnote 3, providing for the commitments described by <em>\u201cany court of criminal jurisdiction\u201d. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In other words, in the same session, and in the same legislative act, the General Assembly created the Circuit Court, defined its jurisdiction, and provided for commitments to the Connecticut State Farm for Women as set forth in the sections we have discussed. \u201cThere is a presumption that the legislature, in enacting a law, did so in view of existing relevant statutes and intended it to be read with them so as to make one consistent body of law.\u201d <em>Hurlbut </em>v. <em>Lemelin, </em>supra, 74; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Vaill, </em>supra. This is particularly so when all statutes are dealt with in the same session. <em>Hurlbut </em>v. <em>Lemelin, </em>supra; <em>Knights of Columbus Council </em>v. <em>Mulcahy, </em>154 Conn. 583, 590, 227 A.2d 413. It is abundantly clear that the express intention of the General Assembly in creating the Circuit Court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>to confer upon it the criminal jurisdiction defined in \u00a7 54-la and, in the case of minor girls described in 17-360 (now \u00a7 18-65) and 17-379, to confer upon the Circuit Court the jurisdiction which, for over fifty years, had resided in justices of the peace and in the town, city or borough courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and. the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\"> The rules concerning appearances (Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 <em>42, 44) </em>are not designed to alert this court to an attorney\u2019s failure to enter an appearance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\"><em> </em>\u201cSec. 54-la. criminal jurisdiction of circuit court.
