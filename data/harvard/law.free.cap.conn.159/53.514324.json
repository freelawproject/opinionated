The workmen\u2019s compensation commissioner made a finding and pro forma award in favor of the plaintiff. The facts found have been treated by the parties as the facts in the case. The Superior Court reserved the matter for the advice of this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-324.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The following facts were found by the commissioner : The plaintiff, when he sustained accidental injuries on March 31,1968, while in the performance of fire duties, was an \u201cactive member\u201d of the Cromwell fire district \u201cvolunteer fire department,\u201d as the term is used in General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a (a) (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result of such injuries he was totally incapacitated for a period of five and three-sevenths weeks and thus was entitled to compensation at the maximum rate of $74 a week pursuant to \u00a7 7-314a (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the twenty-six weeks preceding the injury, he was regularly employed by Western Electric Company, Inc., and was so employed on the date of his injury as a volunteer fireman, and his average weekly wage as an employee of that company for the applicable period, computed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-310, was $168.04. The defendant state treasurer is the custodian of the second injury and compensation assurance fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The determination whether the claim for acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>dental injury of a volunteer fireman in the plaintiff\u2019s position comes within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 31-310, which is part of chapter 568, entitled \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d must be governed by the expressed intention of the General Assembly. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>138 Conn. 620, 623, 88 A.2d 117. The pertinent portion of \u00a7 31-310 which must be construed for a determination of the issue in the present case originated in the 1967 legislative session as \u00a7 17 of Public Act No. 842. It is part of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and is designed to protect the concurrent employee such as a wage earner having more than one job who, for instance, might lose his earnings from his principal job because of an injury occurring on another job with a low compensation rate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Monaco &amp; Sons Motor Sales, Inc., </em>145 Conn. 101, 102, 105, 139 A.2d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">A brief legislative history of the evolution of aeci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>dent insurance protection provided for Connecticut firemen will help to resolve the ambiguity in the statutes and clarify the question whether General Statutes \u00a7 31-310 applies to a claim arising under \u00a7 7-314a. In <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>94 Conn. 403, 413, 418, 109 A. 176, this court held that a full-time fireman, regularly paid by a municipality, did not hold his position under a \u201ccontract of service\u201d and so was not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act as it then existed. At the legislative session immediately following that decision, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was amended so as specifically to include within the definition of an \u201cemployee\u201d any salaried officer or paid member of any police department or fire department. His \u201cemployer\u201d for the purposes of workmen\u2019s compensation was stated to be the municipality which paid him. See Public Acts 1921, c. 306 \u00a7 11 (now part of General Statutes \u00a7 31-275); <em>Lake </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>102 Conn. 337, 340, 128 A. 782. While this amendment offered standard protection to full-time, regularly paid firemen hired by a municipality, it apparently was not considered to cover all volunteer firemen since the 1941 General Assembly enacted chapter 206, \u00a7 1, of the 1941 Public Acts (Sup. 1941, \u00a7 70f), which applied to \u201call active members of such [volunteer] fire company, whether paid or not for their services, except firemen who, because of contract of employment, come under the workmen\u2019s compensation act.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 7-314. Although it gave insurance coverage to volunteer firemen, the benefits were less generous than under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. By No. 892 of the 1967 Public Acts (General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a), the General Assembly repealed this system of compensation for volunteer firemen who, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>cause of the lack of contract employment, did not come under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and provided (\u00a7 2) that they \u201cshall be compensated in accordance -with the provisions of chapter 568 [the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act]\u201d of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The defendant the Aetna Insurance Company agrees that the plaintiff comes within General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a (a) (2) and that it is liable to him under that act for a portion of the compensation due him. It claims, however, that by virtue of \u00a7 31-310 it is not liable for the full award. As a matter of statutory interpretation, we must agree with the state treasurer\u2019s contention that \u00a7 31-310 has no application to claims arising under \u00a7 7-314a (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Section 31-310 refers to an injured employee who \u201chas worked for more than one employer.\u201d The basic question is whether the plaintiff, who admittedly worked for Western Electric, also worked for the municipality as a second employer within the meaning of \u00a7 31-310, as the Aetna argues. If the plaintiff, in his capacity as a volunteer fireman, had entered into or worked under a contract of employment with the municipality, he would have been an employee of the municipality under \u00a7 <em>31-275</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and been compensated solely because of the provisions of chapter 568 and not because of the provisions of \u00a7 7-314a. Public Acts 1967, No. 842, \u00a7 17 (General Statutes \u00a7 31-310) and No. 892 (General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a), pertinent to this discussion, were addressed to entirely different problems. The latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>act substituted an upgrading of the benefits for volunteer firemen equated to those in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and provides, inter alia, that \u201c[f]or the purpose of this section\u201d the wage rate shall be taken as that producing the maximum benefit rate as provided under \u00a7 31-309. General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a (b). The former act concerns the problem of the wage earner with two jobs who might be disadvantaged owing to an injury incurred on a lower paying job. There is no relationship between the two situations. The purpose of the workmen\u2019s compensation law is to provide for the workman, and it is presumed that the General Assembly acted with the knowledge that the objective in enacting such legislation was to protect the employee. <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 279, 281, 240 A.2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">It is significant that \u00a7 31-310, as quoted above, provides in part that the employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wages shall be calculated upon the basis of wages earned from all such employers\u201d but that \u00a7 7-314a (b), in this connection, provides a different method of computation, viz., \u201c[f]or the purpose of this section, the average weekly wage of a volunteer fireman shall be construed to be the average production wage in the state as determined by the labor commissioner under the provisions of section 31-309.\u201d It is reasonable to suppose that the legislature devised the latter method of computation to benefit and protect volunteer firemen in cases where wages actually \u201cearned\u201d by them, if any, might be wholly inadequate as a basis for determining their disability benefits. If we were to agree with the Aetna\u2019s contention that \u00a7 31-310 applied to this case, we would have to ignore \u00a7 7-314a (b) and instead determine the plaintiff\u2019s average weekly wage on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>basis of wages \u201cearned\u201d from Western Electric and the fire district. Where there are two inconsistent methods of computation such as we have in the present case, the method of computation which covers the subject matter in specific terms, herein as particularly applied to volunteer firemen, will prevail over the general language of another statute which might otherwise prove controlling. <em>Charlton Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>153 Conn. 103, 110, 214 A.2d 354. Since the proration provision of \u00a7 31-310 is inextricably linked to a method of computation which is incompatible with \u00a7 7-314a, it cannot be read into or reconciled with that statute and therefore is inapplicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">An historical review of the legislation pertaining to volunteer firemen suggests the conclusion that the General Assembly created a fictitious relationship of employer-employee between volunteer firemen and the municipality only to ensure the payment of benefits to volunteer firemen similar to those provided for regular firemen. The words \u201cbenefits for volunteer firemen\u201d in the title of No. 892 of the 1967 Public Acts may be considered to determine legislative intent in construing legislation which is doubtful or ambiguous in meaning. <em>State </em>v. <em>Faro, </em>118 Conn. 267, 272, 171 A. 660. The term \u201cactive member of a volunteer fire company,\u201d except for an inconsequential addition, has remained the same in \u00a7 7-314 since 1941. If the General Assembly had intended the relationship to exist for all purposes instead of \u201c[f]or the purpose of this section\u201d (\u00a77-314a), it would have amended \u00a731-275 to include volunteer firemen within the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d as it did in 1921 in the case of regular firemen. Although it was the purpose in \u00a7 7-314a to benefit volunteer firemen it cannot be said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u00a7 31-310 provided such a benefit in their situation. On the contrary, if \u00a7 31-310 specifically applied to volunteer firemen, it could only benefit an insurance carrier. The plaintiff, who did not take an appeal in this case, cannot obtain any additional benefit from \u00a7 31-310 since he cannot receive less than the maximum due under \u00a7 7-314a (b) regardless of whether or not he had a primary job.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Payment of an award from a special fund such as the second injury and compensation assurance fund, which was established, inter alia, to assist in the payment of compensation awarded to handicapped and disadvantaged workers; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-349\u201431-355; see <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Ingraham,, </em>150 Conn. 153, 158, 186 A.2d 798; should be made only in accordance with express statutory authority; 101 C. J.S., Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 837; in order to protect that special fund and prevent unwarranted diversions of it from the specific purpose for which it was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Contrary to the claim of the state treasurer, now abandoned in this court, it is apparent that the workmen\u2019s compensation commissioners have jurisdiction over claims arising under \u00a7 7-314a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Hotel Bond Co., </em>89 Conn. 143, 146, 147, 93 A. 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The workmen\u2019s compensation commissioner had jurisdiction over the present claim, and the plaintiff, an \u201cactive member of a volunteer fire department\u201d as the term is used in \u00a7 7-314a was not a person who \u201chas worked for more than one employer\u201d as the phrase appears in General Statutes \u00a7 31-310.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The Superior Court is advised to render judgment affirming the award of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">No costs will he taxed in this court in favor of any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">In this opinion King, C.

If an employee is injured on the part time job, his average wages on that job are small in relation to his overall weekly earnings and with respect to his regular job. Yet those wages would determine 'his compensation rate. This can be devastating to a worker because the amount paid would be a pittance. On the other hand, we must recognize that it would be unfair to the part time or second employer to have him pay benefits based upon the overall wages of the employee. We have therefore proposed a compromise under which the part time or second employer pays for all the medical bills as he now does, and the same amount he would pay for the injury, but the employee would be entitled to receive an additional amount from the second injury fund which would be based upon his overall earnings. We have provided that the benefits be payable in relationship to total wages. In this way, the cost of his time of employment [sic] is spread over the entire economy and will not impose an undue burden upon a single employer.\u201d 12 H.R.

I believe that this court should not abandon this well-settled principle of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Section 7-314a (2) of the General Statutes (see footnote 2 in the majority opinion) expressly provided that such volunteer firemen as the plaintiff \u201cshall be construed to be employees of the municipality for the benefit of which volunteer fire services are rendered\u201d and \u201cshall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of chapter 568.\u201d Chapter 568 is the chapter of the General Statutes which provides for workmen\u2019s compensation and \u00a7 31-310 (see footnote 1 in the majority opinion) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>included within that chapter. Section 31-310 clearly and unambiguously provides for the proration of workmen\u2019s compensation where an injured employee worked for more than one employer. \u201cIn this respect, the statute is unambiguous and is not therefore subject to modification by way of construction.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>United Investors Corporation, </em>157 Conn. <em>44, </em>48, 245 A.2d 567. \u201cIt is the expressed intent of the legislature which controls, and that intent is to be found in the meaning of what it says\u201d; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Vaill, </em>158 Conn. 478, 483, 262 A.2d 169; and not some unexpressed or supposed state of mind of the General Assembly.

Under this formula a prescribed portion of the award is to he paid from the second injury and compensation assurance fund. This fund was created and is maintained by a statutory assessment against each workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier and self-insurer doing business in the state on the basis of a percentage of the total amount expended by each of them in payment of their liability under the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. General Statutes \u00a7 31-354. In this way the burden was shifted by the General Assembly \u201cto industry and, eventually, the public at large.\u201d <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Ingraham, </em>150 Conn. 153, 158, 186 A.2d 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">In this opinion Alcorx, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
