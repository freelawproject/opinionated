On August 19, 1960, the state highway commissioner took by condemnation 13.8 acres of a thirty-five-acre tract in Southington owned by Florence J. Francis and occupied by her and her husband. See <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>155 Conn. 570, 236 A.2d 894. A junk business had been conducted on the property, and tons of personal property, mostly junk merchandise, were on the land when the commissioner acquired title. In April, 1961, the personal property not having been removed, the commissioner, acting pursuant to \u00a7 48-23 of the General Statutes, obtained from the Superior Court an order that he be put in peaceable possession of the condemned acreage. In June, 1961, a deputy sheriff for Hartford County, acting by virtue of executions issued by the Superior Court, proceeded to remove from the land acquired by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>commissioner the mass of junk merchandise. He placed it along the shoulders of the adjoining highway for a distance of about two miles on both -sides. Thereafter, a resident in front of whose home some of the property had been placed brought an action in the Superior Court against the selectmen of the town of Southington seeking an order that they forthwith remove the property stored along the highway. In that action, to which the present defendants were not parties, a mandatory injunction was issued directing the selectmen \u201cto remove forthwith in accordance with the provisions of Section 52-549, the junk, scrap metals, scrap materials, trucks, machinery and all other personal property now stored on the Meriden-Waterbury Road (also known as Route 6-A) in the Town of Southington, provided the same has been upon the highway for at least twenty-four hours.\u201d In accordance with that order, the selectmen caused the property to be removed from the highway and stored, and, when the defendants did not call for it within fifteen days after the removal, it was sold at public auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The town thereupon brought the present action against the defendants claiming $28,410.80 as the cost of the removal and storage less the proceeds of the sale. The defendants\u2019 demurrers to the complaint and substituted complaint were overruled, and the case was tried to a jury. Mrs. Francis testified that she had been the owner of the real estate taken by eminent domain, that she was the owner of all the articles removed therefrom and stored upon the highway, and that the articles were on the highway for more than twenty-four hours before they were removed therefrom. The court directed a verdict in favor of Mr. Francis, and with that directed verdict the jury also returned a verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>in favor of the plaintiff against Mrs. Francis for $28,410.80 plus interest. The court denied a motion by Mrs. Francis to set aside the verdict against her and for judgment notwithstanding that verdict, and judgment was rendered on the verdicts as returned. It is from that judgment that Mrs. Francis has taken this appeal, and, except as otherwise indicated, we will hereinafter refer to her as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The defendant has abandoned many of her assignments of error which have not been briefed. <em>Nowell </em>v. <em>Nowell, </em>157 Conn. 470, 484, 254 A.2d 889. Although raised variously by claims of error in the overruling of her demurrers and by asserted error in the court\u2019s charge and in the denial of her motion for a directed verdict, the basic claim of the defendant is that \u00a7 52-549<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the General Statutes is not applicable to the facts of this case because operation of that statute is limited to cases of eviction by summary process, because she was not a \u201ctenant\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in \u00a7 52-549 and because \u00a7 52-549 does not authorize the plaintiff to recover from her the reasonable cost of removing, storing and selling her personal property. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>defendant stated in her brief: \u201cEach point of the defendant\u2019s brief attempts to show that the legislature intended that Section 52-549 apply only to actions brought under the Summary Process chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In short, it is the contention of the defendant that the General Assembly intended that \u00a7 52-549 apply only to evicted lessees wrongfully holding over after their lease has terminated, that the defendant was not an \u201cejected tenant\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 52-549, that the plaintiff submitted to the jury \u201cno evidence of a tenancy,\u201d that the court erred in excluding evidence to rebut the plaintiffs evidence that the defendant refused to vacate the property, and that the court erred in withdrawing from consideration by the jury a special defense filed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Our decision of this appeal is unnecessarily complicated by reason of the procedure adopted by the defendant. She has assigned and briefed claimed errors both in the court\u2019s charge and in its denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the verdict is not supported by the evidence. Assignments of error addressed to the charge are tested by the claims of proof as they appear in the finding. Practice Book \u00a7 635; <em>Begley </em>v. <em>Kohl &amp; Madden Printing Ink Co., </em>157 Conn. 445, 447, 254 A.2d 907; <em>Intelisano </em>v. <em>Greenwell, </em>155 Conn. 436, 444, 232 A.2d 490. On the other hand a claim that a verdict is not supported by the evidence is tested by the evidence printed in the appendices to the briefs. <em>Prystash </em>v. <em>Best Medium Publishing Co., </em>157 Conn. 507, 508, 254 A.2d 872; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mortoro, </em>157 Conn. 392, 393, 254 A.2d 574; see Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 716-21. The defendant printed no appendix to her brief, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>in her attack on the court\u2019s rulings on the verdict, she improperly relies on her claims of proof in the finding rather than on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">We do not agree with the basic contention of the defendant that \u201c[w]ithout evidence of a landlord-tenant relationship, created by the parties, there can he no recovery for the town\u2019s expenses\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 52-549. What is now \u00a7 52-549 was originally adopted as chapter 105 of the Public Acts of 1895 as a single act not in any way connected with the summary process statutes to which it made no reference. The summary process statutes had been in effect since 1806. See <em>Lorch </em>v. <em>Page, </em>97 Conn. 66, 72, 115 A. 681. It is of significance to note that in the same 1895 session, the General Assembly by another act entitled \u201cAn Act concerning Summary Process\u201d amended \u00a7 1355 of the Revision of 1888 (the predecessor of what is now General Statutes \u00a7 52-532) providing under what circumstances an action in summary process might be brought. See Public Acts, 1895, c. 124. Section 1355 originally and as amended in 1895 authorized summary process only in cases in which a \u201clessee\u201d was in possession of leased premises.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the other hand, the same legislature in adopting what is now \u00a7 52-549 enacted chapter 105 under the \u00a1title \u201cAn Act concerning the Removal, Storage and Sale of Personal Effects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Ejected Tenants.\u201d 'That act not only made no reference to lessors or lessees or the limited statutory action of summary process but commenced \u201c[w]henever an ejectment of a tenant of any tenement is made by legal process . . . .\u201d In the Revision of 1902, this language was shortened to that now found in \u00a7 52-549: \u201cWhenever a tenant is ejected by legal process,\u201d and the section was, by the revisers, printed at the end of the chapter providing for actions of summary process. See Rev. 1902, \u00a7 1088. \u201cThere is a presumption that a general revision of the statutes does not change the law\u201d; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Phoenix State Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>138 Conn. 12, 16, 81 A.2d 444; and in the absence of anything evincing a contrary intent, the meaning and the effect of the statute were unchanged. <em>State ex rel. Rundbaken </em>v. <em>Watrous, </em>135 Conn. 638, 648, 68 A.2d 289; <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>City Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>115 Conn. 393, 400, 161 A. 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">There is merit to the contention of the plaintiff that the defendant as a matter of law became a tenant at sufferance when she continued to hold possession of the condemned land by occupying it after title and right to possession had passed to the highway commissioner. \u201cA tenancy at sufferance arises when a person who came into possession of land rightfully continues in possession wrongfully after his right has terminated.\u201d <em>Welk </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>136 Conn. 603, 608, 73 A.2d 295; <em>Lowell Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Save-Mor Furniture Stores, Inc., </em>346 Mass. 426, 193 N.E.2d 585. It is recognized in the common law as the least and lowest estate which can subsist in realty. 2 Blackstone, Commentaries, p. 150; see also 1 Swift, Digest, p. 90. Regardless of such a concept of technical tenancy, however, or the frequent use of the term in juxtaposition with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>word landlord, the word \u201ctenant\u201d is derived from the Latin \u201cteneo\u201d meaning to hold and is defined generally as meaning anyone who holds or possesses land or tenements or who has the occupation or temporary possession of such property, the title to which is in another. Webster, Third New International Dictionary; Black, Law Dictionary (4th Ed.); 86 C.J.S. 553, Tenant. Hence, in common usage in addition to tenants holding possession by agreement with landlords, there are joint tenants, life tenants, tenants in common and tenants by courtesy, all of whom are the holders of some interest in property although their status has no relationship to anyone standing in the position of a landlord or lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We conclude that, since the General Assembly has used the word \u201ctenant\u201d in \u00a7 52-549 without modification or restriction and without reference to any lessor or landlord relationship, it is to be taken in its general meaning of the holder or possessor of land and that the defendant, who continued in possession of the condemned property after title and right to possession passed to the highway commissioner, was therefore a tenant within the meaning of that term as used in \u00a7 52-549. Her continued \u201cuse and occupation of the . . . [condemned tract], after the taking date, was contrary to, violative of, and indeed nullified, the provisions of the taking statute and was clearly wrongful.\u201d <em>Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Norwalk Aluminum Foundry Corporation, </em>155 Conn. 397, 402, 233 A.2d 1. It is an undisputed fact that she was ejected from the property by legal process by virtue of the eminent domain proceedings and the subsequent order of the Superior Court which, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 48-23, ousted her of her possession of the premises and placed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>highway commissioner in peaceable possession of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We find no merit to the contention of the defendant that as used in \u00a7 52-549 the words \u201cpersonal effects\u201d were used in the statute in a sense other than their usual meaning of personal estate, goods, moveables and chattel property. Webster, Third New International Dictionary; Black, Law Dictionary (4th Ed.); 28 C.J.S. 887, Effect. Indeed, the defendant cites no authority for her claim that as used in \u00a7 52-549 the words have a more restricted meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The remaining contention of the defendant on this aspect of the appeal is that \u00a7 52-549 does not provide for money damages in such circumstances as those disclosed in this case. It is her claim that reimbursement for the expense of removing her property from the highway and storing and selling it is limited to the amount realized from the sale of the removed property. With this contention we cannot agree. Section 52-549 expressly provides that \u201csuch removal and storage by the selectmen shall be at the expense of such tenant.\u201d The further provision that, in the event that the proceeds of the sale exceed the reasonable charges, the net proceeds shall be turned over to the owner of the removed personal property is completely consistent with the provision that the removal and storage be at the expense of that owner. There is no ambiguity in the statute. If the proceeds of the sale do not cover the reasonable charges, the ejected owner of the personal property remains liable for the difference. If the proceeds of the sale exceed such reasonable charges, then, logically, the net proceeds are, on demand, to be paid to the owner of the property and if not so demanded then turned over to the town treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>We conclude, accordingly, that there was no error in the decision of the trial court holding that the rights and duties of the parties are, under the circumstances, governed hy \u00a7 52-549, that it properly overruled the defendants\u2019 demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s substituted complaint which sufficiently alleged a cause of action under the provisions of that statute, and that the evidence summarized in the appendix to the plaintiff\u2019s brief amply justified the rulings of the court in denying the motions of the defendant to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">We turn now to the assignments of error addressed to the charge and rulings on evidence. We find no error in the refusal of the court to charge in accordance with the four specific requests filed by the defendant. Each of these requests was predicated on the defendant\u2019s contention that \u00a7 52-549 was not applicable to the circumstances of this case in the absence of some landlord-tenant relationship existing between the defendant and the highway commissioner and a construction of the words \u201cpersonal effects\u201d as limited to articles \u201cassociated with the person as property having more or less intimate relation to the person or possessor.\u201d As already noted, we find no merit to these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The defendant has not briefed and is therefore considered to have abandoned all but two of her claims of error assigned to the charge as given. She has pressed claims of error in the action of the court in withdrawing from the consideration of the jury a special defense filed by the defendant. The substance of this defense is that in the action brought against the selectmen to require them to remove the property from the highway, an action to which the defendants were not parties, the select<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>men denied the applicability of \u00a7 52-549 until the state \u201coffered to save the Town harmless if the Town complied with an order of the Court and proceeded first against the defendants,\u201d that as a result the town withdrew its opposition to the state\u2019s claim and \u201cvoluntarily assumed the obligation to remove the goods under an agreement with the State who is the real plaintiff and hiding behind the Town.\u201d In the portion of the charge to which the defendant objects, the court reminded the jury that at the time the pleadings were read the court had informed them that the issue raised by this specially pleaded defense was a legal issue to be decided by the court and that they were not going to have an opportunity to give it any consideration. The court thereafter indicated that a demurrer to the original complaint had been filed and sustained \u201cmeaning that, as a matter of law, the defense was insufficient\u201d and also stated \u201c[m]y ruling is that the demurrer which was filed here must be sustained for the same reasons.\u201d The only two demurrers which the record discloses were addressed to the, complaint and substituted complaint, not to the special defense, and both demurrers were overruled, not sustained. The court was obviously mistaken in its reference to the action taken on the demurrers. Any error, however, was clearly harmless since it was contained in the portion of the charge which purported to explain to the jury why the special defense had been removed from their consideration. The actual ruling of the court was entirely correct since the facts pleaded in the special defense, even if proved, would not constitute a defense to the cause of action alleged by the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The remaining briefed assignment of error is addressed to an evidential ruling. On direct exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>nation of Mr. Francis, he was asked to relate the circumstances surrounding the ejectment from the premises by the sheriff and his removal of the merchandise to the highway. The defendants claimed that evidence that they did not refuse to move the merchandise from the land taken by the highway commissioner but were trying to move it and were unable to do so was material to the question whether \u00a7 52-549 was applicable to the plaintiff\u2019s present action since, they asserted, unless the defendants had the status of tenants with respect to that land, there could be no recovery in the present action. This inquiry was clearly made in the context of the defendants\u2019 repeated contention that \u00a7 52-549 was inapplicable unless there existed a landlord-tenant relationship between the highway commissioner and the defendants. The court had already properly ruled that in \u00a7 52-549 the word \u201ctenant\u201d was not used in such a restricted lessor-lessee sense as the defendants contended and that it was immaterial in the present proceedings whether the failure of the defendants to move the merchandise and quit possession of the property was due to their refusal or to their claimed inability to do so. We find no error in the evidential ruling of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u201cSec. 52-549. ejected tenant; sale of personal effects.
