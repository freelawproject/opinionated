The plaintiff has not assigned error in the court\u2019s conclusion, nor does its assignment of errors raise any other issue of law which may be reviewed by this court. The lack of such an assignment of error is fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.

The claims of error which the plaintiff does raise are addressed to findings of fact made by the court and are necessarily irrelevant since there are no issues of law properly before us.
