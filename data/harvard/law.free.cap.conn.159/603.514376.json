The court failed to make a finding as to the facts on which it based its conclusion that the search and the seizure were valid. The record is therefore inadequate for a determination of the legality of the search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">There is error in each case, the judgments are set aside and a new trial is ordered in each case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
