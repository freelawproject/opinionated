We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of the case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Woodall first argues that the district court erroneously admitted the opinion testimony of Immigration Inspector Janet Gale. At trial, the prosecution asked Inspector Gale to describe Woodall\u2019s tone of voice during a post-arrest phone conversation between Woodall and his wife. Inspector Gale responded: \u201c[n]ot panic stricken. That\u2019s when I totally discounted his story.\u201d The admission into evidence of Inspector Gale\u2019s response stating that she \u201ctotally discounted [Woodall\u2019s] story\u201d was error because \u201copinion evidence regarding a witness\u2019 credibility is inadmissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez-Lima, </em>161 F.3d 545, 548 (9th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Awkard, </em>597 F.2d 667, 671 (9th Cir.1979) (\u201cUnder the Federal Rules, opinion testimony on credibility is limited to character; all other opinions on credibility are for the jurors themselves to form.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">However, we reverse for nonconstitutional errors in admitting evidence \u201conly if it is more probable than not that the erroneous admission of the evidence materially affected the jurors\u2019 verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Arambulor-Ruiz, </em>987 F.2d 599, 605 (9th Cir.1993) (internal quotations omitted). Here, it does not appear that the erroneous admission of Inspector Gale\u2019s testimony materially affected the verdict. First, Inspector Gale\u2019s disbelief of Woodall\u2019s story was mentioned only in Inspector Gale\u2019s testimony; the government made no reference to Inspector Gale\u2019s statement in its closing argument. <em>See Arambula-Ruiz, </em>987 F.2d at 605. Second, notwithstanding Inspector Gale\u2019s statement, the government introduced ample corroborating evidence to support a jury finding that Woodall was not under duress. <em>See United States v. Barrett, </em>703 F.2d 1076, 1082 (9th Cir.1983). Trial testimony indicated that Woodall attempted to bring illegal aliens into the United States on May 17 and May 19, 2000. Between these two dates, Woodall stayed at a hotel in Tijuana located near the apartment of Jimmy, a man who sold drugs. Testimony did not indicate that Woodall made any attempts to get away from Jimmy or Tijuana between his two smuggling attempts. Woodall testified that he did not feel that he was free to leave because he owed Jimmy money and because he was not sure whether Jimmy owned the taxis in the area. Woodall admitted that when he was apprehended for alien smuggling the first time (on May 17) he did not tell law enforcement officials that he was under duress. Mary Woodall testified that on the occasions that her husband transported aliens to the United States she stayed at Jimmy\u2019s house with Jimmy\u2019s wife. She was told that it was \u201cin her best interests to stay there.\u201d Jimmy was generally not present at the house. After she received her husband\u2019s phone call in the early morning hours of May 20, she asked Jimmy for some money for cigarettes. She then took a cab to the trolley, and took the trolley to San Diego. No one attempted to stop or restrain her. In light of this evidence, we cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s erroneous admission of Inspector Gale\u2019s opinion testimony materially affected the verdict. Accordingly, we conclude that the admission of Inspector Gale\u2019s statement was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Woodall next contends that the combination of the government\u2019s hearsay objections, the court\u2019s limiting instructions, and the exclusion of certain defense testimony collectively denied him the opportunity to present his duress defense. At trial, Woodall gave a detailed statement about Jimmy\u2019s threats. He testified that Jimmy stated that he would kill his wife if Woodall did not transport aliens across the border. Woodall also set forth the details of his drug debt to Jimmy. Further, Mary Woodall testified regarding the details of her alleged confinement at Jimmy\u2019s apartment. In light of this testimony, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>evident that Woodall was able to present his duress defense to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AXA\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b797-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
