The award of attorneys\u2019 fees was reasonable, and we reject the government\u2019s challenges to the fees. Also, all costs awarded were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">The district court did not, however, make any explicit decision as to the \u201cexpenses\u201d requested by Jeppesen that were not allowable costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Beyond fees and costs, the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), authorizes an award of expenses normally billed to a client. <em>See International Woodworkers, Local 3-98 v. Donovan, </em>792 F.2d 762, 767 (9th Cir.1985). We remand for further proceedings on whether Jeppesen should be awarded any expenses under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Jeppesen is entitled under the EAJA to reimbursement for fees, costs, and expenses incurred as a result of defending against the government\u2019s appeal. <em>See Love v. Reilly, </em>924 F.2d 1492, 1497 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">AFFIRMED in part and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b895-11\"><em> </em>This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-12\">. It is understandable that the district court awarded reimbursement for only fees and costs. The billing statement attached to a supporting affidavit submitted by Jeppesen's counsel listed two categories of requested items labeled as \"Legal Fees\u201d and \u201cCosts Advanced.\u201d Although the supporting affidavit requested reimbursement for an \"attorney fee\u201d and \"expenses,\u201d the supporting affidavit was entitled \"Affidavit of Barry Marcus in Support of Plaintiff\u2019s Application for Award of <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Nonetheless, the affidavit requested reimbursement for \"expenses during the litigation, which have been charged to Mr. Jeppesen.\u201d The district court made no express ruling about expenses apart from costs. We express no opinion whether the submissions satisfy Jeppesen\u2019s burden under the EAJA and <em>International Woodworkers, Local 3-98 v. Donovan, </em>792 F.2d 762, 767 (9th Cir.1985), to qualify for an award of expenses, but the district court should decide this in the first instance. The issue was obscured by the form of plaintiff's submission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
