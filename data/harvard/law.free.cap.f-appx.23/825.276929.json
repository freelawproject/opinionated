Harrod\u2019s counsel has filed a motion pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for review and seeking to withdraw as counsel of record. Harrod has filed a supplemental pro se brief contesting the district court\u2019s jurisdiction; however, this contention lacks merit. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 (\u201cThe district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction ... of all offenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Our independent review of appellant\u2019s brief and the district court record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), indicates that Harrod knowingly and voluntarily waived his statutory right to appeal and was sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement. Therefore, we enforce the appeal waiver and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Vences, </em>169 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b858-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
