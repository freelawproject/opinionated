R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The cases are therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Mariano Hernandez-Muniz, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, requests a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition. He appeals separately the district court\u2019s ruling on the merits of his petition and its later refusal to grant him a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">To obtain a COA Hernandez-Muniz must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). This court has reviewed his request for a COA, his appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, as well as the entire record before us. We conclude that his petition does not meet the standard quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">We GRANT Hernandez-Muniz\u2019s motion to amend his application for a certificate of appealability. We DENY the request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS these appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1015-32\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
