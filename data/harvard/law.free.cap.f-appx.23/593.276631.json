The district court ordered that the federal sentence was to run consecutively to Araujo\u2019s state time, but the court did not distinguish between the two state sentences, one of which was six years and the other fifteen. Almost five years later. Araujo filed a motion seeking a \u201cclarification\u201d of his sentence. He argued that his federal sentence was actually concurrent with his fifteen-year state term and consecutive only to the six-year term. He based his argument on conflicting language in both the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of his sentence and the court\u2019s written commitment order. The district court denied Araujo\u2019s motion, but went on to state that a \u201cclerical error\u201d had occurred when the written commitment order failed to incorporate the court\u2019s intent, expressed at the sentencing hearing, \u201cto have the federal sentence served consecutively to both state sentences.\u201d The court then corrected the error pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Araujo appeals, but we dismiss the appeal rather than reach the merits because Araujo signed a plea agreement relinquishing his right to \u201cpursue any appeal in this case, including an appeal of his Sentence.\u201d <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>167 F.3d 1142, 1144-45 (7th Cir.1999). This appeal falls within the broad language of Araujo\u2019s appeal waiver and is therefore DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
