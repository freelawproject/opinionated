R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-16\">This is a pro se state prisoner civil rights appeal. Mr. Denney sought damages, declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief for Defendants\u2019 alleged alteration of his complaint and information filed in his state criminal proceeding. The district court dismissed Mr. Denney\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. We agree with the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion which states that Mr. Denney\u2019s \u201cbroad reference to equal protection and due process ... fall[s] far short of presenting any cognizable claim of constitutional deprivation.\u201d Order at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-17\">We also agree with the district court that Mr. Denney\u2019s claim for damages is premature absent a showing that his conviction has been overturned. Mr. Denney has a \u00a7 2254 petition pending in the United State District Court of Kansas. Until this petition has been resolved, Mr. Denney cannot recover damages pursuant to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-18\">Appellant\u2019s complaint is DISMISSED without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-19\">We remind Appellant that because his motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal was granted, he must continue making partial payments on court fees and costs previously assessed until such have been paid in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1020-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
