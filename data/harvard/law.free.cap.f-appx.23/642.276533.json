Lewis pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 33 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. Counsel has filed a brief and has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Mr. Lewis should receive credit for time he spent in a county jail before being indicted on the instant offense. Mr. Lewis, however, must first exhaust his administrative remedies by presenting his claim to the Bureau of Prisons. <em>See United States v. Chappel, 208 </em>F.3d 1069, 1069-70 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 542.10-542.19 (2001). Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and having found no nonfrivolous issues, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\">.
