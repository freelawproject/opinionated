McDonald appeals the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>United States v. Pirro, </em>104 F.3d 297, 299 (9th Cir.1997), and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-19\">McDonald filed his \u00a7 2241 petition, seeking release from prison in order to obtain medical treatment for his Hepatitis C. The district court sua sponte dismissed McDonald\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, finding that because McDonald was not challenging the \u201clegality or duration\u201d of his confinement, his use of \u00a7 2241 was improper. The district court further found that because McDonald was challenging the \u201cconditions of [his] confinement,\u201d he could seek relief through a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-23\">When a pro se habeas corpus petition may be fairly read to state a claim under the Civil Rights Act, it should be so construed. <em>See Hansen v. May, </em>502 F.2d 728, 729-30 (9th Cir.1974); <em>Galligher v. McCarthy, </em>470 F.2d 740, 741 (9th Cir.1972). Furthermore, courts have a duty to construe pro se pleadings liberally. <em>Zichko v. Idaho, </em>247 F.3d 1015, 1020 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We therefore reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to construe McDonald\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 1983 complaint and to proceed accordingly. <em>See Hansen, </em>502 F.2d at 729-30; <em>Galligher, </em>470 F.2d at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-24\">We express no opinion on the merits of McDonald\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-25\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b860-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
