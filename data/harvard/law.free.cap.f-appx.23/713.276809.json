We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural background, we need not detail it here. At issue is the district court\u2019s denial of fees on the grounds that ISC\u2019s out-of-state counsel was an inactive member of the Colorado bar during certain periods of the litigation and was not admitted <em>pro hac vice </em>during this litigation in federal district court in Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In September 1999, the Colorado Supreme Court issued an order granting ISC counsel\u2019s request to be retroactively restored to active status from February 1999 onward. The district court erroneously found that the supreme court\u2019s order was irrelevant. It is well settled that it is within the states\u2019 exclusive province to license and regulate lawyers. <em>See, e.g., Leis v. Flynt, </em>439 U.S. 438, 442, 99 S.Ct. 698, 58 L.Ed.2d 717 (1979) (\u201cSince the founding of the Republic, the licensing and regulation of lawyers has been left exclusively to the States.... \u201d); <em>Paciulan v. George, </em>229 F.3d 1226, 1229 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that states have traditionally had exclusive power to admit members to the bar), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1077, 121 S.Ct. 775, 148 L.Ed.2d 673 (2001). Under Colorado state law, the Supreme Court of Colorado has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to define the practice of law and to prohibit the unauthorized practice of law within the State of Colorado.\u201d Colo. R.C.P. Rule 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">In addition to counsel\u2019s inactive status, however, the district court pointed to counsel\u2019s failure to properly and timely request <em>pro hac vice </em>status as a basis for denying ISC\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees. Out-of-state counsel are permitted to appear <em>pro hac vice </em>in the District of Idaho only at the court\u2019s discretion. D. Idaho L. Civ. R. 83.4(e). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a <em>pro hac vice </em>application for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Ries, </em>100 F.3d 1469, 1471-72 (9th Cir.1996). The district court cited several significant and legitimate reasons for denying ISC counsel\u2019s <em>nunc pro tunc </em>motion for <em>pro hac vice </em>status \u2014 namely, his tardiness in filing the application, his failure to file a proper application, his unsupported and unsworn statements regarding his bar status, his misleading statements regarding his standing with the Colorado Bar, his failure to notify the district court of his inactive status, and his failure to take the Idaho bar despite his long-term residence in the state. In view of these reasons, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying the <em>pro hac vice </em>application.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Failure of ISC counsel to properly and timely secure <em>pro hac vice </em>admission before the district court was a sufficient reason to deny ISC\u2019s application for attorneys\u2019 fees, thus, we do not address whether ISC was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the meaning of the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
