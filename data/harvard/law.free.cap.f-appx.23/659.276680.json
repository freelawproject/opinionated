Frank appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for equitable tolling to file a late 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, and the denial of his motion for production of transcripts in order to file a different \u00a7 2255 motion. Frank seeks to challenge his guilty plea conviction for one count of continuing criminal enterprise, one count of money laundering and one count of tax evasion, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Since the relevant facts are not in dispute, we review de novo the issue of equitable tolling, <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Equitable tolling of the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations is appropriate only if extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time. <em>Calderon v. United States District Court for the Central District of California, </em>163 F.3d 530, 541 (9th Cir.1998) <em>(Kelly). </em>Frank states that his health condition and his appointed counsels\u2019 failure to file his \u00a7 2255 motion were extraordinary circumstances beyond his control, which entitled him to equitable tolling. Frank\u2019s contentions have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">First, Frank\u2019s suffering from colon cancer, and undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy to treat it are extraordinary circumstances beyond his control which justified equitable tolling. <em>See id. </em>(holding that a defendant\u2019s alleged mental incompetency justifies equitable tolling at least until a competency hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Second, Frank\u2019s appointed counsels\u2019 failure to file a \u00a7 2255 motion is a separate justification for equitable tolling in this case. <em>See Calderon v. United States District Court for the Central District of California, </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1289 (9th Cir.1997) <em>(Beeler) </em>(holding that equitable tolling was justified where defendant\u2019s counsel accepted employment out of state and left replacement counsel with unusable work product), <em>partially overruled on other grounds by Kelly, </em>163 F.3d at 539-40. The district court initially appointed Francisco Leon to file Frank\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, but he failed to do so. The district court then appointed Rebecca Donaldson, who also failed to file the \u00a7 2255 motion, saying that Leon failed to forward her Frank\u2019s entire file. The failure of Frank\u2019s court appointed lawyers to file his \u00a7 2255 motion was a circumstance beyond his control. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">The statute of limitations therefore should have been equitably tolled in order for Frank to file his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Miles, </em>187 F.3d at 1107. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying Frank\u2019s motion to file a late \u00a7 2255 motion is reversed and the case remanded. <em>See id. </em>\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">In light of our disposition, the district court\u2019s order denying Frank\u2019s motion for production of transcripts is vacated. We express no opinion on the merits of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">On remand, the district court shall appoint new counsel to assist Frank with the filing of his \u00a7 2255 motion and shall consider in the first instance any and all issues raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-23\">. Although a motions panel of this court previously determined that a certificate of appealability was unnecessary, upon further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>consideration, we conclude that a certificate is required. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 478, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We therefore grant a certificate as to the issue of whether it was error for the district court to deny Frank's motion for equitable tolling to allow him to file a late \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
