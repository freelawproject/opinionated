Whiteside also argues that Florists\u2019 Mutual acted in bad faith by fading to respond to her claim. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the .district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, see Weiner <em>v. San Diego County, </em>210 F.3d 1025, 1028 (9th Cir.2000), and affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-20\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not recite them in detail except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-21\">Whiteside argues that the district court erred in ruling that Florists\u2019 Mutual had no duty to defend her in a suit brought by her former employee for intentional infliction of emotional distress. An insurer has a duty to defend a claim that potentially seeks damages within the policy\u2019s coverage. <em>See Gray v. Zurich, </em>65 Cal.2d 263, 274, 54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168 (1966). Florists\u2019 Mutual\u2019s policy provided coverage only for \u201coccurrences,\u201d which is defined in the policy to mean an accident. The underlying complaint alleges deliberate conduct. In California, \u201c[i]t is fundmental that allegations of intentional wrongdoing do not allege an \u2018accident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collin v. American Empire Ins. Co., </em>21 Cal.App.4th 787, 806, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 391 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>(1994). The district court was therefore correct in finding that the claim was not potentially covered by Florists\u2019 Mutual\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Next, Whiteside argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Florists\u2019 Mutual on her claim that Florists\u2019 Mutual breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing. In general, \u201ca bad faith claim cannot be maintained unless policy benefits are due.\u201d <em>McMillin Scripps North Partnership v. Royal Ins. Co. of America, </em>19 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1222-23, 23 Cal.Rptr.2d 243 (1994). However, unusual circumstances may exist \u201cin which an insurance company could be liable to its insured for tortious bad faith despite the fact that the insurance contract did not provide for coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1222-23, 23 Cal.Rptr.2d 243. For example, where an insurance company makes a misrepresentation to its insured that hinders the insured\u2019s investigation of his claim thereby preventing the insured from protecting his interests, bad faith liability may attach notwithstanding the lack of contractual coverage. <em>See id. </em>at 1223, 23 Cal.Rptr.2d 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Here, Whiteside presented sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue regarding whether Florists\u2019 Mutual breached its independent tort duty of good faith and fair dealing. Whiteside came forward with evidence that she relied on Florists\u2019 Mutual\u2019s representations to her that it was \u201chandling\u201d the B allow matter when it was not, and that Florists\u2019 Mutual waited over five years to deny coverage of her claim. As a result, Whiteside did not initially retain independent counsel and suffered the temporary loss of over $1200.00 from her bank account, her car, and an FTD account that constituted half of her total revenue. This is sufficient to raise a genuine question as to whether Florists\u2019 Mutual breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part. The case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b848-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
