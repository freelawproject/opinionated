Ashley\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Ashley has filed a pro se supplemental brief and a related motion. Three issues are presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-22\">First, Ashley argues the district court erred in failing to issue a written order in his \u00a7 2255 proceeding, and in denying his motion to correct the docket in his \u00a7 2255 proceeding. We find no error in the district court\u2019s order and docket entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-23\">Second, Ashley argues he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his \u00a7 2255 proceeding, at which he was resentenced. Ashley\u2019s claim necessarily fails because there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel at a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)-(2) (West Supp.2001); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987). In any event, Ashley did not establish that his counsel was ineffective during the hearing at which the court favorably modified his sentence. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-24\">Third, Ashley argues, in his pro se brief and related motion, that his <em>Anders </em>counsel erred in appealing the district court\u2019s oral order partially granting Ashley\u2019s civil \u00a7 2255 motion, rather than bringing an appeal against his amended sentence in Ashley\u2019s criminal case. This claim is meritless. Moreover, we find that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>court did not abuse its discretion when it resentenced Ashley within the applicable guideline range. <em>United States v. Pitts, </em>176 F.3d 239, 248 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">We therefore dismiss the appeal and deny Ashley\u2019s motion to compel his attorney to file additional briefing. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Ashley\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
