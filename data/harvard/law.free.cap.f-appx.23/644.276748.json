We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and, applying de novo review, <em>see McLean v. Crabtree, </em>173 F.3d 1176, 1180 (9th Cir.1999), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-22\">Because Lani\u2019s conviction became final before the enactment of the current one-year limit for filing federal habeas claims imposed in April 24, 1996, Lani would normally have had until April 23, 1997 to file his petition. <em>See Calderon v. District Court, </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1287 (9th Cir.1997), <em>overruled on other grounds, </em>168 F.3d 530 (1998); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). However, this limitation period is tolled by a pending \u201cproperly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Although Lani\u2019s pending state court motions may have been untimely filed, the applicable Nevada statute permits exceptions for good cause. <em>See </em>Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 34.726(1) (permitting late filing where delay is not petitioner\u2019s fault and dismissal would cause undue prejudice). Because Lani\u2019s motions were not untimely on their face, the one-year limitation was tolled while they were pending. <em>See Dictado v. Ducharme, </em>244 F.3d 724 (9th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>***</footnotemark> Therefore, because Lani\u2019s federal habeas petition was filed less than three months after the last state court proceedings was concluded, dismissal was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-23\">Respondents argued a number of other grounds for dismissal before the district court, and that court, in a footnote, indicated its tentative view that several of these have merit. However, neither party has briefed these alternative grounds upon ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>peal, and we decline to reach them sua sponte. Accordingly, we remand for further proceeding so that the district court may decide these remaining questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b676-25\"> The district court relied on an earlier disposition of <em>Dictado </em>that has been since superseded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
