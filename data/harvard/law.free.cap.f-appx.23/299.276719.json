Although the respondent appeared at the trial before the Administrative Law Judge (the \u201cALJ\u201d), it did not file exceptions with the Board from the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, a Board decision and order is entitled to summary enforcement if no objections are filed with the Board from the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See NLRB v. Ochoa Fertilizer Corp., </em>368 U.S. 318, 322, 82 S.Ct. 344, 7 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961); <em>NLRB v. Tri-State Warehouse &amp; Distributing, Inc., </em>677 F.2d 31, 31-32 (6th Cir.1982) (order); <em>NLRB v. Innkeepers of Ohio, Inc., </em>596 F.2d 177, 178 (6th Cir.1979) (order). The respondent has filed a response, asserting that it has already complied with most of the Board\u2019s directives and intends to comply with the remaining directive (the payment of back wages) after a hearing is held to determine the amount of back wages to be paid. It therefore argues that summary enforcement by this court is unnecessary. Longstanding caselaw holds, however, that even full compliance with a Board decision and order by a respondent does not foreclose enforcement by this court upon the Board\u2019s application. <em>See NLRB v. Mexia Textile Mills, Inc., </em>339 U.S. 563, 567, 70 S.Ct. 833, 94 L.Ed. 1067 (1950); <em>NLRB v. Edgar Spring, Inc., </em>800 F.2d 595, 598 (6th Cir.1986) (per curiam); <em>NLRB v. Louisville Chair Co., </em>385 F.2d 922, 926 (6th Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 1013, 88 S.Ct. 1264, 20 L.Ed.2d 163 (1968); <em>NLRB v. Hecks, Inc., </em>369 F.2d 370, 371 (6th Cir.1966) (per curiam); <em>NLRB v. Globe-Warnicke Systems Co., </em>336 F.2d 589, 590 (6th Cir.1964) (summary enforcement). Although the respondent\u2019s compliance may be commended, we conclude the Board is entitled to the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">It therefore is ORDERED that the Board\u2019s decision and order in Case No. 7-CA-43054 is hereby enforced. The respondent, Judd Contracting, Inc., Detroit, Michigan, its officers, agents, successors and assigns, shall:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">1. Cease and desist from:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">(a) Laying off (discharging) or otherwise discriminating against any employees for engaging in activities supportive of the union, seeking both membership in the union and the benefits of membership in the union, and engaging in concerted activities, and discouraging employees from engaging in these activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">(b) In any like or related manner interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed them by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">2.

Reasonable steps shall be taken by the respondent to ensure that the notices are not altered, defaced, or covered by any other material. In the event that, during the pendency of these proceedings, the respondent has gone out of business or closed its facility involved in these proceedings, the respondent shall duplicate and mail, at its own expense, a copy of the notice to all current employees and former employees employed by the respondent at any time since April 27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">(e) Within 21 days after service by the Region, file with the Regional Director a sworn certification of a responsible official on a form provided by the Region attesting to the steps that the respondent has taken to comply with this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">NOTICE TO EMPLOYEES POSTED PURSUANT TO A JUDGMENT OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS ENFORCING AN ORDER OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">An Agency of the United States Government</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">The National Labor Relations Board has found that we violated the National Labor Relations Act and has ordered us to post and abide by this notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Section 7 of the Act gives employees these rights</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-13\">To organize</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-14\">To form, join, or assist any union</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-15\">To bargain collectively through representatives of their own choice</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-16\">To act together for other mutual aid or protection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-17\">To choose not to engage in any of these protected concerted activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-18\">WE WILL NOT lay off (discharge) or otherwise discriminate against employees because of their support of and sympathies for Iron Workers Local 25, International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers, AFL-CIO, or any other labor organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-19\">WE WILL NOT lay off (discharge) or otherwise discriminate against employees because they desire and seek membership or the benefits of membership in Iron Workers Local 25, International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers, AFL-CIO, or any other labor organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-20\">WE WILL NOT in any like or related manner interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed them by Section 7 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-21\">WE WILL, within 14 days from the date of this Order, offer Lee W.
