One of Merrick\u2019s employees filed suit against Budd arising out of personal injuries incurred when the employee was working on Budd\u2019s premises. According to the contract, Merrick agreed to indemnify Budd for all of the latter\u2019s costs, damages, and attorney fees relating to personal injury claims, even those incurred as a result of Budd\u2019s own negligence, so long as Budd was not grossly negligent. The district court granted summary judgment for Merrick, holding that Merrick had no contractual indemnity obligation under Kentucky law unless Budd was first found liable to the injured worker. Because we conclude that Kentucky law is contrary to the district court\u2019s ruling, we REVERSE its judgment and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AMh\">A. Factual background</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Budd entered into a maintenance contract with Merrick for the latter company to service and maintain Budd\u2019s heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system (HVAC). While servicing Budd\u2019s HVAC system, Anthony Thompson, an employee of Merrick, stepped through a pair of double doors on a mezzanine level electrical substation and fell to the plant floor sixteen feet below. The fall left Thompson a paraplegic, and served as the underlying basis for this lawsuit. At issue in this appeal is a clause within the contract between Budd and Merrick which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">Seller [Merrick] agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the buyer [Budd], its affiliates, customers and each other party to which its products are provided and each of their shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all demands, action, causes of actions, suits, costs, fees, penalties, damages, (consequential and otherwise,) attorney fees and all other liabilities and all obligations arising out of or relating to: (a) personal injuries damages or death to any natural person or damage to any property .... <em>Seller\u2019s indemnification shall be applicable even as to losses caused in whole or in part by an indemnitee\u2019s negligence, but shall not apply to the extent that losses are clearly shoum to have resulted solely and directly from gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnitee.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">B. Procedural background</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">In March of 1996, Thompson sued Budd for negligence in a Kentucky state court. Budd removed the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky based on diversity of citizenship. Thompson subsequently amended the complaint to name various other defendants, including the company that constructed Budd\u2019s plant. Budd then filed a cross-claim against these defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>dants, as well as a third-party complaint against Merrick (who was not named as a defendant in Thompson\u2019s lawsuit) for common law and contractual indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">These indemnity claims were all dismissed by the district court following summary judgment motions by the defending parties. The court also dismissed Thompson\u2019s lawsuit against Budd based on the latter\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Thompson appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his suit against Budd, and settled his claims as to the other defendants. Budd cross-appealed the district court\u2019s denial of its indemnity claim against the co-defendants and Merrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On appeal, this court affirmed the dismissal of Thompson\u2019s claims against Budd, reasoning that Budd was a statutory \u201ccontractor\u201d under Kentucky law. This relieved Budd of tort liability pursuant to the Kentucky Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>See Thompson v. Budd Co., </em>199 F.3d 799, 805 (6th Cir.1999) <em>(Thompson I). </em>As to Budd\u2019s claims for indemnity against its co-defendants, with whom it had no contractual arrangements, this court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of common law indemnity. <em>See id. </em>at 806-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">This court construed Budd\u2019s contractual indemnification claim against Merrick, however, as providing for indemnification of Budd\u2019s legal expenses in defending the suit brought by Thompson irrespective of whether liability had been imposed on Budd. <em>See id. </em>at 808-09. Because Merrick could only escape the indemnification clause if Budd was \u201cgrossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct,\u201d the ease was remanded back to the district court to make factual findings on that issue. <em>Id. </em>at 810 (\u201c[GJenuine issues of material fact remain as to whether Budd was grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct which led to Thompson\u2019s injuries. This issue must be remanded for further factual determinations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">After the case had been remanded to the district court, Merrick filed a renewed motion for summary judgment, arguing that this court \u201cneglected to consider\u201d a recent Kentucky Court of Appeals case, <em>ARA Services, Inc. v. Pineville Community Hospital, </em>2 S.W.3d 104 (Ky.Ct.App.1999), in which, according to Merrick, the state court held that one party to a contract cannot be required to indemnify the other party if neither has been held hable to the original plaintiff. On March 24, 2000, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Merrick. It concluded that if Budd was not liable to Thompson, then Budd cannot recover on an indemnity claim against Merrick, even if such indemnity is called for by the terms of their contract. Budd filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">II.' ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">A. Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See, e.g., Holloway v. Brush, </em>220 F.3d 767, 772 (6th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is proper when there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The judge is not to \u201cweigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A genuine issue for trial exists only when there is sufficient \u201cevidence on which the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">B. The district court erred when it concluded that, despite the contractual language to the contrary, Merrick cannot be required to indemnify Budd</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Kentucky law distinguishes between indemnification that arises out of the common law and indemnification that is \u201cassumed contractually.\u201d <em>See Crime Fighters Patrol v. Hiles, </em>740 S.W.2d 936, 938 (Ky.1987). As this court declared in <em>Thompson I, </em>\u201ca party cannot recover under a common law indemnity claim if it has not been held liable to a third party.\u201d <em>Thompson I, </em>199 F.3d at 807. <em>Thompson I </em>therefore affirmed the denial of Budd\u2019s claim for common law indemnification against the co-defendants. In contrast, \u201c[t]he nature of an indemnitor\u2019s liability under an indemnity contract shall be determined by the provisions of the indemnity agreement itself.\u201d <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Napier Elec. and Constr. Co., </em>571 S.W.2d 644, 646 (Ky.Ct.App.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Common law indemnity thus requires liability by the party against whom indemnity is sought; contractual indemnity does not. <em>Compare Poole Truck Line, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>892 S.W.2d 611, 614 (Ky.Ct.App.1995) (holding in a common law indemnity case that \u201c[b]oth indemnity and contribution depend upon liability by one or both parties to the original claimant who suffered the original loss\u201d) <em>with Fosson v. Ashland Oil &amp; Ref. Co., </em>309 S.W.2d 176, 178 (Ky.1957) (holding that indemnity contracts in which one party agrees to indemnify another, even for those costs that are caused by the indemnitee\u2019s own negligence, are not against public policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">This case presents us with the question of whether a contractual indemnity clause should be enforced when neither Budd nor Merrick were held hable in tort for the underlying injury to Thompson. In answering this question in the negative, the district court relied on <em>ARA Services, Inc. v. Pineville Community Hospital, </em>2 S.W.3d 104 (Ky.Ct.App.1999), a case decided almost a year before <em>Thompson I. </em>The plaintiff in <em>ARA </em>sued both the indemnitor (ARA) and the indemnitee (Hospital) for personal injuries. After the jury returned a verdict for both defendants, the Hospital demanded contractual indemnification for its expenses and attorney fees. The contractual provision in question read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, ARA agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the [Hospital], its agents, officers and employees, against all claims for loss or damage, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, <em>attributable to ARA\u2019s sole negligence, </em>acts or failures to act in performing under this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 106 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">In applying this contract to the facts of the case, the Kentucky court based its analysis on the following rule: \u201cContracts are, of course, to be construed according to their terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Its denial of contractual indemnity to the Hospital was thus based solely on the contractual language. The court reasoned that \u201c[h]ere, the terms of the contract are clear. ARA assumed all claims for loss or damage attributable to ARA\u2019s sole negligence, acts or failure to act. The jury determined that ARA was not negligent; hence ARA is not contractually hable to the Hospital.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">In the present case, the district court based its denial of Budd\u2019s contractual indemnification claim solely upon the statement in <em>ARA </em>that \u201c[b]ecause the Hospital was not held liable to Lewis, it does not have an independent right to indemnity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 107. This statement from <em>ARA, </em>however, was made in the context of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>an argument by the Hospital that it was also entitled to a common law right of indemnity, and is thus not applicable to the contractual indemnity issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The district court apparently thought that <em>ARA </em>created a novel rule of contract law in Kentucky. According to the district court, all contractual language providing for indemnification is to be ignored \u201cwhere no liability is found.\u201d <em>ARA </em>does not so hold, nor have we found any case that supports such a rule under Kentucky law. Rather, <em>ARA </em>reaffirms the principle in contractual indemnity claims that \u201ccontracts are, of course, to be construed according to their terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Like <em>ARA </em>the terms of the contractual language before this court are clear. Unlike <em>ARA, </em>however, the terms of Budd\u2019s contract with Merrick provide for a different result. Rather than providing for indemnification only in the event of Merrick\u2019s negligence, the contract at issue here was much broader than the indemnity provisions in ARA\u2019s agreement. As this court described in <em>Thompson I, </em>\u201conly where the costs or attorney fees are \u2018clearly shown to have resulted solely and directly from [Budd\u2019s] gross negligence or willful misconduct\u2019 can Merrick avoid Lability under ... these contractual provisions.\u201d <em>Thompson I, </em>199 F.3d at 808 (brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">We agree with this court\u2019s previous interpretation of the contract, and reassert the principle that \u201c[c]ontracts are, of course, to be construed according to their terms.\u201d <em>ARA </em>2 S.W.3d at 106. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, which was based on its erroneous conclusion that the contractual provision should be ignored due to the lack of Budd\u2019s Lability to Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">This stiU leaves the factual question of whether Merrick might escape indemnification under the terms of the contract based on aUegations of Budd\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct. We therefore remand the case to the district court, for the second time, to see that this factual determination is made. <em>See Thompson I, </em>199 F.3d at 810 (\u201cAs the district court noted, genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether Budd was grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct which led to Thompson\u2019s injuries. This issue must be remanded for further factual determinations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">C. There is no need to decide if the district court erred in granting summary judgment despite this court\u2019s prior determination that genuine issues of material fact remain</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Budd also complains that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment erroneously ignored the law of the case, based on this court\u2019s prior determination that genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether Budd\u2019s conduct was grossly negligent or constituted wiUful misconduct. Because we are reversing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment based on its erroneous interpretation of Kentucky law, there is no need to address this claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
