At Todd\u2019s first trial, Todd testified and the jury could not reach a verdict. At a second trial, Todd did not testify and the jury convicted him. The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> denied Todd\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal or new trial, and sentenced Todd to forty-six months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-18\">On appeal, Todd first contends the district court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial because the Government violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. According to Todd, the Government made an improper comment on his failure to testify by making an indirect remark during opening statement and by asking eleven questions during the Government\u2019s case in chief. Specifically, during opening statement, the prosecutor argued Todd had a practice of \u201cabandoning] and covering]\u201d that was \u201ccontinuing now\u201d and would not end until the jury deliberated and reached a verdict. Later, the prosecutor asked different witnesses whether certain statements by Todd would be accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-19\">Because Todd did not object during his trial, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Christians, </em>200 F.3d 1124, 1128 (8th Cir.1999). To establish a Fifth Amendment violation, Todd must show the remarks and questions were improper and they prejudicially affected his substantial rights and thus deprived him of a fair trial. <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018Indirect comments on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify constitute error when the comments show the prosecutor intended to call attention to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify or if the jury would naturally and necessarily understand the comments as highlighting the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Moore, </em>129 F.3d 989, 993 (8th Cir.1997)). We conclude the Government\u2019s remarks and questions were neither improper nor prejudicial, and thus, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>trict court did not abuse its discretion in denying a mistrial. Indeed, when the Government made the statements and asked the questions, the Government expected Todd to testify and thus would not be commenting on his failure to do so. In any event, the limited, vague remarks and questions over the course of a four-week trial do not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Second, Todd asserts the Government\u2019s strike of two blacks from the jury violated <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986) (precluding use of peremptory challenge to exclude potential juror solely on the basis of race). The Government used all ten of its peremptory challenges and struck two black potential jurors, leaving three minorities on the jury. Todd raised a <em>Batson </em>objection, and the Government explained it removed the first black juror because she seemed confused by a legal concept and offended at the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to follow up. The Government said it removed the second black juror because of her employment as a life skills trainer and a specific experience the prosecutor had with a juror of the same profession who had served on Todd\u2019s codefendant\u2019s case. Todd did not offer any argument or fact to show the explanations were pretextual. Assuming without deciding Todd established a prima facie case of discrimination, we conclude the district court did not commit clear error in finding the Government offered race-neutral explanations and Todd failed to show the reasons were a pretext for race discrimination. See <em>United States v. Hill, </em>249 F.3d 707, 714 (8th Cir.2001) (explaining three-step <em>Batson </em>analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Third, Todd contends the district court improperly grouped the money laundering counts under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d). We disagree. Subsection 3D1.2(d) specifically states it applies to offenses covered by \u00a7 2S1.1, which sets the offense level for money laundering. Todd also appears to assert fraud and money laundering harm the same victim and thus should be grouped as one count under \u00a7 3D1.2(b). We have already rejected this contention, holding fraud has a specific victim while money laundering victimizes society in general. <em>United States v. O\u2019Kane, </em>155 F.3d 969, 971-72 (8th Cir.1998). Last, we reject Todd\u2019s assertion that judicial estoppel prevents the district court from grouping the counts as it did because the grouping is inconsistent with the sentencing applied to a former codefendant who pleaded guilty. The doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents a party from taking inconsistent positions in the same or related litigation. <em>Hossaini v. Western Mo. Med. Ctr., </em>140 F.3d 1140, 1142 (8th Cir.1998). Here, the Government took the same position in both cases, and we have found no cases applying the doctrine to a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">We thus affirm Todd\u2019s sentence. We also deny his motion to supplement the record with the testimony of his first trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-16\"> The Honorable George Howard, Jr., United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
