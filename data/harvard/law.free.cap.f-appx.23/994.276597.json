SIMMONS, Secretary, Kansas Department of Corrections; David McKune, Warden, Lansing Correctional Facility; Roger Bonner; (FNU) Rawls, Investigators I &amp; I, Lansing Correctional Facility; Pat West, Disciplinary Administrator, Lansing Correctional Facility; and Connie Lawson, Correctional Officer, Lansing Correctional Facility, Defendants-Appellees.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>No. 01-3260.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b1027-5\">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b1027-6\">Jan. 25, 2002.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1027-7\">Before SEYMOUR and McKAY, Circuit Judges, and BRORBY, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"At7\">McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">This is a pro se state prisoner \u00a7 1983 civil rights appeal stemming from Mr. Cotton\u2019s publication of a book of poetry, the prison\u2019s investigation of that publication, and disciplinary action taken as a result of the investigation. Mr. Cotton claims that his rights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments were violated by the Defendants. Mr. Cotton also claims that he was falsely accused of copyright violations and that one of the Defendants slandered his character. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Mr. Cotton appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">We agree with the district court that none of Mr. Cotton\u2019s claims concerning the propriety of the disciplinary hearings or their results are actionable pursuant to \u00a7 1983 unless the results of the hearings were overturned. <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 646-48, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997) (applying <em>Heck </em>to judgments in prison disciplinary proceedings). Mr. Cotton failed to show that his disciplinary determination has been reversed or called into question. Thus, <em>Balisok </em>bars Mr. Cotton\u2019s claims regarding the disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-14\">Mr. Cotton\u2019s claim that Defendant Lawson\u2019s alleged slander of his character brought him disgrace, ridicule, and contempt is also not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. Mr. Cotton has made no showing of how his First Amendment or any other constitutional rights have been violated by Lawson\u2019s conduct. Damage to one\u2019s reputation alone does not constitute a liberty interest. Paul <em>v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 709, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976); <em>Corbitt v. Andersen, </em>778 F.2d 1471, 1474-75 (10th Cir.1985). Therefore, this claim must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-15\">After a thorough review of the briefs and the record, and for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned July 31, 2001, Order, we hold that no relief is available to Mr. Cotton pursuant to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-16\">Appellant\u2019s complaint is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1027-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
