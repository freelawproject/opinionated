Having considered the record and the parties\u2019 arguments, we are satisfied the district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> correctly granted the requested injunction pending trial on the merits. Because the parties\u2019 submissions show they are thoroughly familiar with the issues before the court, we believe an extensive discussion is not warranted. Having reviewed SWB\u2019s contentions of reversible error and abuse of discretion, we affirm for the reasons explained in the district court\u2019s thorough opinion and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-8\"> The Honorable Catherine D.
