Before the District Court, Ferguson argued that his appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise on direct appeal the trial court\u2019s alleged error in refusing to allow Ferguson\u2019s witness, who appeared in court after the jury had already completed its deliberations and reached a verdict, to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">For substantially the reasons stated in Judge Kaplan\u2019s careful and thorough order, the order of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
