Anthony Gill, an inmate in the custody of the New York State Department of Corrections, alleges an unconstitutional search of documents in his electronic typewriter, a retaliatory transfer, and denial of due process with respect to a thirty day confinement in a double-bunk special housing unit cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-23\">The district court did not explain the factual findings or legal grounds forming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>the basis of its order granting summary judgment. Such conclusory orders \u201cgenerally do not provide this Court with a sufficient basis for review and are therefore disfavored.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Burke, </em>256 F.3d 93, 95 (2d Cir.2001) <em>(per curiam). </em>\u201c \u2018If the court fails to make findings and to give an explanation, and the reason for the court\u2019s ruling is not clear to us, we will remand for findings and an explanation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beckford v.
