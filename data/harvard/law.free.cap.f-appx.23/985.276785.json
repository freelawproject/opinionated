We review the dismissal of a case pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 33-34, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992); <em>Schlicher v. Thomas, </em>111 F.3d 777, 779 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-17\">Mr. Rudd\u2019s complaint alleges that his arrest and conviction for rape resulted from a conspiracy against him and that the prosecutor proceeded against him despite knowing the charges were false. He further claims that \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>vented the dismissal of the charges against him. Finally, Mr. Rudd generally claims that he was denied due process and equal protection during his trial. He seeks a new trial, damages, the appointment of counsel, and an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">On appeal, Mr. Rudd claims that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint without affording him notice and an opportunity to amend his pleading. Aplt. Br. at 3. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) authorizes a district court to dismiss a complaint \u201cat any time\u201d it determines it is frivolous or malicious. While we construe pro se complaints liberally, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1988), we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. Mr. Rudd\u2019s damages claim appears to be barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), which provides that to recover damages for unconstitutional imprisonment, an inmate must show that the conviction or sentence has been invalidated. Moreover, it is apparent that Mr. Rudd is challenging the fact or duration of his confinement \u2014 the proper remedy is habeas under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, with its requirement of exhaustion of state remedies. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). Finally, we agree with the district court that the complete lack of facts supporting the conclusory allegations contained in Mr. Rudd\u2019s eomplaint counsels dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1017-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
