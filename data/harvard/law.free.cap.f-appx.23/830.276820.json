Laws appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s denial of his applications for Social Security disability insurance benefits and Supplemental Security Income disability benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s order upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of social security benefits. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1279 (9th Cir.1996). The Commissioner\u2019s decision must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error. <em>Id. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-21\">Laws contends that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) analysis of his subjective complaints was deficient. This contention lacks merit. The ALJ properly rejected Laws\u2019 testimony that excess pain rendered him permanently disabled. The ALJ offered specific, clear, and convincing reasons why he found Laws\u2019 testimony regarding the extent of his pain to be not credible. <em>See Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-22\">Laws contends that the ALJ accorded insufficient deference to the medical opinion of his treating physician, Dr. Coats. This contention also lacks merit because the ALJ \u201cset forth specific, legitimate reasons\u201d for rejecting Dr. Coat\u2019s opinion that Laws was permanently disabled. <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 604-605 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-23\">The ALJ\u2019s hypothetical posed to the vocational expert was proper because it was supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Sample v. Schweiker, </em>694 F.2d 639, 644 (9th Cir.1982). Accordingly, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s determination that Laws had the residual functional capacity to perform light work and, therefore, was not disabled within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>meaning of the Act. <em>See Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b862-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
