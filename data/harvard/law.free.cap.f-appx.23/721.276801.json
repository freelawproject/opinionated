Chima (\u201cChima\u201d), an African-American male, brought a law suit against William J. Perry, (\u201cPerry\u201d), Secretary of the United States Department of Defense (\u201cDOD\u201d), in 1994, which asserted eight claims. The district court granted Perry\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice as to all the claims against all the defendants except Chima\u2019s employment discrimination claim against Perry under Title VII of the CM Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>The district court also granted Perry\u2019s motion to dismiss Chima\u2019s Title VII claim without prejudice on the ground that Chima failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. In an unpublished disposition, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss all non-Title VII claims and all claims against defendants other than Perry. The Ninth Circuit reversed as to the district court\u2019s decision that Chima failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before initiating his Title VTI claim. This appeal concerns the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Perry following a bench trial on Chima\u2019s Title VII claim. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Chima first argues that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to exclude the testimony of Perry\u2019s witnesses as a discovery sanction. Chima contends that Perry\u2019s failure to respond to his requests for admissions constitutes failure to cooperate in discovery and that the district court should have sanctioned Perry under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\u201cF.R.C.P.\u201d) 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">Chima served a request for admissions and request for production of documents pursuant to F.R.C.P. 36 on Perry\u2019s witnesses<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. Perry refused to comply with Chima\u2019s discovery requests and the district court refused to compel Perry to comply on the ground that Chima had not complied with Local Rule 7.15, which required the parties to formulate a joint stipulation regarding the discovery issue in dispute. Even if Chima were to have complied with Local Rule 7.15, it is unlikely that the court would have compelled Perry\u2019s witnesses to comply with Chima\u2019s requests. F.R.C.P. 36 applies exclusively to parties, and thus Chima is not permitted to issue requests for admission upon witnesses. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to exclude the testimony of Perry\u2019s witnesses as a discovery sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">Chima next contends that the district court abused its discretion when it denied Chima\u2019s motion in limine to bar Perry from presenting witnesses. Chima argues that Perry and defense witnesses had conspired to obstruct justice and committed perjury. Chima, however, failed to allege or show facts sufficient to support his claim of peijury by the defendants and has only provided conclusory allegations. <em>See Streck v. Peters, </em>855 F.Supp. 1156, 1162 n. 3 (D.Hawai\u2019i 1994) (concluding that where \u201c[t]he only evidence [the plaintiff] provides in support of his perjury allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>tions is his own affidavit testimony, which contains only the most conclusory assertions of perjury and provides no specific facts supporting the assertions ..., [he cannot] create an issue of material fact with regard to the perjury allegations.\u201d (citing <em>Hansen v. United States, </em>7 F.3d 137, 138 (9th Cir.1993) (concluding that \u201c[w]hen the nonmoving party relies only on its own affidavits to oppose summary judgment, it cannot rely on conclusory allegations unsupported by factual data to create an issue of material fact\u201d)). In his brief, Chima merely offers defense witnesses\u2019 testimony and then concludes that these \u201cstatements] demonstrate[ ] that [the witnesses] lied to the District Court, which is tantamount to perjury.\u201d Chima further asserts that the declarations of Ervin Williams, William Stephens, Rosa Howard, Pedro Lamdagan, and Jerry Gasbarra, \u201ccontradict\u201d defense witnesses\u2019 statements. While the testimony of these witnesses does challenge the testimony of defense witnesses, such inconsistencies go to the weight of the evidence and not the admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Chima also contends that the district court abused its discretion when it granted Perry\u2019s motion to exclude Chima\u2019s use of statistical evidence. This data, the \u2018Workforce Profile by Grade Series for DCMDW,\u201d provides statistics on the number of minority workers in each DOD grade level. Chima argues that these statistics support his claim that the DOD discriminates against black male employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In <em>Lynn v. Regents of the University of California, </em>656 F.2d 1337, 1342-43 (9th Cir.1981), this Circuit concluded that \u201c[statistical evidence is unquestionably relevant in a Title VII disparate treatment case.\u201d The Supreme Court has cautioned, however, that not all statistical evidence is relevant: Statistical evidence must be \u201cof a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the exclusion of applicants for jobs or promotions because of their membership in a protected group.\u201d <em>Watson v. Fort Worth Bank And Trust, </em>487 U.S. 977, 994, 108 S.Ct. 2777, 101 L.Ed.2d 827 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">We recognize that statistical evidence is commonly used to support Title VII discrimination actions, but also note that such evidence must be relevant. We conclude that the decision by the lower court to exclude Chima\u2019s statistical data was not erroneous because Chima offered no evidence or explanation of how the evidence supported his employment discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Chima further argues that the district court erred when it failed to compel Perry to comply with the subpoenas Chima served on defense witnesses to testify at trial. Chima served these subpoenas by mail rather than by personal service as required by F.R.C.P. 45(b)(1). Perry asserts that because the subpoenas were not properly served, the DOD was not obligated to permit its employees to attend the trial. Perry further contends that employees were permitted to take personal time to attend the trial but that Chima\u2019s failure to tender witness fees and expenses discouraged the witnesses from attending.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">We agree that Chima probably served the subpoenas improperly and conclude that the district court therefore did not err when it failed to compel the recipients to comply. Regardless, Chima has not shown how the testimony of the witnesses in question would have materially altered the course of the trial. Thus any error was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">We are seriously concerned, however, by the DOD\u2019s letter which the government attached to Chima\u2019s subpoenas and gave to most of the defense witnesses whom Chi-ma served. Defense counsel sent a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>to the subpoenaed witnesses stating that: (1) Chima\u2019s service <em>of </em>the subpoenas is \u201cdefective\u201d; (2) \u201csubpoenaed Government employee witnesses are not compelled to appear merely because the receipt of the subpoena form is through the mail\u201d; (3) regardless of whether the witnesses are properly subpoenaed, the witnesses \u201cmay only be granted \u2018court leave\u2019 (accounted for as official time) when testifying on behalf of [the government]\u201d; (4) witnesses must use \u201ccharged leave or forego pay in order to take time off work to appear\u201d for Chima; and (5) witnesses must \u201cnotify their supervisor\u201d and \u201cobtain approval for the absence from duty prior to the trial date.\u201d While it is true that the subpoenas were defectively served, we find the coercive nature of this letter to be highly troubling. We also question the legality of the requirement that a subpoenaed government employee first obtain approval before appearing in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Lastly, Chima claims that he did not waive his right to a jury trial and that the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>decision to order a bench trial for all of Chima\u2019s claims violated his Seventh Amendment right. We conclude that Chima sufficiently preserved his right to a jury trial when he filed an objection to the order for a bench trial in the form of a memorandum of contentions of fact and law. In his memorandum, Chima repeated his demand for a jury trial and explicitly stated that he did not abandon any issue. Such conduct constitutes a continuing objection sufficient to preserve his right to appeal the denial of his request for a jury. <em>See United States v. Nordbrock, </em>941 F.2d 947, 949-50 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">We must, however, affirm the district court\u2019s decision if we conclude that the district court\u2019s error did not prejudice Chima. \u201cThe erroneous denial of a jury trial in a civil case is subject to harmless error analysis. The denial will be harmless only if no reasonable jury could have found for the losing party .... \u201d <em>Fuller v. City of Oakland, </em>47 F.3d 1522, 1533 (9th Cir.1995) (citation omitted). Chima offers this court no evidence-and there is no evidence in the record-to suggest that a jury would have concluded that the DOD discriminated against Chima on account of his race. Moreover, Chima offered no suggestions as to what the witnesses who were barred from testifying might have testified to or how the statistical evidence Chima sought to introduce might have enhanced his claim. Based on the record before us, we cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s denial of a jury trial was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b755-10\">.
