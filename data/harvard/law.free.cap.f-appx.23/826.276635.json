Guerrero-Martinez\u2019s attorney has moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), on the ground that the appeal presents no arguable issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-24\">As part of his plea agreement, Guerrero-Martinez waived his right to appeal the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>judgment and sentence. Because he received a sentence consistent with the plea agreement, and there is no evidence that the waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing or was not voluntary, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal. <em>United States v.
