The district court held that the contested Proxy Statement was not false or misleading and, therefore, granted Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \u201cPSLRA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we recount them only as needed to explain our decision. In July 1997, Northrop and Lockheed Martin (\u201cLockheed\u201d) announced plans to merge; the union would have created the world\u2019s largest defense contractor. The United States Departments of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and Defense (\u201cDOD\u201d) launched an investigation to assess the antitrust ramifications of the proposed defense-industry juggernaut. In the ensuing months, Northrop and Lockheed had numerous conversations and meetings with the government and responded to its frequent and onerous requests for document production.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">In January 1998, the two companies issued a joint Proxy Statement recommending that shareholders approve the proposed merger. The shareholders subsequent approval of the merger triggered the \u201cchange-in-control\u201d provision of Northrop\u2019s executive stock option plans, resulting in an estimated $150 million windfall for Northrop executives. When the government announced its opposition to the merger weeks later, Northrop and Lockheed abandoned their plans, leaving Northrop and its shareholders $150 million poorer.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">Fanni alleged that Defendants knew months before it issued the Proxy that the government\u2019s opposition to the merger was a \u201cvirtual certainty.\u201d Thus, the following Proxy Statements misrepresented the risk of government opposition as a mere possibility when, in fact, the risk was a near certainty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-15\">It is possible that governmental authorities may impose conditions for granting approval. We may be required to divest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>one or more of either company\u2019s product lines, or agree to various operating restrictions before or after receipt of a shareholder approval, in order to establish compliance with the antitrust laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqoD\">Fanni claimed that the shareholders would not have approved the merger \u2014 and the concomitant $150 million bonanza \u2014 were it not for the aforementioned statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). \u201c[T]he PSLRA has modified the liberal, notice pleading standard found in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>Desaigoudar v. Meyercord, </em>223 F.3d 1020, 1021 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Thus, while Fanni\u2019s allegations of material fact are presumed true, we must consider whether the complaint complies with the PSLRA\u2019s \u201cmore stringent pleading requirements.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Fanni\u2019s complaint clearly alleges fraud, accusing Defendants of concealing their awareness of the government\u2019s certain opposition to the merger in order to secure shareholder approval.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fanni is, thus, subject to the PSLRA\u2019s rigorous pleading requirements which govern securities fraud class actions. Fanni fails to satisfy this heightened pleading standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">SEC Rule 14a-9 prohibits any proxy solicitation \u201cwhich, at the time ... it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-9. The PSLRA requires Fanni\u2019s complaint to \u201cspecify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the ... reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(1) (2001). <em>See also Desaigoudar, </em>223 F.3d at 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">Fanni\u2019s complaint specifies in great detail conversations and meetings between Defendants and government officials during which Defendants supposedly learned of the government\u2019s steadfast opposition to the merger. Fanni clearly grounds its factual allegations on \u201cinformation and belief\u201d (rather than personal knowledge) yet its complaint offers no facts by which we can assess its credibility. The PSLRA requires Fanni to \u201cstate with particularity all facts forming the basis for [its] belief,\u201d and to \u201cprovide a list of <em>all relevant circumstances </em>in great detail.\u201d <em>In re Silicon Graphics Inc. Secs. Litig., </em>183 F.3d 970, 983, 984 (9th Cir.1999) (emphasis added). Specifically, the complaint must reveal the \u201csources of [Fanni\u2019s] information,\u201d \u201ccorroborating details,\u201d and facts suggesting the reliability of its assertions. <em>Id. </em>at 985. Fanni fails to state the sources of its information, any corroborating details, or other indicia of the reliability of its assertions. Accordingly, the PSLRA requires that we dismiss Fanni\u2019s complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number><em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(3)(A) (requiring dismissal of private securities fraud action where complaint fails to meet pleading requirements of \u00a7 78u-4(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b815-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-16\">. \u201cFanni'' denotes the three class actions\u2014 the Fanni, Schnee, and Florida State Board of Administration actions \u2014 consolidated for trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\">. Fanni\u2019s contention that it accuses Defendants of negligence or recklessness, rather than fraud, is belied by its complaint. The following is representative of Fanni\u2019s allegations: \"By the time of the proposed shareholder vote on the merger, [Defendants] knew that it was a virtual certainty that the Government would oppose the merger. Nevertheless, they stood silent ... because they stood to gain personally from that approval.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">Even were we to accept that the complaint did not allege fraud, and thus, was not governed by the PSLRA\u2019s stringent pleading standards, the PSLRA's \"safe-harbor\u201d provision would insulate the allegedly misleading statements because they were \u201cforward-looking\u201d and accompanied by \"meaningful cautionary language.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c)(1) to (c)(1)(A)(i), (i)(1)(B), (i)(1)(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
