We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The Ashes argue that STLB\u2019s commercial general liability (CGL) insurance policy is ambiguous because an ordinary insured could reasonably conclude that the products-completed operations (PCO) coverage arose independently of Coverage A and its auto exclusion. Gainsco agrees that the CGL policy includes PCO coverage, but contends that it is in Coverage A which unambiguously excludes injuries arising out of use of an automobile. This must be so, as the only insuring agreement for bodily injury and property damage liability is in Coverage A. The policy also specifies that the PCO aggregate limit is the most Gainsco will pay \u201cunder coverage A for damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damage\u2019 included in the \u2018products-completed operations hazard.\u2019 \u201d The Ashes\u2019 suggestion that the endorsement containing the ISO 2104 Exclusion excludes PCO coverage from Coverage A but not from the policy as a whole lacks substance; apart from Coverage A, there is no insuring agreement for PCO coverage. Regardless of why the endorsement was issued, and whether it is confusing, the endorsement neither creates PCO coverage in some non-existent other part nor causes the policy to be ambiguous as to the source of PCO coverage. <em>See Stanford Ranch, Inc. v. Maryland Cas. Co., </em>89 F.3d 618 (9th Cir.1996); <em>Ray v. Valley Forge Ins. Co., </em>77 Cal.App.4th 1039, 92 Cal.Rptr.2d 473 (Ct.App.1999). Thus, the automobile exclusion applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">This must have comported with STLB\u2019s reasonable expectations, for it paid no premium for separate PCO coverage and the declarations indicate that the limit of PCO coverage is zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Further, the PCO definitions are consistent with the automobile exclusion in Coverage A. \u201cYour product\u201d includes \u201ccontainers (other than vehicles),\u201d and excludes \u201cvending machines or other property rented to or located for the use of others but not sold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Accordingly, there is no possibility of coverage giving rise to any duty to defend, no obligation to indemnify, and no bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b829-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
