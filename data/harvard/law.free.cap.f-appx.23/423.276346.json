This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Lawrence Friedman, Trustee for the Chapter 7 estate of the captioned debtor, filed an adversary proceeding against Kenneth Mit\u00e1n (defendant-appellant), Keith Mit\u00e1n, Mit\u00e1n Mid-America Management Department, Inc., Pellestar Ltd., Mit\u00e1n III Limited Partnership, Mecca One Limited Partnership, Mt. Hollywood Limited Partnership and Mit\u00e1n Properties Corp. (collectively \u201cco-defendants\u201d) seeking to recover approximately $500,000.00 in damages. On April 21, 1997, the parties entered a Settlement Agreement. The settlement was noticed to the debtor\u2019s creditors, and on September 2, 1997, the bankruptcy court issued its opinion and order approving the settlement and denying a motion for an order sealing the court file. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision in an opinion and order entered September 10, 1998. This court affirmed the district court\u2019s decision in an order filed July 11, 2000. <em>See Mitan v. Friedman (In re Polemar Constr. Ltd., P\u2019ship), </em>2000 WL 1256953 (6th Cir. July 11, 2000) (unpublished order). No further appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">As a result of the Settlement Agreement, the defendants agreed to remit to the Trustee the sum of $40,000.00 payable in ten consecutive, equal monthly installments of $4,000.00 each, the first such payment being due and payable on the thirtieth day after the date the Settlement Order became final and non-appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The Trustee contends that by the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the first payment was due August 11, 2000, and that the defendants failed to remit payment by that date. Pursuant to Paragraph C of the Settlement Agreement, in the event of a default by the defendants, the Trustee may accelerate the unpaid balance if payment has not been received within seven days of written notice of the default. The Trustee served written notice on the defendants on September 20, 2000. The Trustee contends that the defendants still failed to remit payment. Thereafter, the Trustee filed a motion for entry of judgment on the Settlement Agreement in the district court. The defendants filed a response arguing that they were not in default because the time to commence installment payments had not arrived because the court had not yet entered a final non-appealable order approving the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">After a hearing on the motion, the district court entered a judgment and final order on October 31, 2000, approving the Settlement Agreement and dismissing the action with prejudice as against defendants Keith Mit\u00e1n and Mit\u00e1n Properties Corp. The court also ordered that installment payments under the terms of the Settlement Agreement commence 30 days after the date of the order and in accordance with the settlement terms. Kenneth Mi-tan is the sole appellant in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Kenneth Mitan\u2019s sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred by refusing to seal the settlement agreement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>district court\u2019s decision to seal (or not to seal) court records is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See EEOC v. Nat\u2019l Children\u2019s Ctr., Inc., </em>98 F.3d 1406, 1409 (D.C.Cir.1996) (citing <em>Johnson v. Greater Southeast Cmty. Hosp. Corp., </em>951 F.2d 1268, 1277 (D.C.Cir.1991)). Abuse of discretion is \u201ca definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Davis v. Jellico Cmty. Hosp. Inc., </em>912 F.2d 129, 133 (6th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). A court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, improperly applies the law, or uses an erroneous legal standard. <em>See Romstadt v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>59 F.3d 608, 615 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">There is a strong public policy in favor of public access to judicial proceedings, most particularly as relates to a court\u2019s order or decree, embodying a settlement. <em>See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Children\u2019s Ctr., Inc., </em>98 F.3d at 1409; <em>SEC v. Van Waeyenberghe, </em>990 F.2d 845, 848 (5th Cir.1993). In exercising its discretion to seal judicial records, the court must balance the public\u2019s common law right of access against the interests favoring nondisclosure. <em>See Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 589, 599, 602, 98 S.Ct. 1306, 55 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978) (court must consider \u201crelevant facts and circumstances of the particular case\u201d); <em>Belo Broadcasting Corp. v.. Clark, </em>654 F.2d 423, 434 (5th Cir.1981); <em>see also Bank of Am. Nat\u2019l Trust &amp; Sav. Ass\u2019n v. Hotel Rittenhouse Assocs., </em>800 F.2d 339, 344 (3d Cir.1986) (court had duty to \u201cbalance the factors favoring secrecy against the common law presumption of access\u201d); <em>Newman v. Graddick, </em>696 F.2d 796, 803 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cThe historic presumption of access to judicial records must be considered in the balance of competing interests.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to seal the Settlement Agreement. Mit\u00e1n did not give any reasons justifying sealing the Settlement Agreement. Further, the Settlement Agreement provisions were already noticed out to parties in interest and thus a material and basic part of what Mit\u00e1n sought to seal had already been disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Accordingly, the October 31, 2000, judgment and final order approving the Settlement Agreement is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
