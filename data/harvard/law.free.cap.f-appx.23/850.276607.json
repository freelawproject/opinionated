The district court granted the INS\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We have jurisdiction of the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">On October 31, 1995, appellants filed applications for adjustment of their status to that of permanent residents; because he was under twenty-one years old at the time (he was eighteen), Jung Hee\u2019s application was derivative of his father Ki Shik\u2019s. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153(d), 1101(b)(1). On February 24, 1998, the INS granted Ki Shik\u2019s application. On February 4, 1999, the INS denied Jung Hee\u2019s application on the ground that he had become ineligible, having turned twenty-one (\u201caged out\u201d) on February 10,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Appellants contend that the INS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to adjudicate their applications in chronological order or to expedite their adjudication. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a), \u201cthe status of an alien ... may be adjusted by the Attorney General, <em>in his discretion </em>and under such regulations as he may prescribe, to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.... \u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 1252(a)(2)(B) further provides that \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review \u2014 (i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1255.... \u201d Given the claim before it, the district court correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Even if we were to reach appellants\u2019 contention that by taking twenty-eight months to process Jung Hee\u2019s application the INS violated its Operating Instruction 103.2q, it would be of no avail. The instruction states a policy that cases be processed in chronological order. Appellants have offered no evidence that the INS did not process the application in chronological order. Rather, they contend that the INS violated the instruction by failing to exercise its discretion to take his application out of turn because of the length of time for which it had been pending and his imminent aging out. Thus, even if the instruction were held to create a substantive right, appellants\u2019 argument does not assert a violation. <em>Cf. Abboud v. INS, </em>140 F.3d 843, 848-49 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b882-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-8\">. Although, as the INS attorney represented during oral argument, jurisdiction may exist to review a new, adequately pled equitable tolling claim, this appeal does not present that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
