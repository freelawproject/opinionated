We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s order, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>uphold the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence and is free of legal error. <em>Verduzco v. Apfel, </em>188 F.3d 1087, 1089 (9th Cir.1999). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Based on the medical evidence, the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) correctly found that Groepler\u2019s mental impairment was not severe during the period between his alleged onset date, April 15, 1989, and his date last insured, December 31, 1994. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521. Because Groepler\u2019s mental impairment was not severe, the ALJ was not obligated to seek the assistance of a medical advisor to establish an onset date. <em>See </em>Social Security Ruling 83-20,1983 WL 31249, at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The ALJ erred in disregarding the records from Mira Boone, a licensed clinical social worker, who held weekly therapy sessions with Groepler from approximately August 1994 through February 1996. <em>Cf Crane v. Shalala, </em>76 F.3d 251, 254 (9th Cir.1996). However, because the medical records from acceptable medical sources support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Groepler did not suffer from a severe mental impairment during the relevant period, the ALJ\u2019s error was harmless. <em>See Booz v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>734 F.2d 1378, 1380 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b711-31\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
