Martinez appeals his conviction and sentence for one count of being an illegal alien found in the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Martinez contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. He specifically claims that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was found in the United States on February 22, 1999, the date alleged in the indictment. We review de novo, <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>244 F.3d 1037, 1042 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 221, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2001), and find Martinez\u2019s contention unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">The date on which Martinez was found is not an element of \u00a7 1326(a). <em>Cf. United States v. Parga-Rosas, </em>238 F.3d 1209, 1213-14 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 319, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2001); <em>United States v. Ramos-Oseguera, </em>120 F.3d 1028, 1035 (9th Cir.1997) (stating that variance in date is not reversible error unless t\u00fane is a material element of the charged offense), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">The indictment in this case gave Martinez notice of what evidence would be presented against him, <em>see United States v. Antonakeas, </em>255 F.3d 714, 722-23 (9th Cir.2001), and did not affect his substantial rights, <em>see United States v. Tsinhnahijinnie, </em>112 F.3d 988, 991 (9th Cir.1997). Accordingly, any variance between the date specified in the indictment and the date Martinez was actually found in the United States was not fatal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Tsinhnahijinnie, </em>112 F.3d at 911; <em>see also United States v. Laykin, </em>886 F.2d 1534, 1542-43 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">Martinez also contends that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the existence of a prior felony conviction used to enhance his sentence must be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Martinez further contends that <em>Apprendi </em>limited <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) to its unique facts. Martinez\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>contentions are foreclosed by our decisions in both <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.) (applying plain error review), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001) and <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001) (applying de novo review).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b856-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-12\">. Although the district court denied Martinez's motion for judgment of acquittal on a different ground, we may affirm on any basis supported by the record. <em>United States v.
