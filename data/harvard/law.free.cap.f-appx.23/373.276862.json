Quist, United States District Judge for the Western District of Michigan, silting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Kathy Heaton Miller, a federal prisoner, appeals her conviction for conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute methamphetamine and distribution of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1). This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1). Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">In a multiple-count indictment involving Miller and several co-defendants, Miller was indicted on the above charges (Counts 1 and 5) as well as on an additional count of distribution (Count 6). A jury convicted Miller on Counts 1 and 5, and Count 6 was dismissed on the government\u2019s motion. The district court thereafter sentenced Miller to 70 months in prison, 4 years of supervised release, and a $200 special assessment. This sentence fell within the guideline sentencing range of 70-87 months in prison, based upon a total offense level of 26 and a criminal history category of II.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">Miller\u2019s court-appointed counsel has filed an appellate brief and a motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). After a review of the entire record, counsel was of the opinion that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but nonetheless raised one possible issue: whether Miller\u2019s conviction was supported by sufficient evidence. Miller was notified of her right to respond to her attorney\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, but no response has been received by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">Upon review, we conclude that counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw should be granted as counsel has filed an acceptable <em>Anders </em>brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">Counsel suggests, at Miller\u2019s urging, that insufficient evidence exists to support her conviction because she believes that two of her co-defendants, Helen Bledsoe Cobb and Barry Oliver, did not testify truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-17\">\u201cAttacks on witness credibility are simple challenges to the quality of the government\u2019s evidence and not the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gibbs, </em>182 F.3d 408, 424 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1051, 120 S.Ct. 592, 145 L.Ed.2d 492 (1999). It was for the jury to decide whether Miller or the witnesses against her were more credible, and the jury chose not to believe Miller. Nonetheless, we have examined whether Miller\u2019s convictions are supported by sufficient evidence. Sufficient evidence exists to support a conviction where, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). To show a conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, \u201cthe government must prove the existence of an agreement to violate drug laws and that each conspirator knew of, intended to join and participated in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Peters, </em>15 F.3d 540, 544 (6th Cir.1994). A formal or express agreement is unnecessary to establish a conspiracy under \u00a7 846; a mere \u201ctacit or mutual understanding among the parties\u201d is sufficient. <em>United States v. Phibbs, </em>999 F.2d 1053, 1063 (6th Cir.1993). To establish a violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1), the government must prove knowing possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. <em>United States v. Christian, </em>786 F.2d 203, 210 (6th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the United States, a rational jury could have found the essential elements of each crime based on the testimony of Cobb and Oliver and a confidential informant, Jack Key. Cobb testified that she had advanced ounces of methamphetamine to Miller, who still owed her $4,000 for doing so. Cobb also testified that Miller notarized the bill of sale when Cobb traded her horse and colt for methamphetamine provided by Oliver. Oliver confirmed Cobb\u2019s testimony about the horse trade and also testified that he had sold Miller two or three grams directly. Finally, Key described a controlled purchase where he went to Miller\u2019s residence to buy \u201ccrank\u201d (methamphetamine) from Miller\u2019s common-law husband, Pete Osborne. Although Osborne was not there, Miller retrieved a gram of methamphetamine from a back bedroom and sold it to Key for $120. Thus, sufficient evidence exists to support Miller\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We have reviewed the record for other possible issues which would merit review and have found none. We do note, however, two minor clerical mistakes on the first page of the judgment. The line which states that defendant \u201cwas found guilty on count(s) <em>one &amp; two of the Indictment\u201d </em>should be corrected to indicate instead that defendant was found guilty of counts one and five. Additionally, the district court should check a box further down and indicate that \u201cCount(s) <em>six </em>is dismissed on the motion of the United States.\u201d These are mere clerical mistakes which may be corrected by the district court at any time pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed, and the action is remanded for correction of the clerical mistakes. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
