UNITED STATES of America, Defendant-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b921-11\">No. 01-1254.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b921-12\">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b921-14\">Nov. 14, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b921-15\">Before SEYMOUR and McKAY, Circuit Judges, and BRORBY, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b921-16\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"AhPo\">McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b921-17\">After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-18\">Mr. Owens-El appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his <em>Bivens </em>claim and his tort claims brought pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act. In essence, Mr. Owens-El seeks monetary damages resulting from his allegedly illegal incarceration. Additionally, Mr. Owens-El challenges the district court\u2019s denial of standing for Mr. Owens-El to prosecute claims under various criminal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-21\">We have reviewed Mr. Owens-El\u2019s claims and the district court\u2019s Order and Judgment of Dismissal filed April 9, 2001. We are convinced that the district court\u2019s decision is correct. For the same reasons as those stated in the district court\u2019s Order and Judgment of Dismissal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-22\">The motion to proceed on appeal in for-ma pauperis is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b921-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
