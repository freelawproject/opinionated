The district court explained in its opinion that state courts in West Virginia had already considered Barden\u2019s arbitration claim and had entered judgment against Barden in the contractual dispute. The district court found that Barden\u2019s petition in federal court was in effect an attempt to upset the judgment of the West Virginia circuit court and held that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine precluded federal court jurisdiction over Barden\u2019s petition. We agree with the district court that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Barden\u2019s petition to compel arbitration, and we affirm on that court\u2019s reasoning. <em>See Barden &amp; Robeson Corp. v. Fellowship Baptist Church of Vienna, </em>No. 6:00-1005 (S.D.W.Va. Jan. 9, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
