Trent appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment affirming the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security denying his application for disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>district court\u2019s decision and must uphold the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1279 (9th Cir.1996). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Trent\u2019s argument that the ALJ\u2019s negative credibility determination concerning his pain and symptoms testimony is not supported by clear and convincing reasons is not persuasive because the ALJ pointed to evidence in the record supporting his findings. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 604 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Because Trent\u2019s treating physician\u2019s supplemental evidence was based on Trent\u2019s subjective complaints of ankle pain and stiffness, which the ALJ already properly discounted, the ALJ properly rejected Dr. Daly\u2019s opinion. <em>See Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The Montana State Agency Residual Functional Capacity Assessment form, indicating that Trent can occasionally lift 50 pounds and frequently lift or carry 25 pounds, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. 404.1567(c), constitutes substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Trent retained the residual functional capacity to perform medium work. <em>See Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Although the ALJ found that Trent is unable to return to his past relevant work as a carpet installer, the ALJ properly found that Trent is capable of performing his past relevant work as a maintenance man, retail pricer, and carpet repairer. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e) (providing that if a claimant can perform past relevant work, the ALJ must find the claimant \u201cnot disabled\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b707-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
