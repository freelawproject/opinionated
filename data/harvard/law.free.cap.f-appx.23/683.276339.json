We have jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>tion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">We lack jurisdiction to address the Peckhams\u2019 arguments concerning the merits of the district court\u2019s original entry of judgment because the Peckhams both failed to file a timely notice of appeal within 60 days of entry of final judgment and failed to file a timely post judgment tolling motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4. Accordingly by order dated October 11, 2000, this court limited the scope of the Peck-hams\u2019 appeal to the court\u2019s denial of their motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">\u201cAn untimely motion for reconsideration is construed as a motion based on Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).\u201d <em>Mt. Graham Red Squirrel v. Madigan, </em>954 F.2d 1441, 1463 n. 35 (9th Cir.1992). Denial of such a motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah County v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262 (9th Cir.1993). Because the Peckhams failed to demonstrate mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, newly-discovered evidence, or any other basis for relief from judgment, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying their motion to reconsider. <em>See id., </em>at 1262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b715-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
