Vannest <em>et al., </em>participants in a Limited Partnership Agreement, appeal from so much of a judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, David G. Larimer, <em>Chief Judge, </em>as dismissed their claim against defendant PNC Bank, National Association (\u201cPNC\u201d or the \u201cBank\u201d), for breach of a related Escrow Agreement. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of PNC because the Bank acted in accordance with the Escrow Agreement as amended by the Limited Partnership\u2019s general partner, Kenver Assurance Corporation of America (\u201cKenver\u201d). On appeal, plaintiffs argue that Kenver did not have authority to amend the original Escrow Agreement and that PNC owed the investors a fiduciary duty to return their money under the terms set out in the original Escrow Agreement. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">The Limited Partnership Agreement and the Certificate of Limited Partnership were filed with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on August 1, 1986. The original Escrow Agreement was executed on August 15,1986, by Kenver on behalf of the Partnership and by PNC. Thereafter, plaintiffs signed a Subscription Agreement; that document stated that, by signing the Subscription Agreement, each investor agreed to the Limited Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partnership Agreement was between Kenver as the general partner and the individual investors as limited partners. Article 9.1.4 of the Limited Partnership Agreement granted Kenver the power to \u201cexecute, sign and deliver in furtherance of any or all of the purposes of the Partnership, any and all agreements, contracts, documents, certifications, subscriptions and other instruments necessary or convenient in connection with the business of the Partnership; all of which may contain such terms, provisions and conditions, subject to the terms of the Agreement, as the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion shall deem appropriate.\u201d We see no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion as a matter of law that the Limited Partnership Agreement gave Kenver authority to sign the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>amended Escrow Agreement in November 1986. Even if Kenver lacked actual authority to enter into the amendments to the Escrow Agreement, PNC was entitled to rely on Kenver\u2019s apparent authority. Given that there is no contention that the Bank failed to comply with the terns of the Escrow Agreement as ultimately amended, we conclude that the complaint against PNC was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">We have considered all of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions on this appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
