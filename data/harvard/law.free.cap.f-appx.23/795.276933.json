Galvez-Garcia failed to appear at his deportation proceeding, and was ordered deported <em>in absentia. </em>Galvez-Garcia sought to reopen his deportation hearing claiming exceptional circumstances based on the ineffective assistance of counsel. The IJ denied his motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>reopen because Galvez-Garcia had not met the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 1988 WL 235454 (BIA 1988) for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Galvez-Garcia appealed to the BIA, attaching new evidence that prima facie meets the requirements of <em>Lozada. </em>The BIA refused to consider the evidence on the ground that its role is to review the record, not create one.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Motions involving new evidence which are presented while an appeal is still pending are in appropriate circumstances to be treated as motions to remand. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(b)(1);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Galvez-Garcia attached a \u201cMotion to Reopen and Reconsider\u201d to his Notice of Appeal to the BIA, his request to reopen and reconsider his case should have been treated by the BIA as a motion to remand to the IJ, under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2, for consideration of the <em>Lozada </em>evidence. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>841 F.2d 865, 867 (9th Cir.l987)(\u201cSince the appeal was pending and the Board had not yet \u2018rendered a decision,\u2019 ... the BIA properly treated their motion as a \u2018motion to remand to the immigration judge.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Galvez-Garcia made a prima facie showing that he was eligible for the relief he sought, and explained the failure to introduce the new facts earlier. In his \u201cMotion to Reopen and Reconsider,\u201d filed pro se, he set forth evidence that he met the <em>Lozada </em>requirements for reopening on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel: (1) he presented evidence of his agreement with his attorney; (2) he asserted that he had attempted to contact his attorney regarding the ineffectiveness complaint; (3) he presented evidence that he had made a complaint to the state bar; and (4) he asserted prejudice from his counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance alleging that he was eligible for suspension of deportation and that grounds existed on which the Attorney General could have favorably exercised his discretion. He also explained that at the time he filed his petition before the IJ, \u201cnot being and [sic] attorney and without the benefit of competent counsel [he] was unable to comply with the Court orders and rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">A decision by the BIA not to remand is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 528 (9th Cir.2000). Under the abuse of discretion standard, the decision of the BIA must be overturned if it was arbitrary, irrational or contrary to law. <em>Israel v. INS, </em>785 F.2d 738, 739 (9th Cir.1986). Given that Galvez-Garcia had met the primary <em>Lozada </em>requirements by the time he reached the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>BIA, and that his appeal and his motion had been filed pro se, and that the regulations set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2 allow motions to reopen and reconsider to be treated as motions to remand if they are filed prior to or subsequent to the filing of an appeal with the BIA, as here, it was arbitrary and irrational for the BIA to fail to treat the petitioner\u2019s motion as a motion to remand. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">We reverse the decision of the Board, and order it to remand to the Immigration Judge with directions to reconsider Galvez-Garcia\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and, assuming the <em>Lazada </em>standard is met, to consider his application for suspension of deportation on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b827-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\">.
