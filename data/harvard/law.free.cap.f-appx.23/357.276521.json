Smith appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal of a final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security. He challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits was supported by substantial evidence. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Smith applied to the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) for supplemental security income and disability benefits on October 14, 1993. He claims disability based on neck and shoulder pain, neuropathy in his legs, depression and migraines. The SSA Appeals Council adopted as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision a memorandum opinion in which an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) concluded that Smith was not disabled and therefore not entitled to benefits because he could still perform jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy despite his impairments. The ALJ based his finding on testimony from treating and examining physicians and a vocational expert. The ALJ attached a multiple-choice Psychiatric Review Technique (\u201cPRT\u201d) questionnaire to the memorandum opinion which assessed the degree of functional limitation caused by Smith\u2019s mental impairment. As part of this assessment, the ALJ marked that Smith \u201cOften\u201d suffered \u201cDeficiencies of Concentration, Persistence or Pace Resulting in Failure to Complete Tasks in a Timely Manner,\u201d a rating in the middle of a five-part scale that ran from \u201cNever\u201d to \u201cConstant.\u201d The district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Garner v. Heckler, </em>745 F.2d 383, 387 (6th Cir.1984); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (stating that the Commissioner\u2019s findings as to any fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence). Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>See Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">A vocational expert\u2019s testimony concerning the availability of suitable work may constitute substantial evidence where the testimony is elicited in response to a hypothetical question that accurately sets forth the plaintiffs physical and mental impairments. <em>See Varley v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>820 F.2d 777, 779 (6th Cir.1987). Here, the ALJ described Smith\u2019s work experience and physical restrictions to the vocational expert, and characterized his mental impairment as limiting him to jobs that are routine and low stress, and do not involve intense interpersonal confrontations, high quotas, unprotected heights or operation of dangerous machinery. The ALJ then asked the expert whether Smith could perform jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy despite his impairments. The expert identified four such jobs: order clerk, assignment clerk, dispatcher, and telephone answering service operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Smith argues that the vocational expert\u2019s assessment cannot provide substantial evidence for the ALJ\u2019s decision because the ALJ did not accurately characterize Smith\u2019s mental impairment in his hypothetical to the expert. Specifically, Smith argues that the ALJ should have added the instruction that the claimant \u201coften\u201d suffers deficiencies in concentration, persistence or pace resulting in failure to complete tasks in a timely manner, as the ALJ indicated in the PRT. Under cross examination by Smith\u2019s attorney, the vocational expert admitted that such an additional stipulation would affect the claimant\u2019s work performance at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>the foui\u2019 identified jobs and might render it impossible for him to perform one or more of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We disagree. The ALJ\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d Smith relies on here \u2014 that Smith \u201coften\u201d has problems concentrating that preclude him from completing tasks on time \u2014 was a single box the ALJ checked in a 1-5 rating scale on a standard psychiatric assessment form. But the ALJ went beyond this simple frequency assessment to develop a complete and accurate assessment of Smith\u2019s mental impairment, as <em>Varley </em>requires. In particular, the ALJ relied on the testimony of four physicians who characterized Smith\u2019s concentration problems as minimal or negligible. The ALJ then translated Smith\u2019s condition into the only concrete restrictions available to him \u2014 examining psychiatrist Schweid\u2019s recommended restrictions against quotas, complexity, stress, etc. \u2014 and duly incorporated them into his hypothetical to the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">It is true that a fifth physician, Dr. Beckner, concluded that Smith suffered an \u201cinability to concentrate\u201d that made it \u201cdifficult to impossible\u201d for Smith to work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the ALJ rejected this assessment based on the reports of the other physicians and because it was unsupported by objective medical facts. This represents a credibility determination which this court may not disturb absent compelling reason. <em>See Varley, </em>820 F.2d at 780 (ALJ\u2019s credibility determination \u201cshould not be discarded lightly\u201d); <em>Garner, </em>745 F.2d at 387 (\u201cThis Court may not try the case <em>de novo, </em>... nor decide questions of credibility.\u201d). No such reason exists here. Accordingly, this court finds that the ALJ accurately characterized Smith\u2019s impairments in his hypothetical to the vocational expert. Because there are no other apparent defects in that expert\u2019s testimony, we conclude that it provides substantial evidence for the ALJ\u2019s finding that Smith was capable of performing jobs found in significant numbers in the national economy and thus was not disabled nor entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">The authorities Smith relies on do not compel a different result. <em>See Herriman v. Apfel, </em>No. 99-CV-73489-DT, 2000 WL 246598, at *1 (E.D.Mich. Feb. 11, 2000) (unpublished); <em>Brooks v. Comm\u2019r, </em>No. CIV. 98-6329-JO, 1999 WL 552663, at *1, *5 (D.Ore. July 26, 1999) (unpublished); <em>McGuire v. Apfel, </em>No. CIV. 98-1302-ST, 1999 WL 426035, at *1, *15-16 (D.Ore. May 11, 1999) (unpublished). In all of these cases, the district court remanded the Commissioner\u2019s decision because the ALJ did not include in a hypothetical to a vocational expert a previous finding that the claimant \u201coften\u201d suffered from problems with concentration. But the ALJs in <em>Herriman </em>and <em>Brooks </em>appear to have made no attempt to incorporate concentration difficulties in their instructions to the vocational expert. These cases are therefore inapposite. <em>McGuire </em>held that an instruction that the plaintiff could perform only simple tasks did not adequately address the ALJ\u2019s prior finding that concentration problems might preclude timely completion of work. <em>See McGuire, </em>1999 WL 426035, at *15-16. Here, the ALJ\u2019s restriction against jobs with quotas adequately addresses that timeliness issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\">.
