There is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the following: (1) whether Chandrasena had the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>fraudulent intent and (2) whether Provident Life justifiably relied upon Chandrasena\u2019s misstatements with respect to his income.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">In order to prevail in its action, Provident Life is required to show that Chandrasena\u2019s misstatements were made with knowledge and with intent to defraud. <em>Fraker v. Sentry Life Ins. Co., </em>19 Cal.App.4th 276, 23 Cal.Rptr.2d 372, 377 (1993); Witkin, Summary of California Law \u00a7 676 (9th ed.1988). Intent is ordinarily a highly fact-intensive question. Here, there are several pieces of evidence that would indicate that Chandrasena\u2019s misstatements were not made with fraudulent intent. For example, neither the application form Chandrasena was asked to till out nor the insurance broker who was assisting Chandrasena made any reference to the particular business expense or class of expenses Provident Life claims he was to have deducted from his reported income. Drawing all inferences in Chandrasena\u2019s favor, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether he knowingly misstated his income with the intent to defraud Provident Life.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Under California law, the right of insurers to reasonably rely on the representations of an insured is waived when an insurer fails to investigate facts that are \u201cdistinctly implied\u201d from other facts. <em>Cohen v. Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>48 Cal.2d 720, 312 P.2d 241, 245 (1957). Provident Life was alerted to a possible significant discrepancy with respect to Chandrasena\u2019s income when it received the report it had solicited from an outside entity, because the report listed Chandrasena\u2019s income as far less than he had reported. Provident Life\u2019s subsequent action, or lack of action, raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether it waived its right to reasonably rely on Chandrasena\u2019s representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b777-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b778-7\">SILVERMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A2q\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">I respectfully dissent. Chandrasena came forward with nothing to support his argument \u2014 and that\u2019s all it is, an unsubstantiated argument \u2014 that he somehow believed that all business expenses were deductible from gross receipts except for the cost of goods sold. Furthermore, as the district judge correctly pointed out, even if Chandrasena truly labored under that odd misunderstanding, it still would not come close to explaining the magnitude of the discrepancy between what he told Provident and what he told the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that there are material facts in dispute concerning the reasonableness of Provident\u2019s reliance on Chandrasena\u2019s misrepresentations. The undisputed facts show that Provident made several inquiries of Chandrasena about his income and that Chandrasena repeatedly confirmed his previous representations. He also supplied what he represented to be an unsigned copy of his 1989 tax return. In underwriting the policy, Provident did not have to assume that it was dealing with a crook. It had the right to rely on Chandrasena\u2019s repeated representations. <em>Robinson v. Occidental Life Ins., </em>131 Cal.App.2d 581, 281 P.2d 39 (1955). It is undisputed that the Equifax report showed Chandrasena\u2019s annual income to be $60,000.00, but it also is undisputed that the report itself does not indicate the basis for that conclusion and specifically states that Chandrasena was not available for an interview. In the face of Chandrasena\u2019s repeated and consistent oral and written representations and the purported tax return he supplied \u2014 none of which he dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>putes having said or done \u2014 it was not unreasonable for Provident to have believed Chandrasena over the Equifax report.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">I would affirm the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
