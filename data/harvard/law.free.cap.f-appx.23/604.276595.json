Madge after he failed to file tax returns for the years 1987-93. Madge petitioned for review, and the Tax Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> upheld the amounts and sanctioned Madge for pursuing frivolous arguments. Madge appeals, arguing that income he received from his business was not \u201cgross income\u201d under the tax code, he was denied due process, and the sanction was inappropriate. After careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-22\">Madge, who elected not to introduce any evidence, failed to meet his burden of proving that the Commissioner\u2019s deficiency determination was incorrect, <em>see Mattingly v. United States, </em>924 F.2d 785, 787 (8th Cir.1991), and the Tax Court properly rejected Madge\u2019s contention that the income from his business was not \u201cgross income\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(a). Based on the undisputed evidence at trial- \u2014 which showed, among other things, that Madge used false identification for some bank accounts and threatened cooperating witnesses \u2014 we conclude the Commissioner proved fraud by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Scallen v. Comm\u2019r, </em>877 F.2d 1364, 1370 (8th Cir.1989). Finally, the Tax Court did not abuse its discretion by sanctioning Madge for insisting upon pursuing frivolous arguments after the Court repeatedly warned him not to do so. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673; <em>Hammers v. Comm\u2019r, </em>894 F.2d 282, 283 (8th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm. We also deny Madge\u2019s motions for oral argument and to take notice of his recent tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-16\">.
