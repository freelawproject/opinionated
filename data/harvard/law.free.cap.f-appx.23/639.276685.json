The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted Rasmussen\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that Rasmussen was not a state actor under section 1983. Hendricks appeals, arguing that Rasmussen became a state actor when he invoked a state involuntary-commitment statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-20\">We agree with the district court that Rasmussen was not a state actor. <em>See Youngblood v. Hy-Vee Food Stores, Inc., </em>266 F.3d 851, 855 (8th Cir.2001) (private party\u2019s mere invocation of state legal procedures does not constitute state action; finding no state action where merchant detained suspected shoplifter in reliance on state statute allowing reasonable detentions for reasonable amount of time); Ellison v. <em>Garbarino, </em>48 F.3d 192,195-96 (6th Cir.1995) (finding no state action when private physician admitted patient pursuant to state involuntary-commitment statute). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-21\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-23\">. The Honorable David S.
