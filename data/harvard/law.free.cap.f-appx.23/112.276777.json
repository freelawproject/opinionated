Murphy, David M. Dansby, Jr., James A. Dickens, and Veamarea Coble appeal from the magistrate judge\u2019s order granting in part Defendant\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in this employment discrimination action.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We have reviewed the record and the magistrate judge\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the magistrate judge. <em>Coble v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth., </em>No. CA-99-236-3-H (W.D.N.C. filed Mar. 13, 2001; entered Mar. 15, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>To the extent that Coble seeks to appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s previous order granting Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on her complaint, we find that Coble\u2019s notice of appeal as to that order was not timely filed. Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Deft of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The magistrate judge\u2019s order was entered on the docket on December 7, 2000; therefore, it was incumbent upon Coble to file her notice of appeal within thirty days of the court\u2019s order, i.e., January 8, 2001. Coble did not file her notice of appeal until April 12, 2001. We therefore dismiss her appeal as to that order for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b145-18\"> The parties consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
