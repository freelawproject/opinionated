We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">I. <em>Whether the bankruptcy court erred in determining that McDonald\u2019s did not have an equitable lien on the escrow account or related segregated account.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The question whether McDonald\u2019s had a valid equitable lien on the construction funds in the escrow account or related segregated account for purposes of bankruptcy is governed by state law. <em>Trust Corp. of Mont. v. Patterson (In re Copper King Inn, Inc.), </em>918 F.2d 1404, 1407 (9th Cir.1990). Under Nevada law, for an equitable lien to be based on a contract between two parties, there must be (1) an identifiable res and (2) an indication that the parties intended that res to serve as security for a debt. <em>Topaz Mut. Co. v. Marsh, </em>108 Nev. 845, 839 P.2d 606, 612-13 (1992); <em>see also Ferrara v. Firsching, </em>92 Nev. 38, 544 P.2d 1198, 1199-2000 (1976) (holding that an agreement must evidence the parties\u2019 intent to create a security interest to support an equitable lien).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Contrary to McDonald\u2019s argument, Paragraph 11 of the Letter Agreement contains no terms demonstrating that Debtor intended to grant McDonald\u2019s a security interest in the funds in the escrow account or in the associated segregated account. Instead, as the bankruptcy court found, that paragraph simply identifies Debtor\u2019s intended source of payment for its obligations to McDonald\u2019s. Consequently, the bankruptcy court did not err by concluding that McDonald\u2019s did not have an equitable lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">II. <em>Whether the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that the challenged payments were not in the ordinary course of business is clearly erroneous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">A payment otherwise avoidable as a preference under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b) cannot be avoided to the extent that it is made in the ordinary course of business. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(c)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-9\">To qualify for the ordinary course exception, a creditor must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that 1) the debt and its payment are ordinary in relation to the past practices between the debtor and the creditor; <em>and </em>2) the payment was ordinary in relation to prevailing business standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-10\"><em>Sulmeyer v. Suzuki (In re Grand Chevrolet, Inc.), </em>25 F.3d 728, 732 (9th Cir.1994) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Factors relevant to the determination</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACkq\">whether transfers are ordinary in relation to past practices are: 1) the length of time the parties were engaged in the transactions at issue; 2) whether the amount or form of tender differed from past practices; 3) whether the debtor or creditor engaged in any unusual collection or payment activity; and, 4) whether the creditor took advantage of the debtor\u2019s deteriorating financial condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that the payments were not \u201cordinary in relation to past practices between\u201d McDonald\u2019s and Debtor is not clearly erroneous. As the court found, McDonald\u2019s engaged in a variety of non-ordinary collection practices with respect to the challenged payments. It sent several demand letters, retained counsel for assistance in collection, and threatened to withhold rental payments if Debtor did not meet its obligations. Further, the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>that the payments were made from Debt- or\u2019s operating account, instead of from the escrow account, also made the payments unusual in the relationship between Debtor and McDonald\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Our affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that the payments were not ordinary in relation to the past practices of Debtor and McDonald\u2019s precludes the application of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(c)(2). Therefore, we need not and do not address McDonald\u2019s arguments that the payments were ordinary in relation to industry standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">III. <em>Whether the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that McDonald\u2019s claim for rejection damages is barred as a matter of law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The bankruptcy court correctly held that McDonald\u2019s claim for damages stemming from the rejection of the lease agreement was barred by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(h), because McDonald\u2019s remained in possession of the leased premises. On appeal, McDonald\u2019s attempts to avoid the application of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(h)(2) by arguing that (1) the agreement on which McDonald\u2019s bases its claim for rejection damages is neither a lease nor an executory contract and, thus, is not subject to rejection under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365; and (2) Debtor is not a lessor for purposes of the statute because it assigned its interest in the lease to Strato-Retail.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">We reject McDonald\u2019s first argument, because McDonald\u2019s argued in its proof of claim that it was entitled to rejection damages under the lease. It cannot now argue that it seeks rejection damages under the Letter Agreement \u2014 which it alleges is neither a lease nor an executory contract \u2014 \u25a0 rather than under the lease. McDonald\u2019s second argument is also unpersuasive. There is no dispute that Debtor was the original landlord and that it was not released from its obligations under the lease when it assigned the lease. Accordingly, Debtor is still a lessor for purposes of \u00a7 365 and, thus, \u00a7 365(h) is the applicable provision to determine McDonald\u2019s remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Because McDonald\u2019s remained in possession of the leased premises following the rejection of the lease, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(h)(2) bars its claim for rejection damages against the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b781-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
