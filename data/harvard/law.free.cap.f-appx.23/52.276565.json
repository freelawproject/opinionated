Arcara, <em>Judge) </em>against Defendant-appellee, Sue Wilson (\u2018Wilson\u201d). Deyver\u2019s complaint alleged that Wilson, Inmate Records Coordinator at Collins Correctional Facility where plaintiff was previously incarcerated, violated his rights to due process by not immediately releasing him from custody on his conditional release date.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">Deyver alleged that on February 1, 1995 he was resentenced and that, as a result, his conditional release date was recalculated to be February 4, 1995. He alleged that he submitted a written request for conditional release as required by statute but that Wilson refused to release him. On March 10, 1995, Deyver was presented with and signed a memorandum containing his conditions of release. He was released from custody on March 20, 1995, after the New York State Department of Parole approved his proposed residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">The district court dismissed Deyver\u2019s complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) on the ground that the complaint did not state a claim against Wilson upon which relief could be granted. The court found that under New York Executive Law \u00a7 259-g and 9 N.Y .C.R.R. \u00a7 8003.1(c) Wilson was required to detain Deyver until he had signed his conditions of release. Because it was not Wilson\u2019s responsibility to prepare Deyver\u2019s conditions of release, any delay in preparing them did not involve Wilson. Under New York Penal Law <em>\u00a7 </em>70.40(1)(b), it is the responsibility of the New York State Department of Parole to prepare such conditions. The court concluded therefore that Wilson had done nothing wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">The district court also concluded that Wilson was entitled to qualified immunity, because \u201ceven if the applicable statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>and regulations could somehow be interpreted to have required defendant Wilson to release plaintiff on February 4, 1995, such an interpretation was not clearly established at the time.\u201d <em>Deyver v. Wilson, </em>98-CV 184A, slip op. at 5 (W.D.N.Y. March 21, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Deyver claims that the district court converted Wilson\u2019s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment without affording him notice of the conversion. He also challenges the substance of the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Although in <em>pro se </em>cases a district court may not convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment without providing unequivocal notice of such conversion, <em>Beacon Enters., Inc. v. Menzies, </em>715 F.2d 757, 767, (2d Cir.1983), Deyver was represented by counsel prior to the motion\u2019s conversion and his opposition papers to the motion, both submitted <em>pro se </em>and through counsel, establish that Deyver recognized that the district court was considering facts outside the pleadings. <em>See Villante v. Dep\u2019t of Corr. of the City of New York, </em>786 F.2d 516, 521 (2d Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We therefore affirm for substantially the same reasons described in the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
