Fitzgerald, </em>109 F.3d 1339, 1342 (8th Cir.1997) (once foreclosed property is sold to third-party purchaser, court generally lacks power to craft remedy for debtor; therefore, debtor who fails to obtain stay of sale has no remedy on appeal and appeal is moot).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-23\">As to appeal No. 01-2434, we conclude after careful review of the record that the district court\u2019s rulings were within its discretion. <em>See Brooks v. Ferguson-Florissant Sch. Dist., </em>113 F.3d 903, 905 (8th Cir.1997) (Rule 60(b) standard of review); <em>Isakson v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, Sioux Falls, </em>985 F.2d 984, 986 (8th Cir.1993) (per curiam)(Rule 11 standard of review); <em>United States v. Faul, </em>748 F.2d 1204, 1211 (8th Cir.l984)(recusal standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>472 U.S. 1027, 105 S.Ct. 3500, 87 L.Ed.2d 632 (1985). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-24\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-16\">. The Honorable Charles B.
