Williams appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) denial of his application for Supplemental Security Income disability benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-83f. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s order upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits, determining whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision and whether the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards. <em>Osenbrock v. Apfel, </em>240 F.3d 1157, 1162 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-19\">Because the ALJ noted that the opinion of treating physician Dr. Anthony Boyce\u2019s was contradicted by clinical findings, the opinions of other examining physicians, and Williams\u2019 own testimony, the ALJ provided specific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence for ascribing less weight to his opinion. <em>See Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 751-52 (9th Cir.1989). Furthermore, because licensed social worker William Thompson (\u201cThompson\u201d) is not an accepted medical source, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.913(a), and because Thompson\u2019s opinion was based on claimant\u2019s subjective symptoms without supporting medical findings, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to disregard his opinion. <em>See Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 605 (9th Cir.1989) (disregarding a physicians opinion because it was premised on subjective complaints, which the ALJ properly discounted, constitutes specific, legitimate reason for rejecting the opinion of a treating physician).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-20\">Contrary to William\u2019s contention, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical to the vocational expert was accurate, detailed, and supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Osenbrock, </em>240 F.3d at 1165. In addition, the vocational expert testified that although Williams is incapable of performing his past relevant work, there are significant numbers of jobs in the national economy that Williams is capable of performing considering his vocational profile and residual functional capacity. Because substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Williams is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>capable of performing jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy, <em>see Barker v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>882 F.2d 1474, 1479-80 (9th Cir.1989), we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b861-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
