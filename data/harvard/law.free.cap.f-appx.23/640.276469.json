On appeal, she argues (1) the district court abused its discretion in denying her request for a continuance, (2) the court\u2019s decision was not supported by sufficient evidence, (3) she was denied her right of allocution, (4) the court erred in \u201cdeparting\u201d from the nonbinding policy statements of Guidelines Chapter 7, (5) she intended to plead guilty and accept responsibility but counsel pleaded not guilty on her behalf against her wishes, and (6) she was under duress at the revocation hearing because the court stated it would detain her if it granted a continuance, and because she suffers from battered-woman\u2019s syndrome. After careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Crabtree\u2019s request for a continuance after she indicated that she did not wish to be detained during any continuance. Crabtree does not show how the lack of a continuance prejudiced her, <em>see United States v. Cotroneo, </em>89 F.3d 510, 514 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1018, 117 S.Ct. 533, 136 L.Ed.2d 419 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-18\">Further, evidence at the hearing supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Crabtree had violated her release conditions. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence above the nonbinding recommendations of Guidelines Chapter 7, <em>see United States v. Shaw, </em>180 F.3d 920, 922 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam) and the hearing transcript shows that Crabtree received her right of allocution, <em>see United States v. Kaniss, </em>150 F.3d 967, 969 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-19\">We reject Crabtree\u2019s remaining arguments. She had an opportunity to admit the allegations during her testimony, and she does not show how the threat of detention, or her battered-woman\u2019s syndrome, prejudicially affected her defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-20\">Crabtree\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and moved to withdraw. Although we question whether <em>Anders </em>applies in this case, we have made a review under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we have found no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Crabtree\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-21\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-22\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-16\">.
