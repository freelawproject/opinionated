The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissed the petition without prej<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>udice because the court lacks personal jurisdiction over Carmona\u2019s Louisiana custodian. We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Although Carmona petitioned for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, as a state prisoner he is subject to the provisions governing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and therefore must obtain a certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253; <em>Crouch v. Norris, </em>251 F.3d 720, 723 (8th Cir.2001). A habeas petitioner must be \u201cin custody\u201d \"within the meaning of \u00a7 2241(c)(3), and the district court in which the petition is filed must have personal jurisdiction \u201cupon the person who holds [the petitioner] in what is alleged to be unlawful custody.\u201d <em>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., </em>410 U.S. 484, 494-95, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973). In <em>Braden, </em>an Alabama inmate petitioned the Western District of Kentucky for a writ giving him relief from an indictment pursuant to which Kentucky officials had lodged an interstate detainer against petitioner. The Court upheld the jurisdiction of the Kentucky federal court because petitioner\u2019s Alabama custodian \u201cacts as agent for the demanding State, and the custodian State is presumably indifferent to the resolution of the prisoner\u2019s attack on the detainer.\u201d 410 U.S. at 499-500 93 S.Ct. 1123. Here, on the other hand, Carmona alleges that Minnesota officials improperly extradited him to Louisiana and therefore he is unlawfully incarcerated <em>in Louisiana. </em>Carmona\u2019s Louisiana custodian is not at all indifferent to this claim. Therefore, the district court\u2019s lack of personal jurisdiction over that custodian required the dismissal of this action. <em>Cf. Lee v. United States, </em>501 F.2d 494, 500-01 (8th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. The court\u2019s September 28, 2001, Order imposing a partial appellate filing fee pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b) is vacated; any partial fee paid should be returned to petitioner. <em>See Malave v. Hedrick, </em>271 F.3d 1139 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-34\">. The HONORABLE MICHAEL J.
