We vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further consideration of two questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The first question is whether Mermaid\u2019s October 2, 2000 Motion for Reconsideration of the Court\u2019s September 26, 2000 Order should have been construed as a motion for additional time under Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b)(2), under which a party\u2019s failure to act within the specified time may be excused if it \u201cwas the result of excusable neglect.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Blissett v. Casey, </em>969 F.Supp. 118, 123 (N.D.N.Y.1997), <em>aff'd, </em>147 F.3d 218 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">As to the second question, in denying Mermaid\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the court observed that in Mermaid\u2019s motion of September 14, 2000 for a scheduling order, \u201cMermaid did not advise the court that the parties were confused or disagreed as to the significance of the September 15 deadline ...\u201d In its motion papers, Mermaid stated, \u201cTriUnion has declined to agree to the Proposed Scheduling Order ... claiming that the September 15 deadline was firmly set by the Court; ... It is the position of Mermaid Seafoods that the September 15 date discussed on July 13, 2000 was not the final or fixed date agreed to by the parties or set by the Court.\u201d On remand, the court should consider whether the September 14 motion, although inartfully drafted, in fact did advise the court that the parties \u201cwere confused or disagreed as to the significance of the September 15 deadline\u201d and whether the court\u2019s ruling of November 20, 2000 was therefore based in part on an incorrect premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">The judgment of the district court is VACATED and the matter REMANDED for further consideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
