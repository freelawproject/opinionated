His sole claim on appeal is that the district court erred in enhancing his base offense level for possession of a firearm during the drug trafficking offense pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (2000). Finding no plain error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">Almazan-Carbaj al did not object to the sentencing enhancement in the district court. Therefore, we will review the district court\u2019s findings for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Walker, </em>112 F.3d 163, 166 (4th Cir.1997). The government has the burden of proving sentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Estrada, </em>42 F.3d 228, 231 (4th Cir.1994). In proving these factors, the government may rely upon information found in a defendant\u2019s presentence report unless the defendant affirmatively shows that such information is inaccurate or unreliable. <em>See United States v. Gilliam, </em>987 F.2d 1009, 1014 (4th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">Almazan-Carbajal asserts the evidence was insufficient to connect his use of a firearm to the drug trafficking offense. Almazan-Carbajal\u2019s presentence report recommended the USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement based on evidence that firearms were recovered at his place of business where undercover officers had previously bought drugs from him, thus satisfying the government\u2019s initial burden of proof. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>128 F.3d 850, 852 (4th Cir.1997) (explaining that \u201cproof of precisely concurrent acts\u201d is not required for enhancement under Section 2D1.1(b)(1) and that \u201cthe proximity of guns to illicit narcotics can support a district court\u2019s enhancement of a defendant\u2019s sentence under Section 2D1.1(b)(1)\u201d). Almazan-Carbaj al presented no affirmative evidence undermining the reliability of the presentence report and never maintained he did not possess the guns found at his place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">Accordingly, we find no plain error in the district court\u2019s application of a two-level enhancement to Almazan-Carbajal\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>offense level for possessing a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking offense pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). We therefore affirm Almazan-Carbajal\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
