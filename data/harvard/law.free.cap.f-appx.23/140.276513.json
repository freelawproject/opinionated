We have reviewed the administrative record and find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s and Id\u2019s conclusion Tadesse failed to show that she suffered persecution or establish a well-founded fear of persecution necessary to qualify for relief from deportation. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994); <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i) (2001); <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240, 1243 (3d Cir.1993); <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992); <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 307, 313 &amp; n. 6 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the Board\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-11\"> We note that 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) effective April 1, 1997. Because this case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) is still applicable here under the terms of the transitional rules contained in \u00a7 309(c) of the IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
