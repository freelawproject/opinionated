Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 submissions, we reject Lamson\u2019s arguments. The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> did not abuse its discretion by not holding a second evidentiary hearing on disputed factual issues regarding service of process, Lamson having failed to show he requested an additional hearing or otherwise explain why he did not timely avail himself of the opportunity to be heard. <em>See Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Daily, </em>973 F.2d 1525, 1532 (10th Cir.1992). Further, the district court did not commit plain error by relying on the plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits, to which Lamson did not timely object. As relevant, the affidavits were grounded in personal knowledge and sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding the summons was served. <em>See Ruby v. Springfield R-12 Pub. Sch. Dist., </em>76 F.3d 909, 912 n. 8 (8th Cir.1996); <em>LSJ Inv. Co. v. O.L .D., Inc., </em>167 F.3d 320, 322 (6th Cir.1999). We thus conclude the grant of default judgment was not an abuse of discretion, <em>see Ackra Direct Mktg. Corp. v. Fingerhut Corp., </em>86 F.3d 852, 856 (8th Cir.1996), and we affirm the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b630-11\"> The Honorable Ann D.
