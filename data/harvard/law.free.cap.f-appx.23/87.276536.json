Clancy appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (John E. Sprizzo, /.), denying his habeas corpus petition brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Clancy seeks to vacate his 1992 New York state conviction for assault in the first and second degrees. First, he claims that the prosecutor intentionally presented false evidence at trial in order to suggest that a defense witness, William Patrick Carroll, lied about his presence at the site of the incident. Second, he asserts that the prosecutor acted deceptively in withholding a W 4 form faxed by Nastasi <em>&amp; </em>White Construction Company for a different William Carroll. Third, he argues that at trial the prosecutor provided defense counsel with a spurious document, falsely represented to be a true copy of the defense witness\u2019s payroll record. Finally, Clancy contends that the prosecution withheld an arrest record containing potentially exculpatory information and that the trial court impermissibly refused to authorize the recording of sidebar conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">As to the first claim, we find no reason to believe that the prosecutor\u2019s confusion over the two workers at the site both named William Carroll was the result of bad faith. Clancy\u2019s conviction, therefore, can be reversed only if, but for the mistakes, he \u201cwould most likely not have been convicted.\u201d <em>United States v. Gallego, </em>191 F.3d 156, 162 (2d Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1216, 120 S.Ct. 2220, 147 L.Ed.2d 252 (2000). The prosecutor impeached Carroll\u2019s testimony in a number of other ways, including his inability to describe any of the elevator passengers, his identification of the wrong elevator, his friendship with Clancy\u2019s father, and his prior conviction for robbery. Moreover, the state presented powerful independent evidence of Clancy\u2019s guilt. The misleading testimony elicited by the prosecutor could not have affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">We find no merit to Clancy\u2019s claim that the prosecutor withheld the Nastasi &amp; White W 4 form. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that there was no evidence that the prosecutor was aware of the potential significance of the W-4 form or intentionally withheld it. <em>See Clancy v. Comm\u2019r of Corr. Servs., </em>No. 94-1904, slip op. at 1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 2000) (adopting report and recommendation of magistrate judge concluding that no evidence showed prosecutor withheld W-4 form).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">As to Clancy\u2019s claim that the prosecutor doctored the payroll record exhibit, we find no basis for it. We reject this claim for substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s first opinion on Clancy\u2019s petition. <em>See Clancy v. Comm\u2019r of Corr. Servs., </em>956 F.Supp. 490, 501 (S.D.N.Y. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Finally, we dismiss Clancy\u2019s remaining claims because they were not included within the certificate of appealability. <em>See Green v. United States, </em>260 F.3d 78, 85 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
