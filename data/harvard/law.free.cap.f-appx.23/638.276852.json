Copley appeals from the final judgment entered in the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the Western District of Missouri, dismissing without prejudice Copley\u2019s habeas petition, wherein he challenged his commitment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246. This appeal has been consolidated with a related petition for a writ of mandamus, wherein Copley sought an expedited ruling on his habeas petition. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the denial of habeas relief and deny as moot the mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-19\">A person, like Copley, against whom all criminal charges were dismissed for reasons related solely to his mental condition, may be hospitalized indefinitely if he is found to be suffering from a mental disease or defect such that his release would be dangerous. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246; <em>United States v. Copley, </em>935 F.2d 669, 670-72 (4th Cir.1991) (affirming district court\u2019s 1990 civil commitment order pursuant to dangerousness finding). In this proceeding, Copley, who recently declined to be released conditionally, argued he was entitled to be released unconditionally, primarily because of the duration of his civil commitment, the fact that he had qualified for conditional discharge on several prior occasions, and the circumstances surrounding his 1988 indictment and 1990 commitment. Having carefully reviewed the record de novo, we, like the district court, find no support for Copley\u2019s assertion that he is entitled to be released unconditionally. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246(d), (e) (providing for hospitalization for treatment until State will assume responsibility, or until person\u2019s mental condition is such that \u201chis release, or his conditional release under a prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment\u201d would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>create a substantial risk of dangerousness, whichever occurs earlier); <em>Nicolaison v. Erickson, </em>65 F.3d 109, 111 (8th Cir.1995) (reviewing de novo constitutionality of habeas petitioner\u2019s state civil commitment), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1125, 116 S.Ct. 939, 133 L.Ed.2d 864 (1996); <em>United States v. Evanoff, </em>10 F.3d 559, 563 (8th Cir.1993) (involuntary commitment under terms of \u00a7 4246 does not violate due process); <em>Irwin v. Wolff, </em>529 F.2d 1119, 1124 (8th Cir.1976) (duration of civil commitment, which is subject to periodic review, is not indication of cruel and unusual punishment). We note that the government is under an ongoing obligation to prepare annual reports concerning Copley\u2019s mental condition and the need for his continued hospitalization, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(e)(1)(B), and to exert reasonable efforts to place Copley in a suitable state facility, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court and deny as moot Copley\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus. We deny any pending motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-15\">. The Honorable Ortrie D. Smith, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri, adopting the report and recommendation of the Honorable James C. England, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
