This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Davis sued an attorney (Brown) whom he retained to file a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 before the statute of limitations ran on such <em>an </em>action. Bringing claims of negligence, breach of contract, and legal malpractice, Davis sought $500,000 in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages as a result of Brown\u2019s failure to file the requested motion despite accepting a fee of $2,500. When Brown failed to respond to the complaint, Davis requested entry of default and moved the district court for a default judgment. In a report filed on September 8, 1999, the magistrate judge determined that Davis\u2019s complaint met the jurisdictional prerequisites for federal diversity jurisdiction, and recommended that the motion for default judgment be granted and Davis be given the opportunity to establish his damages. With no objection from either party, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and ordered Davis to submit documentation in support of his claim for damages. The default judgment was entered on November 17,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">Davis timely submitted an affidavit and other documentation to support his claim for $1.5 million in damages. On August 22, 2000, the magistrate judge determined that Davis was entitled to $4,500 in compensatory damages and $10,000 in punitive damages, and recommended that this amount be awarded. Davis timely objected, arguing that Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(c) barred the district court from entering any award other than that requested when the default judgment was entered. The district court overruled Davis\u2019s objection, adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report, and awarded Davis a total of $14,500. The judgment was entered on March 27, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">On appeal, Davis continues to argue that the district court erred in its application of Rule 54(c) by awarding damages \u201cdifferent in kind\u201d after the default judgment was entered. He seeks remand to amend the judgment to award him $500,000 in compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-17\">A district court\u2019s decision under Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(c) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Employers Reinsurance Corp., </em>144 F.3d 1077, 1080 (7th Cir.1998); <em>Stewart v. Furton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>774 F.2d 706, 710 (6th Cir.1985). We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining the appropriate amount of compensatory damages in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Although he objected to the entire damage award in his response to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, Davis does not challenge on appeal the award of $10,000 in punitive damages. Therefore, that issue is considered to be abandoned and is not reviewable on appeal. <em>See Enertech Elec., Inc. v. Mahoning County Comm\u2019rs, </em>85 F.3d 257, 259 (6th Cir.1996). In any event, the district court did not abuse its discretion in setting the amount of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment, entered on March 27, 2001, is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
