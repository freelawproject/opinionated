The district court departed upward from criminal history category V to category VI pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. (2000), and imposed a sentence of 102 months imprisonment. Montero-Castaneda appeals his sentence, contending that the district court failed to explain adequately its reason for departing, and that the departure was an abuse of discretion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">With thirteen criminal history points, Montero-Castaneda was initially placed in category VI. The probation officer suggested that the district court might want to consider an upward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 because Montero-Castaneda had sixteen prior sentences that were not counted in his criminal history because they were beyond the applicable time period. The government requested an upward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3, noting the sixteen uncounted sentences, and arguing that Montero-Castaneda\u2019s criminal record indicated that he had a \u201cpropensity for committing crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">At sentencing, the government further argued that the guideline range did not adequately reflect the seriousness of Montero-Castaneda\u2019s criminal past because the sixteen uncounted prior sentences were for serious offenses, including among them burglary, drug possession, forgery, receiving stolen property, and assault. Under questioning by the district court, Montero-Castaneda denied committing the breaking and entering, despite his guilty plea, and went on to deny committing or excuse his commission of most of the other offenses to which he had pled guilty in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">The court then determined that a one-level upward departure was justified, stating that, \u201cif there is ever a case that I have seen that seems to indicate that sentencing alone is not going to have any effect on the Defendant\u2019s planned and unplanned activities, this certainly is the one.\u201d The new guideline range was 84-105 months. The court imposed a sentence of 102 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">When the district court decides to depart, it \u201cshould clearly identify the aggravating factors and its reasons for connecting them to the permissible grounds for departure under \u00a7 4A1.3.\u201d <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 882 (4th Cir.1992) (citation omitted). Here, Montero-Castaneda\u2019s sixteen uncounted outdated convictions were correctly identified in the presentence report as a permissible ground for departure. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. n. 8 (court may consider sentence imposed outside applicable time period as basis for departure if it evidences similar, or serious dissimilar, criminal conduct). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Moreover, Montero-Castaneda\u2019s long record of convictions also indicated a likelihood that he would commit more crimes in the future, a factor that the government emphasized in its sentencing memorandum. The district court obliquely referred to this factor in announcing its decision to depart. Even though the court\u2019s explanation of its decision was not as clear as it could have been, it is evident that the court implicitly adopted the reasons put forward by the probation officer and the government as justifying a departure. Because the factors underlying the court\u2019s decision were fully developed, we do not believe remand is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Montero-Castaneda also claims that the departure was an abuse of discretion, but makes no argument on this issue. He has thus abandoned the issue on appeal by failing to provide argument in his brief. <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (noting that issues not briefed or argued on appeal are deemed abandoned). Therefore, we will not address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
