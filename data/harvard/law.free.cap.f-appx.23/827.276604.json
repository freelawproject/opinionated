Allen' appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment following a jury trial and orders denying his motions for a new trial and relief from judgment in his civil rights action, which alleged retaliation and excessive force. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo whether a jury instruction misstates elements of a constitutional violation, <em>Caballero v. City of Concord, </em>956 F.2d 204, 206 (9th Cir.1992), and review for abuse of discretion a denial of a request for a continuance, <em>United States v. 2.61 Acres of Land, </em>791 F.2d 666, 671 (9th Cir.1985) (per curiam). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-23\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Allen\u2019s request for a continuance because Allen did not show that he was prejudiced by the denial of the request, and further delay would have inconvenienced the court and the opposing parties. <em>See 2.61 Acres of Land, </em>791 F.2d at 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-24\">We reject Allen\u2019s contention that the closing argument of defense counsel constituted misconduct which warrants a new trial because Allen did not object to the closing argument at trial. <em>See Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Frank Coluccio Constr. Co., </em>785 F.2d 656, 658 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-25\">Allen\u2019s contention that the jury instructions were flawed lacks merit. <em>See Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 9, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-26\">Allen\u2019s contention that the clear weight of the evidence did not support the verdict lacks merit because there is evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Patel v. Penman, </em>103 F.3d 868, 878 (9th Cir.1996) (review limited to whether any evidence exists in the record to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>port jury\u2019s verdict where appellant failed to move for judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Allen\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"APy\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b859-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
