Luna appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal of his third amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint alleging false arrest, equal protection and due process violations, and several state law claims arising from his arrest for suspicion of child abuse. We have jurisdiction under to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), <em>Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police Dep\u2019t, </em>839 F.2d 621, 623 (9th Cir.1988), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Because Luna failed to allege constitutional deprivations that were the result of any official policy or practice, the district court properly dismissed his section 1983 claims against the City of San Bernardino. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 668, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Because Luna failed to allege sufficient facts, the district court properly dismissed his equal protection claim. <em>See Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 265, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977) (holding proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose required to show equal protection violation); <em>see also Sherman v. Yakahi, </em>549 F.2d 1287, 1289-90 (9th Cir.1977) (holding a pleading will not be sufficient to state a claim under the Civil Rights Act if the allegations are mere conclusions).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Because Luna failed to allege facts to support a claim that the city police officers acted in a clearly arbitrary manner, having no substantial relation to public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, the district court properly dismissed Luna\u2019s substantive due process claim. <em>See Sinaloa Lake Owners Ass\u2019n v. City of Simi Valley, </em>882 F.2d 1398, 1407 (9th Cir.1989), overruled in part by <em>Armendariz v. Penman, </em>75 F.3d 1311, 1326 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Luna\u2019s state law claims after it properly dismissed all claims over which it had original jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Executive Software N. Am., Inc. v. United States Dist. Court, </em>24 F.3d 1545, 1555-56 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Luna\u2019s requests to admit new evidence are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b727-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
