Russell TRAIL, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b1016-13\">No. 01-6221.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b1016-14\">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b1016-15\">Jan. 4, 2002.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1016-16\">Before HENRY, BRISCOE, and MURPHY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1016-17\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b1016-18\">MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1016-19\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-20\">This case is before the court on Russell Trail\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Trail seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (providing that no appeal may be taken from a \u201cfinal order in a proceeding under section 2255\u201d unless the movant first obtains a COA). This court denies Trail\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-21\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Trail raised the following three claims: (1) the government breached the plea agreement at sentencing; (2) his sentence violates United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.8 and 2D1.1; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>and (3) his counsel was ineffective. The district court concluded that Trail\u2019s motion should be denied because it was filed outside of the limitations period set out in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) and because Trail had not demonstrated adequate grounds for equitably tolling the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">To be entitled to a COA, Trail must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3). To make the requisite showing, Trail must demonstrate both that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling and debatable whether the \u00a7 2255 motion states a valid constitutional claim. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). This court has reviewed Trail\u2019s request for a COA and appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record on appeal. Our review demonstrates the district court\u2019s determination that Trail\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is time-barred is not reasonably debatable. We have nothing to add to the thorough analysis set out in the district court\u2019s order. Accordingly, this court DENIES Trail\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISSES this appeal for substantially those reasons set out in the district court\u2019s order dated May 17, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
