We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">In November 1986, Amax Potash Corporation (Amax Potash), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amax, Inc. (Amax), began operating a potash mine near the city of Carlsbad, in Eddy County, New Mexico. Because federal lands covered portions of the mine, Amax Potash was required to enter into mineral leases with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Approximately five years later, in February 1992, Amax sold all of the stock of Amax Potash to Horizon Gold Corporation (Horizon Gold), a publicly-held corporation with no affiliation to Amax or any of its subsidiaries. As a result of the purchase, Amax Potash became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Horizon Gold. Horizon Gold changed the name of Amax Potash to Horizon Potash, Inc. (Horizon Potash), and also sought permission from the BLM to transfer or assign the federal mineral leases from Amax Potash to Horizon Potash. In June 1993, Horizon Potash permanently closed the potash mine and laid off the mine employees due to financial difficulties. <em>See Kirby v. Cyprus Amax Minerals Co., </em>203 F.3d 835, 2000 WL 51799 at *1 (10th Cir.2000) (unpublished opinion) (noting that Horizon Gold and Horizon Potash \u201care now bankrupt\u201d). At the time of the closure, the BLM had not approved the request for assignment of the federal mineral leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">In July 1993, the BLM issued a notice to Amax asserting that, because the assignment of the mineral leases from Amax Potash to Horizon Potash had not been approved, and because Amax Potash was (or at least had been) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amax, the BLM considered Amax to be responsible for its continuing lease obligations to the United States, including site maintenance and payment of royalties. In particular, the BLM was concerned that Horizon Potash was in violation of several applicable regulatory requirements, including the duty to perform \u201ca minimum level of mine maintenance in order to prevent waste of mineral and non-mineral resources,\u201d the duty to \u201cpay royalties\u201d to the BLM, and the duty to submit production maps to the BLM at the end of each royalty reporting period. App. at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">Amax (which became defendant Cyprus Amax Minerals Company in November 1993 as a result of a merger<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) administratively appealed the BLM\u2019s decision. Cyprus Amax and the BLM ultimately settled the dispute in December 1996 but there was no conclusive determination by the BLM of whether Cyprus Amax was liable under the mineral leases. The settlement agreement specifically provided that, \u201c[b]y entering into th[e] ... agreement, Cyprus Amax does not admit that it is or was liable for the Horizon Potash Mine site or that it is or was an owner, operator or lessee of the federal or state leases or the facilities on privately owned property at the site.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442. As part of the settlement, the BLM also agreed to officially rescind all orders previously issued, including those asserting that Cyprus Amax was responsible under the mineral leases. Effective July 1, 1998, the BLM officially released Cyprus Amax from \u201cany and all liabilities under the related potash leases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">In June 1997, two former mine employees (Robert Kirby and Michael Mashaw) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>filed suit in federal district court against defendant Cyprus Amax claiming that it had violated the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2101-2109, by failing to give timely notice of the mine closure. The complaint sought, on behalf of the named plaintiffs and other former employees of the mine, backpay damages, lost benefits, and attorney fees. The district court certified a class of plaintiffs consisting of workers employed at the mine at the time of closure. Thereafter, however, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Cyprus Amax. On appeal, this court affirmed the district court\u2019s decision, concluding: \u201cQuite simply, the WARN Act applies only to employers. Cyprus Amax cannot be considered an employer under the Act, and therefore, cannot be liable to the employees.\u201d <em>Kirby, </em>2000 WL 51799 at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">In June 1999, while the <em>Kirby </em>case was still pending, a group of fifty-one individuals, all of whom were members of the plaintiff class in <em>Kirby, </em>filed suit against Cyprus Amax in the District Court of Eddy County, New Mexico. The complaint, self-described as one for breach of contract, invoked 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), which allows a beneficiary of an ERISA-governed benefit plan to sue for \u201cbenefits due to him under the terms of the plan,\u201d and 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 187, a provision of the Federal Mineral Leasing Act (FMLA) which imposes certain duties on lessees of federal mineral deposits. According to the complaint, each plaintiff had been a salaried employee at the mine at the time of its closure. The complaint further alleged that, due to Amax Inc.\u2019s continuing responsibility under the FMLA and the federal mineral leases <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at the time of the mine\u2019s closure, it was responsible for severance pay to each of the plaintiffs pursuant to \u00a7 2.2 of its Corporate Policy Statement on Employee Separation (which was issued on April 30, 1987).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cyprus Amax removed the case to federal court. Cyprus Amax filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court granted Cyprus Amax\u2019s motion and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">We review the district court\u2019s disposition of plaintiffs\u2019 claims de novo. <em>See Perkins v. Kansas Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir.1999) (dismissal under either Fed. R.App. P. 12(b)(6) or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)); <em>Bullington v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>186 F.3d 1301, 1313 (10th Cir.1999) (summary judgment). To the extent the district court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims for failure to state a claim, we may uphold the dismissal only if we conclude that \u201cno relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.\u201d <em>Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, </em>467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984). Cyprus Amax\u2019s motion, and plaintiffs\u2019 response thereto, were based in part on documentary evidence. To the extent the district court granted summary judgment on plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>tiffs\u2019 claims, we may uphold the grant of summary judgment only \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Before addressing the specific arguments asserted by plaintiffs on appeal, it is helpful to review the theory of liability upon which plaintiffs are attempting to proceed. According to plaintiffs, this case \u201cinvolv[es] the application of the Federal Mineral Leasing Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 187 to a severance pay compensation plan under ERISA.\u201d App. at 466. More specifically, plaintiffs contend they should be \u201cconsidered employees of Cyprus Amax for purposes of payment of wages and severance obligations as a result of the requirements of the Federal Mineral Leasing Act and the fact that at all times the [federal mineral] leases remained in Amax\u2019s name, not Horizon\u2019s.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468. In other words, plaintiffs argue that \u201cAmax\u2019s continuing obligation to see that the Horizon employees were paid wages, because they were mining upon federal lands leased by Amax, triggers the Amax severance plan obligation at such time as those miners permanently lost employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468-69. In sum, plaintiffs argue that \u201cthe lessee\u2019s [Amax\u2019s] severance plan continues for the benefit of the former employees [of the mine] for so long as the lessee continues to be legally obligated to pay wages as lessee of the federal mineral lease upon which the former employees are working.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">In dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the district court relied heavily on our decision in <em>Kirby. </em>According to the district court, <em>Kirby </em>held \u201cthat the Plaintiff employees worked for Horizon Potash not Amax Potash at the time of their termination, and that Amax [could not] be held liable to the employees for past wages.\u201d App. at 547-48. The district court concluded that, in deciding <em>Kirby, </em>we \u201ccould not have meant to rule on the meaning of \u2018employer\u2019 for the purpose of one act and not for the purpose of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548. Thus, the district court concluded that <em>Kirby, </em>to the extent it concluded that Cyprus Amax was not plaintiffs\u2019 employer for purposes of the WARN Act, was likewise binding for purposes of this case and plaintiffs\u2019 claims under ERISA and the FMLA. <em>Id. </em>at 548-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Plaintiffs present two challenges to the district court\u2019s decision. First, plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in applying the holding in <em>Kirby </em>to this case. According to plaintiffs, the doctrine of issue preclusion does not apply because the determination in <em>Kirby </em>that plaintiffs \u201cwere not Amax employees under the WARN Act is not relevant to the issues in this case.\u201d Pltfs\u2019 Br. at 22. Second, plaintiffs contend that, contrary to the conclusion reached by the district court, they should be considered \u201cemployees\u201d of Cyprus Amax for purposes of ERISA and Cyprus Amax\u2019s severance plan. On this point, plaintiffs simply outline their theory of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments notwithstanding, we conclude the district court properly relied on <em>Kirby </em>in dismissing this case. Although plaintiffs are correct that the instant action seeks to impose liability on the defendant pursuant to an ERISA plan, whereas the <em>Kirby </em>action sought to impose liability on the defendant pursuant to the WARN Act, there are important similarities between the two cases. It is undisputed that plaintiffs were employees of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Horizon Potash, not Amax or any of its subsidiaries, at the time of the mine closing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Kirby, </em>2000 WL 51799 at *1 (noting that \u201cCyprus Amax was admittedly not the employer at the time the mine closed\u201d). Further, plaintiffs attempted to surmount this problem in both cases by use of an identical vehicle: the FMLA and the underlying federal mineral leases. More specifically, plaintiffs attempted in <em>Kirby, </em>and are again trying here, to demonstrate that the requirements of \u00a7 187 and the lease provisions regarding regular payment of wages somehow made Cyprus Amax their employer as a matter of law. As the district court recognized, it is inconceivable that this theory could be rejected in <em>Kirby </em>but accepted in this case. Thus, regardless of whether the decision in <em>Kirby </em>is binding on plaintiffs pursuant to the doctrine of issue preclusion (and there is no indication that the district court actually applied that doctrine), it was not error for the district court to rely on <em>Kirby </em>in dismissing this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\"><em>Kirby </em>aside, plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability is clearly flawed. Obviously aware that Cyprus Amax\u2019s severance policy applies only to its employees, plaintiffs attempt to shoehorn themselves into this category through the FMLA and the mineral leases. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that, because the BLM never approved the assignment of the mineral leases to Horizon Potash, Cyprus Amax remained hable thereon (as the parent company of Amax Potash) and, pursuant to \u00a7 187 of the FMLA and the related lease provisions regarding payment of wages, became them employer as a matter of law. The problem, however, is that even assuming Cyprus Amax was the lessee at the time of the mine closing (which is not at all clear), \u00a7 187 and the lease provisions refer only to the regular payment of \u201cwages,\u201d and say nothing about severance pay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, nothing in \u00a7 187 or the lease provisions operates to make Cyprus Amax the plaintiffs\u2019 employer, or plaintiffs participants under Cyprus Amax\u2019s severance pay plan, for purposes of ERISA. <em>See generally </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(5) (defining \u201cemployer,\u201d for purposes of ERISA, as \u201cany person acting directly as an employer, or indirectly in the interest of an employer, in relation to an employee benefit plan; and includes a group or association or employers acting for an employer in such capacity\u201d); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(7) (defining an ERISA \u201cparticipant\u201d as \u201cany employee or former employee of an employer .... who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan\u201d). Further, plaintiffs neither claim nor attempt to prove there was any type of collusive understanding between Amax and Horizon Gold that the former would sell Amax Potash to Horizon Gold in the expectation that the latter would, in short order, bankrupt, thereby relieving both the seller and the buyer from any severance pay or other obligations to plaintiffs. Finally, it is apparent that the lease obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>gations, as well as any statutory obligations under the FMLA, run solely to the United States. Indeed, the very purpose of the FMLA and the corresponding lease provisions is to protect the government\u2019s interest as lessor and landowner. Plaintiffs fail to explain how they, as private parties, are in a position to assert a violation of the lease provisions or the FMLA. <em>Cf. Operating Eng\u2019rs Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund v. JWJ Contracting Co., </em>135 F.3d 671, 676 (9th Cir.1998) (concluding that Davis Bacon Act, requiring federal government work contracts to contain minimum wage stipulations, did not generally grant a private cause of action directly to employees); <em>Davis v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>662 F.2d 120, 121 (2d Cir.1981) (concluding Vocational Rehabilitation Act, requiring any federal government contract in excess of $2,500 to contain provision requiring contractor to take affirmative action to employ qualified handicapped individuals, did not create private cause of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b989-23\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-13\">. The names Amax and Cyprus Amax will be used interchangeably throughout the remainder of this order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b991-6\">. Each lease included a provision entitled \"Operations, wages, and freedom to purchase,\u201d which provided, in pertinent part, that the lessee agreed to \"pay all wages due miners and employees both above and below ground, at least twice each month in lawful money of the United States.\u201d App. at 17 (\u00a7 2(m) of the lease).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b991-11\">. Section 2.2 of the Corporate Policy Statement provided that \u201c[ejmployees whose jobs [we]re eliminated or restructured as a result of a staff reduction caused by merger, acquisition, divestiture, unit shutdown, departmental consolidation, elimination due to technological change or elimination of position for other similar business reasons [wejre eligible\u201d for severance pay. App. at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b993-6\">. It is uncontroverted that plaintiffs were never employed by Cyprus Amax or its predecessor. Rather, they were employed by Amax Potash, a subsidiary company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b993-7\">. Black's Law Dictionary defines the term \"severance pay\" as follows: \"Payment by an employer to employee beyond his wages on termination of his employment. Such pay represents a form of compensation for the termination of the employment relation, for reasons other than the displaced employee\u2019s misconduct, primarily to alleviate the consequent need for economic readjustment but also to recompense the employee for certain losses attributable to the dismissal.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1374 (6th ed.1990). In our view, this substantially rebuts plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that \"severance pay\u201d is equivalent to \"wages.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
