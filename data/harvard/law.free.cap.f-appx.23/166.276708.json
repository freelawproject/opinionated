New </em>Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Olds filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994), in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia where he is confined. The court construed the action as one under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001), and transferred it to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, the court in which Olds was convicted and sentenced. Because Olds previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, the court dismissed Olds\u2019 action without prejudice because he failed to obtain authorization from this court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s order. To the extent that Olds\u2019 <em>Apprendi </em>claims are cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994), Olds\u2019 168-month sentence for conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 846 (West 1999), does not violate <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 514, 518 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc) (finding no <em>Apprendi </em>error where sentence for conspiracy to commit drug offense involving unspecified drug quantity was under twenty years), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 309, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-20\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying relief without prejudice. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
