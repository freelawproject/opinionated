Kennedy, </em>564 F.2d 1329, 1338 (9th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 944, 98 S.Ct. 1526, 55 L.Ed.2d 541 (1978). We reject defendants\u2019 argument that immaterial discrepancies and apparent verbal slips in grand jury testimony required the district court to dismiss the indictment. We also reject defendants\u2019 argument that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to advise the second grand jury of its right to compel the testimony of live witnesses required the district court to dismiss the indictment. We dismiss indictments only when the government\u2019s conduct before the grand jury was \u201cso excessive, flagrant, scandalous, intolerable, and offensive as to violate due process,\u201d and that is not the case here. <em>United States v. Edmonds, </em>103 F.3d 822, 825 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">We reject defendants\u2019 argument that the wiretap affidavit contained facts that were so misleading that the district court should have suppressed the wiretap evidence. Even if we were to ignore all of the allegedly misleading statements, there would still be more than enough evidence to support the wiretap order. Because there was a \u201csatisfactory explanation\u201d for the sixteen-day delay in sealing the tapes, the government did not violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(a)\u2019s requirement that it immediately make recordings available to the judge issuing the wiretap order. <em>See United States v. Pedroni, </em>958 F.2d 262 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Nor do we agree that the district court should have suppressed evidence discovered in the search of the two mobile homes on Fleming Road. Probable cause supported the first and second warrants. The district court did not err in finding that, even without the affidavit\u2019s alleged misleading and false statements, there would still have been undisputed evidence to support probable cause. <em>See United States v. Reeves, </em>210 F.3d 1041, 1044 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1000, 121 S.Ct. 499, 148 L.Ed.2d 470 (2000). The district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the defendants did not make a sufficient showing that the government\u2019s alleged failure to preserve the evidence was in bad faith. <em>See Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 57-58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b894-6\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
