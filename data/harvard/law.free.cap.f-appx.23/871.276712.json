R.App. P. 4(a)(5) motions. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Tarka brought suit against Montana State University employees and students under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 2000e-2(a), alleging civil rights violations, discrimination, and libel. The district court, on the recommendation of a magistrate judge, dismissed Tarka\u2019s complaint for various defects. Tarka filed a motion under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) for relief from the district court\u2019s judgment and order. He also sought an extension of time to file a notice of appeal of the dismissal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). The district court denied both motions, and Tarka now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">I. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to vacate a judgment under Rule 60(b) for. an abuse of discretion. <em>Thompson v. Calderon, </em>151 F.3d 918, 920 (9th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). A district court abuses its discretion if it does not apply the correct law or if it rests its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of material fact. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>98 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.1996) (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-17\">Tarka claimed that relief was appropriate because there was surprise, discovery of new evidence, and misconduct on the part of opposing counsel. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1), (2), &amp; (3). The district court denied Tarka\u2019s motion on its finding that Tarka\u2019s allegations were unsubstantiated. The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion, therefore it did not abuse its discretion. We affirm the denial of Tarka\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-18\">II. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-19\">We also review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal. <em>Alaska Limestone Corp. v. Hodel, </em>799 F.2d 1409, 1411 (9th Cir.1986). The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Tarka\u2019s request for an extension. Tarka failed to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d for an extension.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b904-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-15\">. As part of his appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion, Tarka also argues that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint without offering or ordering an amendment. However, that issue is not properly before the panel because Tarka failed to timely appeal the dismissal. <em>See Briones v. Riviera Hotel &amp; Casino, </em>116 F.3d 379, 380 (9th Cir.1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b904-23\">. Although Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) also allows a court to grant an extension if the movant shows \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d Tarka only asserted \u201cgood cause\u201d as the basis for an extension.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
