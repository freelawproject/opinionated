Boone appeals the district court\u2019s order upholding the denial of his application for disability benefits and supplemental security income. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no reversible error. The ALJ did not abrogate his duty to advise Boone of the availability of representation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Nor did the ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>fail to assist Boone, a pro se claimant, in developing the record. Finally, substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Boone v. Halter, </em>No. CA-99-857-1 (M.D.N.C. Apr. 26, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b214-11\"> To the extent that the Commissioner failed to follow procedures set forth in his <em>Hearings, Appeals and Litigation Law Manual, </em>we find that Boone failed to show prejudice resulting from rigorous adherence to those procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
