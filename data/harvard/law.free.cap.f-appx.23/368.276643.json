This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-28\">Seeking monetary relief, O\u2019Neal sued his former wife, the City of Dayton, Ohio, multiple city police officers, prosecutors, and the organization known as Artemis, contending that he had been subjected to false arrest and malicious prosecution. The district court subsequently granted summary judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In his timely appeal, O\u2019Neal asserts that there were sufficient issues of fact which would prevent the grant of summary judgment as to some of the defendants, that he was arrested in violation of the Fourth Amendment, that the prosecutors engaged in malicious prosecution, and that he alleged sufficient facts to satisfy the elements of malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>See Summar ex rel. Summar v. Bennett, </em>157 F.3d 1054, 1057 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">O\u2019Neal alleged the state tort claims of malicious prosecution and false arrest against defendants Conrad, King, and Greer. O\u2019Neal was arrested on September 11, 1997, and the prosecution was terminated in January 1998. O\u2019Neal filed his complaint on June 14, 1999. As such, these allegations are barred by Ohio\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2305.11(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">O\u2019Neal sued the City of Dayton, Ohio, alleging that the city failed to properly supervise, train, and discipline its officers. The Supreme Court has determined that a municipality cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 solely because it employs a tortfeasor. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). In <em>Monell, </em>the Supreme Court held that municipalities may be sued when the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements a policy statement, regulation, or decision which has been officially adopted and promulgated by the body\u2019s officers. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018. A municipality will not be held liable under \u00a7 1983 for random, unauthorized acts of its employees. <em>Id. </em>at 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018. O\u2019Neal does not provide any evidence that his arrest by Officer Higgins was made pursuant to a government policy. Therefore, the City of Dayton was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The facts establish that Officer Higgins, who is not a defendant, arrested O\u2019Neal pursuant to a warrant for violating a protective order. As Officer Higgins was the officer who made the arrest, O\u2019Neal did not establish that the other named police officers deprived him of a federal right. <em>Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 166, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985). Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing O\u2019Neal\u2019s complaint against the numerous defendant police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">O\u2019Neal sued numerous prosecutors for their involvement in his arrest and subsequent attempt to prosecute him. Prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity for conduct intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process. <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). This immunity extends to a prosecutor\u2019s decision to file a criminal complaint and to seek an arrest warrant. <em>See Ireland v. Tunis, </em>113 F.3d 1435, 1446 (6th Cir.1997). Absolute prosecutorial immunity is not defeated by a showing that a prosecutor acted wrongfully or even maliciously. The decision to prosecute, even if malicious and founded in bad faith, is unquestionably advocacy and is at the heart of the <em>Imbler </em>holding. <em>See Grant v. Hollenbach, </em>870 F.2d 1135, 1138 (6th Cir.1989). Therefore, the prosecutors were entitled to absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
