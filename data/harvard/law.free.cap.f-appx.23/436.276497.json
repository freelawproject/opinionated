The parties have waived oral argument and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-20\">In 1994, Gray applied for disability benefits. After exhausting her administrative remedies, Gray sought review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision in the district court. The case was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The district court rejected the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation concluding that the Commissioner had made a legal error. The district judge remanded the application to the Commissioner for further proceedings. While her first application was being reviewed, Gray filed a second application for benefits and received a favorable decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-21\">Gray then filed a request for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA. The Commissioner objected to the request stating that his position was substantially justified, thus prohibiting the award of fees under the EAJA. The district court agreed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Commissioner and denied Gray\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. Gray then requested the district court to alter its decision pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) which the district court subsequently denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In her timely appeal, Gray argues that the Commissioner\u2019s position was not substantially justified within the meaning of the EAJA. Therefore, she is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">This court review's the district court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 559, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988); <em>United States v. $515,060.42 in U.S. Currency, </em>152 F.3d 491, 506-07 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The EAJA provides that a court shall award fees and other expenses to a prevailing party, other than the United States, in any civil action brought by or against the United States, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances would make an award unjust. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). Eligibility for a fee award in a civil action requires that the claimant be a prevailing party, that the government\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d and that no special circumstances made an award unjust. <em>Commissioner, INS v. Jean, </em>496 U.S. 154, 158, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990). This court has defined \u201csubstantially justified\u201d under the EAJA to mean justified in substance or justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person. A position can be justified even though it is not correct and can be justified if a reasonable person could think it correct, that is, that it has a reasonable basis in law and fact. <em>United States v. Real Property Located at 2323 Charms Rd., </em>946 F.2d 437, 440 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The district court found that the Commissioner\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d A review of the record supports this conclusion. The magistrate,, judge agreed with the Commissioner that Gray should be denied benefits. This finding lends credence to the Commissioner\u2019s position that a reasonable person could believe that the denial of benefits was correct. Further, the district court did not reverse the Commissioner\u2019s decision and award benefits. Rather, the district court remanded the application for further proceedings due to an error of law. This conclusion further supports the Commissioner\u2019s argument that his position was justifiable. In light of these facts, the district court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
