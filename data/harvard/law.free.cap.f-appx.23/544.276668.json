McClain brings this direct appeal challenging the sentencing court\u2019s calculation of his base offense level for a \u201cfelon in possession of a firearm\u201d offense. Finding that McClain possessed the firearm in connection with another offense, attempted murder, the sentencing court increased McClain\u2019s base offense level from 14 to 22. McClain argues that the evidence adduced at trial would support either attempted murder or aggravated assault but that under the \u201crule of lenity\u201d the sentencing court should have adopted the view of the evidence most favorable to him and sentenced him accordingly. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-20\">McClain was convicted of possessing a firearm after a felony conviction in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tion of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). His conviction stemmed from an altercation he had with Erie Jackson, who is married to Wendy Jackson, the mother of McClain\u2019s daughter. On the morning of April 23, 2000, McClain returned his daughter, Nat\u00eda, to Jackson\u2019s home after an overnight visit. Wendy Jackson had denied McClain\u2019s request to keep Nat\u00eda for a longer period. Shortly after Nakia\u2019s return, Eric Jackson left for the grocery store. While driving to the store Jackson encountered McClain walking a few blocks away. When Jackson stopped at a stop sign, McClain shouted at him, and the two men began arguing about Nat\u00eda. McClain then walked over to Jackson\u2019s car, reached through the open driver\u2019s side window and hit Jackson in the head with a .32 caliber semi-automatic pistol. Jackson got out of the car, and the two men began fighting over the gun. During the fight, McClain pointed the gun at Jackson and tried to fire, but the gun did not discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Springfield police officer Donald Anderson arrived at the scene, and McClain fled down an alley. Jackson told the officer that McClain had a gun, and the officer began chasing McClain on foot. During the chase McClain dropped the gun. The officer recovered the gun but lost sight of McClain. Police found McClain at his home later that day crouching in a stairwell closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">At trial Jackson testified that during the altercation McClain had pointed the gun at him \u201c[l]ike he would shoot.\u201d He stated that McClain tried to fire the gun but that it did not discharge. Officer Anderson testified that upon inspecting the gun he observed that the barrel contained one bullet with a \u201cprimer strike,\u201d meaning that someone had attempted to fire it. Gary Havey, a forensic scientist from the Illinois State Police, testified that he too noticed the primer strike on the bullet when inspecting the gun for fingerprints. At the close of the government\u2019s case, McClain offered into evidence several photographs of the scene and rested without presenting any witnesses. The jury returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">In his presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) the probation officer recommended a base offense level of 22, rather than the level 14 that ordinarily would have applied under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6). The probation officer reasoned that the court should apply the cross-reference provision of \u00a7 2K2.1(e)(1) because McClain had used the firearm in connection with the commission of another crime, namely, the attempted murder of Jackson. The probation officer therefore recommended applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(2) \u2014 \u201cAssault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder,\u201d which provides for a base offense level of 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The PSR also included a total of 12 criminal history points. Three points each were assessed for a 1992 state conviction for unlawful possession of a stolen vehicle, a felony offense for which McClain received a three-year prison sentence, and a 1995 \u201cfelon in possession\u201d conviction for which he received a 46-month federal prison sentence. An additional four points were assessed under U.S.S .G. \u00a7 4Al.1(c) for four state offenses: a 1991 theft conviction; a 1993 criminal trespass conviction; a 1994 conviction for unlawful use of a weapon; and a 1998 retail theft conviction. McClain received an additional two points for committing his current gun offense less than two years after release from imprisonment for the 1995 \u201cfelon in possession\u201d offense. This record resulted in a criminal history category of V, producing a range of 77-96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">At sentencing McClain argued that under one of two theories his offense level should be 18 rather than 22. He first suggested a base offense level of 14 under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6) with a 4-point upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) because the gun was used in the felony offense of aggravated assault. Alternatively he suggested a base offense level of 15 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2, the guideline for aggravated assault, with a 3-point upward adjustment under \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(2) because he had \u201cbrandished\u201d the gun during the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The court rejected these arguments, instead adopting the recommendation in the PSR that McClain be sentenced under the guideline for attempted murder. The court found \u201cample\u201d evidence in the record that McClain had attempted to murder Jackson, including Jackson\u2019s testimony that McClain tried to shoot him from close range, and the testimony of the police officers that the bullet found in the gun was dented, indicating that someone had tried to fire it. The court sentenced McClain to 95 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release. McClain filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Given McClain\u2019s criminal history and the type of weapon involved, the presumptive base offense level was 14 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6). But \u00a7 2K2.1(c) also provides that if McClain used his handgun \u201cin connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense,\u201d the district court was to apply \u201c \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) in respect to that other offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.\u201d Further, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1 provides that when an attempt is expressly covered by another section of the guidelines, the other section should be applied. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1(c)(1). The applicable sentencing provision for assault with intent to commit murder or attempted murder provides for a base offense level of 22. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The sentencing court applied the above provisions to calculate McClain\u2019s base offense level at 22. We review the sentencing court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Crucean, </em>241 F.3d 895, 899 (7th Cir.2001). We review the court\u2019s decision to apply a cross-reference provision for clear error. <em>United States v. Westmoreland, </em>240 F.3d 618, 635 (7th Cir.2001) (internal citation omitted). \u201cClear error\u201d means that a reviewing court is \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. McEntire, </em>153 F.3d 424, 431 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">We conclude that the court did not commit clear error in applying the cross-reference provision and sentencing McClain for attempted murder. As the district court observed, there was evidence in the record to support the conclusion that McClain attempted to murder Jackson. Such evidence included Jackson\u2019s testimony that McClain tried to shoot him with a .32 caliber semi-automatic pistol at close range, and the police officers\u2019 testimony that the bullet in the gun\u2019s chamber appeared to have been fired unsuccessfully. As the prosecutor observed at sentencing, \u201cThe only reason we\u2019re here with felon in possession rather than murder is because that round didn\u2019t fire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">On appeal McClain argues that, although the facts surrounding his offense would support either attempted murder or aggravated assault, under the \u201crule of lenity\u201d the sentencing court should \u201cendeavor to use the rationale most favorable to the defendant and construe the guidelines accordingly.\u201d The government counters that McClain waived any argument regarding the \u201crule of lenity\u201d by failing to raise it at sentencing, or, alternatively, that the \u201crule of lenity\u201d did not require the sentencing court to adopt a view of the evidence most favorable to McClain.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">The \u201crule of lenity\u201d is a principle of statutory construction that, in rare cases,</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>requires an ambiguous criminal statute to be construed in favor of the defendant. <em>See United States v. Chapman, </em>500 U.S. 453, 463, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991). The rule is not applicable unless there is \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty\u201d in the language of a statute \u201ceven after a court has seized everything from which aid can be derived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). In such a case any ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the defendant. <em>See McEntire, </em>153 F.3d at 438 n. 16. The rule is not, however, an \u201coverriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>500 U.S. at 463, 111 S.Ct. 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">We conclude that McClain waived his \u201clenity\u201d argument by failing to raise it below. Waiver occurs when the defendant intentionally relinquishes a known right. <em>United States v. Ramsey, </em>237 F.3d 853, 862 (7th Cir.2001), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Apr. 18, 2001) (No. 00-9546). Waiver extinguishes the error and precludes appellate review. <em>United States v. Staples, </em>202 F.3d 992, 995 (7th Cir.2000). Here McClain objected to the application of \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(2) at sentencing, arguing that the court instead should apply either \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) or \u00a7 2A2.2. McClain did not cite the rule of lenity, nor did he argue that any of the relevant guideline provisions were ambiguous, and his argument is thus waived. <em>See Ramsey, </em>237 F.3d at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Even assuming McClain has not waived this argument, the rule is wholly inapplicable to this case. We have previously considered rule of lenity arguments when a defendant argues that a particular sentencing guideline is ambiguous. <em>See generally United States v. Jones, </em>235 F.3d 342, 345-46 (7th Cir.2000) (rejecting application of rule of lenity to definition of \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d in guidelines); <em>United States v. Unthank, </em>109 F.3d 1205, 1211 (7th Cir.1997) (declining to apply rule of lenity to guidelines provision defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d); <em>United States v. Reddrick, </em>90 F.3d 1276, 1282 (7th Cir.1996) (rejecting rule of lenity argument with respect to differing penalties imposed by guidelines for offenses involving \u201ccocaine\u201d and \u201ccocaine base\u201d). Although the rule may generally apply to a court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines, the rule is inapplicable to a court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts of a particular case. <em>See McEntire, </em>153 F.3d at 438 n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">McClain\u2019s argument that the sentencing court was required to adopt the more favorable view of the evidence is not a proper application of the rule of lenity, which is designed to ameliorate statutory ambiguity. <em>See McEntire, </em>153 F.3d at 438 n. 16. The Supreme Court has expressly rejected the notion, suggested in McClain\u2019s brief, that the rule is an overarching policy of lenience toward criminal defendants. <em>See Chapman, </em>500 U.S. at 463, 111 S.Ct. 1919.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
