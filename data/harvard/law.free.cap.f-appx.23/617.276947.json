The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced her to 5 months imprisonment and one year supervised release (including 5 months home detention). On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief arguing that Duffy\u2019s convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-27\">The evidence at trial, examined in the light most favorable to the jury verdict, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>United States v. Robinson, </em>217 F.3d 560, 564 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 999, 121 S.Ct. 497, 148 L.Ed.2d 468 (2000), showed that Duffy, by virtue of her job responsibilities, was the only pharmacy employee with the ability to order cocaine (by having her manager sign blank order forms), to authorize payment for the cocaine, and to receive the cocaine when it was shipped. This evidence was sufficient to support both guilty verdicts. <em>See United States v. Wilbur, </em>58 F.3d 1291, 1292 (8th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>589 F.2d 1344, 1350 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 919, 99 S.Ct. 2843, 61 L.Ed.2d 287 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">We have conducted an independent review under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and conclude that there are no other nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm, and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-17\">. The HONORABLE DONALD E.
