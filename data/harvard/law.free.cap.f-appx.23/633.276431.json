The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Hinojosa to 292 months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>imprisonment. Hinojosa appeals his conviction, arguing that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court abused its discretion in allowing the cross-examination of a defense witness and admission of impeaching rebuttal evidence. Hinojosa also argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">After a careful review of the record, we find that any error in the admission of evidence was harmless. <em>See United States v. Capozzi, </em>883 F.2d 608, 616 (8th Cir.1989) (\u201cReversal is warranted only where an abuse of discretion leads to prejudice.\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Lynch, </em>800 F.2d 765, 770 (8th Cir.1986))). Hinojosa\u2019s jury trial lasted one week and included testimony from fourteen government witnesses from several law enforcement agencies including the FBI, ATF, DEA, and local law enforcement. We are unpersuaded that the admission of the challenged evidence was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Further, we find that the district court did not clearly err in enhancing Hinojosa\u2019s sentence for obstruction of justice. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>68 F.3d 1050, 1055 (8th Cir.1995) (standard of review). The district court credited the testimony of one of the threatened witnesses, and such credibility determinations are rarely disturbed on appeal. <em>See United States v. Adipietro, </em>983 F.2d 1468, 1472 (8th Cir.1993). We are unpersuaded that the district court\u2019s determination should be disturbed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-29\">. The Honorable Richard G. Kopf, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
