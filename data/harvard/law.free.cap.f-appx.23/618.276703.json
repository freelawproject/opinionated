James further argues the district court failed to consider adequately the Chap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>ter 7 policy statements or the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">After carefully reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 submissions on appeal, we conclude the district court acted within its discretion. The court was not bound to impose a sentence within the 8-to-14-month range recommended under Chapter 7 of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Carr, </em>66 F.3d 981, 983 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (because Chapter 7 serves nonbinding, advisory role, \u201cdistrict court is free to depart from Chapter 7\u2019s suggested sentence when, in its considered discretion, such a departure is warranted\u201d). While 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) requires the court to consider certain factors in imposing a revocation sentence, the court is not required to make specific findings relating to each of the factors, <em>see United States v. Graves, </em>914 F.2d 159, 160 (8th Cir.1990) (per curiam), nor is it required to state on the record that it has considered the factors or to explain its reasons for the sentence imposed, <em>see United States v. Caves, </em>73 F.3d 823, 825 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam). We believe the court adequately weighed the relevant factors, which were brought to its attention by the probation office\u2019s report and counsel\u2019s arguments at the revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-14\">.
