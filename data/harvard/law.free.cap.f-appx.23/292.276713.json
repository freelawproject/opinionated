For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-27\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-28\">On December 23, 1999, Mit\u00e1n filed a complaint for breach of contract and conversion against Defendant-Appellant International Fidelity Insurance Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>(\u201cIFIC\u201d) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Although the complaint contained a conclusory allegation that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000, the only damages enumerated therein were the alleged conversion of $22,000 tendered by Mit\u00e1n as collateral for IFIC\u2019s surety obligation on a $29,000 appeal bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">After reviewing the complaint, the Court <em>sua sponte </em>directed Mit\u00e1n to show cause why the matter should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Mi-tan responded with a document addressing the parties\u2019 diverse citizenship and the non-prejudieial nature of a prior dismissal, but failed to elaborate upon the alleged amount in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The court thereafter issued a second show cause order, directing Mit\u00e1n to \u201cspecifically address the issue of whether the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000,\u201d and to \u201cspecifically delineate the damages he has suffered and [to] discuss the legal theories under which he is permitted to recover those damages.\u201d <em>(See </em>Joint Appendix at 49 (emphasis in original)). In responding to that second show cause order, Mit\u00e1n for the first time asserted that IFIC\u2019s failure to provide written verification of its continuing surety obligation had resulted in the \u201cunlawful seizure\u201d of three automobiles, as well as the loss of a \u201cunique\u201d real estate sale opportunity. .No affidavits or other documentation substantiating such alleged damages were provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The district court then issued a third show cause order, requiring Mit\u00e1n to appear in person for a hearing, \u201cto specifically address the issue of [the requisite jurisdictional amount].\u201d <em>(See </em>Joint Appendix at 61). Although the record does not contain a transcript of that hearing, the district court summarized the presentation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">At the March 27, 2000 hearing, Kenneth Mitan\u2019s counsel, his brother, Keith Mi-tan, was specifically asked about the amount in controversy. He responded that Kenneth Mit\u00e1n had given $22,000 in cash to IFIC for a bond, which IFIC still has. Further, Kenneth Mitan\u2019s counsel represented that three vehicles were seized as a result of IFIC\u2019s failure to acknowledge the bond in writing, causing approximately $20,000 in damages. Finally, counsel stated that Kenneth Mit\u00e1n was unable to sell a piece of commercial property for $830,000. Counsel claimed that the [sic] because the Ingham County Circuit Court entered an injunction preventing the property from being sold until the judgment in [that court] was paid, Kenneth Mit\u00e1n could not accept an offer to sell the property. Counsel represented to the Court that the property could now only be sold for approximately $750,000, thereby representing a loss of $80,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhP\">(Joint Appendix at 73-74).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Reviewing the .evidence and the arguments presented, the district court rejected Mitan\u2019s claim of damages exceeding $75,000. The court expressed doubt regarding the reliability of damage assertions which surfaced only in the face of dismissal. In addition, the court viewed Mitan\u2019s \u201chistory of forum shopping and abusing the legal process\u201d as making him less than credible. (Joint Appendix at 75). The court\u2019s order included the following detailed account of the \u201cdrawn out and complex\u201d facts and procedural background underlying the matter before it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">The instant action arises out of an August 1993 purchase agreement entered into by Mit\u00e1n Properties Company VI (hereinafter Mit\u00e1n VI) and Frandorson Properties (hereinafter Frandorson), whereby Mit\u00e1n VI agreed to purchase from Frandorson three Lansing area shopping centers for $21,976,832.10. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>However, Mit\u00e1n VI could not obtain financing, and eventually, Frandorson agreed to convey its interest in the shopping centers to another party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alv\">On July 15, 1994, five days before Frandorson was to sell the shopping centers to another party, Mit\u00e1n VI filed a complaint in the Ingham County Circuit Court alleging an interest in the properties pursuant to the August 1993 purchase agreement. At the same time, Mit\u00e1n VI recorded a notice of <em>lis pen-dens </em>on the shopping centers in both Ingham and Clinton County. An expedited hearing was conducted in the Ingham County Circuit Court, at which the court ordered Mit\u00e1n VI to post a security bond and surety in the amount of $33,400,000. Furthermore, the Ingham County Circuit Court stated that if the bond was not posted by the date and time required, Mit\u00e1n Vi\u2019s complaint would be dismissed and it would subsequently be enjoined from filing any further related action for a period of forty-five days. Mit\u00e1n VI did not post the bond, therefore on July 21, 1994, Mit\u00e1n Vi\u2019s complaint was dismissed and all notices of <em>Us pendens </em>recorded by Mit\u00e1n VI with respect to Frandorson\u2019s shopping centers were canceled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">After the Ingham County Circuit Court\u2019s ruling, Mit\u00e1n VI filed an appeal of the order requiring it to post a security bond, as well as a second set of notices of <em>Us pendens </em>against Frandorson\u2019s shopping centers in both Ingham and Clinton Counties. On the following day, July 22, 1994, Frandorson filed a motion for bond, injunctive relief and contempt in the trial court against Mit\u00e1n VI, and again obtained an expedited hearing. The Ingham County Circuit Court issued a second order canceling the second set of notices of <em>lis pendens </em>and enjoined Mit\u00e1n VI from recording, \u201canywhere in the world,\u201d any further notices of <em>Us pendens </em>pertaining to the subject properties. The order also enjoined Mit\u00e1n VI and its agents from \u201cinitiating any new actions pertaining to the subject matter of the case in any court of general jurisdiction for forty-five days.\u201d The order further provided that a contempt hearing would be held to address the matter of sanctions and penalties for filing the second set of notices of <em>Us pendens.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">Two days later, on July 24, 1994, Mit\u00e1n VI assigned its alleged interest in the shopping centers to Mit\u00e1n V. On the following day, Mit\u00e1n V filed various documents in both the Ingham and Clinton County Circuit Courts which, although not entitled notices of <em>lis pendens, </em>had the same effect of clouding the shopping centers\u2019 titles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">Frandorson responded to this latest action by filing a motion for bond, injunctive relief, contempt, and cancellation of the third set of title-clouding documents in the Ingham County Circuit Court. Now two cases arising out of the same transaction, with the same facts, were pending in front of the Ingham County Circuit Court, the first case, against Mi-tan VI as defendant, and the second case, against Mit\u00e1n V as defendant. In the second case, Frandorson requested compensatory and exemplary damages, costs and attorney fees, an order canceling the latest set of title clouding documents and an order adjudging that the Mit\u00e1n defendants had no right, title or interest in Frandorson\u2019s shopping centers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">Just two hours before a hearing in the first case, Mit\u00e1n VI had it removed to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The parties appeared for the hearing in Ingham County Circuit Court, but the court ruled that it no longer had jurisdiction in light of the removal to federal court. However, the Ingham County Circuit Court agreed to entertain a motion for bond or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>other relief in the second case against Mit\u00e1n V. Shortly before the hearing on the motion, defendants also caused it to be removed to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, thus preventing the Ingham County Circuit Court from issuing an order. However, on August 4, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, on Frandorson\u2019s motion, remanded both eases to state court. In doing so, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan imposed sanctions against Mit\u00e1n V and Mit\u00e1n VI on the basis that the removal \u201cwas instituted for the wholly improper purpose of delaying and impeding both the state court in conducting its business as well as Frandorson in conveying title of the real property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">On the day after the case was remanded from the Western District, the Ingham County Circuit Court entered an order in the second case, which required the Mit\u00e1n defendants to post a $88,400,000 bond for damages and costs, including attorney fees; forbid the Mit\u00e1n defendants from filing any pleadings until the bond was posted; provided that if the Mit\u00e1n defendants failed to post the bond, Frandorson could move for summary disposition; canceled and dissolved all title-clouding documents previously filed; and scheduled a contempt hearing. On August 9,1994, the Mit\u00e1n defendants once again removed both cases to the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. That court, however, again remanded the cases to the Ingham County Circuit Court. On August 26, 1994, the Mit\u00e1n defendants filed an answer to Frandorson\u2019s complaint without posting a security bond as ordered. Then on October 7, 1994, Frandorson moved to strike the Mit\u00e1n defendants\u2019 answer and sought summary disposition. The motion alleged that the Mit\u00e1n defendants\u2019 answer violated the Ingham County Circuit Court\u2019s August 5, 1994, order because defendants had not posted the required security bond. The Ingham County Circuit Court granted Frandorson\u2019s motion, entering the order on November 28, 1994. Thereafter, on January 10, 1995, the parties stipulated to entry of a consent judgment, as to damages only, in the amount of $25,000. The Mit\u00e1n defendants then appealed this decision to the Michigan Court of Appeals. Eventually, two counts of criminal contempt charges were levied against the Mit\u00e1n defendants for filing title[-]clouding documents after being enjoined from doing so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">The action before this Court stems from the Mit\u00e1n defendants\u2019 appeal. Michigan Court Rule 7.209 requires that an appeal bond be filed in order to stay the decision of a state trial court while a matter is being appealed. On February 2,1995, International Fidelity Insurance Company (hereinafter IFIC), executed an appeal bond. Pursuant to that bond, IFIC became obligated as a surety for Kenneth Mit\u00e1n, in the amount of $29,000. Kenneth Mit\u00e1n asserts that IFIC continues to be obligated as surety in the amount of $29,000 pursuant to the appeal bond. He also maintains that he has made repeated requests for written verification of IFIC\u2019s obligations as surety under the appeal bond. Kenneth Mit\u00e1n further claims that although verbal verification was given, IFIC has refused to provide him with any written verification. Therefore, Kenneth Mit\u00e1n filed suit in this Court, requesting injunctive relief. Specifically, Kenneth Mit\u00e1n requested the Court to find that IFIC continues to be obligated as surety under the appeal bond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">In November, 1999, this case was dismissed because there was a nearly identical case pending in state court between Kenneth Mit\u00e1n and an insurance agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The case was dismissed without prejudice, pending the outcome of the state court action under the Declaratory Judgment Act[,] 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a), which gives trial courts discretion to dismiss an action when there is a nearly identical state case pending. <em>See Wilton v. Seven Fall Company, </em>515 U.S. 277, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995)[.] After the suit was dismissed from this Court, Kenneth Mit\u00e1n filed a nearly identical complaint with the Court. However, in the second complaint, he did not request injunctive relief. Instead, Kenneth Mit\u00e1n claims breach of contract and conversion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">(Joint Appendix at 69-74).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Based on its findings that Mitan\u2019s jurisdictional allegations were not credible and that Mit\u00e1n had abused the legal process, the district court dismissed Mitaris complaint with prejudice. In addition, the court barred Mit\u00e1n, \u201canyone in privity\u201d with him, and any of his \u201cassignees, designees, transferees, donees, grantees, appointees, nominees, legatees, or devisees,\u201d from \u201cfiling any further complaints or motions\u201d arising out of the same facts, at the risk of contempt sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Mit\u00e1n now appeals from that order. He argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Additionally, Mit\u00e1n asserts that any dismissal for lack of jurisdiction should have been without prejudice, and that the court therefore erred in dismissing his complaint with prejudice. Finally, Mit\u00e1n contends that the court erred in prohibiting the filing of further complaints or motions regarding a matter as to which the court had determined that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Federal district courts have original jurisdiction \u201cof all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between citizens of different States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1). District courts have the inherent power to dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>for want of jurisdiction. <em>In re Prevot, </em>59 F.3d 556, 565 (6th Cir.1995), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1161, 116 S.Ct. 1048, 134 L.Ed.2d 194 (1996). A district court\u2019s legal determinations in dismissing a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>while any factual findings are reviewed only for clear error. <em>See Michigan Ass\u2019n of Indep. Clinical Labs. v. Shalala, </em>52 F.3d 1340, 1346 (6th Cir.1994). The party seeking to avoid dismissal bears the burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Moir v. Greater Cleveland Reg'l Transit Auth., </em>895 F.2d 266, 269 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">In determining whether Section 1332\u2019s \u201camount in controversy\u201d requirement is met, federal courts look to the amount alleged in the complaint, unless it appears that the plaintiff in good faith cannot claim that amount. <em>See Horton v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>367 U.S. 348, 353, 81 S.Ct. 1570, 1573, 6 L.Ed.2d 890 (1961); <em>Klepper v. First Am. Bank, </em>916 F.2d 337, 340 (6th Cir.1990). Dismissal for failure to satisfy the requisite jurisdictional amount may be appropriate when the facts indicate that a plaintiff claimed certain damages merely to obtain federal court jurisdiction. <em>See </em>14B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3702, at 98-101 (3d ed.1998). Such cases are exemplified \u201cby those relatively infrequent instances in which flagrant abuse of federal court jurisdiction is obvious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">Upon examining the record relative to the district court\u2019s jurisdictional amount determination, this court concludes that the district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous. Only after two show cause orders unequivocally put Mit\u00e1n on notice that the district court harbored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>concerns about the existence of subject matter jurisdiction did Mit\u00e1n expand upon the skeletal allegations of his complaint by mentioning the purported seizure of three automobiles and loss of a \u201cunique\u201d real property sales opportunity. Even after a third show cause order explicitly directed Mit\u00e1n to appear personally at a hearing to address the jurisdictional amount issue specifically, Mit\u00e1n still produced no testimony, documentation or other competent evidence to support his damage allegations. Aside from the representations of Mitan\u2019s counsel, the district court lacked any convincing proof that any seized vehicles or real estate deal ever existed. The court also had no sound basis for assuming that Mit\u00e1n individually (rather than one of the Mit\u00e1n property companies) had standing to pursue an action for those claimed losses, or that the damage figures counsel proposed reflected reasonable valuations. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mitan\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction did not constitute clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Dismissals of actions that do not reach the merits of a claim, such as dismissals for lack of jurisdiction, ordinarily are without prejudice. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b); Costello v. <em>United States, </em>365 U.S. 265, 285, 81 S.Ct. 534, 545, 5 L.Ed.2d 551 (1961). Nevertheless, \u201c[i]n rare circumstances, a district court may use its inherent power to dismiss with prejudice (as a sanction for misconduct) even a case over which it lacks jurisdiction, and its decision to do so is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Caribbean Broadcasting Sys., Ltd. v. Cable &amp; Wireless PLC, </em>148 F.3d 1080, 1091 (D.C.Cir.1998). This court long has recognized that a trial court\u2019s inherent power includes the power to dismiss cases involving flagrant abuses. <em>See Reid v. Prentice-Hall, Inc., </em>261 F.2d 700, 701 (6th Cir.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In this matter, the district court\u2019s opinion and order adequately conveys that court\u2019s intent to dismiss the complaint with prejudice as a sanction for Mitan\u2019s prior misconduct. After painstakingly documenting Mitan\u2019s \u201chistory of forum shopping and abusing the legal process,\u201d the court clearly articulated its distaste for such practices. <em>(See </em>Joint Appendix at 69-74, 75). The record before us could be construed to present one of \u201cthose relatively infrequent instances in which flagrant abuse of federal court jurisdiction is obvious.\u201d <em>See </em>14B Wright, Miller <em>&amp; </em>Cooper, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3702, at 104. Under such circumstances, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Mitan\u2019s complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The federal courts\u2019 inherent power to protect the orderly administration of justice and to maintain the authority and dignity of the court extends to a full range of litigation abuses. <em>See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 43-44, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 2132, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991); <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 764, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 2463, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980) (quoting <em>Cooke v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 517, 539, 45 S.Ct. 390, 395-96, 69 L.Ed. 767 (1925)). A district court may award sanctions pursuant to its inherent powers when bad faith occurs. <em>Shimman v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 18, </em>744 F.2d 1226, 1229-30 (6th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1215, 105 S.Ct. 1191, 84 L.Ed.2d 337 (1985). The power to punish for contempt also is an inherent power of the federal courts, including the power to punish violations of their own orders. <em>Green v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 165, 170, 78 S.Ct. 632, 635, 2 L.Ed.2d 672 (1958). A court may use this inherent power to sanction a party who \u201chas acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\u201d <em>Strag v. Board of Trustees, Craven Community </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number><em>College, </em>55 F.3d 943, 955 (4th Cir.1995). An abuse of discretion standard of review applies to sanctions decisions under that power. <em>Orlett v. Cincinnati Microwave, Inc., </em>954 F.2d 414, 417 (6th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The district court\u2019s order invoked its inherent authority to sanction Mit\u00e1n for his repeated abuse of the judicial process when it prohibited him from introducing further related actions. Because there was a basis for the district court to invoke its inherent power to sanction Mit\u00e1n, the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 639, 642-43, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 2780-81, 49 L.Ed.2d 747 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
