R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The district court\u2019s order denying \u00a7 2255 relief was entered on the docket on July 9, 2001. Robinson timely moved to extend the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(5), which the district court granted on October 17, 2001. Robinson therefore had ten days after entry of the order granting the extension of time in which to file his notice of appeal \u2014 that is, until October 29, 2001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Despite this extension, Robinson did not file his notice of appeal from the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief until November 2, 2001. Because Robinson failed to file a timely notice of appeal after obtaining an extension, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s July 9 order denying \u00a7 2255 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">We also lack jurisdiction to consider Robinson\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order denying Rule 60(b) relief. The district court entered its order on August 14, 2001. Because Robinson failed to obtain an extension or reopening of the sixty-day appeal period, his notice of appeal filed on November 2, 2001, was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Accordingly, we deny Robinson\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-10\">. Although styled as a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), the motion actually was a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) because Robinson filed it more than ten days after entry of judgment. <em>See Small v. Hunt, </em>98 F.3d 789, 797 (4th Cir. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-5\">. The tenth day fell on Saturday, October 27, 2001, so Robinson had until Monday, October 29 to file his notice of appeal. See Fed. R.App. P. 26(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
