On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief arguing that the court erred when it denied Mr. PerezCano\u2019s downward-departure motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-16\">Further, as the court \u201celeet[ed] not to depart in this case,\u201d and Mr. Perez-Cano does not suggest the court acted with an unconstitutional motive, its discretionary decision not to depart is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>169 F.3d 569, 573 (8th Cir.1999) (district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart downward is reviewable only if court acted with unconstitutional motive or believed it lacked authority to depart); <em>United States v. Field, </em>110 F.3d 587, 591-92 (8th Cir.1997) (district court\u2019s conclusion \u201cunder the facts of this case\u201d that downward departure was not warranted fairly indicated it recognized its authority to depart) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-20\">Following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-21\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-17\">. The Honorable Richard G.
