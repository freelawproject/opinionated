After full review of the case, the court is satisfied that appropriate disposition of the appeal does not warrant an opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. R. 36(b). Accordingly, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED by the court that the judgment of the district court is affirmed for the reasons set forth in the attached memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-17\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-18\">Drysdale seeks to overturn a district court\u2019s decision not to vacate or modify an arbitration award rendered against the company in connection with a dispute that arose out of a house renovation contract with the Frists. Drysdale\u2019s main complaints are that the arbitrator (1) impermissibly allowed the Frists to raise new allegations of missing items in their rebuttal submissions, without allowing Drysdale an opportunity to respond, thereby violating the District of Columbia Uniform Arbitration Act, D.C.Code \u00a7 16-4311(4) (2001), and (2) adopted a new pricing formula, which either contained an obvious mathematical error, or, in the alternative, was premised on evidence that the arbitrator could not have considered unless he avoided violation of \u00a7 16-4311(4) by allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>rebuttal. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The district court has adequately resolved all issues raised in this case, especially in light of the exceedingly narrow standard of review that applies to challenged arbitrators\u2019 decisions. See, e.g., <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n Int\u2019l, </em>808 F.2d 76, 80 (noting that this standard is \u201camongst the narrowest known to the law\u201d) (quoting <em>Diamond v. Terminal Ry. Ala. State Docks, </em>421 F.2d 228, 233 (5th Cir.1970) (internal quotation marks omitted)). As the appellant itself acknowledges in its reply brief, each of the purportedly \u201cnew\u201d items introduced by the Frists on rebuttal was a subject of previous testimony and exhibits produced by both sides during the seven-day arbitration hearing. Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 1. In fact, a majority of those \u201citems\u201d were claims of either double billing or lack of supporting documentation, see Affidavit of Karyn Frist, Attachment 1 (Mar. 13, 1998), J.A. 319-23, all of which were already subject to the arbitrator\u2019s previous order to Drysdale to produce all related receipts, contracts, and other documents. In addition, a videotape of the house, made by Drysdale in connection with the arbitration proceedings, could have been deemed by the arbitrator to be a sufficient basis for evaluating the truthfulness of the \u201cnew\u201d claims. The arbitrator was clearly presented with a point-by-point response by the Frists to each of Drysdale\u2019s claims of lack of opportunity to respond, see Opposition to Claimant\u2019s Motion to Strike or for Leave to Respond to Respondents\u2019 Post Hearing Submissions, at 8-9, J.A. 349-50, and Drysdale has failed to show that the arbitrator\u2019s evidentiary rulings involved the sort of \u201crefus[al] to hear [material] evidence\u201d that calls for vacation of an award under the statute. See D.C.Code \u00a7 16-311(4) (2001). Rather, his ruling was squarely within his discretion to determine whether further evidentiary submissions would be \u201ccumulative, unreliable, or of slight value compared to the time and expense involved.\u201d Construction Industry Arbitration Rule 31 (American Arbitration Association 1996); Memorandum Opinion at 8, J.A. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">With respect to the proper value of the pricing multiplier, we reject Drysdale\u2019s contention that the arbitrator\u2019s use of 1.4 was a mistake that warrants modification of the award. Drysdale argues that the arbitrator misinterpreted the Frists\u2019 rebuttal testimony, and, contrary to the Frists\u2019 continuing, acknowledgement that a coefficient of 1.67 should have been used, erroneously applied one equal to 1.4. But this is undercut by Drysdale\u2019s own contemporaneous interpretation of the Frists\u2019 rebuttal affidavit as suddenly espousing \u201cthe new 1.40 markup,\u201d which in turn caused Drysdale to file a written objection to the arbitrator on that ground. See Claimant\u2019s Motion to Strike or for Leave to Respond to Respondents\u2019 Post-Hearing Submissions, at 2, J.A. 339. Ambiguities present in the record on this issue preclude us from finding that the arbitrator\u2019s choice of 1.4 was \u201can evident miscalculation of figures,\u201d so as to fall within statutory grounds for correcting an arbitration award. See D.C.Code \u00a7 16-4312 (2001); cf. <em>Apex Plumbing Supply, Inc. v. United States Supply Co., </em>142 F.3d 188, 194 (4th Cir.1998) (holding, in construing the Federal Arbitration Act, that the remedy of modification of an \u201cevident miscalculation of figures\u201d could only apply to mathematical errors appearing <em>on the face </em>of the award).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Were the Frists indeed suddenly contending on rebuttal that 1.4 represents the proper industry mark-up, Drysdale submits, then, because it represented an abrupt change in their prior position, the arbitrator should have either ignored it, or allowed Drysdale to respond. But under District of Columbia law, the arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>refusal to hear material evidence leads to vacatur only if it has resulted in substantial prejudice to one party\u2019s rights. See D.C.Code \u00a7 16-4311(4) (2001). Because the proper value of the multiplier in the pricing formula was exhaustively debated by the parties even prior to the rebuttal stage, Drysdale had an adequate opportunity to present its views on this subject. Therefore, even if erroneous, the arbitrator\u2019s evidentiary ruling disallowing further submissions by Drysdale could hardly be described as depriving Drysdale of a fair hearing. See, e.g., <em>Hoteles Condado Beach v. Union De Tronquistas, </em>763 F.2d 34, 40 (1st Cir.1985) (\u201cvacatur is appropriate ... when the exclusion of relevant evidence \u2018so affects the rights of a party that it may be said that he was deprived of a fair hearing/ \u201d) (quoting <em>Newark Stereotypers\u2019 Union No. 18 v. Newark Morning Ledger Co., </em>397 F.2d 594, 599 (3d Cir.1968)); <em>Fairchild &amp; Co. v. Richmond, F. &amp; P.R. Co., </em>516 F.Supp. 1305, 1315 (D.D.C. 1981) (evidentiary mistakes do not provide grounds for vacating an arbitration award unless they undermine the fundamental fairness of the proceedings).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
