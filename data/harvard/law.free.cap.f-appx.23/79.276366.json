Berman, <em>Judge) </em>upon his guilty plea to possessing a firearm after having previously been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Alers challenges the 15 year sentence imposed on him pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) because the indictment failed to plead, and the jury did not find, that the predicate offenses were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">As counsel for each party agreed at oral argument, Alers\u2019 claim is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>268 F.3d 151 (2d Cir.2001). Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
