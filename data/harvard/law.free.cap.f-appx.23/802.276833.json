We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-17\">Redante contends that the one-year statute of limitations period should be equitably tolled because his counsel misinformed him regarding the timely filing of his state and federal petitions. We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a petition for writ of habeas corpus, including a dismissal on statute of limitations grounds. <em>See Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999). Appellate review of whether the limitations period for a habeas corpus petition was equitably tolled is de novo in cases where the facts are undisputed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-20\">To obtain equitable tolling, Redante must show that extraordinary circumstances beyond his control made it impossible for him to file his habeas petition on time. <em>See Calderon v. United States Dist. Court for Cent. Dist. of Cal. (Beeler), </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1288 (9th Cir.1997), <em>overruled on other grounds by Calderon v. United States Dist. Court for Cent. Dist. of Cal. (Kelly), </em>163 F.3d 530, 540 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc). We conclude that Redante is not entitled to equitable tolling because he has no right to counsel on a habeas petition, and the misinformation provided by his counsel did not make it impossible for Redante to exercise his constitutional right to file his federal habeas petition. <em>See Frye v. Hickman, </em>273 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.2001)(concluding that \u201cthe miscalculation of the limitations period by [defendant\u2019s] counsel and his negligence in general do not constitute extraordinary circumstances sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-21\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Redante\u2019s petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b834-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
