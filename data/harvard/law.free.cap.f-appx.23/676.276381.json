We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">The district court did not err when it dismissed Tretiak\u2019s claims arising from the state disciplinary proceedings in early 1997, the ALJ\u2019s decision or the adoption of that decision in mid-1997, and the state\u2019s issuance of a press release in June 1997. These claims were barred by the statute of limitations because they accrued more than two years before Tretiak filed his complaint on November 5,1999. Nev.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 11.190(4)(e)(2001); <em>Perez v. Seevers, </em>869 F.2d 425, 426 (9th Cir.1989). The district court also properly dismissed Tretiak\u2019s claim based upon the draft proposed order because absolute immunity protects state agency officials who are performing functions comparable to either judges or prosecutors. <em>See Romano v.. Bible, </em>169 F.3d 1182, 1186-88 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">The district court correctly dismissed Tretiak\u2019s claims arising from any alleged injury to Retirement Financial Centers of America, Inc. or RFCA Financial Services, Inc. Neither corporation was named as a plaintiff. Tretiak cannot maintain a claim on behalf of a corporation, nor may he represent the corporations as a pro se plaintiff. <em>See Shell Petroleum v. Graves, </em>709 F.2d 593, 594 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Rowland v. California Men\u2019s Colony, </em>506 U.S. 194, 202, 113 S.Ct. 716, 121 L.Ed.2d 656 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">Tretiak\u2019s claims against NASD Regulation, Inc. and Sylvia Scott, an NASD enforcement attorney, arising from the NASD disciplinary proceeding were properly dismissed. NASD Regulation, Inc., when acting under the authority delegated to it by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78a-78mm, is entitled to absolute immunity from money damages. <em>See Partnership Exch. Sec. Co. v. National Ass\u2019n of Sec. Dealers, Inc., </em>169 F.3d 606, 608 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Sparta Surgical Corp. v. National Ass\u2019n of Sec. Dealers, Inc., </em>159 F.3d 1209, 1214 (9th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Finally, the district court properly dismissed Tretiak\u2019s claims against Maurice Kamhi, an employee of the California Department of Corporations, arising out of an 1998 investigation of RFCA Financial, Inc. The district court properly determined that Kamhi is entitled to qualified immunity because Tretiak failed to meet his burden of showing that Kamhi\u2019s conduct violated a clearly established right. <em>See Romero v. Kitsap County, </em>931 F.2d 624, 627 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">AFFIRMED<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b709-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
