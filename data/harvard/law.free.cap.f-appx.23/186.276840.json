Brown seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order resentencing him for his violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) (1994), following a remand from this court. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>6 Fed.Appx. 159, 161 (4th Cir.2001). We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Brown\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-21\">Parties to a criminal proceeding are accorded ten days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment was entered on the docket on July 18, 2001. Brown\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on July 31, 2001. Because Brown failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
