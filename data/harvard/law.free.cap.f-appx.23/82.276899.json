Wood, <em>Judge), </em>adopting the Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge Andrew J. Peck dated December 6, 2000, and granting defendants-appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The District Court held that (1) Cobian\u2019s Title VII and ADA claims relating to actions taken before December 27, 1997 (i.e., 300 days before her October 23, 1998 EEOC charge) are time-barred; (2) Cobian\u2019s claims regarding her niece\u2019s custody are barred by the domestic relations exception and the <em>Rooker Feldman </em>doctrine; (3) Cobian failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of race, national origin or disability; and (4) Cobian failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. We affirm for substantially the reasons stated in Magistrate Judge Peck\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned Report and Recommendation. <em>See Cobian v. New York City, </em>No. 99 Civ. 10533, 2000 WL 1782744 (S.D.N.Y. Dec.6, 2000).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
