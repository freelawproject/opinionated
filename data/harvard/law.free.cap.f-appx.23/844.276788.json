We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal, <em>see Daviton v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., </em>241 F.3d 1131, 1135 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Hollis-Arrington contends that Judge Phillips did not have the authority to render final judgment because she was a magistrate judge when judgment was entered and none of the parties consented to her jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(e)(1). This contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">District Judge Pregerson assigned this case to Magistrate Judge Phillips for determination of defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. On December 27, 1999, after the matter was under submission, but before any decision had been filed, Virginia A. Phillips was appointed as a United States District Court Judge for the Central District of California. On January 3, 2000, District Judge Phillips issued an order dismissing Holhs-Arrington\u2019s action with prejudice on statute of limitations grounds. As a district court judge, Judge Phillips had authority to enter a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b877-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
