Fouts appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adverse grant of summary judgment in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Fouts moved the district court for an extension of time to file an appeal more than thirty days following entry of judgment, and thus Fouts was required to give defendants notice. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(B). Because he did not, the district court lacked authority to grant the extension, and Fouts\u2019s ensuing notice of appeal was untimely. <em>See Hable v. Pairolero, </em>915 F.2d 394, 394-95 (8th Cir.1990) (district court lacked jurisdiction to order extension where party filed motion more than 30 days after judgment and failed to notify opposing parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-27\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-16\">.
