On appeal, he argues that the jury did not properly find the drug quantity attributable to him, in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the district court\u2019s jury instructions improperly allowed the jury to attribute to him quantities outside his knowledge and not in furtherance of the specific agreement with his co-conspirators. After careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-21\">The district court\u2019s instruction, read as a whole, fairly and adequately reflected the applicable law and therefore was not erroneous. <em>See United States v. Phelps, </em>168 F.3d 1048,1057 (8th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-33\">.
