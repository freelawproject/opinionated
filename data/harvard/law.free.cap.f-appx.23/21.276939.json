According to petitioner, his \u201cfirst\u201d petition was in fact a motion for reduction of sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) which the district court, acting without his consent, had recharacterized as a \u00a7 2255 petition. If so, that filing would likely \u201cnot count as a \u2018first\u2019 habeas petition sufficient to trigger AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping requirements.\u201d <em>Raineri v. United States, </em>233 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>As the district court found, however, this assertion is factually mistaken. The record reveals that a \u00a7 3582(c) motion was filed on May 16, 1997 and was denied in a margin order dated June 3, 1997. Petitioner then filed a separate pleading on November 24, 1997 which was formally styled as a \u00a7 2255 petition and was treated as such. The court disposed of that matter in an order dated February 17, 1998. The existence of this earlier \u00a7 2255 proceeding renders the instant petition second or successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The judgment is affirmed. Alternatively, to the extent the notice of appeal can be construed as a request for leave to file a second or successive petition, that request is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated in the first paragraph of this court\u2019s November 20, 2000 judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
