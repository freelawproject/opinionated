Mehdipour\u2019s present action arises out of his pending appeal of his Oklahoma state court conviction for distribution of a controlled substance. In the present action, he argues that the defendants, judges of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA), are (1) violating his right of access to the courts by refusing to allow him to add the issue of whether the defendant judges were harassing him and acting in bad faith to the pending appeal of his conviction, (2) violating his equal protection rights by refusing to recuse themselves from his appeal, and (3) violating his right to a speedy appeal because they have taken more than two years to decide his appeal. He argues that the district court abused its discretion by determining that his suit was frivolous for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">This court recently dismissed another claim brought by Mehdipour against these same defendants arising out of the same pending state court appeal, where Mehdipour sought an injunction to force the defendants to allow him to fire his counsel and proceed pro se. <em>Mehdipour v. Chapel, </em>4 Fed.Appx. 701, 2001 WL 173644 (10th Cir. Feb. 22, 2001) (unpublished). We held that his claims were barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and by <em>Younger </em>abstention,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that in any event Mehdipour had failed to show the irreparable injury necessary for an injunction. <em>Id. </em>at *1. In the present action, the district court below dismissed Mehdipour\u2019s action as frivolous, reasoning that because Mehdipour\u2019s appeal of his conviction remained pending before the OCCA, <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>and <em>Younger </em>remained just as compelling as in the prior case.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-15\">As to Mehdipour\u2019s arguments regarding his right to assert additional claims and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>right to have the defendants recuse themselves, we agree with the district court that <em>Younger </em>obliges us to abstain. <em>Younger </em>abstention is appropriate here because Mehdipour\u2019s arguments could be presented in the ongoing state proceeding, that proceeding implicates important state interests, and that proceeding affords an adequate opportunity to raise such federal claims. <em>Roe No. 2 v. Ogden, </em>253 F.3d 1225, 1232 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">As to Mehdipour\u2019s argument regarding his right to speedy appeal, this argument was not presented to the district court in his complaint, and therefore we decline to consider it on appeal. <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>48 F.3d 1147 (10th Cir.1995). We recognize that Mehdipour did refer to a speedy appeal argument in his February 23, 2001 Motion for Temporary Restraining Order And/Or Preliminary Injunction and Brief in Support filed before the district court. However, even in view of our liberal construction of pro se filings, Mehdipour\u2019s mere passing mention of an issue in a post-complaint motion, without any effort at legal or factual support, was insufficient to put this issue before the district court. The district court\u2019s Order of Dismissal made no reference to a speedy appeal claim. Accordingly, we do not consider this argument, although we pause to observe that most of the delay of which he complains resulted from resolution of Mehdipour\u2019s successful motion to fire his counsel and submit his own appellate brief. <em>See Harris v. Champion, </em>15 F.3d 1538, 1558, 1562-63 (10th Cir.1994) (stating that the reason for the delay is one of four factors to be balanced in determining whether a delayed appeal constitutes a violation of due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Finally, we perceive no error in the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) or \u00a7 1915(g). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b953-12\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-17\">. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.
