Estillore, a native and citizen of the Philippines, excludable on the basis of various misrepresentations he made upon his entry into the United States and in his application for naturalization. Estillore subsequently sought a waiver of exclusion and made a request for voluntary departure under \u00a7\u00a7 241(a)(1)(H) and 244(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The IJ denied both the application for a waiver and the request for voluntary departure. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed these rulings, and this appeal followed. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the denial of Estillore\u2019s application for a waiver of exclusion, and dismiss Estillore\u2019s appeal of the BIA\u2019s decision on voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-20\">I. Application for a \u00a7 241(a)(1)(H) Waiver of Exclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b890-21\">Because Estillore was in deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997, this case falls under the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d). <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c). Pursuant to these rules, we apply pre-IIRIRA law in reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of \u00a7 241(a)(1)(H) relief,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which directs us to review the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See INS v. Yang, </em>519 U.S. 26, 28, 117 S.Ct. 350, 136 L.Ed.2d 288 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-22\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in this case. As noted by the BIA, Estillore made multiple misrepresentations to the INS, both upon entry and in his application for naturalization. Moreover, Estillore\u2019s wife and three children currently reside in Asia, with all three children living in the Philippines. Given these facts, we cannot say that the BIA\u2019s decision to deny \u00a7 241(a)(1)(H) relief amounted to an abuse of discretion. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s decision to deny \u00a7 241(a)(1)(H) relief is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-23\">II. Request for Voluntary Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b890-24\">As noted above, this appeal is governed by IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules. Pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>to these rules, there is no appeal of discretionary decisions made under \u00a7 244 of the INA in cases, like Estillore\u2019s, in which the final order of deportation is entered after the enactment of IIRIRA. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E). Because the BIA\u2019s denial of Estillore\u2019s request for voluntary departure was a discretionary decision made under \u00a7 244, Estillore has no right to appeal the BIA\u2019s ruling. <em>See Antonio-Cruz v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1129, 1130 (9th Cir.1998). Thus, Estillore\u2019s appeal of the BIA\u2019s decision on voluntary departure must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the BIA\u2019s denial of \u00a7 241(a)(1)(H) relief is AFFIRMED, and Estillore\u2019s appeal of the BIA\u2019s decision on voluntary departure is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b890-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-25\">. Therefore, we ignore IIRIRA\u2019s modification and redesignation of \u00a7 241(a)(1)(H), as well as IIRIRA\u2019s provision that eliminates judicial review of discretionary decisions by the Attorney General. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7\u00a7 305(a)(2), 306(a)(2), 308.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
