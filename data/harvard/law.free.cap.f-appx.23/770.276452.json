He brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Los Angeles County (\u201cCounty\u201d), alleging that the hospital violated his constitutional rights when, pursuant to an established practice or custom, it failed to independently review his medical condition before admitting him. Finding no evidence of such a practice, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the County. We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>I <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Two Los Angeles police officers responded to a disturbance at a public swimming pool where they confronted Wayman. The officers deemed Wayman\u2019s behavior aberrant, took him into custody, and transported him to Harbor-UCLA for a \u201c \u00a7 5150\u201d psychiatric hold. <em>See </em>Cal. Wel. &amp; Inst.Code \u00a7 5150 (\u201c \u00a7 5150\u201d). Section 5150 provides that a police officer \u201cwho has probable cause to believe that the person is, as a result of mental disorder, a danger to others, or to himself\u2019 may take that person into custody and place him in a facility designated by the County for \u201c72-hour treatment and evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Dr. Charles McDaniel (\u201cMcDaniel\u201d), a medical resident, evaluated Wayman when he first arrived at the hospital. Wayman seemed agitated, and exhibited \u201cbizarre mannerisms\u201d and violent behavior. After McDaniel consulted with the supervising physician, Dr. Martin Mueller (\u201cMueller\u201d), they decided to admit Wayman as an involuntary patient for evaluation and treatment under \u00a7 5150. Wayman was subjected to four-point restraints, given psychotropic medication, and observed for 24 hours before being released.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Wayman brought this \u00a7 1983 action against the County, alleging that Harbor-UCLA wielded a \u201crubber stamp\u201d by accepting, without independently verifying, a police officer\u2019s determination that probable cause existed for detaining patients under \u00a7 5150 (\u201cRubber Stamp Policy\u201d). Way-man contended that this practice resulted in, and was deliberately indifferent towards, the unjustified, involuntary admission of thousands of patients, including himself, in violation of their First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments rights. The district court granted the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">II <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Ray v. Henderson, </em>217 F.3d 1234, 1239 (9th Cir.2000). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Wayman, we determine whether any genuine issues of material fact could support his \u00a7 1983 claim against the County, and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law. <em>Id. </em>at 1239-10. Wayman must introduce some \u201csignificant probative evidence\u201d tending to show the existence of the County\u2019s alleged Rubber Stamp Policy. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \u201cMere allegation and speculation\u201d will not suffice. <em>Nelson v. Pima Community College, </em>83 F.3d 1075, 1081 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">III <em>The County\u2019s Liability Under Section 1983</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\"><em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) and its progeny govern municipal liability actions under \u00a7 1983. Under this line of decisions a local government may be liable \u201conly where the municipality <em>itself </em>causes the constitutional violation.\u201d <em>City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 385, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). \u201c[Although the touchstone of the \u00a7 1983 action against a government body is an allegation that official policy\u201d deprives a plaintiffs constitutional rights, liability may also attach from local governmental custom \u201ceven though such custom has not received formal approval\u201d from the government\u2019s official policymakers. <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018. <em>See also Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, </em>885 F.2d 1439, 1443 (9th Cir.1989). Thus, a local government\u2019s policy of inaction constitutes grounds for suit where the failure \u201camounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons\u201d impacted by the inac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>tion. <em>City of Canton, </em>489 U.S. at 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197. <em>See also Oviatt v. Pearce, </em>954 F.2d 1470, 1474 (9th Cir.1992). A \u00a7 1983 plaintiff can prevail only by demonstrating that the alleged policy is so \u201cclosely related to the ultimate injury\u201d as to constitute the \u201cmoving force behind\u201d it. <em>City of Canton, </em>489 U.S. at 391, 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Wayman relies exclusively on the deposition testimony of Drs. Mueller and McDaniel to demonstrate the existence of the County\u2019s Rubber Stamp Policy. The most generous interpretation of their testimony suggests that Harbor-UCLA never rejects a \u00a7 5150 patient delivered by a police officer. Such evidence, however, is not probative of a County practice of failing to conduct an independent psychiatric evaluation prior to admitting a patient. Wayman provides no documentation or direct testimony suggesting the existence of the practice he purports to attack, nor any evidence concerning the admission and evaluation of the supposed thousands of other \u00a7 5150 patients who were similarly victimized. Indeed, Mueller testified that County doctors adhered to Harbor-UCLA\u2019s written policies which require independent examinations before a doctor may involuntarily admit a patient. Thus, Mueller\u2019s deposition testimony, which serves as the cornerstone of Wayman\u2019s complaint, flatly contradicts Wayman\u2019s assertion that doctors acted pursuant to a County Rubber Stamp Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Even assuming for argument\u2019s sake that Mueller and McDaniel did \u201crubber stamp\u201d \u00a7 5150 patients, the doctors\u2019 behavior would evidence, at most, culpable conduct by individuals rather than an established County policy as required for liability under <em>Monell </em>and <em>City of Canton. </em>In sum, Wayman offers no evidence that a County policy was the moving force behind his alleged injuries. The district court correctly granted summary judgment on Wayman\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b803-14\">.
