R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">This is a pro se state prisoner civil rights appeal. Mr. Lucero seeks damages and equitable relief for alleged violations of his First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, alleging that New Mexico state officials have violated state statutes by housing prisoners in private corrections facilities. Mr. Lucero also alleged that the law libraries in these facilities have been closed and that the mail is being censored. After reviewing Mr. Lucero\u2019s complaint, the district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), dismissed Mr. Lucero\u2019s complaint for failure to state a constitutional violation or to establish relevant actual injury. Mr. Lucero appealed to this court. The district court denied a timely-filed Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Mr. Lucero claims that he has been confined in a private facility under an illegal contract. This claim fails. \u201c[Sjtate and federal prisoners generally enjoy no constitutional right to placement in any particular penal institution.\u201d <em>Prows v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>981 F.2d 466, 468 n. 3 (10th Cir.1992). \u201c[T]he fact that an inmate ... must reside in[ ] a private prison[ ] simply does not raise a federal constitutional claim, though it may be raised procedurally under \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Rael v. Williams, </em>223 F.3d 1153, 1154 (10th Cir.2000); <em>see also Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 866 n. 4 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">Mr. Lucero also claims that Defendants denied him access to the courts by failing to provide a law library or legal assistance and allegedly censoring his mail. These claims require Mr. Lucero to \u201cestablish relevant actual injury.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). We agree with the district court that Mr. Lucero failed to established relevant actual injury in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">After a thorough review of Mr. Lucero\u2019s brief and the record, for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned May 11, 2001 Order, we hold that no relief is available to Mr. Lucero.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">Appellant\u2019s complaint is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">Appellant\u2019s motion to proceed without prepayment of the filing fee is GRANTED. We remind Appellant that he must continue making partial payments on court fees and costs previously assessed until such have been paid in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1025-32\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
