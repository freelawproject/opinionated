Centennial asserted that the False Claims Act case was based on information Becker discovered within the course and scope of his agency relationship with Centennial. We have previously granted the motion to submit this case for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-18\">Centennial contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because the evidence showed that there existed some genuine issues of fact, which would preclude the entry of summary judgment. It also argues that the court erred in granting summary judgment when Centennial had not been afforded full discovery. We agree with the district court that Centennial\u2019s asserted issues of fact are based on mere speculation. <em>See Ennis v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Bus. &amp; Educ. Radio, Inc., </em>53 F.3d 55, 62 (4th Cir.1995). Accordingly, after review of the materials in the Joint Appendices and the arguments presented in the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error, and therefore affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Centennial, L.L.C. v. Becker, </em>No. CA-97-1126-3-22 (D.S.C. Nov. 15, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
