R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b734-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-24\">Richard Eugene Flennory appeals his 151-month sentence imposed following a guilty plea conviction to bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-25\">Flennory contends that the district court erred in concluding that he was a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. We review de novo a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is a career offender. <em>See United States v. Casarez-Bravo, </em>181 F.3d 1074, 1076 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-26\">Flennory first contends that the district court erred by qualifying his 1993 Washington conviction for delivery of marijuana as a predicate conviction because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>even though it constitutes a felony under Washington law, it should be treated as a misdemeanor pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844, as his state offense allegedly involved a small amount marijuana for no remuneration. We disagree for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The language of section 4B1.2 expressly states that \u201c[t]he term \u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 means an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the ... distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Flennory was convicted of delivery of marijuana in state court and sentenced to 17 months imprisonment. We therefore conclude that the district court correctly decided that Flennory\u2019s 1993 conviction qualities as a predicate felony conviction because \u201c[a] prior felony conviction used to establish career offender status may stem from an offense under state law, so long as the offense is punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d <em>United States v. Gallegos-Gonzalez, </em>3 F.3d 325, 329 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Flennory further contends that the district court erred in qualifying his 1988 California conviction for attempted robbery as a predicate conviction, because the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the conviction is crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>81 F.3d 900, 903 (9th Cir.1996). Because Flennory failed to raise this objection before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>258 F.3d 1120, 1124 (9th Cir.2001). Here too, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s determination that Flennory\u2019s 1988 conviction is a predicate conviction pursuant to U.S .S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 was not plain error because the language of California Penal Code \u00a7 211 (\u201cRobbery\u201d) and \u00a7 664 (\u201cAttempts\u201d) clearly establishes that Flennory\u2019s conduct constituted a crime of violence. <em>See Jimenez, </em>258 F.3d at 1126-27 (stating that the district court\u2019s reliance upon a presentence report that contained no reference to the statute of conviction did not prejudice defendant\u2019s substantial rights because conduct in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 273.5 (\u2018Willful Infliction of Corporal Punishment\u201d) constituted an aggravated felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b734-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
