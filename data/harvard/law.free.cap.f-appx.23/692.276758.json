We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, <em>Hicks v. Small, </em>69 F.3d 967, 969 (9th Cir.1995), and for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend, <em>Griggs v. Pace Am. Group, Inc., </em>170 F.3d 877, 879 (9th Cir.1999). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-21\">The district court did not err by dismissing Byers\u2019 first amended complaint because it included only vague and conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>sory allegations, and did not set forth a legal basis for Byers\u2019 claims or federal court jurisdiction. <em>See Ivey v. Bd. of Regents, </em>673 F.2d 266, 268 (9th Cir.1982) (upholding dismissal of a complaint consisting of vague and conclusory allegations); <em>Legg v. United States, </em>353 F.2d 534, 535 (9th Cir.1965) (per curiam) (holding that federal court lacked jurisdiction over ambiguous, uncertain and verbose complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Byers\u2019 motion to amend because Byers\u2019 proposed second amended complaint did not cure the defects of his first amended complaint. <em>See Ivey, </em>673 F.2d at 268; <em>Legg, </em>353 F.2d at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Byers\u2019 contention of judicial bias is without merit because it is based solely on his disagreement with the district judge\u2019s decision. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 554-55, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b725-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
