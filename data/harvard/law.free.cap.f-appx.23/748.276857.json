Medina failed to link his persecutors to the Peruvian government. <em>See Canas-Segovia v. INS, </em>970 F.2d 599, 601 (9th Cir.1992). It was equally likely that Medina was being threatened as a result of an ongoing business feud with his uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-24\">Since Medina failed to show that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a political opinion, \u201cwe [ ] need to proceed no further because <em>a fortiori\u201d, </em>Medina fails to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>DeValle v.
