We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>see Margolis v. Ryan, </em>140 F.3d 850, 852 (9th Cir.1998), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-24\">Contrary to Rugamba\u2019s contention, the district court properly granted summary judgment on his perjury claim because a civil action for damages arising from false testimony or perjury is not recognized in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>California. <em>See Agnew v. Parks, </em>172 Cal.App.2d 756, 343 P.2d 118, 124 (Cal.Dist.Ct.App.1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Because Rugamba failed to comply with the district court\u2019s service deficiency notice, the district court did not abuse its discretion by not issuing a summons and complaint. <em>See Walker v. Sumner, </em>14 F.3d 1415, 1422 (9th Cir.1994). Furthermore, the district court\u2019s grant of defendant Hunt\u2019s motion for leave to amend its answer was proper. <em>See Texaco, Inc. v. Ponsoldt, </em>939 F.2d 794, 798-99 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Summary judgment was proper because Rugamba failed to present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to any of his claims. <em>See Wallis v. Simplot, </em>26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b885-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
