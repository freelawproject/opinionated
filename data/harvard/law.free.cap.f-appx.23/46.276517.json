Covello, <em>Chief Judge, </em>awarding Greenfield $906,675 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $20,000 in expenses, and awarding class trial counsel Brenner, Saltzman &amp; Wall-man (\u201cBSW\u201d) $906,184.96 in fees and $19,550.08 in expenses out of a $7.7 million fund for the plaintiff class, generated by the settlement of the action after four days of trial; Silverberg and Greenfield also appeal from orders of the district court denying their postjudgment motions for increased awards. On appeal, Greenfield contends that he was entitled to a significantly larger fee than that awarded to BSW; that BSW was overcompensated; and that he was entitled to reimbursement for expenses in the amount of $116,983.97; Silverberg contends that he was entitled to an \u201cincentive award\u201d as the class representative. Finding no basis for reversal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-18\">Fees awarded in common-fund eases must be reasonable. <em>See, e.g., Goldberger v. Integrated Resources, Inc., </em>209 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir.2000). \u2018What constitutes a reasonable fee is properly committed to the sound discretion of the district court,\u201d which is \u201cintimately familiar with the nuances of the case\u201d and is in a better position than an appellate court to evaluate the reasonableness of a fee request. <em>Id. </em>at 47-48; <em>see, e.g., In re \u201cAgent Orange\u201d Product Liability Litigation, </em>818 F.2d 226, 237-40 (2d Cir.1987). The district court\u2019s fee decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 237; <em>Goldberger v. Integrated Resources, Inc., </em>209 F.3d at 47. Similarly, to be reimbursable from the common fund, the attorney\u2019s expenses must be \u201creasonable in amount, [and] necessary to bring the action to a climax.\u201d <em>In re Fidelity/Micron Securities Litigation, </em>167 F.3d 735, 737 (1st Cir.1999); <em>see, e.g., In re \u201cAgent Orange\u201d Product Liability Litigation, </em>818 F.2d at 238. The district court\u2019s decision as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>what expenses were reasonable and necessary, and hence should be reimbursed out of settlement funds, will not be overturned except for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>The abuse-of-discretion standard of review also applies to the grant or denial of incentive awards for class representatives. <em>See, e.g., Montgomery v. Aetna Plywood, Inc., </em>231 F.3d 399, 408 (7th Cir.2000), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 2000, 149 L.Ed.2d 1003 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">We see no abuse of discretion in the decisions challenged here. We reject appellants\u2019 contentions that Greenfield was entitled to a higher fee award and that BSW should have been awarded less. From the $7.7 million settlement fund, the district court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses totaling some $2,509,717, or nearly one-third of the fund. The district court employed the lodestar method in calculating the base fees to be awarded Greenfield and BSW, respectively, and we see no error in those calculations. Nor can we see any basis for overturning the court\u2019s conclusions (a) that BSW, though it had served only as local counsel until some five months prior to trial, was entitled to a multiplier in light of, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cbrillian[ce]\u201d of BSW partner David R. Schaefer\u2019s performance at trial, and (b) that no multiplier was warranted for Greenfield in light of his pre-BSW stewardship of the lawsuit for \u201cnine years of litigation and multiple settlement conferences\u201d during which the opposing parties and counsel were \u201cbarely speaking to one another\u201d and defendants\u2019 settlement offers did not remotely approach the ultimately agreed amount. Ruling on Application for Attorneys\u2019 Fees, dated March 14, 2000, at 5. Although appellants state that the district court erred in believing that defendants\u2019 highest pretrial offer was $1 million when in fact it was $1.95 million, that difference is insignificant in light of the $7.7 million for which the case was settled after the entry and performance of BSW as trial counsel. We see no basis for overturning the assessments by Chief Judge Covello, who presided over the final years of the litigation, of the two firms\u2019 relative contributions and his conclusion that BSW played the \u201cpivotal role,\u201d both at trial and \u201cin the ultimate settlement of this case,\u201d <em>id.; see also id. </em>at 6 (defendants\u2019 agreement to settle for $7.7 million was \u201ca direct result of Schaefer\u2019s efforts at the trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Similarly, the district court was in the best position to evaluate the contributions made by Silverberg to the litigation, and we see no basis for overturning its assessment that those contributions \u201cd[id] not rise to the level of special circumstances warranting an incentive award,\u201d Order dated December 22, 2000, at 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by Greenfield\u2019s argument that the court erred in limiting his reimbursement for expenses, other than fees for experts, to $20,000, rather than granting the $116,983.97 he claimed. The burden was on Greenfield to persuade the court that the expenses were reasonably incurred. The court pointed out that Greenfield merely listed the amounts and dates of each claimed expense, with a one-to-three-word description of each, and \u201cdid not provide any other invoices, receipts or further explanation of how or why these other expenses were incurred, or why they were necessary to the litigation.\u201d Order dated December 22, 2000, at 1. Greenfield does not dispute this finding on appeal. Rather, he asserts that his expense request comported with \u201cestablished procedure\u201d \u201cin Connecticut\u201d (Appellants\u2019 brief on appeal at 27), and that he should have been warned of the need to substantiate his claim of $116,983.97. But he cites no authority to support his view of \u201cestablished procedure.\u201d And although Greenfield indicates that he was unaware that he would be required to support each claimed item <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>of expense with more than one-to-three words of explanation, the principles (a) that, to be reimbursable, a given expense must be reasonable and necessary, and (b) that the burden of showing entitlement to an award is on the person seeking the award, are hardly novel. We see no unfairness in holding Greenfield to the usual standards and no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s conclusion that he did not carry his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We have considered all of appellants\u2019 contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment and orders of the district court are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
