Having thoroughly reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Crane violated the three conditions of her supervised release. Further, the court did not abuse its discretion by revoking Crane\u2019s supervised release term and imposing another term of imprisonment. The arguments that Crane makes to the contrary are either waived because she did not raise them below or patently meritless. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Maxwell, </em>254 F.3d 21, 25-30 (1st Cir.2001). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed. See </em>Local Rule 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
