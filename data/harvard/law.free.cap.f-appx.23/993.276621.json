R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-16\">Injured in a workplace accident, plaintiff Roger Woods sought and obtained permanent disability benefits under a benefit plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U .S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461. As a result of a routine review of his file, the plan administrator terminated his benefits, finding that his injury did not prevent him from securing what the terms of the plan define as \u201cgainful employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-17\">After an unsuccessful administrative appeal, Woods filed suit in federal district court, alleging that the termination of his benefits violated ERISA. The district court granted summary judgment against him. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-20\">The parties are familiar with the additional facts comprising and framing this dispute, so we need not repeat them here. Having carefully reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the record on appeal, as well as the law governing this ERISA claim, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court for substantially the same reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s order dated November 30, 2000.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1025-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
