Nov.8, 1999). The relevant provisions are included in a set of regulations, <em>see </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 745.100-745.119, issued pursuant to several statutes that are intended to prevent human exposure to toxic substances. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601-2692, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4851-4852d.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-21\">Mr. Yee subsequently received a hearing before an administrative law judge, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>upheld the assessment of the penalty. <em>See In the Matter of Billy Yee, </em>2000 WL 777973 (E.P.A. A.L.J. June 6, 2000). The EPA appeals board affirmed the order of the administrative law judge. <em>See In re Billy Yee, </em>2001 WL 624774 (E.P.A. May 29, 2001). Mr. Yee now petitions for judicial review. We lack jurisdiction to consider Mr. Yee\u2019s petition and therefore dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">A petition for judicial review of an assessment under the relevant statutes may be filed \u201conly ... within the 30-day period beginning on the date [when] the order making such an assessment was issued,\u201d <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a)(3). The EPA order was issued on May 29, 2001. The final day to file a petition for review, consequently, was June 27, 2001. Mr. Yee filed his petition on June 28, 2001, and has cited no authority that would relieve him of his obligation to comply with the statutory deadline. We therefore dismiss Mr. Yee\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
