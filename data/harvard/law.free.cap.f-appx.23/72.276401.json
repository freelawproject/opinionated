Jeffreys appeals from an order denying his third motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s March 2000 dismissal of his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We review the denial of Jeffreys\u2019 motion, which was made pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), for abuse of discretion. <em>Israel v. Carpenter, </em>120 F.3d 361, 365 (2d Cir.1997). Because the claim raised in Jeffreys\u2019 most recent motion\u2014 the alleged incapacity of the Commission\u2019s counsel to represent the State of Connecticut \u2014 is irrelevant to the basis on which the district court dismissed Jeffrey\u2019s complaint and the motion was a patent attempt to evade the jurisdictional time limit for filing a notice of appeal, the district court did not abuse its discretion. We therefore affirm the district court and deny as moot Jeffreys\u2019 motion objecting to the defendants\u2019 response.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
