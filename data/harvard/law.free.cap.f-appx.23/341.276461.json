The court sent a letter to the parties inquiring why the ease should not be heard without oral argument, and neither party responded. This panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-23\">Wilson filed an application for benefits alleging that he suffered from diabetes, hydrocephalus, disc problems in his neck, and weakness in his arms, hands, and legs. Following a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that Wilson was not disabled because he could perform a substantial number of jobs in the economy. The Appeals Council declined to review the ALJ\u2019s determination. Wilson then filed a complaint challenging the Commissioner\u2019s decision. A magistrate judge, hearing the case with the consent of the parties, granted judgment for the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-24\">Upon review, we conclude that substantial evidence exists to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>See Brainard v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>889 F.2d 679, 681 (6th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-25\">Wilson argues that the Commissioner erred in rejecting the opinions of his treating physicians and giving greater weight to the opinions of non-examining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>physicians. It is true that the opinion of a non-examining physician is entitled to little weight if it is contrary to the opinion of the claimant\u2019s treating physicians. <em>Shelman v. Heckler, </em>821 F.2d 316, 321 (6th Cir.1987). However, the treating physician\u2019s opinion is entitled to controlling weight only when the medical opinion is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record. <em>Walters v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>127 F.3d 525, 530 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In Wilson\u2019s case, all three treating physicians expressed their opinions that Wilson was disabled in the context of his previous position as a bricklayer, a position involving heavy labor. In contrast, the non-examining physicians\u2019 opinions concerned Wilson\u2019s residual functional capacity to do lighter work. The treating physician\u2019s opinions were inconsistent with the substantial evidence in the record that Wilson could perform, with a few additional limitations, at the light work level.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Wilson also argues that the magistrate judge and the district court erred in failing to specifically address Wilson\u2019s hand restrictions. The loss of manipulative ability or capacity is a nonexertional limitation. <em>Hurt v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>816 F.2d 1141, 1143 (6th Cir.1987) (per curiam). When nonexertional impairments are present, the ALJ must make a specific finding regarding whether the limitations are sufficiently severe to preclude a full range of employment under the guidelines. <em>Cole v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>820 F.2d 768, 771-72 (6th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Contrary to Wilson\u2019s argument, the district court did address the issue and concluded that Dr. Wolfe\u2019s description of Wilson\u2019s grip as \u201cmoderate\u201d was sufficient to show no significant manual limitations. While the ALJ did not recite the phrase \u201cmanipulative abilities,\u201d the ALJ did recite Dr. Wolfe\u2019s findings concerning Wilson\u2019s hand restrictions. The ALJ then listed Wilson\u2019s residual functional capacity, including the ability to perform work with some pushing and pulling of arm controls. So the ALJ clearly did consider the issue and did conclude that the limitations were not sufficiently severe to prevent Wilson from performing at the light work level.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
