The case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Shephard sued United States District Court Judge Algenon Marbley, Clerk of Court Kenneth J. Murphy, and Deputy Clerk Jim Hencye, alleging that the defendants are prejudiced against him and denied him forms required for prosecution of his cases. Shephard also alleged a variety of constitutional violations arising out of his conditions of confinement. The district court denied Shephard in forma pauperis status and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. Shephard has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly denied Shephard pauper status and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. This court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of pauper status for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gibson v. R.G. Smith Co., </em>915 F.2d 260, 261 (6th Cir.1990). The district court dismissed Shephard\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), the so-called \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">The district court properly determined that Shephard was not entitled to pauper status under \u00a7 1915(g). The court concluded that Shephard has filed three or more lawsuits which were dismissed because they were frivolous or failed to state a claim, and Shephard does not challenge the court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 1915(g) applies to him. Further, Shephard has not established that he falls within the \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d exception to \u00a7 1915(g). While Shephard alleged in a conclusory manner that he received threats and mistreatment at the hands of other inmates and prison staff, he does not allege any immediate or specific danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Accordingly, this court affirms the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We also note that Shephard is a frequent and abusive litigant in this court and the district court. In November 1999, the court for the Southern District of Ohio commented that Shephard had filed over 50 lawsuits since 1993, and the court determined that his \u201cconduct constitutes a persistent campaign of harassment of this Court and its personnel by the filing of frivolous litigation.\u201d Consequently, the court revoked Shephard\u2019s pauper status and directed the Clerk to not file any papers tendered by Shephard, unless he received prior judicial authorization. <em>In re: Alonzo Dean Shephard, </em>No. MC-3-99-025 (S.D.Ohio Nov. 1, 1999) (Rice, C.J.). We encourage the district court in the future to follow this procedure before processing Shephard\u2019s cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Further, we have determined that this court must take additional injunctive action against Shephard because, despite the district court\u2019s November 1999 order, Shephard continues to pursue frivolous and vexatious litigation. A review of this court\u2019s docket reveals that, since the time of the district court\u2019s order, Shephard has filed eight separate appeals with this court, many of which subsequently were dismissed for want of prosecution. In an effort to stem this tide of litigation, this court enjoins Shephard from filing further appeals, without first satisfying the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). While this court cannot absolutely foreclose an individual from initiating an action or pursuing an appeal in federal court, <em>Ortman v. Thomas, </em>99 F.3d 807, 811 (6th Cir.1996), the court may impose prefiling restrictions on an individual with a history of repetitive or vexatious litigation. <em>Feathers v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>141 F.3d 264, 269 (6th Cir.1998); <em>Ortman, </em>99 F.3d at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Therefore, the court finds that, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), Shephard is precluded from pursuing any further civil action or appeal in forma pauperis, unless he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d In order to comply with this requirement, Shephard shall file with this court for any future appeal a pleading entitled \u201cApplication Pursuant to Court Order Seeking Leave to Proceed In Forma Pauperis under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).\u201d This application must be filed within ten days after Shephard files a notice of appeal. The application shall: 1) contain specific factual allegations demonstrating that Shephard is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury;\u201d and 2) describe the relationship between the alleged danger and the claims contained in the underlying complaint. Failure to submit this application or to comply strictly with the terms of this injunction will result in summary dismissal of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Upon timely receipt of a complete application, the clerk of the Sixth Circuit shall direct the clerk of the appropriate district court to transmit the record of the underlying case. No further proceedings shall take place in this court, nor shall any other filings be accepted, until this court has reviewed the application and the record to determine whether Shephard meets the requirements of \u00a7 1915(g). If this court concludes that the application fails to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1915(g), the court will deny Shephard pauper status or revoke his pauper status.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">This procedure shall govern any appeals in this court filed by Shephard until such time as the court may order otherwise.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
