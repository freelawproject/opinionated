He appeals his sentence, alleging that the district court erred in counting his juvenile adjudications in his criminal history score under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2) (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-22\">On appeal Kelley argues, as he did at his sentencing hearing, that the Sentencing Commission exceeded its mandate and acted irrationally when it promulgated USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2), which he contends violates the Equal Protection Clause. Legal interpretations of the guidelines are reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Daughtrey, 874 </em>F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989); <em>see also United States v. Blake, </em>81 F.3d 498, 503 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-23\">Guideline section 4A1.2(d)(2)(A) provides that, for offenses committed before age eighteen, two criminal history points are added under \u00a7 4A1.1(b) for each adult or juvenile sentence to confinement of at least sixty days if the defendant was released from confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense. Kelley argues that \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2) is unconstitutional because it automatically treats juvenile adjudications like adult sentences for criminal history purposes, although the juvenile justice system is based on principles and goals that are different from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>adult justice system. He further contends that \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2) violates equal protection in that juvenile adjudications are treated differently from military, foreign, or tribal sentences and civil adjudications. He also notes that incarcerations for treatment, such as insanity or mental disability, are not automatically counted for criminal history purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The sentencing guidelines as a whole have been held to be constitutional, <em>Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 412, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989), and no court has held \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2) to be invalid.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This Court has rejected a due process challenge to \u00a7 4A1.2(d) in <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>929 F.2d 128, 130 (4th Cir.1991) (holding that defendant cannot raise due process challenge to use of juvenile adjudications for offenses committed after effective date of sentencing guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\"><em> United States v.

Booten, </em>914 F.2d 1352, 1354-55 (9th Cir. 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
