This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Haag sued the Village of Camden, Ohio; the Village of Camden Police Department; and Police Chief Paul Plaugher for compensatory and punitive damages. He alleged that the defendants wrongfully arrested him and improperly investigated his case when they charged him with rape and corrupting another with drugs. Haag was arrested in April 1998, acquitted in September 1998, and filed suit in September 2000. The defendants moved to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that Haag\u2019s claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The district court agreed and dismissed Haag's complaint as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">In his timely appeal, Haag argues that his claim accrued when he was acquitted of the criminal charges. He has also moved for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a suit pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See Bloch v. Ribar, </em>156 F.3d 673, 677 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Haag\u2019s complaint as barred by the statute of limitations. Haag filed his suit more than two years after his claim accrued and no tolling provision applied to render the complaint timely. <em>See </em>Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2305.10; <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 276, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985); <em>Kuhnle Bros., Inc. v. County of Geauga, </em>103 F.3d 516, 519 (6th Cir.1997). Haag\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim of an alleged wrongful arrest accrued at the time of his arrest in April 1998. <em>See McCune v. City of Grand Rapids, </em>842 F.2d 903, 906 (6th Cir.1988). Effective January 13, 1991, Ohio law no longer tolls the statute of limitations because of a plaintiffs imprisonment. Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2305.16. The tolling provision Haag invoked, \u00a7 2305.15(b), tolls the statute of limitations for actions brought against, not by, prisoners. Thus, Haag\u2019s September 2000 complaint was untimely. <em>See </em>Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2305.10; <em>Kuhnle Bros., Inc., </em>103 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">Haag\u2019s argument that his claim did not accrue until after he was acquitted of the charges against him is without merit. First, it is well-established that a \u00a7 1983 claim for wrongful arrest accrues at the time of the arrest. <em>McCune, </em>842 F.2d at 906. Second, Haag conceded that his claim accrued in April 1998 when he filed his response to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and cannot take an inconsistent position on appeal. <em>See Marx v. Loral Corp., </em>87 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">Accepting all of Haag\u2019s factual allegations as true, he can prove no set of facts in support of his claims that would entitle him to relief. <em>See Sistrunk v. City of Strongsville, </em>99 F.3d 194, 197 (6th Cir.1996). For the foregoing reasons, we deny Haag\u2019s motion for counsel and affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
