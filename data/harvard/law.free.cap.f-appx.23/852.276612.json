Spargo\u2019s claim is that, because of the large amounts of drugs with which he was caught, he should have been sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and therefore not subject to a period of special parole. However, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>section does not cover Schedule II controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Spargo\u2019s crime involved methamphetamine. Because methamphetamine is a Schedule II controlled substance, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802(9), 802(17), Spargo is subject to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), which provides sentences for violations of \u00a7 841(a) involving other Schedule I or II controlled substances, or smaller quantities of narcotic drugs such as cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Among the penalties permitted by the statute under this section is special parole. Accordingly, Spargo was properly sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). <em>See United States v. Gozlon-Peretz, </em>498 U.S. 395, 399-400, 111 S.Ct. 840, 112 L.Ed.2d 919 (1991) (\u201cPersons convicted of crimes involving lesser amounts of narcotic and non-narcotic substances remained subject to the penalties applicable to offenses committed before the 1984 amendments, including special parole. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) and (C).\u201d). Because the statute provides for no upper limit on the period of special parole, a period of five years is not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>877 F.2d 23, 25 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b884-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
