The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-20\">Defendant Christopher Kovac entered a plea of guilty on charges of attempted manufacture of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>court sentenced Kovac to 136 months in prison, applying a total offense level of 31 and a Criminal History Category of II under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cUSSG\u201d). Kovac appeals his sentence, claiming that the district court erroneously (1) denied his motion to compel the Government to file a substantial assistance motion under USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), (2) imposed a two-level enhancement for the possession of a dangerous weapon under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), and (3) refused Kovac\u2019s request for a horizontal downward criminal history departure under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3. We exercise jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">On February 18, 1999, the DEA\u2019s Clandestine Lab Enforcement Team, led by Officer Ralph Sorrell, executed a search warrant at Kovac\u2019s home and. found a methamphetamine lab. The lab was located primarily in the kitchen area of Kovac\u2019s residence, but there were also three or four anhydrous ammonia tanks found in a basement bunker and in the detached garage. Kovac admitted that the lab was his and that he was using anhydrous ammonia to manufacture methamphetamine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Prior to the search, Officer Sorrell asked Kovac if there were any weapons in the home and Kovac admitted that there was an explosive device or \u201cbomb\u201d in the attic. The attic of Kovac\u2019s residence was divided into two rooms, a bedroom and a storage area. The entrance to the storage area was through the bedroom, via a door located just to the left of the bed. The bomb was found just inside this door, about one step away from the bed. Kovac claimed that the bomb was manufactured by a friend who intended to throw it into someone\u2019s car; but he later changed his story, stating that the friend intended to throw the bomb into a house.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">There was a bottle of rifle reloading powder next to the bomb. When questioned by Officer Sorrell, Kovac admitted that the reloading powder was his, claiming \u201cthat he was going to do some reloading but never got around to it.\u201d Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 27, R. Vol. II, Doc. 52. Officer Sorrell testified that after he pointed out that the reloading powder was the same kind used in the bomb, Kovac \u201ckind of hung his head for a second and said that [his friend] had saw [sic] him with that [sic] and had borrowed it from him to make this explosive device.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. During the search the officers also found a \u201ctrip-light\u201d system that was apparently designed to let occupants know when someone was approaching the front of the house. On the outside of the house there was a motion sensor or an electric eye that was triggered if anyone approached. This motion sensor was connected to a spotlight in the attic bedroom that would turn on and shine directly on the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">Kovac was arrested and charged in a seven-count Indictment alleging various drug and firearm offenses. On May 15, 2000, Kovac pled guilty on two counts, including the attempted manufacture of more than 50 grams of methamphetamine (Count 2). The parties entered into a plea agreement stating, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-13\">The government agrees to advise the sentencing court prior to sentencing of the nature and extent of the cooperation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>in this or other investigations provided by this defendant. <em>If, in the sole opinion of the United States Attorney\u2019s office, the defendant\u2019s cooperation amounts to substantial assistance, the government will file a motion, pursuant to Section 5K1.1 Sentencing Guidelines [sic] and Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(e), to depart downward from the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Plea Agreement at H 2(e), Ex. A to Def.\u2019s Pet. to Enter Plea of Guilty and Order Entering Plea, R. Vol. I, Doc. 24 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Thereafter, Officer Sorrell interviewed Kovac, in the presence of his attorney, at the Corrections Corporation of America facility at Leavenworth Kansas, in an effort to determine whether he could provide substantial assistance. Lawyers in the United States Attorneys Office then conferred with Officer Sorrell about the interview and reviewed the statement provided by Kovac. After doing so, the United States Attorneys Office determined that the information provided by Kovac was neither new nor useful to the Government. That office also took into account Officer Sorrell\u2019s statements that he did not believe that Kovac was entirely truthful during the interview, specifically referring to Kovac\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for the bomb. Based on the information obtained from Officer Sorrell\u2019s interview with Kovac, the United States Attorneys Office determined that a substantial assistance motion was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Kovac\u2019s sentencing hearing started on October 2, 2000, but was continued until October 11, 2000. During the October 2 portion of the hearing, Kovac\u2019s attorney attempted to question Officer Sorrell about his meeting with Kovac and whether Kovac provided substantial assistance. The Government objected, asserting that such questioning was irrelevant because the Government had not filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, having determined that such a motion was unwarranted. The district court agreed and sustained the Government\u2019s objection. When the sentencing hearing resumed on October 11, however, Kovac submitted a motion to compel the Government to file a substantial assistance motion, claiming that the Government\u2019s refusal constituted bad faith, in violation of the plea agreement. Def.\u2019s Suggestions in Supp. of Req. to Compel Gov\u2019t to File \u00a7 5K1.1 Mot. at 3, R. Vol. I, Doc. 41. The district court denied Kovac\u2019s motion, finding that \u201cthe Government has complied with that part of the agreement and there\u2019s no showing of bad faith based on the evidence that was presented to the court.\u201d Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">In sentencing Kovac, the district court applied a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), finding that Kovac possessed a dangerous weapon (i.e., the bomb) in connection with his illegal drug manufacturing activities. Kovac objected to this enhancement, asserting that it was clearly improbable that the bomb was connected with the offense. Def.\u2019s Sentencing Mem. at 1, R. Vol. I, Doc. 30 (citing USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, Comment (n.3)). In response to Kovac\u2019s objection, the Government called Officer Sorrell to testify at the sentencing hearing. Officer Sorrell testified that he considered the bomb to be a dangerous weapon, and that based on his experience in investigating over 300 methamphetamine lab cases the bomb was possessed in connection with Kovac\u2019s illegal drug manufacturing operation. Specifically, Officer Sorrell concluded that together with the warning devices found on the premises, the bomb was apparently intended as a means of destroying evidence in the event a police raid on the lab appeared imminent. Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 30-33. The district court overruled Kovac\u2019s objection and applied the two-level enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 104-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>Finally, Kovac objected to the Presentence Investigation Report\u2019s (\u201cPSR\u201d) \u201ccriminal history\u201d calculation, which assessed three criminal history points and placed him within Category II of the Sentencing Table, rather than Category I. The PSR assessed two criminal history points for Kovac\u2019s February 8, 1990, conviction for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, Transporting an Open Container and Providing False Information to a Law Enforcement Officer, and one criminal history point based on Kovac\u2019s June 15, 1992, conviction for Disorderly Conduct. PSR at 8-12. Kovac argued that the PSR overrepresented his criminal history by considering the 1990 conviction, which was almost ten years old at the time he committed the offenses in this case, and sought a horizontal downward departure under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3. Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 10-11. Although the district court did not specifically discuss Kovac\u2019s objection to the PSR\u2019s criminal history recommendation during its ruling at the sentencing hearing, it heard argument on this objection and expressly accepted the PSR\u2019s calculations, sentencing Kovac in accordance with Category II of the Sentencing Table. Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 119; Judgment in a Criminal Case at 8, R. Vol. I, Doc. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">In general, \u201c[w]e review the district court\u2019s legal interpretation and application of the guidelines de novo and review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, giving due deference to the court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Henry, </em>164 F.3d 1304, 1310 (10th Cir.1999). Under this standard, \u201cwe will <em>not </em>reverse the district court unless the court\u2019s finding was without factual support in the record, or if after reviewing all the evidence we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>United States v. Beaulieu, </em>893 F.2d 1177, 1182 (10th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">A. <em>Substantial Assistance Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Kovac\u2019s first contention on appeal is that the district court improperly denied his motion to compel the Government to file a substantial assistance motion under USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). As indicated above, Kovac contends that the Government violated its obligation under the plea agreement because its \u201crefusal to file a 5K motion [was] in bad faith or ... irrational.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines permits a sentencing court to depart downward from the applicable guideline range \u201c[u]pon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) similarly allows a district court, upon a motion by the government, \u201cto impose a sentence below a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">Under both \u00a7 5K1.1 and \u00a7 3553(e), \u201c[t]he government\u2019s motion is \u2018an unequivocal condition precedent ... to a downward departure by the district court, limiting the court\u2019s authority and giving the government \u2018a power, not a duty, to file a [\u00a7 5K1.1] motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cerrato-Reyes, </em>176 F.3d 1253, 1264 (10th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Lee, </em>989 F.2d 377, 379 (10th Cir.1993) and <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>A prosecutor is granted the sole discretion to decide whether or not to file a substantial assistance motion on the defendant\u2019s behalf. <em>United States v. Courtois, </em>131 F.3d 937, 938 (10th Cir.1997). <em>See also United States v. Massey, </em>997 F.2d 823, 824 (10th Cir.1993) (\u201cCongress wisely or unwisely left the matter of substantial assistance to the prosecutor\u201d). With few exceptions, the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of such discretion is not subject to review by the district courts. <em>Courtois, </em>131 F.3d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">One exception allows a district court to review the government\u2019s discretionary refusal to file a substantial assistance motion if the defendant makes a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d that such refusal was unconstitutional, either because it was based on an unconstitutional motive, such as the defendant\u2019s race or religion, or because it was not rationally related to any legitimate governmental objective. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840. <em>See also United States v. Duncan, </em>242 F.3d 940, 947 (10th Cir.2001). In the proceedings below, Kovac did not assert any constitutional challenges to the Government\u2019s discretionary refusal to file a substantial assistance motion on his behalf, and thus we do not consider the applicability \"of this exception on this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Another exception allows the district court to step in \u201cif \u2018the refusal violates an agreement with the government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cerrato-Reyes, </em>176 F.3d at 1264 (quoting <em>Lee, </em>989 F.2d at 379)). It is this exception which Kovac invokes.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">The question of whether or not the government has breached a plea agreement is a question of law which we review <em>de novo. Courtois, </em>131 F.3d at 938. Without question, the plea agreement here does not expressly obligate the Government to file a substantial assistance motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, Kovac does not assert that the Government was expressly obligated to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>substantial assistance motion on his behalf under the plea agreement. Both below and on appeal, Kovac asserts only that by entering into the plea agreement, a contract, the Government implicitly agreed to act in good faith, limiting its discretion and subjecting its decision-making process to review for \u201cbad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">We recognize that as a general rule of contract law there is an implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing in all contracts. <em>See Concrete Spec. v. H.C. Smith Constr. Co., </em>423 F.2d 670, 672 (10th Cir.1970) (citing 5 S. Williston, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 670, at 159 (3rd ed.1961)). We also recognize the general rule that plea agreements are to be enforced and construed in accordance with traditional contract principles. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>237 F.3d 1258, 1260-61 (10th Cir.2001). Nonetheless, there is a split of authority among the federal circuits regarding whether or not the government\u2019s discretionary refusal to file a substantial assistance motion can be reviewed for bad faith under plea agreements which expressly grant the government sole discretion over a defendant\u2019s entitlement to such a motion. The majority of the federal circuits addressing the issue reject a district court\u2019s review of the prosecutor\u2019s discretionary refusal of a substantial assistance motion for bad faith in such cases,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> while a minority hold that the implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing applies to such plea agreements, allowing the district court to review a prosecutor\u2019s discretionary refusal for bad faith.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">Similarly, the decisions within this circuit are not consistent. Some cases hold that \u201cthe district court\u2019s role is limited to deciding whether the government has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>made its determination [not to file the motion] in good faith.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas, </em>925 F.2d 1260, 1266 (10th Cir.1991).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Other cases hold that where the government retains its sole discretion under the express terms of the plea agreement it retains the powers otherwise granted it under \u00a7 5K1.1 and \u00a7 3553(e), and thus its discretionary refusal to file a motion is reviewable only for constitutional error, as articulated in <em>Wade. See United States v. Hawley, </em>93 F.3d 682, 691 (10th Cir.1996) (holding that where plea agreement leaves decision within the \u201csole and exclusive discretion\u201d of the government defendant must demonstrate that government acted with unconstitutional motive and court lacks jurisdiction to review government\u2019s decision where unconstitutional motives have not been aheged, or the defendant has made only \u201cgeneralized allegations of improper motive\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Because we beheve that the latter view more accurately reflects the policies announced in <em>Wade </em>limiting our intrusion into prosecutorial discretion over substantial assistance motions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as well as the policies and principles announced in other Supreme Court decisions generally limiting our intrusion into a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we adopt that view and hold that where a plea agreement expressly grants the government sole discretion over the filing of a substantial assistance motion, a prosecutor\u2019s discretionary refusal to file such a motion may not be reviewed for bad faith. Such plea agreements merely reaffirm the power otherwise granted the prosecutor under \u00a7 5K1.1 and \u00a7 3553(e); they do not give defendants any greater rights, nor do they give the courts a greater power of review. Based on the fact that Kovac challenged the Government\u2019s discretionary refusal to file the substantial assistance motion below solely on the grounds of alleged bad faith, his claim is not subject to any further review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Even assuming <em>arguendo, </em>however, that the Government\u2019s discretionary refusal could be reviewed for bad faith under traditional contract principles, we would still affirm the denial of Kovac\u2019s motion, and we would do so regardless of which standard apphes to such claims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Kovac essentially claims that because he met with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Officer Sorrell in Leavenworth, Kansas, and provided a statement, he necessarily-provided substantial assistance. He asserts that the government acted in bad faith, and abused its discretion, by refusing to file a substantial assistance motion on his behalf merely because they believed that the information he provided was not useful and they doubted his veracity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The district court found, however, that there was \u201cno showing of bad faith\u201d in this case, Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 110, and this finding is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Lee, </em>989 F.2d at 380 (stating that question of whether government acted in good faith is factual one reviewed for clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Keeping in mind that a district court must give \u201c[s]ubstantial weight ... to the government\u2019s evaluation of the extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance,\u201d USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, App. Note 3, a defendant challenging the government\u2019s discretionary refusal to file a substantial assistance motion on the basis of \u201cbad faith\u201d has a heavy burden, and must demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that the government acted in a patently unreasonable manner, entirely disregarding the assistance provided with the intent of purposely denying him or her the benefit of the substantial assistance motion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Kovac did not meet this burden. His claims, both below and on appeal, amount to nothing more than blanket assertions and conelusory allegations that the Government acted inappropriately without any evidence whatsoever of illicit motive or an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>discretion by the United States Attorneys Office. We are not persuaded by Kovac\u2019s baseless allegations of bad faith and thus, even if the Government\u2019s discretionary refusal could be reviewed for bad faith, we would still affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">\n<em>B. Dangerous Weapon Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ArHq\">Kovac\u2019s second contention on appeal is that \u201che should not have been assessed a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) of the Guidelines for possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with a drug offense because it was clearly improbable that the weapon in question [i.e., the bomb] was connected with the offense.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. at 6. The district court found that the Government sufficiently proved that Kovac possessed the bomb during the commission of the manufacturing crime to which he pled guilty, and overruled Kovac\u2019s objection. Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 105. This finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) provides for a two-level enhancement if a \u201cdangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\u201d during the commission of the offense. \u201cThe adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, Comment (n. 3). \u201cThe government has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a weapon was possessed in physical proximity to the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Contreras, </em>59 F.3d 1038, 1040 (10th Cir.1995). To meet this burden, the government is required to \u201cpresent evidence demonstrating \u2018that a temporal and spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Lang, </em>81 F.3d 955, 964 (10th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>45 F.3d 1423, 1449 (10th Cir.1995)) (further quotations omitted). Once the government meets its burden, the onus is on the defendant to demonstrate that the two-level enhancement should not apply. <em>Contreras, </em>59 F.3d at 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">\u201cThe government meets its initial burden when it shows that a weapon was located near the general location where at least part of a drug [offense] occurred.\u201d <em>United States v. Vaziri, </em>164 F.3d 556, 568 (10th Cir.1999). It is undisputed that Kovac owned, constructed and operated the lab at his residence, and the Government presented evidence that Kovac knew there was a bomb in the attic, as well as evidence connecting the bomb to the drug activity occurring on his premises.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">Kovac\u2019s rejoinder is that despite this evidence, it was \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the bomb was actually connected to the manufacturing offense. Kovac argues that because manufacturing related activity occurred only in the kitchen, the basement and the detached garage, areas of the residence \u201cfar removed\u201d from the attic where the bomb was actually found, there was an insufficient \u201cspatial\u201d connection between the weapon and the manufacturing charge. Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. at 8; Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 2. It is undisputed, however, that the attempted manufacture occurred in Kovac\u2019s residence, and the presence of the bomb in that same residence is enough to support the enhancement if the residence was generally used in the furtherance of the alleged drug offense. <em>See United States v. Dickerson, </em>195 F.3d 1183, 1188 (10th Cir.1999) (concluding that enhancement proper because although fire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>arms were not found in same room as drugs, they were found in \u201cclose proximity\u201d to the drugs and the entire house was utilized for drug activity);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Contreras, </em>59 F.3d at 1039 (holding that although firearm was found in attached garage, twenty five feet from drugs in living room, enhancement proper because entire residence was used as a \u201cstash house\u201d for drugs); <em>United States v. Earls, </em>42 F.3d 1321, 1326 (10th Cir.1994) (upholding enhancement where residence generally \u201cused in furtherance of the drug business\u201d). The record indicates that Kovac\u2019s drug activity did not occur in a small, isolated part of his residence, but extended throughout the house and even into adjacent buildings. <em>See </em>Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 15-20; Reply Brief at 2 (\u201cThere was activity in the kitchen ..., in the basement ... and in the detached garage\u201d). As we recognized in <em>United States v. Flores, </em>149 F.3d 1272 (10th Cir.1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIHd\">enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) is designed to reflect the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers add firearms to the mix.... Although in many cases the weapon will be involved with some sort of illegal transaction, it is not necessary for the Government to show that drugs and money changed hands near the weapon; the weapon may simply serve as a potentially deadly means of protecting the trafficker\u2019s goods, thereby increasing the danger of violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1280 (citation omitted). Although there is no evidence that any manufacturing actually occurred in the attic or the adjacent bedroom, there is sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the residence was generally used to further Kovac\u2019s illegal manufacturing activities, and that the bomb served as a \u201cpotentially deadly means of protecting\u201d Kovac\u2019s operations from detection by destroying evidence in the event a police raid on the lab appeared imminent, \u201cthereby increasing the danger of violence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Kovac further asserts that the district court\u2019s ruling was erroneous because there was no evidence that he actually owned or controlled the bomb. For purposes of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), however, \u201c[personal possession of a [weapon] ... is not necessary.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>131 F.3d 1392, 1400 (10th Cir.1997). Regardless of whether or not Kovac was the technical owner of the bomb, the evidence demonstrated that Kovac was aware that the bomb was in the attic, and that Kovac had full access to the bomb during his illegal drug manufacturing. <em>See United States v. Hallum, </em>103 F.3d 87, 89 (10th Cir.1996) (finding enhancement proper where weapon was accessible to criminals while they were involved in drug cultivation activity). Although Kovac told Officer Sorrell that the bomb was not his and was not intended to be used in connection with his illegal manufacturing operation, Officer Sorrell testified that he did not believe Kovac, and the district court apparently found Officer Sorrell\u2019s testimony to be more credible than the statements made by Kovac at the time of his arrest (or thereafter). We will not disturb such determinations on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number><em>United States v. Caro, </em>248 F.3d 1240, 1243 (10th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">In light of the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the Government met its burden under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), and in concluding that there was a sufficient connection between the bomb, the manufacturing activity, and Kovac to overrule Kovac\u2019s objection to the two-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">\n<em>C. Criminal History Departure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Kovac\u2019s final contention on appeal is that the district court erred in refusing to depart downward when fixing his criminal history category under the Sentencing Guidelines. Kovac claims that the PSR over-represented his criminal history and asserts that a downward departure was warranted under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, \u201c[i]t is established law in this circuit, and in every circuit which has considered the jurisdictional issue, that an appellate court does not have jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward from the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. McHenry, </em>968 F.2d 1047, 1048 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Kovac expressly acknowledges the limits on our jurisdiction and attempts to overcome them by asserting that \u201cthe District Court did not understand its authority to [depart]\u201d because it did not mention the departure motion in its ruling at sentencing, or in the judgment itself. Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 6-7. Although we will review discretionary refusals to depart where it appears from the record that \u201cthe district court refused ... because it erroneously interpreted the Guidelines as depriving it of the power to depart based on the proffered circumstances,\u201d <em>United States v. Barrera-Barron, </em>996 F.2d 244, 245 (10th Cir.1993), such review is appropriate only where \u201cthe judge\u2019s language unambiguously states that the judge does not believe he has authority to downward depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>30 F.3d 1318, 1319 (10th Cir.1994). Such unambiguous language does not exist here, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court misunderstood its authority to depart downward under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3. The district court heard argument on Kovac\u2019s motion and implicitly rejected it, finding \u201cthat the total offense level as modified by the court\u2019s ruling should be a total offense level 31, criminal history category 2.\u201d Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 113. The fact that the district court did not articulate the exact reasons for its discretionary refusal does not evidence that the district court misunderstood its ability to depart downward. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider this allegation of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Kovac\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b964-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

Kovac also pled guilty to the possession of a firearm while being addicted to a controlled substance in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3), admitting that he was a user of, and addicted to, methamphetamine, and that he was found in possession of a Baretta 9mm handgun (which had been involved in interstate commerce) at the time of his arrest. Plea Agreement at \u00b6 6, Ex. A to Def.\u2019s Pet. to Enter Plea of Guilty and Order Entering Plea, R. Vol. I, Doc. 24. However, Kovac does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>appeal any aspect of his conviction or sentence on the firearm possession offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b965-9\">. On the same day, DEA officers stopped another individual who was seen leaving Kovac\u2019s residence and who was found to be in possession of methamphetamine.

Although <em>Cerrato-Reyes </em>involved claims under \u00a7 5K1.1, and not \u00a7 3553(e), the analysis is the same under both provisions. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number><em>States v. Duncan, </em>242 F.3d 940, 944 n. 5 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b968-6\">. For the first time on appeal Kovac attempts to raise a constitutional challenge, asserting that the Government's refusal to file a substantial assistance motion was not rationally related to any legitimate governmental end, and relying on <em>Duncan, </em>which was decided during the pendency of this appeal. Ordinarily, we will not consider an issue on appeal that was not raised below. <em>Walker v. Mather, </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992). Although we have the discretion to consider new arguments based on \u201cchanges in the law arising during the pendency of the appeal,\u201d <em>Anixter v. Home-Stake Prod. Co., </em>77 F.3d 1215, 1222 (10th Cir.1996), we decline to exercise such discretion in this case because (i) the standard relied upon by Kovac, and recognized by <em>Duncan, </em>was articulated through <em>Wade </em>as early as 1992, (ii) there is no evidence in the record to support Kovac's claims that the government's decision was irrational, and (iii) Kovac made no showing, much less a \u201csubstantial threshold showing,\u201d that the Government\u2019s discretionary refusal was unconstitutional. Indeed, Kovac\u2019s only claim on appeal is that the Government's discretionary refusal in this case did not further the legitimate governmental interests specifically articulated in <em>Duncan, </em>but in that case we neither purported to provide an exhaustive list of legitimate governmental ends, nor suggested in any way that the ends specifically articulated therein were the only ones the government could ever rely upon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b968-11\">. We apply general principles of contract law when defining the government\u2019s obligations under a plea agreement, looking to the express language and construing any ambiguities against the government as drafter. <em>United States v. Brye, </em>146 F.3d 1207, 1210 (10th Cir.1998). As with all contracts, we interpret plea agreements by giving effect to their plain and unambiguous language, giving due consideration to a defendant's reasonable understandings at the time. <em>United States v. Bunner, </em>134 F.3d 1000, 1003 (10th Cir.1998). As quoted above, the plain language of Section 2(e) of the plea agreement in this case merely left open only the possibility of a substantial assistance motion. It did not obligate the Government to file a motion, \"expressly leaving the decision to file such a motion in the sole [opinion] of the government.\u201d <em>Courtois, </em>131 F.3d at 939. While the plea agreement could have limited the discretion otherwise granted to the government under \u00a7 5K1.1 and \u00a7 3553(e), <em>Lee, </em>989 F.2d at 380, it clearly did not do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b969-6\">.

We have never fully articulated the standard for \"bad faith\" in this context. Some circuits hold (i) that a defendant is required to make a prima facie showing of bad faith, (ii) that the government must then come forth with a good faith explanation for its decision, and (iii) that the defendant then bears the ultimate burden of proving that the government's reasons were inadequate or merely pretextual. <em>See, e.g., Isaac, </em>141 F.3d at 484 (citing <em>United States v.

On appeal, Kovac asserts that the government cannot refuse a substantial assistance motion merely because the government found the information provided to be useless to its investigation, relying primarily on an analogy to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(0(5), a provision which expressly renders the usefulness of the information provided by a defendant irrelevant when a district court is assessing whether or not to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines in favor of a lower statutory minimum sentence. Kovac\u2019s analogy is flawed, however, because \u00a7 5K1.1 and \u00a7 3553(e) simply do not contain the language Kovac relies upon from \u00a7 3553(0, and \u00a7 3553(0 and its counterpart USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 are fundamentally distinct provisions that have absolutely no application in this case. See <em>United States v. Acosta-Olivas, </em>71 F.3d 375, 379 (10th Cir.1995) (\"Section 5K1.1 [and \u00a7 3553(e)] concerning substantial assistance operate! ] very differently from \u00a7 5C1.2[and\u00a7 3553(0(5)].\u201d). <em>See also United States v.

This argument defies common sense and the essential purpose of \u00a7 5K1.1 because a defendant can in no circumstances be said to provide \"assistance\u201d to the government, much less \"substantial assistance,\u201d if he is not providing truthful information. There is nothing unreasonable in the government considering the perceived veracity of the defendant when deciding whether or not to file a substantial assistance motion on his or her behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b971-11\">. <em>See generally Isaac, </em>141 F.3d at 484 (concluding that defendant must show that government did not base its decision on \"an honest evaluation of the assistance provided,\u201d but inappropriately considered factors \u201cextraneous to the decision\u201d); <em>United States v.

Kovac argues that <em>Dickerson </em>is distinguishable because the defendant in that case was convicted of \"controlling a building and making it available for use for the purpose of illegal drug activity,\u201d a crime that, by its very nature, \"implicated the illegal use of the entire residence.\u201d Appellant's Reply Br. at 1-2. However, it was not the crime charged that was important in <em>Dickerson, </em>but the fact that the crime implicated the entire residence. 195 F.3d at 1188.

Moreover, although we make no judgment about whether or not the mobility of a weapon may be relevant in cases involving the actual transportation of drugs, we believe that because Kovac was convicted of attempted manufacturing, a drug crime that did not necessarily involve the actual transport or movement of drugs, the mobility or immobility of the bomb is entirely irrelevant in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b974-11\">.
