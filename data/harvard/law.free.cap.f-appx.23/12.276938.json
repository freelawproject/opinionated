Nothing in the relevant statute or rule, however, requires the court to issue its own findings or explain the scope of its review. <em>Elmendorf Grafica, Inc. v. D.S. America (East), Inc., </em>48 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-18\">The appellant also argues that summary judgment was improper because of a factual dispute concerning whether a researcher properly invoked his right to withhold information by objecting to disclosure within the five days allotted by 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.65(d)(2). As the magistrate stated, however, the date of the researcher\u2019s objection was irrelevant since the government could itself determine to withhold the information under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.65(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-19\">None of the appellant\u2019s remaining objections rise to the level of appellate argument. <em>United States v. Zannino, </em>895 F.2d 1,17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-20\"><em>Affirmed. </em>Loc. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
