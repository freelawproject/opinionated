He raises three issues on which a Certificate of Appealability (COA) was issued (whether the district court was required to offer him the opportunity to amend his petition to delete unexhausted claims; whether the district court abused its discretion by not holding district court proceedings in abeyance while Bratton exhausted his claims; and whether the district. court erred by not exercising authority granted by AEDPA to deny unexhausted claims on the merits), and two that are not certified having to do with ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>decline to consider the uncertified issues or to expand the COA beyond what was allowed by the motions panel of this court.
