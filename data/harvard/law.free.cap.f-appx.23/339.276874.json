Jones, appearing through counsel, appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment denying Jones\u2019s application for Social Security Disability and Supplemen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>tal Security Income Benefits. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The court sent a letter to the parties requiring them to show why this case should not be decided without oral argument; neither party responded to the letter. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Jones claimed that he became disabled because of a back condition and learning disabilities. The Appeals Council declined to review the administrative law judge\u2019s decision denying benefits. The district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits. This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision to determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Brainard v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>889 F.2d 679, 681 (6th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Jones claims that a provision in the medical-vocational guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. 8, App. 2, \u00a7 201.00(h), contains an example which mandates that Jones receive an award of benefits. We conclude that the example in \u00a7 201.00(h) does not mandate a finding of disability. The example merely shows that an administrative law judge (ALJ) is not precluded from finding disability where a claimant cannot perform a full range of sedentary work. <em>Abbott v. Sullivan, </em>905 F.2d 918, 927 (6th Cir.1990); <em>Mingus v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>No. 98-6270, 188 F.3d 508, 1999 WL 644341, at *3-4 (6th Cir. Aug. 19, 1999) (unpub.decision); <em>Littrell v. Shalala, </em>898 F.Supp. 582, 585 (S.D.Ohio 1995). A vocational expert can testify that a claimant is limited to less than a full range of sedentary work and nonetheless find that the claimant can perform a significant number of jobs in the economy. <em>Bradley v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>862 F.2d 1224, 1228 (6th Cir.1988); <em>McCormick v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>861 F.2d 998, 1002 (6th Cir.1988). So \u00a7 201.00(h) did not mandate a finding of disability in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Concerning Jones\u2019s daily activities, the general rule is that the ALJ may consider the household and social activities of the claimant while evaluating his complaints and symptoms. <em>Bogle v. Sullivan, </em>998 F.2d 342, 348 (6th Cir.1993). When the ALJ evaluated Jones\u2019s daily activities such as feeding his chickens, mowing the lawn, and fishing, the ALJ could have determined that these were intermittent activities that did not suggest the ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. <em>Walston v. Gardner, </em>381 F.2d 580, 586 (6th Cir.1967). Instead, the ALJ found that Jones\u2019s daily activities supported his ability to perform a limited range of sedentary work, and we conclude that substantial evidence supports this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Finally, Jones argues that the ALJ improperly credited all of Dr. SainriJacques physical limitations findings except for the inability to stoop. <em>See </em>Social Security Ruling 96-9p. Unfortunately for Jones, Dr. Saint-Jacques\u2019 assessment that Jones could never stoop was not accompanied by a reference to any medical evidence supporting his conclusion. An unsubstantiated entry on an assessment form is not entitled to deference by the ALJ. <em>Villarreal v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>818 F.2d 461, 463 (6th Cir.1987) (per curiam). The ALJ actually gave Jones the benefit of the doubt regarding the other unsubstantiated limitations, presented those limitations in a hypothetical to the vocational expert, and credited the expert\u2019s testimony that found a significant number of sedentary jobs still available to Jones in the economy even with those limitations. Once again, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
