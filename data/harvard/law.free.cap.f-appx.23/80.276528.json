Squatrito, <em>Judge) </em>denying their motion to disqualify United States Bankruptcy Judge Alan H.W. Shiff. Appellants contend that Chief Judge Shiff displayed bias against them and favored the trustee during the resolution of their bankruptcy petition. In addition, Appellants request that this Court set aside several orders issued by the bankruptcy court including orders authorizing the sale of their marital residence and distributing proceeds of that sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-26\">We have considered all of appellants\u2019 contentions in this appeal and substantially for the reasons stated the ruling of the District Court filed April 4, 2001, <em>Hutter v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Coan, </em>No. 3:98-1156, Slip Op. at 1 (D.Conn Apr. 4, 2001), we find Appellants\u2019 arguments to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
