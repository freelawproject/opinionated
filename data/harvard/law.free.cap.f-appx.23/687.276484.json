We have jurisdiction to review a final order of the BIA pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 llOSa(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings, including whether a petitioner has demonstrated past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, for substantial evidence, and we uphold the BIA ruling unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000). Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that the threats against Reyes-Villanova do not amount to past persecution on account of political opinion, <em>see Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000), and that he does not have an objective fear of future persecution, <em>see Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995). Accordingly, Reyes-Villanova failed to establish eligibility for asylum and therefore failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Pedro-Mateo, </em>224 F.3d at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b720-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-26\">. Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), deportation proceedings initiated prior to April 1, 1997, for which a final order of deportation is issued after October 30, 1996, are subject to the transitional rules. <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir. 1997). Because deportation proceedings were initiated against Reyes-Villanova on January 28, 1997, and a final order of deportation was issued on October 16, 2000, the transitional rules apply to his case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
