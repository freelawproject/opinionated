Background</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Prior to 1993, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822(e) required the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), as the receiver of failed financial institutions, to provide depositors with notice of any unclaimed funds in their accounts which had been transferred by the FDIC to a solvent institution. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822(e) (Supp. IV 1992) (amended 1993). This process was revised in 1993 with the passage of the Unclaimed Deposits at Insured Banks and Savings Association Act, Pub.L. No. 103-44, 107 Stat. 220 (1993). Under this Act, if a receivership is established after June 28, 1993, the FDIC is obligated to send two notices to a depositor\u2019s last known address. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 1 (codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822(e)(1) (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">In June 1996, appellant Robert Lepelletier Jr. filed a complaint against the FDIC seeking under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 <em>et seq., </em>the names of individuals and businesses with unclaimed deposits at three banks <em>for </em>which the FDIC was acting as receiver. Lepelletier\u2019s complaint also alleged that the due process clause required the FDIC to either 1) publish the names and amounts due for all parties having unclaimed funds or 2) provide him with the names of the depositors. [S.A. 1-12.] The district court granted partial summary judgment to the FDIC on the FOIA claim, holding that an exemption to disclosure applied to the names of individual depositors. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) (unwarranted invasion of privacy exemption). <em>See Lepelletier v. FDIC, </em>977 F.Supp. 456 (D.D.C. 1997), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, Lepelletier v. FDIC, </em>164 F.3d 37 (D.C.Cir.1999) <em>(\u201cLepelletier I\u201d). </em>In denying summary judgment in part, the district court held that the names of businesses with unclaimed funds were not exempted from disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 459-60. The district court also granted summary judgment to the FDIC on the due process claim, holding that sending written notice to the holders of unclaimed deposits at their last known addresses, as required by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822(e) and its pre-1993 notification requirements, satisfied due process. <em>Id. </em>at 463-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">On appeal, we reversed in part the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the FDIC and remanded the case to the district court to determine 1) whether the depositors\u2019 interests in their account balances outweighs their privacy interests such that the release of depositors\u2019 names would be required under FOIA, and 2) whether the procedures of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822(e) were consistent with the due process considerations set forth in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). <em>See Lepelletier v. FDIC, </em>164 F.3d 37 (D.C.Cir.1999) <em>(\u201cLepelletier </em>II\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Following our decision in <em>Lepelletier II, </em>the FDIC released all of the depositors\u2019 names to Lepelletier. It then filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment on grounds that Lepelletier had obtained all the relief requested in his complaint. [A. 1; 32-42.] The FDIC argued in the alternative that the direct mailing to the depositors\u2019 last known addresses \u2014 the form of notice provided for by statute\u2014 satisfied due process. Lepelletier filed a cross motion for summary judgment arguing that publication of the depositors\u2019 names was constitutionally required and necessitated a <em>Mathews </em>hearing. [A. 46-53.]</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">Following a <em>Mathews </em>hearing, the district court determined that the direct mail notice specified in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822(e) satisfied due process. Consequently, in a written order filed March 3, 2000, the court granted the FDIC\u2019s motion to dismiss and denied Lepelletier\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment. <em>Lepelletier v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., </em>Civ. No. 96-1363(JR) (D.D.C. Mar. 3, 2000). The court conditioned its dismissal on the FDIC providing Lepelletier with partial addresses of depositors (subject to appropriate FOIA exemptions) within 30 days of the order. On March 27, the FDIC fulfilled the requirements of the district court\u2019s order by releasing two lists of unclaimed accounts with partially redacted information. [S.A. 20-25.] Lepelletier now appeals the district court\u2019s March 3 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Upon review, we dismiss Lepelletier\u2019s appeal as moot. The mootness doctrine limits federal courts to deciding \u201cactual, ongoing controversies.\u201d <em>Honig v. Doe, </em>484 U.S. 305, 317, 108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988). \u201cEven where litigation poses a live controversy when filed, the doctrine requires a federal court to refrain from deciding it if \u2018events have so transpired that the decision will neither presently affect the parties\u2019 rights nor have a more-than-speculative chance of affecting them in the future.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clarke v. United States, </em>915 F.2d 699, 701 (D.C.Cir. 1990) (quoting <em>Transwestern Pipeline Co. v. FERC, </em>897 F.2d 570, 575 (D.C.Cir. 1990)). This limitation continues \u201c \u2018through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and appellate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Following our decision in <em>Lepelletier II, </em>the FDIC provided Lepelletier with a list of all depositors with unclaimed funds in accounts held by the FDIC in its capacity as receiver. Moreover, Lepelletier received additional depositor information (i.e., depositor addresses) pursuant to the district court\u2019s order of March 3, 2000. Lepelletier has thus received all \u2014 indeed more than \u2014 the relief he initially sought through his Freedom of Information Act request. Consequently, his appeal is moot and will not be entertained further by this court. Because Lepelletier\u2019s appeal is moot, we need not address the constitutional issue of whether the procedures set forth in \u00a7 1822(e) satisfy due process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
