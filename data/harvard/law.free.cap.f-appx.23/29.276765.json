(\u201cNike\u201d) and St. John\u2019s University (\u201cSt. John\u2019s\u201d), and denying Keady\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">This case arises from Keady\u2019s vocal opposition to the practices of Nike and to the decision by St. John\u2019s to contract with Nike. Keady alleges that he was constructively discharged from his position as an administrative assistant at St. John\u2019s due to this opposition. Keady filed suit in November 1999, alleging, inter aha: violations of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1985(3) and 1986; a criminal conspiracy to deprive him of his civil rights under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241; defamation; discrimination on account of his <em>religion in </em>violation <em>of the </em>New York State Human Rights Law and the New York City Human Rights Law (collectively, \u201cNYHRL\u201d); and breach of contract. St. John\u2019s moved to dismiss the complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6), and 12(c). Nike moved to dismiss the complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). After responding to the motions, Keady moved to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">On September 21, 2000, the district court issued an opinion and order granting both of Defendants Appellees\u2019 motions, and denying Keady\u2019s motion. <em>Keady v. Nike, Inc., </em>116 F.Supp.2d 428 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">With respect to Plaintiffs \u00a7 1985(3) claim, the court ruled, inter aha, that the claim failed because Plaintiffs allegations were too conclusory to survive a motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 434-35. The court dismissed Plaintiffs \u00a7 1986 claim because it was dependent on his failed \u00a7 1985(3) claim. <em>Id. </em>at 435. In addition, the court ruled that Plaintiffs 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 claim failed because that criminal statute does not allow private rights of action. <em>Id. </em>at 435-36. The court then opted to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Keady\u2019s state law claims, and dismissed them as well. <em>Id. </em>at 436-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to dismiss de novo, <em>Cooper v. Parsky, </em>140 F.3d 433, 440 (2d Cir.1998), taking all factual allegations as true and construing ah reasonable inferences in the nonmovant\u2019s favor, <em>Lee v. Bankers Trust, </em>166 F.3d 540, 543 (2d Cir. 1999). We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for leave to amend the complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>Ronzani v. Sanofi S.A., </em>899 F.2d 195, 199 (2d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-14\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Keady\u2019s complaint is too conclusory to allege a \u00a7 1985 claim. With respect to Plaintiffs 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1986 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 claims, we agree with the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing these claims. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Keady\u2019s federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-15\">In addition, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny Keady\u2019s motion for leave to amend the complaint for substantially the same reasons as set forth in the court\u2019s opinion and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>We do not agree, however, with the district court\u2019s determination that supplemental jurisdiction was \u201cwarranted in this case\u201d due to considerations of \u201cjudicial economy and fairness to the litigants.\u201d <em>Keady, </em>116 F.Supp.2d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">A federal court has supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims whenever a federal law claim confers subject matter jurisdiction on the court and both claims \u201cderive from a common nucleus of operative fact.\u201d <em>United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). Although the decision whether to dismiss pendent state claims is within the district court\u2019s discretion, failure to dismiss a pendent claim after dismissing all of a plaintiffs federal claims \u201cmay be an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion,\u201d especially when that state claim involves \u201cnovel questions of state law.\u201d <em>Robison v. Via, </em>821 F.2d 913, 925 (2d Cir.1987); <em>accord Raucci v. Town of Rotterdam, </em>902 F.2d 1050, 1054 (2d Cir.1990); <em>Morse v. Univ. of Vt., </em>973 F.2d 122, 127 (2d Cir.1992). \u201cThe court must \u2018consider and weigh in each case, and at every stage of the litigation, the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity in order to decide whether to exercise jurisdiction\u2019 over the pendent claim.\u201d <em>Raucci, </em>902 F.2d at 1055 (quoting <em>Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, </em>484 U.S. 343, 350, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988)). \u201c[I]n the usual case in which all federal-law claims are eliminated before trial, the balance of factors ... will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.\u201d <em>Cohill, </em>484 U.S. at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We have frequently upheld summary judgments with respect to both state and federal claims in cases brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d) and corresponding state discrimination laws. <em>See, e.g., Van Zant v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, </em>80 F.3d 708, 715 (2d Cir.1996). Here, however, none of Keady\u2019s state law claims fully corresponded to his federal law claims. Although identical standards apply to employment discrimination claims brought under NYHRL and Title VII, Keady did not bring a Title VII claim, but rather a \u00a7 1985(3) claim, for which the standards are different from a NYHRL claim. Moreover, considerations of judicial economy are less strong here, where we are faced not with a situation in which discovery has been completed and the district court has granted summary judgment, but rather a situation in which the court granted a motion to dismiss based on allegations made in the complaint (albeit after several pre-trial conferences). Most important, while the question of whether Keady has properly alleged a NYHRL claim based on religious discrimination does not necessarily present a \u201cnovel question! ] of state law,\u201d <em>Robison, </em>821 F.2d at 925, we think that the answer to this question is better resolved by a New York court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Thus, although we commend the district court for doing its best to resolve these claims in a way that it deemed most fair to the litigants, we conclude that, on balance, the district court abused its discretion by retaining jurisdiction over Keady\u2019s state law claims after dismissing his federal claims. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Keady\u2019s state law claims, and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss Keady\u2019s state law claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED AND REMANDED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
