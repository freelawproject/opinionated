Campos brought this action to recover benefits from a disability insurance plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). For reversal, she argues that the plan administrator\u2019s setoff of her plan benefits by the amount of her social security disability benefits, on the ground that both were payable as a result of the \u201csame disability,\u201d was contrary to the plain language of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">Upon de novo review of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we conclude that the plan administrator\u2019s decision \u2014 -based in part on interpreting \u201csame disability\u201d to mean \u201cbased upon the same period ... and cause of disability,\u201d and not \u201cbased on the same medical diagnosis\u201d \u2014 -was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Sahulka v. Lucent Techs., Inc., </em>206 F.3d 763, 767-68 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review; where plan gives administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility, abuse-of-discretion standard is used unless beneficiary can show conflict of interest or serious procedural irregularity that caused serious breach of plan administrator\u2019s duty); <em>Finley v. Special Agents Mut. Benefit Ass\u2019n, </em>957 F.2d 617, 621 (8th Cir.1992) (court determines whether administrator\u2019s interpretation of plan language was abuse of discretion by considering whether (1) interpretation was consistent with plan goals, (2) interpretation renders any language in plan meaningless or internally inconsistent, (3) interpretation conflicts with ERISA\u2019s substantive or procedural requirements, (4) administrator has interpreted relevant terms consistently, and (5) interpretation is contrary to plan\u2019s clear language).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-11\">. The Honorable Lyle E. Strom, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
