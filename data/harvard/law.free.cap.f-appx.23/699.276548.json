We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>see Burrell v. Star Nursery, Inc., </em>170 F.3d 951, 954 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The district court properly granted summary judgment to Hewlett-Packard on Elshirbiny\u2019s claims. Elshirbiny failed to file her complaints with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 300 days of the allegedly discriminatory events. Her claims were therefore untimely. <em>See Draper v. Coeur Rochester, Inc., </em>147 F.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Because Elshirbiny failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances, the district court properly determined that she was not entitled to equitable tolling. <em>Cf. Stoll v. Runyon, </em>165 F.3d 1238, 1242 (9th Cir.1999) (stating that equitable tolling is proper where \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d demonstrates that complainant was completely disabled during the limitations period).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">We decline to address Elshirbiny\u2019s argument that she is entitled to equitable tolling because of a continuing violation, because the argument is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Int\u2019l Assn. of Indep. Tanker Owners v. Locke, </em>148 F.3d 1053, 1063 (9th Cir.1998)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-10\">.
