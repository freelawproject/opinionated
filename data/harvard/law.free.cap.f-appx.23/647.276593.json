Gonzales now asserts that his plea was involuntary and was made in order to escape from acts of violence threatened by the victim\u2019s family. On appeal from the initial dismissal of his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, we affirmed the dismissal of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but remanded his plea coercion claim for an evidentiary hearing. We noted that \u201c[t]he allegations in the petition, if proven, could call for habeas relief. There is little doubt that a serious problem existed in and around the courtroom that might have caused this defendant to sense real danger to his weE being.\u201d <em>Gonzales v. Gomez, </em>129 F.3d 125 (table), 1997 WL 683313, at *1 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">After holding an evidentiary hearing on remand, the district court found that Gonzales had been threatened. It also found, however, that those threats did not intimidate Gonzales and, thus, did not render his plea involuntary. Gonzales now timely appeals. Because the district court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous, we affirm the denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">A guilty plea must be the voluntary expression of the defendant\u2019s own choice. <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970). \u201cA guilty plea, if induced by promises or threats which deprive it of the character of a voluntary act, is void. A conviction based upon such a plea is open to collateral attack.\u201d <em>Machibroda v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 487, 493, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962). To determine voluntariness, we examine the totality of the circumstances, <em>Brady, </em>397 U.S. at 749, 90 S.Ct. 1463, which includes \u201cthe subjective state of mind of the defendant .... \u201d <em>Iaea v. Sunn, </em>800 F.2d 861, 866 (9th Cir.1986). Where, as in this ease, the court has remanded the case to a district court for an evidentiary hearing, the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Seidel v. Merkle, </em>146 F.3d 750, 753 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">Petitioner\u2019s plea agreement reduced his minimum term of imprisonment by ten years. He testified during the plea colloquy that he had not been threatened or coerced into making a guilty plea. When, \u201cduring the plea coEoquy, [a defendant] specifically denied that any threats and coercions had been used against him[,][c]ourts generally consider such responses to be strong indicators of the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1448, 1455 (9th Cir.1995). In addition, he failed, on direct appeal in state court, to raise his allegation that his plea was coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">The district court heard and saw Gonzales testify. In the context of aE of the evidence adduced at the evidentiary hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it found that, although threats had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>been made, Gonzales was not intimidated or coerced by those threats. The effect of the threats on Gonzales \u2014 Gonzales\u2019 state of mind at the time he entered his nolo contendere plea \u2014 is a question of fact. Under the dear-error standard, if a permissible view of the evidence and the inferences therefrom support the district court\u2019s finding, we must affirm, whether we would have weighed the evidence differently had we been sitting as the trier of fact. <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). Because the district court\u2019s finding that Gonzales\u2019 plea was voluntary is not clearly erroneous, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"As4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b680-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit, except as may be provided by Ninth Cir.
