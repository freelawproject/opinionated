Hernandez\u2019s attorney has moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), on the ground that the appeal presents no arguable issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-24\">As part of his plea agreement, Hernandez waived his right to appeal the judgment and sentence. Because he received a sentence consistent with the plea agreement, and there is no evidence that the waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing or was not voluntary, we enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>the waiver and dismiss the appeal. <em>United States v.
