The permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 apply to this case because removal proceedings were initiated against petitioner after April 1, 1997. <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">\u201cBecause the issue in this appeal is whether [petitioner] committed an aggravated felony, and because we have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction, <em>see Aragon-Ayon v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 847, 849 (9th Cir.2000), the jurisdictional question and the merits collapse into one.\u201d <em>Ye v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-21\">Because petitioner\u2019s conviction for the offense of second degree burglary of a vehicle in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 459 with a sentence of three years is not an aggravated felony, petitioner is not removable for being an aggravated felon under 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). <em>See id. </em>(stating that vehicle burglary under California Penal Code \u00a7 459 does not qualify as a burglary or crime of violence as those terms are used in the definition of aggravated felony.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-22\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b909-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
