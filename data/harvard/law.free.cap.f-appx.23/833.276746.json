We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">We review de novo the dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. <em>See Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Holt contends that his constitutional rights were violated when correctional officers made a false written report of his conduct during a visit and when, as a result of this report, his visitation rights were restricted. Because Holt is not a member of a suspect class, there is no fundamental right at issue, and restrictions on visitation are rationally related to the legitimate objectives of prison officials, Holt\u2019s equal protection rights were not violated. <em>See Coakley v. Murphy, </em>884 F.2d 1218, 1221-22 (9th Cir.1989). Because the Constitution does not guarantee a right of unfettered visitation, the allegedly erroneous report and restrictions on Holt\u2019s visitation rights did not violate his federal right to due process of law. <em>See Kentucky Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Thompson, </em>490 U.S. 454, 460-61, 109 S.Ct. 1904, 104 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989); <em>Keenan v. Hall, </em>83 F.3d 1083, 1092 (9th Cir.1996), <em>amended by </em>135 F.3d 1319 (10th Cir.1998). In addition, there was no state law procedural due process violation because the restriction on Holt\u2019s visitation rights was not an atypical and significant hardship. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Further, Holt failed to allege that the false report was made, or his visitation rights restricted, for retaliatory reasons. <em>See Pratt v. Rowland, </em>65 F.3d 802, 806 (9th Cir.1995). Accordingly, the district court did not err when it dismissed his third amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">Holt\u2019s motion to change the name of appellee Levan to Lightfield is granted. The Clerk shall change the docket to reflect appellee Levan\u2019s new name.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b866-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
