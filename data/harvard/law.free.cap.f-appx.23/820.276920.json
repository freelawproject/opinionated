(DGA) and DGA\u2019s Pension and Health Plans (the Plans), appeal the district court\u2019s award of $109,000.00. They claim that Appellees/Defendants owe them more than the district court awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-21\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>court\u2019s award of damages for abuse of discretion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and its findings of fact for clear error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse and direct the district court to enter judgment for DGA in the amount of $106,955.56 and for the Plans in the amo\u00fant of $58,691.01,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a total of $165,646.57.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">We conclude that the amount of damages to which DGA and the Plans each are entitled consists of the amount awarded in the judgment against the Newz Productions, Inc. (the Newz), plus interest and legal fees accrued since the time^ of that judgment. The Plans are also entitled to liquidated damages equal to the amount owed in interest. Thus, for DGA, the amount owed equals $91,978.13 (the amount awarded in the judgment against the Newz) plus $7,260.88 in interest and $7,716.55 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs, for a total of $106,955.56. And for the Plans, the amount owed equals $48,813.05 (the amount awarded in the judgment against the Newz) plus $1,329.98 in interest, $1,329.98 in liquidated damages, and $7,218.00 in attorneys fees and costs, for a total of $58,691.01. We note that Appellants ask for fewer attorneys fees than that to which they appear entitled in both instances. Our award is consistent with their request.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to enter judgment in accord with this order. REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b852-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-8\">. <em>McLean v.
