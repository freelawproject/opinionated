Anderson, a former postal worker, entered into conditional pleas of guilty, pursuant to Rule 11(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in the Magistrate Court for obstructing the mail and delaying the mail in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1701 and 1703(b). Anderson appeals the District Court\u2019s order denying his supplemental motion to suppress statements made to Anderson\u2019s supervisor, Art Battle.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Anderson argues that because Battle is a government actor, a postal supervisor, he was required to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to questioning Anderson. Anderson was not in custody when Battle questioned him, and, therefore, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required. <em>See Miranda v. State of Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying Anderson\u2019s supplemental motion to suppress statements made to his supervisor is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\">.
