We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-22\">Because the Bureau of Prisons has since released Wharton from custody, this Court lacks the ability to remedy his grievance, which renders moot his habeas petition. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>529 U.S. 53, 56-60, 120 S.Ct. 1114, 1117-19, 146 L.Ed.2d 39 (2000) (holding that length of federal supervised release term may not be reduced by reason of excess incarcerated time); <em>Aragon v. Shanks, </em>144 F.3d 690, 691 (10th Cir.1998) (holding appeal moot where habeas petitioner on probation sought revoked good time credits, because under New Mexico law, the mandatory term of probation would not be affected by a retroactive application of good time credits), c<em>f. Zichko v. Idaho, </em>247 F.3d 1015, 1019 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe general rule concerning mootness has long been that a petition for habeas corpus becomes moot when a prisoner completes his sentence before the court has addressed the merits of his petition.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b873-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-32\">. <em>United States v.
