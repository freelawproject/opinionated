The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-15\">This is a pro se \u00a7 2254 prisoner appeal. The underlying petition for habeas corpus was dismissed by the trial court as untimely. The district court denied Appellant\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability. This motion has been renewed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-16\">Ms. Payne\u2019s petition was filed beyond the one-year statute of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Ms. Payne argues that the limitations period should be equitably tolled because she relied on her attorney to meet filing deadlines. Additionally, Ms. Payne asserts that tolling of the AEDPA limitations period is appropriate since she is actually innocent of the charge of Murder in the First Degree because someone else actually committed the crime. The trial court held that equitable tolling is not justified by \u201c[m]ere attorney negligence.\u201d Opinion at 3 (quoting <em>Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (10th Cir.2000)). The trial court also held that since Ms. Payne has not accompanied her habeas petition with new rehable evidence of her innocence, circumstances did not warrant a tolling of the statute. We can add nothing to the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-19\">Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or Appellant\u2019s brief raises an issue which meets our standards for the grant of a certificate of appealability. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 474, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). She has not made a substantial showing of a denial of a federal right nor has she raised any arguments which require further proceedings or that are debatable among jurists of reason. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-20\">We DENY Ms. Payne\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal. The motion to proceed in forma pauperis is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1021-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
