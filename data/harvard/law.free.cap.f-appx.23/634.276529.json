The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied Black Bear\u2019s motion for mistrial, which was made after a government witness gave unresponsive testimony regarding bruises he observed on the victim. Black Bear appeals his conviction, arguing that the testimony was \u201cprior bad act\u201d evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), admitted in violation of the trial court\u2019s order excluding such evidence. Black Bear also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-21\">After careful review of the record, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Black Bear\u2019s motion for a mistrial. <em>See United States v. Flores, </em>73 F.3d 826, 831-32 (8th Cir.1996) (standard of review; district court has superior vantage point in measuring effect of testimony on the jury than appellate court reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>cold record; curative instruction ordinarily alleviates any prejudice flowing from improper testimony). Further, we find that the evidence amply supported the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. McCarthy, </em>244 F.3d 998, 999-1000 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-22\">.
