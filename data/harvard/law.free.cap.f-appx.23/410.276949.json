(\u201cADA\u201d), the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323(b)(3) (\u201cUSERA\u201d), and Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 4112.01. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-18\">In this action, Weaver raises claims related to his ex-employer\u2019s, the Garber Company, and Garber\u2019s parent, Caraustar Industries, Inc. (collectively, \u201cGarber\u201d), termination of his employment as a \u201cpressman\u201d on September 23, 1998. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of Garber, dismissing the complaint on the ground of res judicata. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-19\">Our review of the district court\u2019s order is de novo. <em>See Holloway v. Brush, </em>220 F.3d 767, 772 (6th Cir.2000); <em>Black v. Ryder/P.I.E. Nationwide, Inc., </em>15 F.3d 573, 582 (6th Cir.1994). Upon review, we conclude that the doctrine of res judicata was appropriately invoked for the reasons stated by the district court in its memorandum and order filed February 26, 2001. <em>See Wilkins v. Jakeway, </em>183 F.3d 528, 532 (6th Cir.1999); <em>Kane v. Magna Mixer Co., </em>71 F.3d 555, 560 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-20\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
