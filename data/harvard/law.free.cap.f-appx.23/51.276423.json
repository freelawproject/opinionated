Mordue, <em>Judge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The district court granted summary judgment, finding that Griffin had failed to produce evidence of anything other than negligence on the part of prison officials. This Court reviews summary judgment orders de novo. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mazzola, </em>175 F.3d 255, 258 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Because we agree that although Griffin was incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm, he did not produce any evidence that could support a finding of the deliberate indifference required to establish a \u00a7 1983 claim for an Eighth Amendment violation by any of the identified defendants, we affirm. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)(requiring proof of \u201ca sufficiently culpable state of mind\u201d); <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 105-06, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (requiring \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d); <em>Green v. Bauvi, </em>46 F.3d 189, 194 (2d Cir.1995) (requiring personal involvement of supervisory officials).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
