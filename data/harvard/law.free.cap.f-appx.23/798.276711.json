Baker (\u201cBaker\u201d) appeals a summary judgment and a judgment after a bench trial in favor of USAA Life Insurance Company (\u201cUSAA\u201d). Baker contends that USAA improperly reduced his monthly payment by treating his benefits from the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (\u201cLACERA\u201d) as \u201cincome\u201d under the policy, in violation of California Insurance Code Sections 10369.6 and 10369.7. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-16\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b831-17\">Baker is a physician who served as the Medical Director of Health Services for the Juvenile Court Division of Los Angeles County. In 1985, he purchased an individual disability insurance policy from USAA. The policy promised Baker a \u201cMaximum Monthly Benefit\u201d for \u201cany calendar month ... in which [his] Income is less than 80% of [his] Pre-loss Income solely because of Injury or Sickness.\u201d Assuming that Baker has a covered sickness or injury, his monthly benefit is determined by multiplying the \u201cMaximum Monthly Benefit\u201d by the ratio of his loss of \u201cIncome\u201d to his \u201cPre-loss Income.\u201d The policy further defines \u201cincome\u201d as \u201cthe amount ... actually receive[d] ... from ... wages, salaries, ...; and pension, retirement, and profit-sharing benefits which start during a ... Benefit Period.\u201d The policy also notes that \u201cincome\u201d does not include \u201cInjury or Sickness benefits provided by other insurers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-18\">In March 1997, Baker became disabled within the meaning of the policy when he was diagnosed with severe depression. Baker filed a claim with USAA and began receiving payments on July 23,1997. Baker also applied for and received disability retirement benefits from LACERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-19\">On May 10,1999, USAA informed Baker that it was entitled to reduce its payments to Baker because he was receiving service-connected disability retirement \u201cincome\u201d from LACERA. The change was retroactive, and USAA asked Baker to pay approximately $60,000. USAA also notified him that it would withhold the reduced amounts as an offset towards what it con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>sidered to be Baker\u2019s overpayment balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Baker filed a complaint against USAA in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleging breach of contract, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. USAA removed the action to the district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. Baker subsequently amended his complaint to add two additional causes of action: deceptive trade practices (Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1770), and unfair business practices (Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17200, <em>et. seq.). </em>All of Baker\u2019s claims are based on a similar premise: by treating LAC-ERA benefits as \u201cincome,\u201d USAA\u2019s offsets of Baker\u2019s disability benefits were inconsistent with Sections 10369.6 and 10369.7 of the California Insurance Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The district court ultimately granted summary judgment to USAA on all but the unfair business practices claim. After a one-day bench trial, the court found in favor of USAA on this claim and held that Sections 10369.6 and 10369.7 do not prohibit offsets against LACERA benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">A. Breach of contract claim</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Baker does not argue that the policy prohibits USAA\u2019s offsets; rather, he contends that treating LACERA benefits as \u201cincome\u201d violates Sections 10369.6 and 10369.7 of the California Insurance Code and renders the challenged provisions of his policy void and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">California Insurance Code Sections 10369.6 and 10369.7 give insurers the option of offsetting payments due under a disability insurance policy in certain circumstances. An insurer that chooses to reduce its benefits pursuant to either section must draft its offsetting provision in accordance with the model language in the statutes or language \u201cnot less favorable\u201d to the insured. <em>See </em>Cal. Ins.Code \u00a7 10369.1.</p>\n<p id=\"AOp\">Section 10369.6 provides a mandatory formula for insurers to include in their disability insurance policy if they choose to offset benefits that the insured is receiving from \u201cother valid coverage.\u201d <em>See </em>Cal. Ins. Code \u00a7 10369.6. Section 10369.7 provides nearly identical rules for disability policies when the insured has duplicate \u201cvalid loss of time coverage\u201d that exceeds his predisability income. <em>See </em>Cal. Ins.Code \u00a7 10369.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Both sections further provide that an insurer may use a definition of \u201cother valid coverage\u201d (\u00a7 10369.6) or \u201cvalid loss of time coverage\u201d (\u00a7 10369.7), but the definition must be limited to coverage provided by organizations subject to insurance law regulation in the United States or Canada, or coverage approved by the Commissioner. <em>See </em>Cal. Ins.Code \u00a7\u00a7 10369.6, 10369.7. If the policy does not include such a definition, the term \u201cshall not include ... benefits provided by ... employee benefit organizations.\u201d Cal. Ins.Code \u00a7\u00a7 10369.6, 10369.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">Baker argues that USAA does not include in its policy any definition of \u201cother valid coverage\u201d or \u201cvalid loss of time coverage,\u201d but uses the definition of \u201cincome\u201d to determine offset eligibility. Because the language does not track and is less favorable to Baker than the model language in the statutes, Baker contends that USAA\u2019s definition of \u201cincome\u201d violates Sections 10369.1, 10369.6, and 10369.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">Baker has failed to establish a statutory basis for holding that USAA\u2019s treatment of his LACERA benefits as \u201cincome\u201d violates Insurance Code Sections 10369.6 or 10369.7. By the statutes\u2019 own terms, offset of benefits from employee benefit organizations are not prohibited. The statutes limit their scope to \u201ccoverage\u201d provided by organizations subject to insurance laws, and benefits from employee benefit organi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>zations are specifically mentioned as not constituting \u201ccoverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">In this case, Baker himself admits that LACERA is an employee benefit organization and not subject to state insurance law or insurance regulatory agencies. He contends, rather, that because the sections do not apply to USAA\u2019s policy, and because they provide the only avenue for an insurer to offset its disability obligations, the USAA policy is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">However, Baker has identified no authority indicating that the California legislature intended Sections 10369.6 and 10369.7 to, as he puts it, \u201coccupy the field\u201d in this area. Insurance law is detailed and the subject area is well-regulated. If the legislature wanted to prohibit offsets of any variety against benefits from non-insurers, it could easily have done so. It has not, and therefore USAA\u2019s treatment of Baker\u2019s LACERA benefits does not violate either Section 10369.6 or 10369.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Since Baker\u2019s breach of contract claim is premised on the policy\u2019s alleged violation of either section of the Insurance Code, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor <em>of </em>USAA on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">B. Breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Because Baker\u2019s breach of covenant claim is similarly premised on alleged violations of the Insurance Code, and we hold that Baker failed to identify a material question of fact as to whether USAA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cincome\u201d in its insurance policy violates the statutes at issue, the district court properly granted partial summary judgment in favor of USAA on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">C. Unfair business practices and deceptive trade practice</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">Baker\u2019s allegations that USAA engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfair business practices under California law are unwarranted. The district court did not clearly err in finding that LAC-ERA is an employee benefit organization not subject to regulation by insurance law or agencies. The court\u2019s determination is supported by the record, and as previously noted, Baker concedes this point in his brief. The court\u2019s factual finding provides the basis for concluding that USAA did not engage in deceptive trade practices or unfair business practices. We agree with the district court\u2019s determination: if the policy provision does not violate California law, it is not an unfair or deceptive practice to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">D. Policy ambiguity</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">Baker contends in his brief that the USAA policy is ambiguous because the definition of \u201cincome\u201d does not explicitly include \u201cservice-connected disability retirement\u201d benefits but only \u201cretirement\u201d benefits. He argues that service-connected disability benefits might be considered disability benefits and therefore not includable as \u201cincome\u201d under the policy. Baker urges us to construe this policy ambiguity against USAA and disallow the offset against his LACERA benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">Because this argument was not raised in the district court, we decline to consider it for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Robertson, </em>52 <em>F.3d </em>789, 791 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b831-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the court of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
