Code 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The pertinent facts are in the trial judge\u2019s order set forth below. A summary of the facts discloses that at approximately 6;00 p.m. on December 5, 2013, Watson\u2019s frightened female cousin, Datrial Allen-Cathey, summoned him to come to her home because a female stranger, the victim, Lisa Langston, appeared to be having some type of psychotic episode in Cathey\u2019s yard. Watson, armed with a pistol, immediately went to Cathey\u2019s residence, where he encountered Langston in the yard. He did not know Langston. Langston was foaming at the mouth and barking like a dog. She immediately accused Watson of killing her baby and charged toward him, exclaiming that she intended to kill him. Langston was \u201cfidgeting\u201d with something at her waist as she charged toward'Watson. Watson fired once into the ground to scare Langston, but she shouted that she was not afraid of guns and continued to rush toward Watson.' Watson fired a second time striking Langston in her arm. However, the bullet traveled into her body striking her lung. She died of the gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">On May 8, 2014, Watson was indicted for Langston\u2019s murder. On October 9, 2014, Watson filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that pursuant to \u00a7 13A-3\u201423(d), Ala. Code 1975, he was entitled to immunity from prosecution because his use of deadly physical force was justified under the circumstances and, thus, lawful. Section 13A-3-23, Ala. Code 1975, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">\u201c(a) A person is justified in using physical force upon another person in order to defend himself or herself or a third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by that other person, and he or she may use a degree of force which he or she reasonably believes to be necessary for the purpose.

This Court conducted an evidentiary hearing on this motion on October 6, 2015. The following witnesses appeared before the court and.provided testimony in this matter: Joshua Watson, Datrial Allen-Cathey, Demetrius Watson, [and] Shelby County Deputy Sheriff John Shearon. Having considered the pleadings, the testimony of witnesses presented by the State of Alabama and [Watson] defendant, the evidence presented during the hearing, together with the argument of counsel and the briefs submitted by the parties, the Court makes the following findings of facts and conclusions of law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">\u201cFINDINGS OF FACTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aghm-dedup-0\">\u201cFirst, this Honorable Court heard the testimony of Mr. Joshua Watson, the brother of Demetrius Watson. Joshua testified that on the night of December 5, 2013, he, along with his girlfriend, was traveling down Highway 31 in Calera, AL when they observed a train stopped at the entrance of Slab Hill Road. Joshua testified that [he] observed an unknown woman, later identified to be Mrs. Lisa Langston, pulled over on the side of the road (at the intersection of Highway 31 and Slab- Hill Road). As he drove closer to Mrs. Langston\u2019s truck, Joshua testified that it appeared she was beating something in the back of the truck. Joshua testified that he proceeded to turn onto 'Slab Hill Road and observed Mrs. Langston hysterically screaming for someone named Haley and acting very erratic. Joshua testified that while he attempted to speak to Mrs. Langston, she acted as if she never saw him and appeared to \u2018stare right through him.\u2019 Joshua then observed Mrs. Langston leave her truck (with the driver side door still open) and head to the stopped train. Joshua then testified that he observed Mrs. Langston crawl underneath the train, stumble several times, and then proceed down Slab Hill Road toward his families\u2019 property. Out of concern for the safety of his family, including several young children who often play outside, Joshua testified that he contacted his family by phone and to warn them and described Mrs. Lang-ston\u2019s erratic behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">\u201cMoments later, and almost 600 feet from the stopped train, Mrs. Langston arrived at the doorstep of Mrs. Datrial Allen-Cathey, the cousin of [Watson]. Mrs. Cathey testified that she had just returned home from a chemotherapy appointment and that it had started to turn dark. Mrs. Cathey testified that [she], her three children (ages 13, 11, and 8), Melissa Thomas and Connie Baker, were at home when they heard noise and loud knocks on the door. Ms. Cathey testified that she and Ms. Thomas went to the door and observed Mrs. Langston acting alarmingly erratic and repeatedly screaming that \u2018[her] husband killed [her] daughter\u2019 and .that her daughter was hung in a tree.behind Mrs.-Cathey\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASZi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>..\u201cMrs. Cathey testified that because they could not calm Mrs. Langston down and that her behavior was. frightening her and her children, she called [Watson] and told him to come and help immediately. Mrs. Cathey testified that once [Watson] arrived, Mrs. Langston took off after him while hysterically screaming, \u201cYou killed my baby, you killed my baby.\u2019 Ms. Cathey also testified that, at one point, [Mrs. Langston] broke through a wooden fence in order to charge towards [Watson]. She testified that [Watson] attempted numerous times to calm Mrs. Langston down, but to no avail. At this time, Mrs. Cathey called 911 and explained to the dispatcher that an unknown woman was at her house, going crazy, rolling around in the yard, scaring her and her kids, and yelling that her husband had killed her daughter. While still on the phone with the 911 dispatcher, Mrs. Cathey observed Mrs. Langston charge at [Watson], Mrs. Cathey then testified that [Watson] fired a warning shot into the ground, but that Mrs. Langston kept advancing onto [Watson] and screamed, \u2018I am not scared of any gun\u2019 and continued rushing towards him. [Watson] then shot once more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-3\">\u201c[Watson] next testified. Upon arriving at Mrs. Cathey\u2019s house, [Watson] testified that he observed an unknown woman foaming at' the mouth, on all fours, and constantly rolling back and forth on the ground. [Watson] testified that he repeatedly and calmly requested Mrs. Langston to leave their property numerous times, but that Mrs. Langston refused. Instead, Mrs. Langston began to hysterically scream at [Watson] that he was the one who, in fact, had killed her daughter and that she was going to kill him. Mrs. Langston then began to advance towards [Watson]. [Watson] testified that he immediately warned her that he was armed and to stop. Mrs. Langston disregarded this warning and kept charging towards \u2022 him. [Watson] then pulled out his pistol, -[for] which he has a valid permit, and fired a warning shot into the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cHowever, in spite of this second warning to stop, Mrs.' Langston screamed that a gun did not scare her and kept advancing towards [Watson] while still threatening to kill him. Mrs. Langston was fidgeting around her waist with her hands. Mrs. Langston then attempted to attack [Watson]. Due to Mrs. Langston\u2019s constant fidgeting around her waist as well \u25a0 as it being dark, [Watson] testified that he had no way of knowing if Mrs. Langston had a weapon. At this time, [Watson] testified that he fired an additional shot in order to protect himself and his family. The 911 tape shows that.within three sec- \u2019 onds or so from the warning shot, [Watson] fired this second shot hitting her in the arm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201c[Watson] testified that he immediately told everyone to get inside. He then took the phone from Mrs. Cathey in order to speak to the 911 dispatcher. During this conversation as well as the ensuing interview with the lead detective, [Watson] explained that Mrs. Lang-ston threatened to kill him, initially grabbed him, and kept coming at him. [Watson] testified that he was scared for his life and that he had no , other choice as it was necessary in order to protect himself and his family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\u201cSheriff John Shear on, the lead detective on the case, testified in response to a question posed by [Watson\u2019s] attorney that he had nothing to dispute that [Watson] feared for his life and that he was acting in self-defense at the time of the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\u201cIncluded in the exhibits provided to this Court were the psychiatric records of Mrs. Lisa Langston, an autopsy report, and toxicology report. Found within these records are proof that Mrs. Langston had been previously diagnosed with a bi-polar disorder as well as depression and that she was currently prescribed numerous medications in order to curb the effects of this disorder. The autopsy report showed that the time of Mrs. Langston\u2019s death, she was approximately 5'2\" and weighed 172 lbs. The toxicology reports showed the following medications found in Mrs. Langston\u2019s system, (1) Doxepin; (2) Xanax; (3) Se-roquel; and (4) Bupropion. In addition to this medication, Mrs. Langston had a 0.18 BAC[, blood alcohol content,] at the time of her death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\u201cLEGAL ANALYSIS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ahg-dedup-1\">\u201cIn 2005, the Florida State Legislature passed what has become known as the \u2018Stand-your-Ground\u2019 law. Approximately twenty-four (24) states have followed the lead of Florida in passing similar laws. In 2006, Alabama became one of these twenty-four states when the new self-defense law took effect, creating a presumption that citizens are justified in using self-defense when they believe someone has unlawfully entered their dwelling, as well as authorizing citizens to stand their ground when attacked anywhere outside the home where they have a right to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201cThe amended Alabama Code Sections dealing with self-defense essentially changed the law in three major ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\u201c1) A presumption was created for a person, using deadly force who has a reasonable belief that another person is: (a) using or about to use unlawful deadly physical force; (b) using or about to use physical force against an occupant of a dwelling while committing or attempting to commit a burglary of such dwelling, (c) committing or about to commit a kidnapping in any degree, assault in the first or second degree, burglary in any degree, robbery in any degree, forcible rape, or forcible sodomy. See \u00a7 13A-3-23(a), Ala. Code 1975;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201c2) A person attacked where he or she has a right to be and who is not engaged in an unlawful activity may \u2018stand his or her ground\u2019 and use deadly force without any duty to retreat. See \u00a7 13A-3-23(b), Ala. Code 1975; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">\u201c3) A person employing the use of deadly force in self-defense or as justified by law is now immune from criminal prosecution or civil liability and should not be arrested absent a determination that the force used was unlawful. See \u00a7\u00a7 13A-3-23(d) &amp; (e), Ala. Code 1975.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">\u201cTherefore, a person meeting the requirements of Ala. Code [1975,] \u00a7 13A-3\u201423(a), is exempt and free from the burden of criminal prosecution or civil litigation. Accordingly, Ala. Code [1975,] \u00a7 13A-3-23(d), provides not just a defense at trial but a bar to trial. This Court has found one Alabama case concerning the processes and procedures for invoking and adjudicating such statutory immunity. State of Alabama v. Robert Allen Carleton, 114 So.3d 165 (Ala.Crim.App.2011) (affirmed without opinion). Additionally, the Court has also looked at other jurisdictions for guidance. Multiple state appellate courts, from jurisdictions with similar copycat \u2018Stand-your-Ground\u2019 legislation, have addressed similar statutory silence and have judicially established certain procedures. Each state appellate court, which has reviewed and addressed \u2018Stand-your-Ground\u2019 -type immunity claims, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>determined that the accused has a right to a pre-trial evidentiary hearing to adjudicate the accused[\u2019s] entitlement to the statutory immunity. This Court has relied upon the legal analysis of other jurisdictions-in establishing the procedure utilized by the Court in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">\u201cColorado appellate courts were the first to address the entitlement to a hearing and the procedures thereto. In People v. Guenther, 740 P.2d 971, 975 (Colo.1987), interpreting their \u2018Stand-your-Ground\u2019 statute, the Supreme Court of Colorado found as follows: \u2018In accordance with the plain meaning of these terms, the phrase \u201cshall be immune from 'criminal prosecution\u201d can only be construed to mean that the statute was intended to bar criminal proceedings against a person for the use of force under the circumstances set forth in subsection (2) of section 18-1-704.5.\u2019 In the silence of statutorily delineated procedures, that Guenther Court proceeded to find that their \u2018Stand-your-Ground\u2019 statute: confers authority on a court to conduct a pretrial hearing on whether the statutory conditions-for immunity from prosecution have been established and, if so established, to dismiss the criminal charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cFollowing the reasoning of the Guen-ther Court, the\u2019 District Court of Appeals of Florida also found the right of the accused to an evidentiary pre-trial hearing on the claims of statutory immunity, pursuant to the Florida \u2018Stand-your-Ground\u2019 law. After analyzing their \u2018Stand-your-Ground\u2019 statute, this Florida intermediate appellate court declared: \u2018[T]he wording selected by our Legislature makes clear that it intended to establish a true immunity and not merely. an affirmative defense.\u2019 Peterson v. State, 983 So.2d 27, 29 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2008). Therefore, the Court held, \u2018[[likewise, we hold that a defendant may raise the question- of statutory immunity pretrial and, when such a claim is raised, the trial court must determine whether [Watson] has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the immunity attaches.\u2019 Id. These Courts imposed the same burden of proof as [they] would in motions for post-conviction relief or motions to suppress. Id. See also McDaniel v. Florida, 24 So.3d 654 (2010); Horn v. Florida, 17 So.3d 836 (2009). Based upon the witness testimony and the evidence offered during the evidentiary hearing, as well as all of the above, this Court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201c1. The events of December 5, 2013, occurred in an isolated neighborhood in rural Shelby County, in the dark of night, and after [Watson received] a call from his brother about an erratically behaving woman approaching his property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u201c2. [Watson] encountered an unknown woman on all fours, rolling around on the ground, and acting very erratie[ally].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvDH\">\u201c3. [Watson] calmly and repeatedly tried to get the woman to leave the property without success.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">' \u201c4. The woman rushed towards [Watson] screaming that 'she was going to kill him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">\u201c5. [Watson] was in possession of his gun, which he has a license to carry, for his safety as well as his family\u2019s, safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\">\u201c6. [Watson] warned the woman that he was armed and [that] she needed to stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">\u201c7. She refused and instead threatened to kill him and charged toward him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-14\">\u201c8. She continued to aggressively approach him and threatened to kill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>[Watson] even after he fired a warning shot towards the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u25a0 \u201c9. Scared for his life as well as his family\u2019s, [Watson] had to make a split-second decision and fired a second shot at her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">\u201c10. [Watson] testified -dearly he had no other choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">\u201c11. [Watson] had no criminal history and was honorably discharged from the Marines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\u201c12. There was no evidence that [Watson] had any animosity toward Ms. Langston [and] that he was motivated by anything other than reasonable fear of serious bodily harm to himself or others present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">\u201cIt is this Court\u2019s findings that [Watson] reasonably perceived that this could have resulted in great bodily harm or death to him or a family member. For this reason, [Watson\u2019s] use of force is protected and immunized by the statute as he had the right to .be present; was free from fault, and had the right to defend himself and others from serious bodily harm or death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">\u201cThe Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence, that [Watson] has met his burden of proving that he is entitled to the immunity provisions of Alabama Code 13A-3-23(d) and (e).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">\u201cTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED [Watson\u2019s] Motion to Dismiss the indictment is hereby granted and the indictment is hereby dismissed with prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1NW\">(Capitalization in original.)(Vol. 1, CR. 145-153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">On November 19, 2015, the State filed a notice of appeal.

(regarding' a pretrial appeal by the State).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">The State contends bn appeal, as it did in its posthearing brief to the circuit court, that there was insufficient evidence 'presented at the immunity hearing\u215bto establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Watson was justified in using deadly force.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State asserts that- \u201c[although the circumstances [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] faced by Watson were disturbing, the evidence at the pretrial immunity hearing failed to establish that his use of deadly force., against Lisa Langston was justified.\u201d (State\u2019s brief, p. 11.) Moreover, the State contends that the evidence was insufficient because Watson was armed with a pistol when he approached Langston; thus, the State argues, he was not free from fault in creating a dangerous situation and cannot prevail on an. assertion that he acted in self-defense. The State further contends that the evidence was insufficient because Watson had no reason to suspect that Langston possessed a deadly weapon; thus, his use of a deadly weapon was not justified. Finally, the State argues that the evidence was insufficient because, it argues, Watson claimed both that the shooting was an unintentional accident and that it was an intentional act of self-defense. The State asserts that the two defenses cannot coexist.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201c \u201cWhen evidence is presented ore ten-us to the trial court, the court\u2019s findings of fact based on that evidence are presumed to be correct,\u2019 Ex parte Perkins, 646 So.2d 46, 47 (Ala.1994); \u2018[w]e indulge a presumption that the trial court properly ruled on the weight and probative force of the evidence,\u2019 Bradley v.

Golden, 897 So.2d 268, 271 (Ala.2004)(quoting Ex parte Cater, 772 So.2d 1117, 1119 (Ala.2000)). The trial court\u2019s factual findings in favor of Watson are supported by the record. \u201cAbsent a gross abuse of discretion, a trial court\u2019s resolution of [conflicts in the testimony or credibility of witnesses] should not be reversed on appeal.\u201d Sheely v. State, 629 So.2d 23, 29 (Ala.Crim.App.1993)(citations omitted).
