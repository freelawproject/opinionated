R.Crim. P., attacking his capital-murder convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-21\">In December 2005, Woods was convicted of four counts of capital murder for murdering Birmingham Police Officers Carlos Owen, Harley A. Chisholm III,  and Charles R. Bennett, while they were on duty, and for murdering the three officers pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, violations of \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(5) and 13A-5-40(a)(10), Ala.Code 1975.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Woods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>was also convicted of attempting to murder Officer Michael Collins. The jury recommended, by a vote of 10 to 2, that Woods be sentenced to death for his capital-murder convictions. The circuit court followed the jury\u2019s recommendation and sentenced Woods to death,. Woods was sentenced to life imprisonment for the attempted-murder conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">On direct appeal, this Court initially remanded the case to the circuit court for that court to correct its sentencing order. <em>See Woods v. State, </em>13 So.3d 1 (Ala.Crim.App.2007), On return to remand, we affirmed Woods\u2019s convictions and sentence of death. <em>See Woods v. State, </em>13 So.3d at 41 (opinion on return to remand). Woods neither filed an application for rehearing in this \u00f3ourt or a petition for a writ of certio-rari to the Alabama Supreme Court; therefore, this Court issued a certif\u00edcate of judgment on January 9, 2008. <em>See </em>Rule 41(a), Ala. R.App. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">In May 2008, this Court was notified that Woods had attempted to file an out-of-time appeal in the Alabama Supreme Court. On May 6, 2008, the Supreme Court notified Woods and this Court that it would not consider that motion until this Court had denied a motion to file \u00e1n out-of-time application for rehearing. On May 9, 2008, more than five months after this Court affirmed Woods\u2019s convictions, Woods moved that' this Court set aside the certificate of judgment issued in January 2008 and allow him to file an application for rehearing. The State opposed this motion. In Octob\u00e9r 2008, this Court denied Woods\u2019s motion. In August 2009, the Alabama Supreme Court denied Woods\u2019s motion for an out-of-time appeal to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">Meanwhile, in December 2008, Woods filed a-petition for postconviction relief in the Jefferson Circuit Court and a request that the circuit court stay the proceedings until the Alabama Supreme Court issued a ruling on his request for an out-of-time appeal. The circuit court granted Woods\u2019s motion and stayed the Rule 32 proceedings. In December 2010, after the Supreme Court denied Woods\u2019s request for an out-of-time appeal, the circuit court issued an 80-page order dismissing Woods\u2019s Rule 32, Ala. R.Crim, P., petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">In its order sentencing Woods-to death, the circuit court set out the following facts surrounding the\u2019 triple homicide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABfo\">\u201cOn June 17th, 2004 Birmingham police officers Carlos Owen, Harley A. Chisholm III, Charles R. Bennett and Michael Collins \u25a0 went to an apartment located at 1619 18th Street, Ensley, Birmingham, Alabama, to serve an arrest warrant on a Nathaniel Woods, who had been identified earlier in the day by these officers as being at this location. Prior to the officers\u2019s arrival at this location, a dispatcher at Fairfield Police Department verified that an assault warrant was valid and unserved on Woods. The officers obtained an NCIC [National Crime Information Center] printout of the outstanding charges and a! photo of Nathaniel Woods. The location of the apartment where the officers had earlier contact with Nathaniel' Woods was in an area comprised primarily of residential homes just a few blocks from the West Precinct of the Birmingham Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>\u201cOfficers Carlos Owen and Michael Collins went to the. rear- door of the apartment, and Officers Chisholm and Bennett went to the front door of the apartment. Nathaniel Woods came to the rear door with the screen door still in place between the officers and Woods. Officer Owen informed Woods that he had an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Woods responded with, \u2018F-you. I don\u2019t have no warrant.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-6\">\u2018Woods was told several times that they had a warrant for his arrest. Officer Chisholm came around to the back of the apartment and from outside the screen door showed Woods the NCIC report and his photo. Woods responded, \u2018That\u2019s not me. F- that.\u2019 He then turned and retreated into the apartment. Officer Chisholm opened the screen door to go after Woods. He was followed by Officer Owen and Officer Collins. While the officers were attempting to take Woods into custody in the doorway between the kitchen and the living room area of the apartment, Officer Collins heard Woods say, \u2018Don\u2019t spray me with that mace.\u2019 At about the same time, Officer Collins heard a radio transmission from Officer Bennett, wherein Bennett yelled, \u2018They are coming out the front.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-8\">\u201cOfficer Collins turned and was leaving through the back screen door of the \u00e1partment to assist Officer Bennett at the front when he heard gunfire from inside the apartment and'felt something hit him on his right side. He stood outside the apartment for a few seconds, and put out a radio broadcast, \u2018Shots fired. Double aught. Officer down.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-9\">\u201cHe could tell bullets were coming out the back door hitting different objects around him and knew he was being shot at by someone from inside the apartment. He took cover behind his patrol car and saw a male he later determined to be the co-defendant, Kerry Spencer, just outside the back door shooting at him with an SKS rifle.\u201d . ;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-12\">(Trial Record, C.R. 92-94.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-13\">In this Court\u2019s opinion on Woods\u2019s direct appeal, we detailed the overwhelming evidence that was presented against\u2019 Woods to show that Woods was an accomplice to the shootings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avhj-dedup-0\">\u201cThe State established that Woods and Spencer had engaged in a hostile, profanity-laced \u2019argument with Officers Owen and Collins on the morning of the shootings, and that'Woods threatened Officer Owen by stating: \u2018Take off that badge and I will f-you up.\u201d (R. 501.) Officer Sanders testified that Officer Chisolm had told him that Woods -had taunted the police by saying, \u2018You can\u2019t get me,\u2019 and then running into the apartment. (R. 639.) Marquita McClure and Markesha Williams testified that, after the police left, Woods stated that he would kill the police. Fernando Belser testified that' Spencer said that if the police did not stop harassing him, he would \u2018light \u2018em up,\u2019 and that Woods had said \u2018[bjasically the same thing\u2019 Spencer had said. (R. 762.) McClure asked Woods to leave the apartment with her, but Woods told her that he wanted to stay with Spencer in case the police came back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-18\">-\u2022 \u201cOfficer Collins testified that when the officers returned to the apartment to arrest Woods, a man who had been outside said that he wanted no part of what was to take place. When the officers told Woods that they had a warrant for his arrest and attempted to take him into custody^ Woods cursed them and refused to come outside. He told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>officers, \u2018If you come in here, we\u2019ll f-you up.\u2019 (R. 694.) He then turned and ran toward the back of the apartment, causing the officers to pursue him to the doorway between the kitchen and the living room. Belser had previously testified that no one went beyond the kitchen area of the apartment unless Woods or Spencer invited them, and he said that anyone who did so could \u2018get hurt pretty bad\u2019 or \u2018something could happen to them.\u2019 (R. 754.) Spencer appeared with the assault rifle, and he fired it repeatedly, shooting Officers Owen and Chisolm multiple times. Woods told Spencer that another officer was at the front door, and Spencer turned and also shot Officer Bennett multiple times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-5\">\u201cSpencer and Woods ran from the apartment together; they ran to John Prather\u2019s house because Woods knew Prather. After they burst into Prather\u2019s house, Spencer and Woods let Prather know that he would be compensated for letting them stay there, and Prather deduced that the pair had been involved in the shooting nearby. Woods told Spencer, \u2018You came through for me,\u2019 Prather said. (R. 842.) Michael Scott was inside Prather\u2019s house when Woods and Spencer entered, and he heard Woods say something like, \u2018 \u201cThey f-ed with the wrong niggers. We shot their asses.\u201d \u2019 (R. 860.) Scott described Woods\u2019s demeanor as calm, not upset, when he made this statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_N2\">\u201cAfter Woods was arrested, Officer Owen\u2019s weapon was recovered from Prather\u2019s house, behind a heater near where Woods had been sitting. Although Spencer testified at his trial that he took Officer Owen\u2019s gun before he left the apartment, in his statement to the police on the afternoon of the shooting, Spencer denied taking the weapon, thus permitting an inference that Woods walked into the kitchen after the shooting and took the officer\u2019s weapon before he and Spencer left the apartment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1186-10\">13 So.3d at 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-11\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-12\">Woods appeals the circuit court\u2019s summary dismissal of his Rule 32 petition. According to Rule 32.3, Ala. R.Crim. P., \u201c[t]he petitioner shall have the burden of pleading and proving by a preponderance of the evidence the facts necessary to entitle the petitioner to relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-13\">Rule 32.6(b), Ala. R.Crim. P., addresses the burden of pleading; in December 2010 it provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-14\">\u201cThe petition must contain a clear and specific statement of the grounds upon which relief is sought, including full disclosure of the factual basis of those grounds. <em>A bare allegation that a constitutional right has been violated and mere conclusions of law shall not be sufficient to warrant any further proceedings.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1186-15\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-16\">In discussing the pleading requirements of Rule 32.6(b), Ala.

State, </em>638 So.2d 1370, 1373 (Ala.Crim.App.1993). It is the allegation of facts in pleading which, if true, entitlefs] a petitioner to relief.

Conclusions unsupported by specific facts will not satisfy the requirements of Rule 32.3 and Rule 32.6(b). The <em>jfull factual basis </em>for the claim must be included in the petition itself. If, assuming every factual allegation in a Rule 32 petition to be true, a court cannot determine whether the petitioner is entitled to relief, the petitioner has not satisfied the burden of pleading under Rule 32.3 and Rule 32.6(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\"><em>Hyde v. State, </em>950 So.2d 344, 356 (Ala.Crim.App.2006) (emphasis added). \u201cThe pleading requirements of Rule 32 apply equally to capital cases in which the death penalty has been imposed.\u201d <em>Taylor v. State, </em>157 So.3d 131, 140 (Ala.Crim.App.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">More recently, the Alabama Supreme Court in <em>Ex parte Beckworth, </em>190 So.3d 571 (Ala.2013), addressed the sufficiency of pleadings in postconviction proceedings and held that the petitioner has no burden to plead the absence of a ground of preclusion in the pleading stage. Specifically, the court held that \u201cBeckworth\u2019s Rule 32 petition should not have been dismissed on the ground that his claim for relief under Rule 32.1(a) lacked allegations negating the preclusive bars of Rule 32.2(a)(3) and (5).\u201d 190 So.3d at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">Furthermore, this Court does not apply a plain-error standard of review when reviewing the dismissal or denial of a postconviction petition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-10\">\u201cThough we reviewed the claims on [Woods\u2019s] direct appeal for plain error, the plain-error standard of review does not apply to a postconviction petition attacking a capital-murder conviction and death sentence. See <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>13 So.3d 418, 424 (Ala.Crim.App.2008); <em>Waldrop v. State, </em>987 So.2d 1186 (Ala.Crim.App.2007); <em>Hall v.

When reviewing the circuit court\u2019s rulings on the claims raised in [Walker\u2019s] postconviction petition, we apply an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gaddy, </em>952 So.2d at 1154.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATcb\"><em>Ray v.

R.Crim. P. Woods makes only general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>arguments that the circuit court erred in summarily dismissing his petition, that there is nothing onerous about the pleading requirements for postconviction petitions, and that the pleading requirements impose no burden on a petitioner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Woods appears to argue that the civil notice-pleading standards apply to postconviction proceedings. \u25a0 The circuit court specifically stated the following. concerning Woods\u2019s burden of pleading his claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-3\">\u201c \u2018The burden of pleading under Rule 32.3 and Rule 32.6(b) is a heavy one.\u2019 <em>Hyde v. State, </em>950 So.2d 344, 356 (Ala.Crim.App.2006). Under the plain language, of Rule 32, the .precise claims and supporting facts presented in a Rule 32 petition must be apparent from the face of the petition. See Ala. R.Crim. P. 32.3; Ala. R.Crim. P. 32.6(b); <em>Boyd </em>[v. <em>State], </em>913 So.2d [1113] at 1125 [ (Ala.Crim.App.2003) ]. \u2018The petition must contain a clear and specific statement of the grounds upon which relief is sought, including disclosure of the factual basis of those grounds.\u2019 Ala. R.Crim. P. 32.6(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-4\">\u201cTo survive summary disposition, a Rule 32 claim must disclose - specific facts, which, if true, entitle the petitioner to relief. <em>Burgess [v. State], </em>962 So.2d [272] at 295 [ (Ala.Crim.App.2005)]; <em>Boyd, </em>913 So.2d at 1125; Ala. R.Crim. P. 32.6(b); see also Ala. R.Crim. P. 32.7(d) (providing that the court may dismiss the petition if it \u2018determines that the petition is not sufficiently specific). \u2018The full factual basis for the claim must be included in the petition itself.\u2019 <em>Hyde, </em>950 So.2d at 356 .... \u2018If, assuming every factual allegation in a Rule 32 petition to be true, a court cannot determine whether the petitioner is entitled to relief, the petitioner has not satisfied the burden of pleading under Rule 32.3 and Rule 32.6(b).\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">(Suppl.C.R.31-32.) The circuit court accurately cited the current law in regard to pl\u00e9ading claims in a postconviction proceeding. It is clear after reviewing the circuit court\u2019s order that the court was aware of the legal distinction between the burden of pleading and the burden of proof in postconviction proceedings and did not confuse the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">Neither do we agree with Woods\u2019s characterization of the pleading requirements of Rule 32, Ala. R.Crim. P. This Court has on numerous occasions stated that the pleading requirements for postconviction petitions are more stringent than those for civil proceedings and are not analogous to the civil notice pleadings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae3W\">\u201cAlthough postconviction proceedings are civil in nature, they are governed by the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure. See Rule 32.4, Ala. R.Crim. P. The \u2018notice pleading1 requirements restive to civil cases do not apply to Rule 32 proceedings. \u2018Unlike the general requirements related to civil cases, the pleading requirements for postconviction petitions are more stringent...,\u2019 <em>Daniel v. State, </em>86 So.3d 405, 410-11 (Ala.Crim.App.2011). Rule 32.6(b), Ala. R.Crim. P., requires that full facts be pleaded in the petition if the petition is to survive summary dismissal. See <em>Daniel, </em>supra. Thus, to satisfy the requirements for pleading as they relate to postconviction petitions, Washington was required to plead full facts to support each individual claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number><em>Washington v. State, </em>95 So.3d 26, 59 (Ala.Crim.App.2012). <em>See also Spencer v. State, </em>201 So.3d 573 (Ala.Crim.App.2015); <em>Davis v. State, </em>184 So.3d 415 (Ala.Crim.App.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">Woods also argues that the circuit court unfairly dismissed the postcon-viction petition without giving him notice of the insufficiency of the petition. Here, the State filed its response to Woods\u2019s petition on July 21, 2010, and filed an amended response on July 27, 2010. However, the circuit court did not issue its order dismissing Woods\u2019s petition until December 1, 2010. Woods had more than an ample opportunity to respond to the State\u2019s answer. More importantly, there is no provision in Rule 32, Ala. R.Crim. P., that requires a circuit court to notify the petitioner before dismissing a petition that fails to comply with the pleading requirements of Rule. 32.6(b), Ala. R.Crim. P. <em>See Mashburn v. State, </em>148 So.3d 1094 (Ala.Crim.App.2013); <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>105 So.3d 1234, 1244 (Ala.Crim.App.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">For the foregoing reasons, Woods is due no relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-8\">Woods next argues that the circuit court erred in summarily dismissing his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel because they lacked specificity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA9B\">\u201cTo sufficiently plead an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, a Rule 32 petitioner not only must \u2018identify the [specific] acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment,\u2019 Strickland <em>v</em>. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), but also must plead specific facts indicating that he or she was prejudiced by the acts or omissions, i.e., facts indicating \u2018that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. <em>A bare allegation that prejudice occurred without specific facts indicating how the petitioner was prejudiced is not sufficient.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1189-11\"><em>Hyde, </em>950 So.2d at 356 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A63c\">\u201c \u2018The claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a general allegation that often consists of numerous .specific subcategories. Each subcategory is an independent claim that .must., .be sufficiently pleaded.\u2019 <em>Coral v. State, </em>900 So.2d 1274, 1284 (Ala.Crim.App.2004), rev\u2019d on other grounds, <em>Ex parte Jenkins, </em>972 So.2d 159 (Ala.2005).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1189-12\"><em>Daniel v. State, </em>86 So.3d 405, 416 (Ala.Crim.App.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-13\">Woods first argues that the circuit court should have considered his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims cumulatively when deciding whether those claims met the pleading requirements of Rule.32, Ala. R.Crim. P. However, in addressing this argument, this Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-14\">\u201cTaylor ... contends that the allegations offered, in support of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be considered cumulatively, and he cites <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). However, this Court has noted: \u2018Other states and federal co\u00fcrts are not in agreement as to whether the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d analysis' applies <em>to Strickland [v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984)] claims\u2019; this Court has also stated: \u2018We can find no case where Alabama appellate courts have applied the cumulative-effect analysis to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u2019 <em>Brooks v. State, </em>929 So.2d 491, 514 (Ala.Crim.App.2005) ...; see also <em>McNabb v. State, </em>991 So.2d 313, 332 (Ala.Crim.App.2007); and <em>Hunt v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>940 So.2d 1041, 1071 (Ala.Crim.App.2005). More to the point, however, is the fact that even when a cumulative-effect analysis is considered, only claims that are properly pleaded and not otherwise due to be summarily dismissed are considered in that analysis. A cumulative-effect analysis does not eliminate the pleading requirements established in Rule 32, Ala. R.Crim. P. An analysis of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, including a cumulative-effect analysis, is performed only on properly pleaded claims that are not summarily dismissed for pleading deficiencies or on procedural grounds. Therefore, even if a cumulative-effect analysis were required by Alabama law, that factor would not eliminate Taylor\u2019s obligation to plead each claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in compliance with the directives of Rule 32.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\"><em>Taylor v. State, </em>157 So.3d 131, 140 (Ala.Crim.App.2010). The circuit court did not err in considering each of Woods\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel individually and not cumulatively when considering the sufficiency of Woods\u2019s pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">Woods makes only one specific argument in this section of his brief. He argues that the circuit court erred in summarily dismissing his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to secure the services of a handwriting expert to counter the State\u2019s handwriting expert. In his Rule 32, Ala. R.Crim. P., petition, Woods merely pleaded the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-6\">\u201cTrial counsel failed to present an independent handwriting expert, who could have contradicted the testimony of the State\u2019s handwriting expert that Mr. Woods had written lyrics found in his cell. If trial counsel had done so, they would have been able to attack the State\u2019s assertions that these lyrics represented an admission of the offense by Mr. Woods.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">(C.R.408.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-9\">Evidence at Woods\u2019s trial established that police discovered a drawing in Woods\u2019s cell that depicted two men shooting firearms. \u201cOne man is shooting an assault rifle and three flaming skulls are depicted in the blasts from that weapon, and the other man is shooting two handguns. The drawing contains a heading at the top, \u2018NATE [Woods\u2019s nickname] $ NOOKIE [Spencer\u2019s nickname],\u2019 and depicts street signs at an intersection of \u201818th Street and Ensley.\u2019 When Deputy Gillum removed the drawing, Woods said that the drawing was his and that he wanted it back.\u201d 13 So.3d at 14. The following lyrics, that were handwritten on a document in Woods\u2019s cell, were also discovered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adfb\">\u201c \u2018Seven execution styles murders</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-10\">I have no remorse because I\u2019m the f-ing murderer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-12\">Haven\u2019t you ever heard of a killa</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArDV\">I drop pigs like [codefendant] Kerry Spencer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-13\">So when I walk around strapped</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-14\">One time bust the caps and watch pigs elapse</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-16\">Snapp, adapt to this because I needs no adapter this is just the first chapter.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATqT\">13 So.3d at 14. The State\u2019s expert testified that Woods wrote the lyrics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-17\">When summarily dismissing the claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to secure a handwriting expert, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-18\">\u201cWoods fails to specify exactly what information an \u2018independent handwriting expert\u2019 would have uncovered, how this unnamed expert would have uncovered such information, whether/how trial counsel could have located the expert, whether the expert would have been available to testify at Woods\u2019s trial, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>how the expert would have contradicted the testimony of the State\u2019s handwriting expert. In sum, rather than offering any specific facts that allegedly would have been discovered through adequate investigation by an \u2018independent handwriting expert,\u2019 Woods offers only vague speculation. Further, Woods does not plead any facts tending to .show exactly how testimony by this expert would have aided trial counsel in the presentation of his case; nor does he explain whether/how the results of the expert\u2019s investigation would have, been admissible at trial. Moreover, Woods also failed to plead any specific-facts indicating that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s acts or omissions\u2014facts indicating that there existed a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Instead, his claim consists only of naked allegations unsupported by specific facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\">(Suppl.C.R.86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">When pleading a postconviction claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to secure the services of an expert, this Court has required that the petitioner include in its pleading the expert\u2019s identity and the content of that expert\u2019s expected testimony. As we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1191-6\">\u201cThe circuit court correctly found that this claim was insufficiently pleaded because Washington failed to plead the identity of experts or the content of those experts\u2019 testimony. See <em>McNabb v. State, </em>991 So.2d 313 (Ala.Crim.App.2007); <em>Woods v. State, </em>957 So.2d 492 (Ala.Crim.App.2004), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 957 So.2d 533 (Ala.2006).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArI1\"><em>Washington, </em>95 So.3d at 64. <em>See also Windsor v. State, </em>89 So.3d 805 (Ala.Crim.App.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">Neither did Woods plead how he was prejudiced 'by counsel\u2019s failure to secure a handwriting expert. The record shows that Steven Drexler, a former handwriting examiner with the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, testified that it was his opinion \u201cthat the questioned writing was written by the author of the Nathaniel Woods\u2019s handwriting standard.\u201d (Trial R. 1391.) Woods\u2019s counsel rigorously cross-examined Drexler, and he testified that he had, in fact, given two opinions in the case, that after issuing his first opinion he requested more writing samples, and that his second opinion more strongly suggests that the questioned sample had been written by Woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-10\">The record further shows that Woods\u2019s trial attorney did move for funds to hire an \u201cindependent expert for handwriting analysis.\u201d (Trial C.R. 1574.) That motion was granted. During a pretrial hearing, defense counsel discussed the fact that she was having difficulty securing an expert and had only just received discovery concerning the handwriting analysis from the State. (Trial R. 126.) It appears that a continuance was granted on that basis. Although Woods did not present his own expert on handwriting analysis, counsel did conduct a thorough' cross-examination of the State\u2019s expert.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1191-11\">\u201c[H]ow to deal with the presentation of an expert witness by the opposing side, including whether to- present counter expert testimony, to rely upon cross-examination, to forgo cross-examination and/or to forgo development of certain expert opinion, is a matter of trial strategy which, if reasonable, cannot be the basis for a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1191-12\"><em>Thomas v. State, </em>284 Ga. 647, 650, 670 S.E.2d 421, 425 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-13\">Woods failed to comply with the pleading requirements of Rule 32.6(b), Ala. R.Crim. P.; therefore, the circuit court correctly summarily dismissed this claim. Woods is due no relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AUGp-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">Woods next argues that .the circuit court erred in summarily dismissing his claim that his- trial couhsel was ineffective for failing to adequately investigate, and present evidence in support of his defense. We address those issues Woods specifically argues in this section of his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">First, Woods argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to secure the services of several different experts. Specifically, Woods argues that counsel should have secured experts: (1) to conduct independent tests on the shirt he was wearing at the time of the murders to show that mace was on the shirt; (2) to test for latent fingerprints' in the bathroom; and (3) to test a shoe print found in the tub to show that Woods left through the bathroom-window and did not leave the apartment with his codefendant Spencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">In Woods\u2019s postconviction petition, he pleaded the following facts relative to this claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqta\">\u201cTrial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to obtain independent testing of key items of physical evidence that would have substantiated the defense\u2019s cas\u00e9 at\u2019 trial. ' First, defense counsel should have obtained independent testing of the shirt that Mr, Woods was wearing at the time \u00f3f the incident for mace.' If trial counsel had done so, upon information and belief, these test results would have revealed the presence of mace. This would have supported testimony that Mr. Woods had been maced and would have corroborated the defense theory that Spencer was reacting spontaneously to the use 'of force by the officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqtm-dedup-1\">\u201cTrial counsel also should have gotten an independent evaluation of latent fingerprints found on the bathroom window. Upon information and belief, if trial counsel had done so, these latent prints would have matched- Mr; Woods\u2019s fingerprints. Trial counsel also should have obtained an independent expert to evaluate the shoe print found in the bathtub. Upon information and belief, if trial counsel had done so', this shoe print would have been found to match Mr. Woods\u2019s shoes. These pieces of evidence would have demonstrated that Mr. Woods did not leave the apartment through the front door with Spencer as the State claimed but rather climbed out the bathroom window. This would have called into question the State\u2019s arguments that'1 Mr. Woods was' acting in concert with Spencer because they left together.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1192-11\">(Suppl,G.R.406.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-12\">When addressing a similar claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to secure the presence of an expert, this Court in <em>Daniel v. State, </em>86 So.3d 405 (Ala.Crim.App.2011), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-13\">\u201cDaniel failed to identify, by name, any forensic or DNA expert who could have testified at Daniel\u2019s trial or the content of the expert\u2019s expected testimony. Accordingly, Daniel failed to comply with the full-fact pleading requirements of Rule 32.6, Ala. R.Crim. P. See <em>McNabb v. State, </em>991 So.2d 313 (Ala.Crim.App.2007) (claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to retain an expert not sufficiently pleaded because expert was not identified); Woods <em>v. State, </em>957 So.2d 492 (Ala.Crim.App.2004), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 957 So.2d 533 (Ala.2006) (claim of ineffective assistance of counsel not sufficiently pleaded because Woods failed to identify an expert by name).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1192-14\">86 So.3d at 425-26. As we stated previously, to sufficiently plead a claim that counsel was ineffective in failing to secure the, services of an expert, the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>must identify the expert by name and plead his/her expected testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-4\">Moreover, Woods failed to plead how he was prejudiced. Woods\u2019s trial record shows that counsel moved for funds to hire a private investigator. (Trial C.R. 133-34.) That motion was granted. (Trial C.R, 535.) Counsel also moved to inspect, examine, and test all. physical evidence collected by the State, (Trial C.R. 237.) That motion was granted and the court wrote on the case-action summary: \u201cMotion to inspect and examine physical evidence is granted and tests will require additional motions.\u201d (Trial C.R. 520.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">Furthermore, one of Woods\u2019s witnesses who was in the apartment at the time of the shootings, Markesha Williams, testified that she did not see Officer Chisholm spray pepper spray and that she has asthma and would have gotten sick if pepper spray had been sprayed in the apartment. (Trial R. 1470.) Another State witness, Fernando Belser, who was also present at the time of the shootings, testified that he did not see Officer Chisholm spray pepper spray, that\u2018he did not cough or smell any pepper spray, and that Woods was not coughing. Another State witness, Michael Scott, testified that he was at John Prather\u2019s house on the day:of the shooting when Woods and Spencer ran into the' back door of the house together. When asked about Woods\u2019s appearance, Scott testified that Woods was not coughing, that Woods did not have trouble breathing, that there were no tears coming from Woods\u2019s eyes, that there was nothing coming from Woods\u2019s nose, that Woods was not rubbing his eyes, and that Woods did not appear to have difficulty seeing in the minutes after the fatal shootings..</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">Woods\u2019s codefendant, Kerry Spencer, also testified that when he finished shooting his rifle he threw the rifle down and he and Woods ran from the apartment together down the alley and into a neighbor\u2019s house.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Trial R. 1595.) Two witnesses at the neighbor\u2019s house testified that. Woods and Spencer arrived at the neighbor\u2019s house together. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-10\">The circuit court committed no error in summarily dismissing this claim because Woods failed to satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 32.6(b), Ala. R.Crim. P. Mot only did Woods fail to plead full facts but also failed to plead how he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s actions. This claim was correctly summarily dismissed and Woods is due no-relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-12\">Woods next argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to secure police records \u2018in order to establish discrepancies in police procedures that, he says, caused the confrontation that ultimately ended in three police officers being killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-13\">In regard to this claim, Woods pleaded the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akin-dedup-0\">\u201cTrial counsel also failed to seek and obtain discovery of the policies and procedures of the Birmingham Police Department regarding the actions of the officers, including patrolling areas outside of your beat, conducting .in-home arrests for a misdemeanor warrant from another jurisdiction and use of force. These documents would have allowed the defense to more effectively challenge the State\u2019s arguments that these officers were acting completely by the book and simply doing their duty at the time of this incident. Without these documents, defense counsel were left to simply ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>police witnesses whether their colleagues had followed proper procedures without any independent ability to challenge then- responses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">(C.R.407-08.) This claim was correctly summarily dismissed because Woods failed to include how he was prejudiced by the failure to secure the records. Woods\u2019s trial counsel did question the officers about police procedures and why the police were at the apartment on the day of the shootings. Indeed, Woods\u2019s pleadings admit as much.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-5\">\u201c[Ejxpert testimony on police procedures was unnecessary where counsel cross-examined the Commonwealth witnesses, who were police officers, in an effective manner so as to convey the same information. See <em>Commonwealth v. Marinelli, </em>570 Pa. 622, 810 A.2d 1257, 1269 (2002) (rejecting claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to call a defense expert witness to refute testimony proffered by a Commonwealth witness when trial counsel engaged in effective cross-examination of the Commonwealth witness). The Commonwealth1 cogently notes that trial counsel elicited testimony both on direct and cross-examination establishing that Officer Wertz was wearing plainclothes, did not shout for Appellant to stop, did not display his badge, which was later recovered from his police vehicle, and that these actions violated police procedures. Trial counsel was not required to present additional expert testimony to establish facts which were already before the jury, and, indeed, were largely uncontested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj2i\"><em>Commonwealth v. Rivera, </em>108 A.3d 779, 795 (Pa.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">The circuit court correctly summarily dismissed this claim because it failed to satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 32.6(b), Ala. R.Crim. P. Woods is due no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-7\">. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-8\">Woods next argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present an intoxication defense. Woods merely pleaded the following in regard to this claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-9\">\u201cTrial counsel also failed to investigate and present evidence in support of a voluntary intoxication defense. Under Alabama law, voluntary intoxication can negate the specific intent necessary for a conviction of capital murder, x-educing the offense to manslaughter. See <em>Fletcher v. State, </em>621 So.2d 1010, 1019-21 (Ala.Crim.App.1993). Counsel should have investigated and presented evidence that at the time of this incident, Mr. Woods was using 3.5 grams of cocaine everyday as well as using marijuana' and drinking large amounts of alcohol. Mr. Woods snorted 4.5 grams of cocaine, smoked 1 ounce of marijuana, and drank 12 beers in the hours before the confrontations with police and was intoxicated at the time of the incident. Trial counsel also should have obtained an expert that could have explain[ed] the effects of cocaine addiction and intoxication on Mr. Woods\u2019s mental state. If trial counsel had investigated and presented this evidence of voluntary intoxication, there is a reasonable probability that Mr. Woods would have been convicted of a lesser offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-10\">(C.R.408-09.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-11\">In affirming the circuit court\u2019s suinmary dismissal of a similar claim that was raised in Spencer\u2019s, Woods\u2019s codefendant\u2019s, post-conviction petition, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-12\">\u201cThis Court has held that a petitioner fails to plead sufficient facts regarding a claim that counsel failed to present an intoxication defense when he makes only a bai-e allegation that the petitioner was intoxicated at the'time of the offense. As this Court has stated: \u2018[The appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>lant] failed to allege how much he had to drink the night of the crime, how long before the crime he had been drinking, or any fact indicating that his alleged intoxication amounted to insanity.\u2019 <em>Connolly v. State, </em>33 So.3d 618, 623 (Ala.Crim.App.2007).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-5\">\u201c \u2018[The appellant] failed to plead sufficient facts to indicate that voluntary intoxication would have been a viable defense or that he would have been entitled to a jury instructions on voluntary intoxication ...; thus, he failed to plead sufficient facts indicating that his trial counsel were ineffective in this regard.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-6\"><em>\u201cMashburn v. State, </em>148 So.3d 1094, 1126-27 (Ala.Crim.App.2013). This claim was insufficiently pleaded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqko-dedup-0\"><em>Spencer v. State, </em>201 So.3d at 23-24. The same is true in this case. Woods failed to plead sufficient facts that would support a defense of intoxication.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-7\">\u201cMashburn failed to plead sufficient facts to indicate that voluntary intoxication would have been a viable defense or that he would have been entitled to jury instructions on voluntary intoxication or any lesser-included offenses; thus, he failed to plead sufficient facts indicating that his trial counsel were ineffective in this regard. See, e.g., <em>Connally v. State, </em>33 So.3d 618, 622-23 (Ala.Crim.App.2007). Therefore, summary dismissal of this claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aft_\"><em>Mashburn v. State, </em>148 So.3d 1094, 1126-27 (Ala.Crim.App.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">Moreover, in regard to Woods\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to secure an expert to testify concerning the effects of cocaine and alcohol addiction, this Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-9\">\u201cSome courts have found that expert testimony on the effects of alcohol is not necessary because it concerns an issue within the common knowledge of a juror. As the Washington Court of Appeals stated in <em>State v. Thomas, </em>123 Wash.App. 771, 98 P.3d 1258 (2004):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-11\">\u201c \u2018A voluntary intoxication defense allows the jury to consider \u201cevidence of intoxication\u201d to determine whether the defendant acted with the requisite intent. But unlike diminished capacity, it is not necessary to present expert testimony to support an involuntary intoxication defense. The effects of alcohol are commonly known and jurors can draw reasonable inferences from testimony about alcohol use. <em>State v. Kruger, </em>116 Wash.App. 685, 692-93, 67 P.3d 1147, rev. denied 150 Wash.2d 1024, 81 P.3d 120 (2003); <em>State v.

State, </em>193 So.3d 765, 801-02 (Ala.Crim.App.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-14\">The circuit court correctly summarily dismissed this claim because Woods failed to satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 32.6(b), Ala. R.Crim. P. Woods is due no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-15\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-16\">Woods argues that the circuit court erred in summarily dismissing his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an instruction on manslaughter as a lesser-included offense. In his petition, Woods pleaded the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-17\">\u201cTrial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to request a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>of manslaughter. If counsel had made such a request, the instruction should have beeh -given, since the evidence adduced at trial reasonably supported a manslaughter theory. See Section IX, supra (incorporated by reference); see also <em>Ex parte Oliver, </em>518 So.2d 705, 706 (Ala.1987) ... ; see also Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-1-9(b) (requiring rational basis for court to charge the jury on included offense).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">(C.R.409.) Again, Woods failed to fully plead this claim. Woods references the substantive issue in section IX of his Rule 32 .petition where he argued that the circuit court erred in failing to give a manslaughter instruction; , however, in this section of Woods\u2019s petition Woods was pleading that his trial counsel was ineffective. Woods had the added burden of pleading how he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to request a jury charge on manslaughter. Woods failed to do so. Accordingly, Woods \u201cfailed to not only plead sufficient facts, but also failed to plead prejudice.\u201d <em>Lee v. State, </em>44 So.3d 1145, 1170 (Ala.Crim.App.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">Indeed, the record establishes no -rational basis for an instruction on manslaughter as a lesser-included offense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Markesha Williams, who testified in Woods\u2019s behalf, said that the second time-the officers came to the. apartment Woods was \u201coutside messing with some speakers in his car.\u201d (Trial R. 1447.) At sentencing, Woods testified in his own behalf and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-6\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Were you doing the drugs as you sold them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-7\">\u201c[Woods]: Nah, I wasn\u2019t smoking crack.

R.Crim. P.

He makes several different arguments in support of this contention, and we address each argument individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-11\">First, Woods argues that his appellate counsel abandoned his case by not filing an application for rehearing; therefore, he says, he is entitled as a matter of law to an out-of-time appeal and he cites several cases in support of this contention. These cases, however, all involve situations where counsel failed to file a brief on direct appeal or where counsel failed to pursue the direct appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here appellate counsel filed a brief but declined to file an application for rehearing after this Court affirmed Woods\u2019s conviction and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-12\">The circuit court found that this claim was precluded pursuant to Rule 32.2(a), Ala. R.Crim. P., because, it stated, this claim had been raised before this Court and the Alabama Supreme Court.

Rule 32.2(a), Ala. R.Crim. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-14\">Moreover, the circuit court correctly determined that this claim had no merit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>\u201cThe Alabama Supreme Court and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals have rejected the arguments that Woods raises in the instant claim. See <em>State v.

Martin, </em>[56 So.3d 709] (Ala.Crim.App.2009). Furthermore, in addressing cases similar to the one at hand, the Alabama appellate courts have held that Rule 32 does not provide a mechanism for obtaining permission to file an out-of-time application for rehearing and/or petition for writ of certiorari. See <em>id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-5\">\u201cFor example, in <em>Carruth, </em>21 So.3d 764, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals held that Rule 32 did not provide grounds for a petitioner to file an out-of-time petition for writ of certiorari to the Alabama Supreme Court. Like Woods, the petitioner in <em>Carruth </em>argued that he was entitled to challenge his capital murder conviction via an out-of-time appeal to the' Alabama Supreme Court on the grounds that: (1) his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to file a petition for writ of certiorari in the Alabama Supreme Court and (2) the petitioner\u2019s failure to \u2018appeal\u2019 the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s decision was through no fault of his own. The Court of Criminal Appeals rejected these arguments. First, it held that Rule 32.1(f) does not provide a valid basis for granting a petitioner\u2019s request to file an out-of-time petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Carruth, </em>21 So.3d at 766-67 [776-67]. In addition, it held that because a defendant has no right to appellate counsel on appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court, appellate counsel\u2019s failure to appeal the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 decision could not be ineffective assistance of counsel so as to permit the filing of an out-of-time petition for writ of certiorari to the Alabama Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 767-70.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">(Suppl.C.R.36-37.) We agree with the circuit court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">\u201cThe right to counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution encompasses the right to \u2018effective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hallford v. State, </em>629 So.2d 6, 8 (Ala.Crim.App.1992). A defendant is entitled to counsel in a direct appeal. The United States Supreme Court, however, has held that there is no right to counsel in discretionary state appeals. <em>See Ross v. Moffitt, </em>417 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974). This Court has characterized an application for rehearing as a discretionary review. In <em>Kinsey v. State, </em>545 So.2d 200 (Ala.Crim.App.1989), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-9\">\u201cIn Alabama, all persons convicted of a criminal offense are granted the right to an appeal by Alabama Code 1975, \u00a7 12-22-130. This appeal is a right granted to the defendant and is to the Court of Criminal Appeals. Alabama Code 1975, \u00a7 12-3-9. Any subsequent review of a criminal conviction by a higher state appellate court is by writ of certiorari to the Alabama Supreme Court. Review by certiorari is entirely discretionary with our Supreme Court (except in capital cases). See [Ala. R.App. P.] Rule 39; <em>Ex parte Sellers, </em>250 Ala. 87, 33 So.2d 349 (1948). The Supreme Court will consider a petition for writ of certiorari \u2018only after the court of appeals has overruled an application for rehearing....\u2019 [Ala. R.App. P.] Rule 39(a). Thus, a rehearing by this Court lies somewhere between a defendant\u2019s first appeal as a matter of right and a subsequent discretionary review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-10\">\u201cWith regard to rehearings,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-11\">\u201c \u2018it is generally the rule that, except in eases provided for by statute, a rehearing is not a matter of right, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>a privilege given by -the appellate court, and governed and limited by its rules.

Pratt, </em>250 Ala. 300, 301, 34 So.2d 145, 146 (1947), the Supreme Court stated: \u2018The object and purpose of an application for rehearing is to invite review by the court as'to the correctness of the opinion and judgment of the court as presented on the record upon which the case is submitted.\u2019 Although <em>Redd Chemical </em>and <em>Gossett </em>involved applications for rehearing before our -state Supreme Court, the principle under consideration applies to the intermediate appellate courts.

Specifically, appellate counsel failed to raise on appeal the following issues: the improper admission the misdemeanor warrant for Mr. Woods arrest (Section IV. A.); the improper admission of Mr. Woods\u2019s conduct toward police officers on other occasions (Section IV.C.); the inadequate and confusing limiting instruction given regarding prior bad acts evidence (Section IV.E.); the failure to change the venue of Mr. Woods\u2019s trial due to extensive publicity (Section V); the failure to adequately instruct the jury on the specific intent necessary for a conviction of capital murder (Section VI); the improper severance of Mr. Woods\u2019s trial from Kerry Spencer\u2019s (Section VII); prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument by attempting to shift the burden of proof to Mr. Woods to prove his innocence (Section VIII); the failure to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of manslaughter (Section IX); the State\u2019s illegal use of peremptory strikes on the basis of race (Section X); the improper admission of victim impact evidence during the guilt phase (Section XI); the improper admission of prejudicial double hearsay (Section XIII); the improper admission of hearsay from police dispatch tapes (Section XIV); the improper admission of prejudicial hearsay statements from an unidentified individual (Section XV); the improper admission of hearsay statements from Mr. Woods\u2019s co-defendant (Section XVI); the failure to ensure a complete and accurate record of the proceedings (Section XVII); the improper admission of gruesome, cumulative and highly prejudicial photographs (Section XVIII); the trial judge\u2019s failure to re-cuse himself (Section XIX); the prejudicial presence of police officers in the courtroom throughout the trial (Section XX); the improper admission of testimony from a purported handwriting expert (Section XXI); the failure to strike the jury from a random sampling of prospective jurors called for jury service (Section XXII); the unconstitutional double counting of a factor making the offense capital as an aggravating circumstance (Section XII); the improper admission of the opinion of the victim\u2019s family members about the appropriate sentence (Section XXIII); the improper introduction of victim impact evidence as rebuttal of mitigation witnesses (Section XXIV); the failure to instruct the jury on the process of weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances at the sentencing phase (Section XXV); the improper consideration of a letter purportedly written by Mr. Woods to Stacy Sellers at the judge sentencing (Section XXVI); and the failure to find uncontra-dicted mitigating evidence (Section XXVII).

For example, in paragraph 219 of his petition, Woods contends that \u2018appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise a number of meritorious issues in Mr. Woods\u2019s appellate brief that, if raised, would have required the reversal of Mr. Woods\u2019s conviction and sentence.\u2019 Woods follows this sentence with a lengthy list of as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>sorted issues, none of which is supported by specific facts. This assertion simply does not state a proper claim for relief. Instead, his \u2018claim\u2019 consists only of bare allegations and speculative, con-clusory statements. Further, the fact that Woods incorporates by reference other claims set forth in this petition does not render his IAC claims sufficiently pleaded. As noted above, incorporating by reference facts from one claim to another does not lower Rule 32\u2019s pleading requirements. Here, even with the incorporation of facts from other claims in his petition, Woods has failed to plead specific facts sufficient to show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or that, but for this allegedly deficient performance, the result in Woods\u2019s case would have been different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1203-5\">\u201cWoods\u2019s claims of IAC on appeal do not contain legal argument and specific factual support sufficient for a court to determine, based on the face of the petition, whether he is entitled to' relief, assuming the facts pleaded to be true. Accordingly, they are insufficiently pleaded and fail to state a valid claim for relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">(Suppl.C.R.94-95.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">To adequately plead a claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise certain issues on direct appeal, the petitioner must do more than merely recite a laundry list of issues that he or she says should have been raised. <em>See Carruth v.

Also, the sections in Woods\u2019s petition that are referenced in the above-cited quote are sections in the petition in which Woods argued the substantive issues concerning each claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. However, in this section of Woods\u2019s postconviction petition, Woods was arguing that his appellate counsel was ineffective. Therefore, Woods had the added burden of pleading specific facts as to how he was prejudiced by appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the above-cited 26 issues. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). Woods failed to plead the full facts in regard to this claim; therefore, it was correctly summarily dismissed. <em>See </em>Rule 32.6(b), Ala. R.Crim. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-9\">Moreover, on direct appeal, this Court addressed and found no error in the following issues, some of which are cited above: that the testimony concerning the computerized search for Woods\u2019s name was admissible, that there was no error in the admission of collateral bad-act evidence, that the evidence was sufficient to support Woods\u2019s convictions and to establish Woods\u2019s guilt based on the accomplice-liability doctrine, that evidence from the victim\u2019s widow about the appropriate sentence was appropriate in rebuttal, and that based on the record Woods was not denied the effective assistance of counsel at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-10\">Also, in its order dismissing Woods\u2019s petition, the circuit court specifically found that there was no merit to the following claims: that the circuit court erred in severing his case from that of his codefen-dant\u2019s, that the prosecutor committed misconduct in its closing arguments, that the circuit court erred in admitting improper victim-impact evidence at the guilt phase, that the circuit court engaged in double counting in sentencing Woods\u2019s to death, that the circuit court erred in admitting prejudicial photographs of the victims, and that the circuit court improperly constructed the strike list.

State, </em>766 So.2d 860, 876 (Ala.Crim.App.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"AgQc\">The circuit court correctly summarily dismissed this claim because Woods failed to plead how he was prejudiced by appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise any of the 26 issues on direct appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 32.6(b), Ala. R.Crim. P. Woods is due no relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-7\">Woods next argues, that the circuit court erred in summarily dismissing his petition and relying on the State\u2019s answer to support the dismissal. Specifically, Woods argues that the circuit court\u2019s order contains the.same \u201cadversarial zeal\u201d condemned by the Alabama Supreme Court in <em>Ex parte Scott, </em>[Ms. 1091275, March 18, 2011] \u2014 So.3d \u2014(Ala.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-8\">\u201cFrom a practical standpoint, we appreciate the need for allowing a trial court the flexibility to adopt the State\u2019s proposed order when denying or dismissing a postconviction petition.\u201d <em>See Jackson v. State, </em>133 So.3d 420, 469 (Ala.Crim.App.2009). \u201cWhile the practice of adopting the state\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions is subject to criticism, the general rule is that even when the court adopts proposed findings verbatim, the findings are those of the court and may be reversed only if clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Bell v. State, </em>593 So.2d 123, 126 (Ala.Crim.App.1991). However, the Alabama Supreme Court has cautioned a reviewing court considering an order that adopts a proposed order drafted by the State. The Supreme Court cautioned;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Qc\">\u201c[A]ppellate courts must be careful to evaluate a claim that a prepared order drafted by the prevailing party and adopted by the trial court verbatim does not reflect the independent and impartial findings and conclusions of the trial court. In <em>Bell v. State, </em>593 So.2d 123 (Ala.Crim.App.1991)\u2014the case the Court of Criminal Appeals quoted in <em>Ingram [v. State, </em>51 So.3d 1094 (Ala.Crim.App.2006) ] for the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard of review\u2014the Court of Criminal Appeals observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-11\">\u201c \u2018The trial court did adopt verbatim the proposed order tendered by the state; however, <em>from our review of the record, we are convinced that the findings and conclusions are those of the trial court. </em>The record reflects that the trial court was thoroughly familiar with the case and gave the appellant considerable leeway in presenting evidence to support his claims.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-12\"><em>\u201cBell, </em>593 So.2d at 126 (emphasis added). The undisputed facts in the present case obviously prevent a similar conclusion here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-13\">\u201cWe are forced by the nature of the errors present in the June 8 order to reverse the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals. In the simplest terms, the patently erroneous nature of the statements regarding the trial judge\u2019s \u2018personal knowledge\u2019 and observations of Ingram\u2019s capital-murder trial undermines any confidence that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law are the product of the. trial judge\u2019s independent judgment and that the June 8 order reflects the findings and conclusions of that judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1204-14\"><em>Ex parte Ingram, </em>51 So.3d 1119, 1124-25 (Ala.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>The next year in <em>Ex parte Scott, </em>[Ms. 1091275, March 18, 2011] \u2014 So.3d \u2014 (Ala.2011), the Supreme Court considered the validity of a circuit court\u2019s wholesale adoption of the State\u2019s answer as its final order denying Scott\u2019s postconviction petition; the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-7\">\u201cHere, we do not even have the benefit of an order proposed or \u2018prepared\u2019 by a party; rather the order is a judicial incorporation of a party\u2019s pleading as the \u2018independent and impartial findings and conclusions of the trial court.\u2019 <em>Ex parte Ingram, </em>51 So.3d [1119] at 1124 [ (Ala.2010) ]. The first and most fundamental requirement of the reviewing court is to determine \u2018that the order and the findings and conclusions in such order are in fact those of the trial court.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 1124. The trial court\u2019s verbatim adoption of the State\u2019s answer to Scott\u2019s Rule 32 petition as its order, by its nature, violates this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ex parte Ingram.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">\u2014 So.3d at \u2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-9\">More recently, in affirming the circuit court\u2019s adoption of the State\u2019s proposed order in <em>Ex parte Jenkins, </em>105 So.3d 1250 (Ala.2012), the Alabama Supreme Court explained its earlier holdings in <em>Ex parte Ingram </em>and <em>Ex parte Scott </em>and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-10\">\u201cCrucial to Jenkins\u2019s argument that the trial judge signed the proposed order without reading it carefully and without verifying its contents is his contention that the trial judge signed the order within hours of receiving it. This contention is based on Jenkins\u2019s \u2018belief that the earliest the trial judge could have seen the proposed order would have been Tuesday, November 25, 2008, the date the order was signed in Ash-ville, because, as explained above, the trial judge was sitting in Pell City the previous day. Also crucial to Jenkins\u2019s argument is his contention that the trial judge had not reviewed the records from his prior trial and Rule 32 proceedings. Neither of these crucial contentions to Jenkins\u2019s argument are founded upon facts contained in the record, and they amount to only speculation and conjecture. Nothing in the record indicates when the trial judge received the proposed order or where he was'sitting on November 24 and 25, 2008. Additionally, nothing in the record indicates that the trial judge did not review the transcripts from Jenkins\u2019s prior proceedings. It is well settled that this Court cannot consider , arguments founded on matters not contained in the record. <em>Etherton v. City of Homewood, </em>700 So.2d 1374 (Ala. 1997).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-12\">\u201cThe circumstances of this case differ from the circumstances presented in <em>Ex parte Ingram </em>and <em>Ex parte Scott. </em>In both of those cases it was clear from evidence before this Court that the orders signed by the trial court were not the product of the trial court\u2019s independent judgment. In <em>Ingram, </em>that fact was clear from the statements contained in the order regarding the trial judge\u2019s \u2018personal knowledge\u2019 and observations of Ingram\u2019s capital-murder trial when the trial judge signing the proposed Rule 32 order did not preside over Ingram\u2019s capital-murder trial. In <em>Ex parte Scott, </em>that fact was clear from the materials before this Court, which contained the State\u2019s responsive pleading adopted by the trial court as its order. In this case, however, there is nothing definitive in the record or on the face of the order that indicates that the order is not the product of the trial court\u2019s independent judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1205-13\"><em>Jenkins, </em>105 So.3d at 1259-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-14\">Here, the circuit court\u2019s order dismissing Woods\u2019s postconviction petition clearly reflects that it was the product of the circuit court\u2019s \u201cindependent judgment.\u201d Most obvious is the fact that the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>amended answer was 113 pages long and the circuit court\u2019s order was 80 pages long.
