According to the principles of the common law, the owner of a wharf who receives or is entitled to receive wharfage for vessels moored to \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 said wharf, is bound to use at least ordinary care and diligence in keeping the water adjacent to such wharf in which vessels lie while moored thereto, free from obstructions, and is liable for any damage done to- any such vessel by reason of the neglect of such duty; and the same principles apply, whether such owner be an individual, or a corporation, whethej1 such corporation be private or municipal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b341-14\">2. The city of Petersburg owns a wharf in the Appomattox river, for the use of which the city is authorized to charge and does charge wharfage. In October 1872 the vessel of A not being able to get to the wharf at which she was to deliver her load on account of an obstruction in the stream by another vessel, drew up to the city wharf and moored to it, and whilst waiting there she sunk on the next low water, from a pile going through her bottom. This pile was oak, being about two feet from the wharf, in the stream where a vessel at the wharf would probably lie, and was not visible at low water, though it was some two feet or more above the bed of the river, and was firmly fixed there&amp;emdash;Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b341-16\">1. The allowing such an obstruction in the place where it was, was negligence; and the city of Petersburg being the owner of the wharf, is liable for the damages occasioned by it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b341-18\">2. The fact that the city had appointed a port warden whose duty it was to attend to the removal of obstructions in the stream, and to attend to the duties of the city in regard to the city wharf, does not exempt the city from liability for the damages. The port warden in this matter is but the agent of the city, and the principal is always bound for the acts and neglects of his agent. The same rule which applies to a private principal, applies to a corporation, whether ordinary or municipal, and <em>a fortiori </em>to a corporation which can only act by an agent.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b342-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>3. The fact that it has been made by statute the duty of the Lower Appomattox company to dredge and remove obstructions from the river at and below Petersburg, cannot relieve the city from her liability. The city is in fact the company owning all the stock and appointing the officers of the company. But even if it was an independent organization, its obligation to perform a duty which the city is also bound to perform on common 1 aw principles, would not relieve the city from its common law liability for the non-performance of such a duty.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b342-11\">4. Nor can it make any difference that the United States have made appropriations to the improvement of the navigation of the river, and have occasionally dredged it. This does not relieve the city from its common law liability in regard to the city wharf.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b342-13\">5. Nor does it make any difference, that in this case no wharfage was actually received by the city, and that it does not usually charge wharfage in cases where the vessel mooring at her wharf is not to be unloaded there. It is sufficient that the city was entitled to charge wharfage.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-15\">This is a <em>supersedeas </em>to a judgment of the circuit court of the city of Petersburg, rendered on the 4th day of June 1873, in an action of trespass on the case brought by William Applegarth against the city of Petersburg.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-16\">The declaration contained four counts. The first was in substance as follows: that before and at the time of the committing of the grievances, hereinafter mentioned, the defendant was the owner, and was possessed of a certain wharf for the landing, mooring, loading and unloading of vessels on the banks of the Appomattox river, within the corporate limits of the city of Petersburg, and known as the city wharf, near to which said wharf there was then a certain obstruction, to wit: a pile before then, by the defendant carelessly and negligently placed, and then being at and upon the bottom of said river, over which pile, at certain states of the tide of said river, the vessel of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\u25a0plaintiff hereinafter mentioned would float, but at <em>r </em>. \u2019 \u2022other states of said tide said vessel would not float, of all of which premises said defendant had notice at before the time aforesaid; that at the time of the com.mitting of said grievances, and while the defendant so owned and possessed the wharf aforesaid, the plaintiff owned and possessed a certain vessel called the North Carolina, of great value, to wit: of the value of $5,000, then being lawfully, by sufferance and permission of said defendant, at and along side said wharf for reward to said defendant in that behalf; and said defendant liad the management and control of said wharf, and the mooring and stationing of vessels at and near the same, whilst such vessels were at such wharf for the purpose of using the same, and said defendant had the legal right to charge and demand of the said plaintiff wharfage therefor; yet the said defendant, at the place aforesaid, and on the 15th day of October 1872, unskilfully, negligently and improperly moored and stationed said vessel of said plaintiff in that part of said river near said wharf and over said obstruction, to wit: over said pile, and unskilfully, negligently and improperly detained said vessel for a long and improper time over said pile, and until said vessel on the day and year aforesaid, upon the natural and usual fall of the tide in said river, came, fell and lodged upon, and struck against, said pile at the bottom of said river, and there remained and continued upon, and striking \u2022against, said pile for a long time, and thereby became, and was greatly strained, bulged, broken, pierced and injured, and was sunk; in consequence and by reason of which injuries, done by said defendant, said plaintiff necessarily sustained great damage, to wit: a loss of $1,262.43, which said sum he avers he necessarily expended in raising said vessel and her cargo, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>rePairing said vessel, and the farther great sum, to wit: the sum of $650, special damage which said plain-necessarily sustained by being deprived of the use aQd enjoyment of said vessel, and her ordinary gains an&lt;^ Pr\u00b0fits said plaintiff during the time that she was sunk, being raised and repaired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\">The second, third and fourth counts are very nearly to the same effect with the first, and it is unnecessary to state the particulars in which they differ from each other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-7\">The plaintiff having died shortly after the institution of the action, his death was suggested, and the action was revived in the name of his administrator, George S. Bernard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-8\">Thereafter the defendant filed a demurrer to the third and fourth counts of the declaration, in which demurrer the plaintiff joined. The court sustained the demurrer to the third count, and overruled the demurrer to the fourth count; and thereupon the defendant pleaded not guilty to each count of the declaration, except the third, and issue was joined on the said plea. The issue was tried by a jury, which, on the 8d day of June 1873, found a verdict in these words: \u201cWe, the jury, find for the plaintiff, and assess his damages at eighteen hundred and eighty-five dollars and eighty-six cents, with legal interest thereon from December 16th, 1872, till paid.\u201d Whereupon the defendant moved the court to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial, upon the ground that the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence in the cause; which motion was overruled, and judgment was thereupon rendered according to the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-9\">Two bills of exceptions were taken by the defendants to certain rulings of the court in the progress of the trial, and were made a part of the record. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>related to the instructions which were given or refused by the court to the jury, and the other to the ruling of the court in regard to the motion to set aside the ver\u2022dict and grant a new trial. In the former, so much of the evidence was set out as was deemed to be necessary or proper to show the relevancy of the instructions. In the latter, is contained a certificate purporting to be of all the facts which were proved on the trial. That certificate is in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-12\">\u201cThe court certifies that after the jury were sworn to try the issue joined in this cause, the following facts were proven before the jury on the part of the plaintiff, viz: That the vessel of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, Wm. Applegarth, called the Forth Carolina, which was in thorough order and repair, and of the value of $3,500 \u25a0or $4,000, arrived at Petersburg about two o\u2019clock A. M. of 15th October 1872, with a cargo of 131 tons of coal, consigned to Marks &amp; Friend, of that city. That she was not able to get to their wharf, in consequence of the river being blockaded by a dredging machine lying alongside the steamer Fanny Lehr, at the wharf \u25a0rented by the Powhatan Steamboat Company from the city, and made fast to another wharf of the defendant, \u2022below, known as the city wharf. That next morning, -15th October 1872, the tide being low, she could not .get up to Marks &amp; Friend\u2019s wharf; and while waiting for the next high tide, Marks &amp; Friend sold the coal to B. S. Burch, with the understanding that Burch was \u2022to send a tug at the next high water to tow her down the river; but Burch failing to do so, and the captain of the vessel, concluding not to wait, commenced, about three o\u2019clock P. M. of 15th October 1872, to haul up to Marks &amp; Friend\u2019s wharf, and had proceeded \u25a0in that direction about twenty feet, perhaps half the -length of the whole vessel, which is eighty-six feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>^on\u00a3\u2019 w^en he received a message from Burch that he-would tow her down on the next high water, which would be about two o\u2019clock A. M. That the vessel-was immediately made fast to the city wharf, where she sunk on the next low water, about nine o\u2019clock P. \u2019 M., from a pile going through her bottom. And that on discovering that she was leaking, which was about twenty minutes to nine o\u2019clock, her pumps were-started, but she sunk in about twenty minutes. That every effort was made by the captain and crew to save-the vessel and cargo and prevent their sinking, and every proper effort made to raise the vessel and cargo and repair the injuries done to the vessel by the sinking as quickly and cheaply as the same could be done. That the actual and necessary costs of raising and repairing the vessel was $1,235.86, and the actual and proper amount of demurrage was $650. That neither the captain nor owner of the vessel paid any wharfage,, hut they were liable to pay wharfage under the city ordinance. That she was sunken by an oak pile-through her bottom, which was sawed off by divers-about eighteen inches or two feet from the bottom of' the river, and the divers traced the pile, by feeling, about eighteen inches or two feet in the sand, and that the inclination was from the wharf, and that the pile entered the vessel about nine or ten feet from the keel and about five feet from her main mast, and that an-old piece of log lying between the pile and the wharf,, about three feet long and eight inches in diameter, was pulled out by them; that the pile that entered the vessel inclined in the direction of the opposite side of the river, and was an oak pile, and in the opinion of an. expert was a fender pile, or part of the city wharf, and. that from where the pile entered the vessel to the-wharf was about two and a half feet; that the pile= <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>that entered the vessel was visible at.low tide; that the river appeared to have been dredged not nearer than two feet from the city wharf, but did not appear to have been dredged level, but in holes, and the dredging on the outside of the pile would have caused it to incline outwards; that about two or three years ago, when one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses named Brown was at Petersburg, in command of another vessel, E. H. Stainback, the port warden of the city of Petersburg, directed him to haul his vessel about another length astern, as there was an obstruction or something else in the way, but what was not recollected, and that after the sinking of the North Carolina witness reminded Stainback of it; but it was also proved by the defendant that that pile was at a different place .from the one where the North Carolina was sunk; that after the sinking of the North Carolina, some two or three inches of a stob under the water, and about two feet from the wharf, was seen by a witness, but the size of the stob, or whether it entered the vessel or not, could not be seen, and that the stob was five or six feet from the guards of the vessel, and that the stob seen under the water was an oak pile and in-&gt; dined outward from the wharf. And it was further proved, that on the 25th day of October 1872, whilst the said vessel was being raised, the late 'William Applegarth addressed and caused to be delivered to E. H. Stainback, port warden of said, city, and to Franklin Wood, the mayor thereof, true copies of a notice which is in the words and figures following to-wit: \u2018To the Hon. Franklin Wood, mayor of the city of Petersburg: Dear Sir: \u2014 This letter will inform you, and through you the city of Petersburg, that I shall hold said city responsible for all damages which I have sustained or shall sustain by reason of the sinking of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>my schooner the \u2018North Carolina\u2019 and her cargo (one hundred and five tons of coal), whilst lawfully lying at the wharf of said city known as \u2018the city wharf,\u2019 on the 15th day of October 1872. Said sinking was caused by the carelessness and negligence of said city. I am now engaged in raising said vessel and her cargo, and will be glad to have from said city whatever assistance she may render. Very respectfully, yours, Vm. Applegarth, by Jones &amp; Bernard, his attorneys.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-10\">\u201c And the court further certifies that the defendant, to maintain the issue on his part, proved the following facts, viz: That when the wharf of the defendant at which the North Carolina was sunken was built, all its fender piles were oak, and all the piles on which the string timbers rested were pine. That the fender piles were placed about thirty feet apart, and.are there still and none of them missing, and that the fender piles are all visible at high water, and that the oak pile on which the vessel sunk is smaller and not like the fender piles at said wharf. That some time between 20th and 30th September 1872, that part of the river along the whole length of the city wharf at which the North Carolina sunk, had been dredged to within about two feet of said wharf; and that the reason why it was not dredged nearer the wharf was for \u2022fear said wharf might be undermined and caused to fall; and that it was more than probable if the pile on which the North Carolina sunk had been there when the dredging was done, the shovel of the dredge would have struck it; that one of the witnesses was a member of the board of directors of the Lower Appomattox company, whose president and directors are appointed by the common couhcil of the city of Petersburg, and that the said city, for the last three years, has furnished the money to open and keep open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the Appomattox river; but that since December 1871, the United States government has had charge of the river, and commenced operations in opening and -cleaning out; that the dredging aforesaid, between 20th and 30th September 1872, was made by said witness under contract with the Lower Appomattox company; that he had no orders to dredge the river regularly; but when he did so, it was under a special contract with the Lower Appomattox company, and that under a like contract he dredged out another vessel that was sunk in the river at a different point between the first and latter part of October 1872; that the pile which sunk the North Carolina did not resemble the fender piles of said city wharf; that about eight or ten days before the sinking of the North Carolina, a three-masted schooner lay near the same spot of the sinking, but received no injury as far as known; that timbers often floated down the river from above; that during the late war the Confederate government built two bridges across the river, not far from the city wharf, at which bridge oak piles were driven down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-4\">\u201c It was also proved that E. H. 'Stainback was the port warden of the city of Petersburg since 1865, and that the conversation which took place two or three years ago, as proved by the plaintiff\u2019s witness Brown, between him and E. H. Stainback, the port warden of Petersburg, occurred in November 1870, and the obstruction referred to by the witness Brown was reported to the Lower Appomattox company with directions to have it taken out, and it was never seen there \u2022afterwards by the port warden; that no demand was made by the city for Wharfage of the captain or officers of the North Carolina, because she had no cargo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>be lan(Jed there, and it was not the custom of the port warden to claim wharfage in such cases.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aq0\">The foregoing are all the facts certified in the second bill of exceptions. In the first, besides the other evidence therein set forth, it is stated that \u201cthe plaintiff further gave in evidence section 20, page 8, and section 30, page 11, of the charter, and chapter 16. of the printed ordinances of the city of Petersburg,, in the words and figures following, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\">\u201c Section 20, page 8, city charter:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">\u201c 20.

If the jury shall believe from the evidence, that the vessel of the plaintiff was sunk and injured by striking against a pile in the Appomattox river, and that such pile was a part of the wharf belonging to the defendant, or was used by the defendant in connection therewith, but that said pile was <em>latent, </em>then they must find for the defendant, unless they shall also believe from the evidence that the defendant or its * agents had express notice of the existence of said pile, or unless its existence was so notorious as to be evident to all who had occasion to pass the place where it was; and it is incumbent on the plaintiff to prove affirmatively such notice or notoriety of existence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\">4th. The law does not require the defendant to scour and drag the river opposite to or alongside of its wharf continually, to ascertain what obstructions might be there, or keep guard along the banks of the river to prevent the commission of injuries by others; and if the jury shall believe from the evidence that the vessel of the plaintiff\u2019was sunk or injured by striking-against a pile in the Appomattox river, and that said pile was not visible to persons or vessels navigating said river or on the shore, and that there is no satisfactory evidence as to how such pile came to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>where it was, or of the probable cause of its being there, or that the defendant or its agents knew it was there, then the jury must find for the defendant; less they shall be satisfied from the evidence that the defendant or its agents had failed or neglected to use a a reasonable care and caution to keep the river in suitable condition for safe navigation of vessels opposite and alongside of said wharf; and it is incumbent on the plaintiff to prove affirmatively such failure or neglect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-10\">5th. That in order to establish negligence against the defendant it is incumbent on the plaintiff to prove some fact which is more consistent with negligence than with the absence of it; and if the evidence in the cause is equally consistent with the existence or nonexistence of negligence on the part of the defendant or its agents, then the jury must find for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-11\">6th. If the jury shall find for the plaintiff, then the amount of damage which they shall assess shall be the amount necessarily incurred in raising and repairing the vessel, and the gross freight which she might have earned during that time, less the expenses and charges which she would necessarily have incurred in earning the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-12\">7th.

If the wharf owner receives tolls from the public generally, he owes this duty to the public, and is liable to any one specially injured by his neglect to fulfil it.55 \u201cIt is negligence to permit anything to project from the side of a wharf in such manner as, by any probable combination of circumstances, to endanger the safety of vessels moored to the wharf. They are entitled to the unobstructed use of the water, whether it rises or falls. A wharf or dock owner receiving toll, does not fulfil his obligations by simply keeping the wharf or dock clear of obstacles and defects, which are visible upon an external inspection. If the general experience of persons in charge of wharves and docks has made it a fact of common notoriety among them, that such property is liable to become defective and dangerous from causes that can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>not be detected from a mere external inspection, the owner is bound to make such further examination as is usual among owners of like property, having interests of their own to protect from damage, of equal mao\u00fchude, with tbose of the community in general,, which are exposed to danger in the particular case. A dock ought to be dredged and cleaned with sufficient frequency to enable all such vessels as are accustomed to enter it to do so without stranding or dragging. And if for any reason the owner of the dock cannot do this, or claims to be released from the obligation to do so, he must withdraw all express or implied invitation for the entry of vessels; and if they are accustomed to enter, paying toll, he must close the dock, or in some other way distinctly warn them to-keep out of it. The existence of piles or other obstructions under the water, and projecting above the ground at the bottom, is presumptive evidence of neg~. ligence; and it is not a sufficient excuse to show that the owner, at the time of an injury thus caused, did not place the obstructions there, or even know of their existence. He should have tested the safety of the dock. But the owner of the dock does not insure vessels against injury in it, and, if he has taken all the-care that can reasonably be expected of him, he is not liable for damage done to a vessel by an obstruction in the dock. The master of a vessel has a right to presume that all parts of a dock are safe, and is not guilty of contributory negligence by taking a place which might, under other circumstances not anticipated by him, be less safe than another.\u201d In the notes to this-section the following among other cases are cited,, which were much relied on in the argument of this case, and seem to be very important. <em>Parnaby </em>v. <em>Lancaster Canal Co., </em>11 Ad. &amp; El. 223; <em>Mersey Docks Trus</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>tees </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>Law Rep. 1 H. of L. 93; and <em>Pittsburgh </em>v. <em>Grier, </em>22 Penn. St. R. 54. In <em>Parnaby </em>v. <em>Lancaster \u2022Canal Co., </em>in which the complaint in the declaration was of a breach of duty alleged to have been created by a statute, the court of exchequer chamber (affirm\u25a0ing the judgment of the court of Q. B.) held that such \u25a0duty was not created by the clause of the statute referred to in the declaration, but arose upon a common law principle, that the owners of a canal, taking tolls for the navigation, were bound to use reasonable care in making the navigation secure, the want of which reasonable care might be collected from the declaration, although the complaint was ostensibly founded on the statute. In the <em>Mersey Docks Trustees </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>in which the judgment of the court of exchequer chamber was affirmed by the House of Lords,, it was held that the principle on which a private person, or a company is liable for damages occasioned by the neglect of servants, applies to a corporation which has been entrusted by .statute to perform certain works, and to receive tolls for the use of those works, although those tolls, unlike the tolls received by the private person or the company, are not applicable to the use of the individual corporators, or to that of the corporation, but are devoted to the maintenance of the works, and, in case of any surplus existing, the tolls themselves are to be proportionably diminished. <em>Parnaby </em>v. <em>The Lancaster Canal Co. (supra), </em>which was the case of an ordinary corporation, was approved of, and the principle of liability for negligence there established, was applied to a corporate body entrusted by statute with the performance of a public duty, and receiving therefrom no profits or emoluments for itself. And it was further held, that if knowledge of the existence of a cause of mischief makes persons re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>sPons^e f\u00b0r injury it occasions, they will be equally responsible when, by their culpable negligence, existence is not known to them. And in <em>Pittsburgh </em>v. <em>Grier, </em>it was among other things held <em>[Black, </em>C. J., delivering the opinion of the court), that a city being in possession of a public wharf within its limits, exercising exclusive supervision and control over it, and receiving tolls for its use, is bound to keep it in proper condition for use; that the corporation is liable for special injury sustained by an individual in consequence of its neglect to keep the wharf in order, and <em>case </em>may be sustained therefor; that it was not material whether the city had adopted ordinances for the regulation of the wharf, or having such, n'\u00e9glected to enforce them\u2014the responsibility is the same in either event;, and that when the plaintiff has sustained injury from the neglect of a public duty, which the defendant has impliedly promised to perform, either <em>case </em>or <em>assumpsit </em>may be maintained. In that case, a steamboat was landed at a moderate stage of water, at a proper place at the Monongahela wharf at Pittsburgh, on which piles of iron metal had been lying for a long time, and nearer to the water\u2019s edge than was allowed by the ordinances of the city. The river afterwards rose, and the boat struck on the iron, and to avoid such danger was backed into the stream, where it was struck by a floating body, and further injured and sunk. It was held that the wharf, being under the exclusive control and regulation of the city authorities, (whether rightfully \u2022 or not, held not to be material), who derived a revenue from its use, the wharfage of the boat having been paid, the city authorities having been guilty of negligence in not having the iron removed, the corporation was liable in an action on the case to the owners of the boat for the injury sustained; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>that though some other place on the wharf might have heen more secure, the captain of the boat had a right to select the one in question, which was at the time safe, the faith of the city being pledged to render it secure; and that it was not material that the city authorities did not foresee the danger as likely to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">There are other sections of S. &amp; B. on Negligence, which have a material bearing-on this case, among which are \u00a7\u00a7 120, 135 and 137. In \u00a7 120 it is stated, among other things, that \u201c there is nothing in the character of a municipal corporation which entitles it to an immunity from liability for such malfeasances, as private corporations or individuals would be liable for in a civil action.\u201d Many eases are referred to in the notes to that section, and among them is the case of <em>Mersey Docks Trustees </em>v. <em>Gibbs, supra, </em>of which there is a very full statement, the decision in which case was afterwards followed in <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Wise, </em>1 Q. B. L. R. 711. In \u00a7 135, it is stated that \u201c the rules of law governing the relation of master and servant, and principal and agent, are as applicable to corporations as to natural persons; and a municipal corporation is liable for the carelessness or neglect of its agents, on the same principle that a natural person is liable for damages resulting from the carelessness, unskillfulness or wrong doing of his agents. \u00a7 137 is to the same effect. Of course municipal corporations in the exercise of their political, discretionary and legislative authority, are not liable for the misconduct, negligence or omissions of the agents employed by them. But municipal corporations, in discharge of ministerial or specified duties, assumed in consideration of the privileges conferred by their charter, <em>are </em>liable for the misconduct, negligence or omissions of their agents; and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>there he the absence of special rewards or advantages. The distinction is so stated in <em>The City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Long\u2019s adm\u2019rs, </em>17 Gratt. 375. The remarks just made by us, concerning the liability of a municiPa^ corPoration, apply only to cases arising under the second branch of the distinction, the principles of which are strongly applicable to a case in which a municipal corporation is a wharf owner, entitled as such to receive wharfage. See Dillion on Municipal Corporations, ch. 23, and notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We have examined the authorities referred to by the learned counsel for the city of Petersburg, to wit: <em>Home </em>v. <em>Richards, 4 </em>Call 441; <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Cunliff, </em>2 Comst. 165; Sh. &amp; Red. on Negligence, \u00a7\u00a7 123, 126, 147, 148 and 407; Wharton on Negligence, \u00a7 52; <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Long\u2019s adm\u2019rs, </em>17 Gratt. 375; <em>Fowle </em>v. <em>The Common Council of Alexandria, </em>3 Pet. R. 398; <em>The City of Providence </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>17 How. U. S. R. 161; <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Wise, </em>5 Best &amp; Smith (117 E. C. L. R.) 439; <em>Weightman </em>v. <em>The Corporation of Washington, </em>1 Black\u2019s R. 39; <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Sheffield, 4 </em>Wall. U. S. R. 189; <em>Withers </em>v. <em>The North Kent Railway Company, </em>3 Hurlst. <em>&amp; </em>Nor. 969. But without stating the purport of these authorities, it is sufficient to say that we do not consider any of them to be in conflict with what we have stated, as in our opinion the law and the authorities cited by us in support thereof. None of the cases referred to by the counsel are cases of a wharf owner, receiving or entitled to receive wharfage; in which case the obligation of such owner to keep his wharf in repair, and to keep the water adjacent thereto free from obstruction, as before stated, seems to be well settled. And though in an action for negligence in such a case, the burden of proving such negligence, devolves, of course, on the plaintiff, yet proof of the existence of an obstruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>in such a case is, generally at least, <em>prima facie </em>evidence of such negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"AIX\">That it is made the duty of the port warden to see \u25a0that the navigation of the Appomattox river, in the city of Petersburg, is kept free from obstruction, and to attend to the duties of the city, in regard to the city wharf, can make no difference. The port warden in this matter is but the agent of the city, and a principal is always bound for the acts and neglects of his agent in the execution of the agency. The same rule on this subject, which applies to a private principal, applies to a corporation, whether ordinary or municipal, and <em>a fortiori </em>to a corporation, which can only act by an agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Nor can it make any difference that it has been made the duty of the Lower Appomattox company to dredge and remove obstructions from the river at and below Petersburg, under the acts passed December 8th, 1824 (acts 1823-\u20194, p. 45, ch. 48), and March 28th, 1851 (acts of 1850-\u201951, p. 72, ch. 91). It seems that the city is now in effect the Lower Appomattox company, owning all the stock of that company, and electing its directory, which company, therefore, is a mere agency of the city. But even if it were a separate and independent organization, its obligation to perform a duty, which the city is also bound to perform, on common law principles, would not relieve the city from its common law liability for the non-performance of such a duty. If so,, a party affected by the neglect of such duty might he injured by this substituted liability of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Nor can it make any difference that the United States have made appropriations to the improvement of the navigation of the river, and have occasionally dredged it. While such operations are beneficial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>city, they do not relieve it from its common law liability in regard to the city wharf.</p>\n<p id=\"Arl\">That no wharfage was actually received by the city th*8 case, and that it does not usually charge wharf-age in such cases, can make no difference. It is sufficient that the city was entitled to make the charge, and that wharfage was due by the vessel owner. He could not know that no wharfage would be received of him. He came to the city with his vessel, laden with a cargo of coal consigned to merchants of the city, and not being able to go up at once to the wharf nearest his consignees, he moored his vessel to the city wharf, relying on the city for the safety of his vessel, expecting and intending of course to pay the legal wharfage-</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The court is further of opinion that the circuit court did not err in overruling the demurrer to the fourth count of the declaration. Without setting out the-substance of that count here, it is sufficient to say that it sets out a good cause of action, and is free from just ground of objection. The demurrer to the third count was sustained, and there was no demurrer to the first or second count.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ9\">The court is further of opinion, that the circuit court did not err in giving the six instructions asked for by the plaintiff; nor in refusing to give the first, second, third and fourth instructions asked for by the defendant ; nor in giving the instruction which it gave of its own motion. These instructions, taken altogether, correctly expounded the law, and were not calculated to mislead the jury. (The court here read the instructions, and commented briefly upon them.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The court is further of opinion, that the circuit court .did not err in overruling the motion of the defendant to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial upon the ground that the verdict is contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>law and the evidence in the cause. It is not necessary to decide whether the certificate is of evidence or of facts. Regarding it as a certificate of facts so far as it is possible so to regard it, and even viewing it most favorably for the defendant, still we think it fully sustains the verdict. The plaintiff\u2019s vessel while lawfully lying at the city wharf, struck against a pile at the bottom of the river, about two and a half feet from the wharf, which penetrated the bottom of the vessel, and caused it to sink. It is probable from the certificate of facts, that the said pile was a part of the wharf, at least originally. But whether so or not it evidently had been there a long time. It was buried more than two feet in the sand, projected from a foot and a half to two feet above the bottom, and leaned from the direction of the wharf towards the opposite side of the river. There had been no dredging at that point, nor within two feet of the wharf, either by the defendant or by the Lower Appomattox company, or the United States, or any other agency. Due diligence on the part of the wharf owner required that there should be such a dredging at reasonable intervals of time; for the existence of such an obstruction occasionally might reasonably have been expected, and the risk of injury to vessel owners who are invited to come to the wharf required the exercise of such diligence. Had there been such dredging during the year next preceding the injury complained of, the obstruction which occasioned it would no doubt have been discovered, and might have been removed in time to prevent the injury. In fact it could be seen from the surface of the water at low tide.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Upon the whole, we are of the opinion that there is no error in the judgment, and that it ought to be. affirmed. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Judgment aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
