W, committee of a lunatic C, settled his account in 1858, which showed him indebted to C in the sum of $1,761.72. In 1863 W again set-tied his account, showing a balance' against him of $1,394.71, as of the 1st November 1863, the only charges against him in this account being the balance of the previous account. In March 1864, upon the petition of W, the judge of the circuit court made an order, authorizing him to invest the amount of $1,000 in Confederate or State bonds; and in the same month W deposited this sum with the treasurer of the Confederate States, and received a certificate showing he was entitled to receive a <em>four per cent, </em>bond of the Confederate States; but it does not appear that the bond was ever issued&amp;emdash;Held : The money in the hands of W having been received in good money, the order of the judge was not authorized by the statute, and W must account for it in good money.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b385-14\">2. The commissioner, in settling the account of W, makes two statements, the only difference in them being, that in one he gives W credit for the $1,000 Confederate bond) and in the other he omits it; and he refers the question of W\u2019s right to the credit to the court. The court adopts the statement, giving him the credit, and decrees accordingly. On appeal held, an exception to the report was not necessary, and the appellate court may correct the decree.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b385-17\">3. The accounts, settled in 1558 and 1863, speaks of W as trustee of C; but in the account by the commissioner he is treated as committee of C. There having been no exception to the report for bringing into the latter account the charges in the first two, W\u2019s adm\u2019r cannot object to the report on this ground in the appellate court, he not having excepted in the circuit court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b385-19\">4.

Adams, committee of Meriwether Cole, a lunatic, against the ad-, ministrator of Walter W. Cole, deceased, a former committee of the lunatic, for a settlement of the account of said Walter W. Cole. The only matter of controversy in the circuit court seems to have been whether Walter W. Cole was entitled to a credit for $1,000, invested under an order of the judge in a Confederate bond. The court below allowed the credit, and Adams, the committee, obtained an appeal to this court.

Cole, deceased, the former committee of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">The only object of the suit was to hold the estate of the said Walter W. Cole to account for the sum of $1,000, alleged by the administrator to have been invested by his intestate for the appellant in a bond of the Confederate States, under an order of the judge of said court made in vacation on the 8th day of March 1864, upon an <em>ex parte </em>petition of the said 'Walter W. Cole, under the act of the general assem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>bly passed March 5th, 1863, entitled \u201can act authorizing fiduciaries to invest funds in their hands in cer tain eases, and for other purposes.\u201d Acts of 1862-\u201963, Ch. 46, P. 81.</p>\n<p id=\"A9s\">A commissioner of the court was ordered to take \u2022an account of the transactions of the said Walter W. Cole as committee, \u201cshowing what estate of Meriwether Cole (the lunatic) went into the hands of said committee, and his disposition of the same, and particularly when and from what source, and in what kind \u25a0of funds the sum of $1,000 was received,\u201d alleged to have been invested as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The account was taken as ordered, and by the re-' port of the commissioner, and the evidence in the cause, it appears that the said Walter W. Cole qualified as committee of the appellant in the year '1854. He made-two <em>ex parte </em>settlements of his accounts, one in the year 1858, and the other in the year 1863. By the first of these, it appears that the only estate of the lunatic, that ever came to the hands of the committee, was the sum of $1,952.41, received June 1st, 1854; \u2022and the balance found against him on the first settlement, to wit: $1,761.72, as of the 1st day of November 1858, was carried into the account stated in the \u2022second settlement, which last named account as stated showed a balance against him of $1,394.71, as of the 1st day of November 1863.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">This last named balance therefore, of $1,394.71, was payable in specie or its equivalent. It had never been invested, so far as appears, and it was therefore a <em>specie \u25a0debt, </em>owing by the committee to the estate he represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">The petition, on which the order of the 8th of March 1864 wa3 made, does not appear in the record. A copy of the order, however, is filed, in which the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>tion is merely referred to, not recited, and the petitioner by that order was authorized to invest in his name as committee $1,000 in interest-bearing bonds of the Confederate States, or State of Virginia, \u201c to be held by him according to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">It does not appear that the investment as ordered was ever completed. The certificate of a depositary of the Confederate States, dated 11th March 1864, is. filed, showing that the sum of $1,000 was paid into the office of the depositary on that day by the said Walter W. Cole, which entitled him to registered bonds of the Confederate States, bearing <em>four per centum, per annum </em>interest from that date. But no such registered bonds were filed, nor does it appear that any such were ever issued in pursuance of the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">W\u00e9 have then the naked case of a fiduciary owing a <em>specie </em>debt to the estate he represented, attempting to discharge that debt by substituting therefor an incomplete investment in <em>four per cent. </em>Confederate bonds of his own Confederate notes, depreciated to such an extent as to be of comparatively little value.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">\u25a0 The circuit court of Charlotte allowed the amount of this pretended investment as a credit to the estate of the committee in the settlement of his accounts,, and this is the only assignment of error relied on by the appellant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">If this had been the first case in this court in which the validity of such an investment as was made by this committee was questioned, we should have had no difficulty in holding that it was of no force. But the invalidity of such investments has been already settled by repeated decisions of this court. <em>Campbell\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Campbell\u2019s ex\u2019or, </em>22 Gratt. 649; <em>Crickard\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Crickard\u2019s legatees, </em>25 Gratt. 410; <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Goodykoontz &amp; als., </em>26 Gratt. 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>It is insisted however by the counsel for the appellee, that the error complained of by the appellant cannot be corrected on this appeal, because the appellant did not except to the commissioner\u2019s report in the circuit court. The facts were shown by the report and the evidence in the cause. The commissioner did not undertake to pass upon the validity of the investment, but that being a question of law, arising upon the facts stated, he expressly referred it, as he had the right to do, to the court for decision; and for the convenience of the court, in applying the law, he made alternate statements of the accounts, in one of which the committee was credited with the amount of the investment claimed, and in the other no such credit was allowed. This was the only difference in the two accounts as stated. In such case no exception by either party in regard to the investment was necessary. The alternate statements, in respect of the credit for the investments allowed in the one, and disallowed in the other, was to that extent, and no further, conflicting, and so far each operated as an exception to the other; and in deciding the question of law, submitted by the commissioner, the court must of necessity have adopted one statement and rejected the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">It was further argued by the counsel for the appellee, that the evidence in the record does not show that the appellee\u2019s intestate was at all indebted as <em>committee </em>to the appellant; that the <em>ex parte </em>settlements appear on their face to have been of accounts of the said intestate as <em>trustee </em>of the appellant, and that'the balance carried by the commissioner into the account stated by him of the transactions of the said intestate as committee, was a balance which appeared to be owing by said intestate as \u201ctrustee\u201d and not as \u201ceommit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>tee.\u201d \u00a5e think it does sufficiently appear, looking to the whole record, that this balance was owing by the appellee\u2019s intestate as \u201c committee,\u201d and although in these <em>ex parte </em>settlements the appellee was styled \u201ctrustee\u201d by the commissioner who stated the accounts, yet the settlements were really of transactions as committee. However that may be, whether the appellee\u2019s intestate was ever at any time a <em>trustee </em>for the appellant, and whether the transactions embraced in the <em>ex parte </em>settlements were transactions of such trustee, or whether they were really transactions as <em>committee, </em>were matters which might be affected by extraneous testimony, and'when the commissioner by his report treated them as transactions of said intestate' in his character of committee, the appellee, if he intended to make any objection on that account, should have excepted to the report. Ho such exception was filed in the circuit court, and the objection now made here, and made for the first time in the cause, comes too late. 2 Rob. Prac. (old ed.) 383; <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Neville\u2019s trustees &amp; als., </em>26 Gratt. 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">If the objection now made here had been made in the circuit court, both parties would have had an opportunity of taking proof touching the matters presented by the exception, and, no doubt, the truth, either one way or the other, if it did not already sufficiently appear, could have been readily established.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">It was further objected by the appellee\u2019s counsel in argument, that upon the authority of <em>Bird\u2019s committee </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>21 Gratt. 712, the suit in this ease could only be maintained by the committee of the appellant, and that the bill of the complainant should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">The bill is in the name of \u201c Meriwether W. Cole, who being a person of unsound mind, \u00e1hes by his next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>friend and <em>committee, </em>Paul <em>Y. </em>Adams,\u201d &amp;c. This would seem to be substantially a suit by the committee in the name of the lunatic. It was so treated by the judge \u25a0of the circuit court\u2014for in the decree complained of, he ordered the committee to settle his accounts as such. The objection is certainly of the most technical \u25a0character, and if there was any defect in the form of the bill, the objection should have been made in the circuit court, where, by amendment, the error, if any, \u25a0might have been corrected. <em>Bird\u2019s committee </em>v. <em>Bird, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">It appears that the appellee, as administrator of Walter W.Cole, turned over to the present committee of the lunatic a bond of James R. Real and A. R. Real, for about the sum of $498, with interest from some day in the year 1858, payable to the said Walter W. Cole, as \u201ctrustee or committee,\u201d upon which bond suit was instituted and \u00e1 judgment recovered. What amount, if any, has been realized on the judgment, whether the obligors are solvent, or whether if insolvent they were insolvent when the bond was executed, does not \u25a0appear. So it is, the administrator of Walter W. Cole received no credit for it, or any part of it, in the account settled by the commissioner, and the judge of the circuit court therefore properly ordered an inquiry as to this judgment, with a view of giving credit to the appellee for whatever amount it might be ascertained on the inquiry he was entitled t\u00f3.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We are of opinion that the decree complained of is erroneous, except such part thereof as directs the inquiry aforesaid; and, with this exception, the decree must be reversed and the cause remanded to the circuit court of the county of Charlotte for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity with the principles herein declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The decree was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">This day came again the parties by their counsel, and the court having maturely considered the transcript of the record of the decree aforesaid, and the arguments of counsel, is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing, and filed with the record, that the said circuit court of the county of Charlotte erred in the decree aforesaid in sanctioning the investment of' $1,000 therein mentioned, and in confirming the report of commissioner J. W. Marshall, so far as said report ascertained the balance due from the appellee\u2019sintestate to the appellant to be $894.79, as of the 1st day of November 1865; and the said circuit court further erred in said decree in not wholly rejecting the statement of the account returned by said commissioner with his said report, in which the said sum of' $1,000 was credited to the appellee\u2019s intestate, and in not approving and adopting the other statement of the account filed by said commissioner with his said report, in which the said sum of $1,000 was not credited to the said intestate, and by which the balance, owing by the said intestate to the appellant, is shown to be $1,394.79, as of the said 1st day of November 1865; and while the said court did not err in directing the inquiry into the debt owing by James Neal and A. R. Neal, yet when the true value of said debt shall be ascertained, it should be deducted from the said sum of $1,394.79, and the remainder will be the sum which should be decreed to be paid with interest to the committee and next friend of the appellant by the appellee out of the estate of his intestate. It is therefore decreed and ordered, that the said decree of the circuit court of the county of Charlotte, so far as it is herein-before declared to be erroneous, be reversed and an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>nulled, and that the same be affirmed in all other respects; and that the appellee out of the estate of his intestate, in his hands to be administered, pay to Paul \"V. Adams, the next friend and committee of the appellant, the costs of the appellant by him expended in the prosecution of his said appeal here. And this cause is remanded to the said circuit court of the county of Charlotte for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity with the opinion and principles herein declared, which is ordered to he certified to the \u25a0said circuit court of the county of Charlotte.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">.Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
