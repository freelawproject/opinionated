The plaintiffs declared upon a writing obligatory for $1,800, executed by John Lewis and. James E. Haskins. The defendants filed the pleas of \u201cpayment,\u201d and <em>\u201cnon est factum.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-8\">The paper declared on was aB follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-9\">Dolls. $1800.

But the court overruled the objection, and admitted the paper as evidence; and the defendants excepted. There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs; and thereupon the defendant applied to one of the judges' of this court for a <em>supersedeas; </em>which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-12\"><em>Jones Bouldin, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-13\"><em>Jno.

And the persons making the writing on which this action is founded, having severally annexed to their names subscribed to the said writing the said word \u201cseal;\u201d and having clearly indicated in the body of the said writing, their intention to make it a sealed instrument, by using therein the words: \u201c as witness our hands and seals,\u201d &amp;c.; the court is of opinion that the said writing is a sealed instrument accordingly. See 2 Bob. Pract., ch. 1, pp. 2-8, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">Therefore it is considered by the court that there is no error in the said judgment; that the same be affirmed; and that'the plaintiffs in error, John T.
