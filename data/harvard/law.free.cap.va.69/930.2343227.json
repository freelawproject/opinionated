In June the case is continued for the commonwealth. The counsel of R relying on the practice of other clerks, to issue <em>subpoenas </em>for a witness once directed to be summoned, does not direct the issue of one to the October term; and one is not issued, and C is not present when on the 2nd of October the case is called at that term. The court continues the case until the 9th, and the clerk by the first mail (the next day) sends a <em>subpoena </em>for C, to the sheriff of Surry; but on the 9th the writ is not returned nor is the witness present. Though the counsel for R states in writing that he has conversed with C, and that he will prove material facts, which he states, in favor of R, and R swears that C is a material witness for her, and she cannot go safely to trial without him, and that she can prove by him the facts stated by the counsel, the court held justified in refusing a continuance of the cause.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b950-12\">At the October term 1875 of the corporation court of Norfolk, Amedee Roussell and Amelia Roussell were jointly indicted, for, on the 7th of September, 1875, stealing a large quantity of jewelry, a gold watch and silver forks, the property of Emile Goulard. The cases were continued until the October term 1876, the parties being admitted to bail. When the case was called at the October term 1876, the attorney for the commonwealth elected to try them separately, and to take up first the case of Amelia Roussell. She, by her counsel, then moved the court for a continuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>\u25a0the cause, upon the ground of the absence of George T. Clarke, a material witness for her, who lived in the county of Surry. The counsel stated in writing that he had conversed with Clarke, and he expected to prove by him that Goulard, the prosecutor in the case, and the main witness, was unworthy of belief, and that disposition had been made of part, if not the whole, of the property alleged by Goulard to have been stolen by the prisoners prior to the time at which the prisoners were charged with the theft. And the prisoner made oath to the materiality of the witness, and that she could not go safely to trial without him. That she expected to prove by him that Goulard was unworthy of belief, and that some, if not all, of the articles alleged to have been stolen by her were disposed of by Goulard, in Surry county, before the day on which it is alleged she stole them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b951-4\">It appeared that in September 1875, before the indictment was found, the prisoner had caused a <em>subpoena to </em>be issued by the clerk of the corporation court for Clarke, addressed to the sheriff of Surry county, returnable October 7th, 1875; which was returned by sheriff, \u201ccame to hand 11th day of October 1875, too late to be executed.\u201d That on the 19th of October the counsel caused to be issued two <em>subpoenas </em>for Clarke, returnable to the November term; and one of these he mailed to the sheriff of Surry, and the other to Clarke; but no return was made of said writs. That on the 4th of November the court caused a rule to be issued against Clarke, directed to the sheriff of Surry county, returnable on the 10th of November, on which there was a return of\u2014\u201c came to hand November 15th, too late to execute.\u201d That Clarke being a member of the legislature, the case was continued to the April term of the court; but the clerk by mistake issued a <em>sub</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number><em>poena </em>returnable to March term, which was returned 7 executed. Nothing was done at the April term in the-At the June term Clarke was present; but the case was' continued for the commonwealth. That prisoner\u2019s, counsel relying upon what was the habit of clerks in other courts to regularly issue <em>subpoenas </em>in all cases when once, an order had been given, to every term of the court in which the case was docketed for-trial, without further directions, did not give any additional memorandum to the clerk directing said witness, Clarke, to be <em>subpcenead. </em>That on the 2d of October 1876, upon the calling of the case for trial, Clarke being absent, not being summoned, and no directions given to the clerk since the first calling of the cause, on motion the court continued the case in order to get said witness present, to the 9th day of October 1876. That then and there the prisoner through her counsel caused another <em>subpoena </em>to be issued for said witness, Clarke, returnable to the 9th of October; and that the clerk sent the said <em>subpoena </em>by the first mail (the next morning), directed to the sheriff of Surry county; but said <em>subpoena </em>was not returned in time for the trial, nor did the witness appear.

The jury found her guilty, fixed the term of her imprisonment in the penitentiary at five years; and she was sentenced by the court accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">When the case was called for trial, she by her counsel moved the court for a continuance of the cause, on the ground of the absence of a witness. The court overruled the motion, and she excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The single question presented for the consideration of this court upon the writ of error is, whether the court below erred in overruling the prisoner\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">In support of her motion, she proved by her counsel that the witness on account of whose absence the motion was made, was George T. Clarke, of the county of Surry, Virginia; that the counsel bad conversed with the witness on the subject of his testimony; that it was material to the defence of the prisoner, and that she expected to prove by said Clarke that M. Goulard, the prosecutor and main witness for the commonwealth (whose goods she was charged in the indictment with having stolen), was unworthy of belief; and that Goulard had disposed of a part, if not the whole of the goods charged to have been stolen, prior to the time at which it was alleged that the prisoner had committed the larceny thereof. In addition to this statement of her counsel, she made an affidavit to the same effect, and further, that she could not safely go to trial in the absence of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">It appears by the record that she was indicted in the corporation court of Norfolk, on the 4th day of October 1875. So that twelve months intervened between the finding of the indictment and her trial and convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>tion thereunder. By the direction of her counsel, <em>sL subpoena </em>for the witness Clarke was issued on the 80th day'of September, four days before she was indicted,, addressed to the sheriff of Surry, and returnable on the 7th day of October following. It was not executed; the sheriff making return that it came to hand \u201ctoo late to execute.\u201d The case was continued to the November term following. Previous to that term, to wit, on the 19th of October, the prisoner\u2019s counsel caused two <em>subpoenas </em>to be issued for Clarke, one of which was mailed' to the sheriff of Surry, and the other was mailed to Clarke himself, both returnable to the November term of the court; but no return was-ever made of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">At the November term, to wit, on the 4th day of November, a rule was made against Clarke, returnable to the 10th day of the same month; to which rule the sheriff of Surry made return, that it \u201c came to hand 15th November, too late to execute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">The court learning that Clarke was a member of the Virginia legislature, continued the case to the April' term following (1876). The clerk issued a <em>subpoena </em>for Clarke, but by mistake made it returnable to March instead of to the April term. The <em>subpoena </em>was executed, but nothing was done in the case at the April term. At the June term, it is stated in the bill of exceptions, but no copy of any order of the court at that term appears in the record, that Clarke was present and that the case was continued \u201con the motion of the commonwealth, and not upon the motion of the prisoner.\u201d At the July term the case was continued for the commonwealth, on account of \u201cthe illness of an important witness for the commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Whether the witness, Clarke, was in attendance at the July term does not appear. The case was eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>tinued at that term to the October term following (1876). When the case was called for trial at the October term, to wit, on the 2nd day of October, the witness, Clarke, was not in attendance, and it appeared that he had not been summoned to attend, that no process had issued requiring his attendance, and none had been ordered to be issued; \u201cthe prisoner\u2019s counsel relying,\u201d as stated in the bill of exceptions, \u201cupon what was the habit of the clerks of other courts to regularly issue <em>subpoenas </em>in all cases, when once an order had been given, to every term of the court in which the case was docketed, without further directions.\u201d The bill then proceeds as follows: \u201cthat on the 2nd day of October, 1876, upon the calling of the case for trial, the said witness Clarke being absent, not having been summoned, and no direction having been given to the cjerk since the first calling of the ease, on motion, the court continued the case, in order to get said witness present, to the 9th day of October 1876. That then and there the prisoner, through her counsel, caused another <em>subpcena </em>to be issued for said witness, Clarke, returnable to the 9th day of October 1876; that the clerk of said court did issue said <em>subpcena, </em>and sent it by the first mail (the next morning) directed to the sheriff of Surry county, that said <em>subpcena </em>was not returned in time for the trial, nor did the witness appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">\u201cA motion for a continuance,\u201d says Judge <em>Moncure, </em>delivering the opinion of the court in <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Gratt. 627, 629, \u201cis addressed to the <em>sound discretion </em>of the court, under all the circumstances of the case; and though an appellate court will supervise the action of an inferior court on Buch a motion, it will not reverse a judgment on that ground, unless such action is <em>plainly </em>erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>Was the action of the corporation court in refusing the continuance in this case under all the circumstances \u201cplainly erroneous?\u201d I cannot think so. Although the case was pending in court for twelve months, it does not appear that a <em>subpoena </em>was ever served upon the witness Clarke but once, and then the <em>subpoena </em>was returnable to the wrong term of the coui\u2019t; nor does it appear that he was ever in attendance except at one term, (June), and it does not appear that he had been summoned to that term. Surely, under the circumstances disclosed by the record, after the case had been continued from the July term to the October term following, it behooved the prisoner to use diligence in preparing for trial at that term. And yet no summons was issued for the witness whose testimony was deemed of such great importance to the prisoner on the trial, and no steps whatever were taken to secure his attendance. The only excuse offered for this omission, was, that the prisoner\u2019s counsel relied upon the habit of the <em>clerks of other </em>courts, when a <em>subpoena </em>for a witness had once been ordered in a case, to continue to issue it afterwards from term to term until trial, without further directions. This is not a valid excuse. After the delay, which had occurred, special efforts should have been made to secure the attendance of this witness. Instead of that, no effort was made at all. It cannot be said that she was prevented from making such efforts by confinement in jail: for she was at large on bail the greater part of the time after she was indicted, and during the whole of the time from the July term till the October term following at which she was tried. When the case, therefore, was called for trial on the 2nd day of October, 1876, it would not have been error if the court had proceeded at once with the trial'in the absence of the witness. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>But the court, out of mere indulgence, doubtless, to the prisoner, and to enable her still to secure the attendance of Clarke at the trial, postponed it till \u25a0 another day of the term, the 9th day of October. After this had been done, it was not the exercise of \u25a0due diligence on the part of the prisoner merely to cause a <em>subpoena </em>for the witness to be sent through the mail into another county to a sheriff who on two previous occasions in the same case had made return on process \u201cnot time to execute,\u201d and at other times had not returned the process at all. The prisoner could not have known that the <em>subpoena </em>thus sent would have reached the sheriff in time to be executed by him, if it reached him at all. Under the circumstances, some other more certain mode should have been adopted to have the <em>subpoena </em>served, or at least placed in due time in the sheriff\u2019s hands for service.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-3\">The affidavit of the prisoner, that Clarke was a material witness, and that she expected to prove by him certain facts, should, under the circumstances, have further stated, if true, that she could not prove the same facts by any other witness present at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">The counsel for the prisoner, in his printed note of argument, cites in support of his assignment of error the case of <em>Gwatkin </em>v. Commonwealth, 10 Leigh 687. That case was essentially different from the one we are now considering. There it was shown that the absent witness had been duly summoned, that his testimony was material, that facts material to the defence could be proved by him which could not be proved by any other witness, and that the witness was probably prevented from attending by his sickness. The certificate of the judge in the bill of exceptions in this case that the evidence on the trial (which was made a part of the record) was of \u201ca circumstantial nature and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>conflicting,\u201d can have no controlling influence in de- \u00b0 termining the propriety of the action of the court in refusing to grant the continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"AI0\">S I ana of opinion that there is no error in the judgment of the corporation court of the city of Norfolk,, and that the said judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Moncure, P., and Christian and Staples, Js., concurred in the opinion of <em>Burks, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Anderson, J., dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">Judgment aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
