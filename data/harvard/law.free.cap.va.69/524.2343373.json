Moore against the Fireman\u2019s Fund insurance company, of San Francisco, on a policy of insurance. Issue was joined on the plea of non assumpsit, and leave was given to introduce any evidence under that plea which could be introduced under any special plea. The jury found a verdict for the defendants on the issue joined; and thereupon the plaintiff moved the court to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial, which motion was overruled, and .judgment was rendered for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"AWh\">The plaintiff excepted to an opinion of the court .given against him on the trial of the cause. It is stated in the bill of exceptions that on the trial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>cause the plaintiff, to sustain the issue on his part, offered the policy of insurance which is set out <em>in haec verba </em>in the bill.

The same proceedings were had in both cases in the circuit court; and this case, as well as that, was brought to this court by writ of' error. The two cases involve the same questions, and were argued and heard in this court at the same time. The court is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing and filed with the record in that case and to be considered as filed with the record in this case also, that there is no error in the judgment in this ease, and. therefore affirm the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Judgment aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
