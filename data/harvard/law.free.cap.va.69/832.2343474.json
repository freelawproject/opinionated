L, who lived in Richmond, Va., in September, 1858, executed to S, \u2022 who lived in Baltimore, his bond for $4,500. S diedin March, 1861, leaving an estate of $60,000, and a wife and two children, minors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>There were three representatives on his estate of whom his widow was one, and she also qualified as guardian of her children. S\u2019s estate was fully administered except the bond of L which was left with the widow, and all his debts were paid. In 1861, C, the oldest son of S, came to Virginia and joined the Confederate army. Whilst still a minor he, with the concurrence of his mother, collected from L money on his bond, which was paid in Confederate money at par, and after C came of age he collected of L the balance due upon bond, and executed a paper by which, setting out all the moneys he had received, he recognized them all as valid payments, and undertook that the bond should be charged to him as part of his interest in his father\u2019s estate; and after his return to Baltimore in 1865, the widow\u2019s accounts as guardian of her children were settled by a commissioner, this bond brought into them, and full acquittances given her. In 1870 the estate of S was committed in Virginia, and the administrator filed a bill to recover the amount of the bond from the executrix and devisees of L, who had died in 1866\u2014Held : There being no debts of S to be paid, the bond must be considered as satisfied.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b853-8\">This case was argued in Richmond, at the March term of^ the court, and decided at Wytheville. It was a suit in equity in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill, in the chancery court of Richmoud, brought in November 1870, by the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Thomas B. Small, against the executrix and devisees of Robert R. Lumpkin, deceased, to subject the real estate of said Lumpkin to satisfy a debt of $4,500, with interest from the 1st day of June 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b853-9\">Thomas B. Small was a resident of Baltimore, and died there in March 1861. Lumpkin lived in Richmond, and died there in 1866. By bond bearing date the 7th of September 1858, Lumpkin bound himself, &amp;c., twelve months after date, to pay to Thomas B. Small $4,500, with interest from the 1st of June 1858. And the only question in the cause was, whether Lumpkin had made a valid payment of this debt to Charles W. Small, a son of Thomas B. Small, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>came to Virginia in 1861, and remained in the South during the late civil war. The facts on that question are sufficiently stated by Judge <em>Burks </em>in his opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b854-11\">A commissioner was directed to take, among others, an account of the debts due from the estate of Lump-kin.

To this report the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b854-12\">The cause came on to be heard on the 22d of February 1872; when the court overruled the exception and confirmed the report.

Small. The defendants answered that the debt was paid. The chancellor was satisfied that the defense was made good by the proofs, and decreed accordingly; and in this, I think, he committed no error. Lumpkin was a citizen of Virginia, and died in 1866. Small, a citizen of. Maryland, died there in March 1861. He left a wife and two sons (minors), entitled under the .laws of Maryland to his estate. After the payment-of his debts, which were inconsiderable, and two pecuniary legacies given by his will, the estate was worth upwards of sixty thousand dollars. The widow and two other persons qualified in Baltimore as representatives of the estate with the will of the testator annexed. She also qualified there as guardian of the children. The administration of the estate, except the Lumpkin debt, seems to have been conducted exclusively-by her co-administrators. The Lumpkin bond was left .with her and committed to her sole management.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Some time during the year 1861, the exact date not distinctly appearing, C. W. Small (the elder of the two sons) came to Virginia and enlisted as a soldier in the Confederate army, and continued in that service until the end of the war. While in Virginia, and during the war, he undertook to collect, and did collect, of Lumpkin the amount of his bond. The greater part was collected while he was under age. He became of age on the 30th day of December 1863; and on the 6th day of January 1864 he collected the remnant of the debt, amounting to $1,875.26. The collections were all made in Confederate currency, taken at its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>par value. When he made the last collection he executed his covenant to Lumpkin, reciting all the payments made to him, ratifying th\u00e9 collections made while he was a minor, and directing his guardian to charge him with what he had collected as a part of his distributive share of his father\u2019s estate, acknowledging the receipt thereof as if the same hadj' been paid to him by the representatives of the estate on account of his interest therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">When these payments- were made, Lumpkin (the debtor) was residing in Virginia, and Mrs. Small, the guardian of her son and representative of her husband\u2019s estate, was a resident of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">In the light of the authorities before cited, it may be conceded, for the purposes of this case, that under the harsh rules of war, the mother and son are to be considered as bearing to each other the unnatural relation of alien enemies; that the occasional correspondence between them, which is proved to have taken place during the conflict of arms then raging, was forbidden and unlawful; and that, pending hostilities, she could confer no valid power upon him, as her agent, to make the collections which he did make. With this concession, however, it by no means follows that the payments make by Lumpkin to O. W. Small were unlawful, and that the obligation of Lumpkin to Small\u2019s estate was not discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Lumpkin and O. W. Small were both Confederates, both within the territory and under the dominion of the same belligerent power. They, at least, were not alien enemies to each other, and it was therefore perfectly competent for them to deal and contract as between themselves. They did so deal and contract Let it be, that the communication, addressed by Mrs. Small to Lumpkin was no valid authority for him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>make payment to her son as her agent. At the time-this letter was addressed by Mrs. Small to Lumpkin, was written to O. W. Small by John E. Larus, half-brother, and <em>the agent of Mrs. Small, </em>advising O. W. Small to make collections of Lumpkin, if pos- # 1 7 * sible, in something else than depreciated currency,. and warning him over and over again, that if he collected in such currency, it was his <em>\u201cown </em>lookout,\u201d it must be on <em>\u201chis own </em>account.\u201d After these cautions, repeated in varied language* he concludes that part of his letter which relates to this subject, in these emphatic words: \u201cI think I have written plain enough, and <em>the whole matter </em>is thus <em>left entirely to yourself, </em>to take just as much as you choose, even if it is the <em>whole amount, remembering, </em>of course, that it is <em>on your own account, at its par or nominal value.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">\u201c The <em>whole matter </em>being thus left <em>entirely </em>to himself,\u201d O. W. Small undertook to act <em>for himself </em>and to deal \u201con <em>his own </em>account.\u201d He did so act and so deal. After attaining full age, he had the right so to act and so to deal, independently of any authority from his-mother or her agent; and accordingly when he received the last payment from Lumpkin, in his own name and on his own behalf he ratified all previous payments, dealings and transactions, and <em>personally </em>undertook that what he had received should stand as a <em>payment </em>to him of so much on account of his <em>distributive share </em>of his father\u2019s estate, in like manner as if it had been paid to him by his father\u2019s personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">- . The war being over he returned to Maryland, and there with his mother and brother, the only parties-interested in the estate in the absence of Lumpkin, and without his agency or influence, the whole matter of the Lumpkin debt was satisfactorily arranged and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>adjusted amongst them. Mrs. Small caused her accounts, as guardian of her two children, to be regularly and formally stated, settled and recorded. The Lumpkin debt was embraced in the settlement, and each of the wards gave her a full acquittance under seal, which was also duly recorded. This settlement appears to have been complete and final. The parties were all severally <em>sui juris, </em>acted with their eyes open, the facts fresh in their recollection, and with a full knowledge of their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">This settlement is conclusive against the parties to it, and binding upon the appellant. His administration here is but ancillary to the principal administration in Maryland. There the whole estate has been long since fully administered. The legacies under the will, and the debts against the estate, have all been fully paid, and the residue of the estate turned over to Mrs. Small and her children, who alone were entitled to it. It is not pretended that there are any creditors or other domestic claimants against the estate here. If therefore the appellant were permitted to recover th\u00e9 amount of the debt claimed of Lumpkin\u2019s estate, it would be for distribution to Mrs. Small and her . two sons. It has already been distributed amongst them, as shown by their own recorded admissions. It ought not to be collected and distributed a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">It is worthy of notice, that the Smalls had their final settlement amongst themselves as long ago as July 1865. The bill in this case was not filed until more than five years afterwards, and four years after Lumpkin\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">I am for affirming the decree of. the Chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">Decree aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
