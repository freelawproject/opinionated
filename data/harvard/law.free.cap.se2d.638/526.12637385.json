All parties have appealed. Because this is an interlocutory appeal, we have limited our review only to those questions over which we have jurisdiction: (1) the entry of summary judgment on all of Freida Foster's claims; and (2) the entry of summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages. We dismiss the parties' appeals with respect to the remaining issues since they are not properly the subject of a Rule 54(b) certification and do not affect a substantial right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With respect to Foster's claims, we hold that she has presented sufficient evidence to raise an issue of fact as to whether she has complied with the statute of limitations and the statute of repose. We agree with defendants, however, that she has submitted sufficient evidence to support only a negligent infliction of emotional distress (\"NIED\") claim against defendant Jason M. Crandell, M.D. The trial court's entry of summary judgment is, therefore, reversed only as to Foster's NIED claim against defendant Crandell. We also uphold the trial court's entry of summary judgment as to plaintiffs' punitive damages claims based on plaintiffs' failure to forecast sufficient evidence to meet the standard for punitive damages set forth in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1D-15(a) (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the early 1990s, Michael Rivest was the pastor of a small congregation of the Charismatic Episcopal Church and had established Isaiah 61 Ministries, Inc. (\"Isaiah 61\"), which was providing Christian counseling as the St. Matthew's Institute for Healing and Growth (\"St. Matthew's Institute\"). In 1994, Crandell agreed to work more closely with Rivest as a referral for any of Rivest's clients who could potentially benefit from medical management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Crandell thereafter became the medical director of Isaiah 61, and a brochure for Isaiah 61 and St. Matthew's Institute listed him as the organization's psychiatrist. In that position, Crandell provided general advice on conducting a counseling practice, made periodic review of Rivest's counseling reports,\n   and answered counseling-related questions from Rivest and other counselors at Isaiah 61. From late 1996 until 2001, Crandell was also involved in a Bible-study group with Rivest and was Rivest's personal physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June 1995, the North Carolina Board of Licensed Professional Counselors (the \"Board\") sent Rivest a letter directing him to cease and desist from providing counseling services, as he appeared to be engaged in the unlicensed practice of counseling in violation of the North Carolina Licensed Professional Counselors Act. Rivest responded to the Board by stating that he was under the \"direct supervision\" of Crandell. Crandell sent a similar letter to the Board, noting that he was employed by Isaiah 61 \"to provide a supervisory relationship\" to Rivest and, therefore, that Rivest was exempted from the Act's licensure requirement under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-332.1(a)(4) (2005) (stating that the Act does not apply to \"[a]ny person counseling as a supervised counselor in a supervised professional practice\"). The Board agreed to this arrangement and sent Rivest a letter stating that he was exempt from the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September 1996, however, the Board sent Crandell another letter indicating that it had reinterpreted the exemption found in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-332.1(a)(4) for supervised unlicensed counseling. The Board's new interpretation construed the exemption as applying only to counselors who were under temporary supervision while attempting to meet the licensure requirements of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-336(b)(2) (2005). According to Crandell, he then terminated his employment with Isaiah 61, but continued to review counseling session reports \"[a]s a courtesy\" until 1998. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend Crandell's supervisory relationship extended beyond 1998 for an unspecified period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In December 1998, the Board sent Rivest another cease and desist letter, copied to Crandell, that again noted N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-332.1(a)(4) no longer applied to Rivest's situation. Rivest's response, also copied to Crandell, stated that Isaiah 61 and St. Matthew's Institute were no longer charging fees for counseling services, and, therefore, were now exempt from the Act under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2090-332.1\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 90-332.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) (stating that the Act does not apply to \"[a]ny ordained minister or other member of the clergy while acting in a ministerial capacity who does not charge a fee for the service\"). Foster later testified that, in lieu of fees, she and the other plaintiffs were, at that time, expected to make \"donations\" to Rivest for his counseling services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff Tami Borland began Christian counseling at the St. Matthew's Institute in 1994 in an effort to save her marriage. After first receiving counseling from another counselor, Borland began regular counseling with Rivest's wife, Kathleen. By 1996, however, Borland had begun counseling exclusively with Rivest and, by 1997, had joined his religious sect, the \"Cistercian Oblates,\" which required that she wear a nun's habit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 1998, Rivest informed Borland that he believed she was experiencing \"stigmata pain,\" which, according to Rivest, was \"pain associated with that of Christ when Christ was nailed to the cross.\" Rivest told Borland that she needed medication and personally took her to see Crandell. Rivest explained that he \"had a business relationship\" with Crandell in which Crandell supervised Rivest's counseling sessions, reviewed his counseling notes and records, served as his advisor, and \"sign[ed] off\" on everything Rivest did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While in Crandell's office, Rivest explained stigmata pain and provided Crandell \"with literature and written documents that pertained to stigmata so that Dr. Crandell could educate himself....\" Crandell explained to Borland that Rivest was \"very qualified\" and that \"he deferred to [Rivest's] recommendations on a regular basis with regard to diagnoses.\" Crandell also told Borland that, if Rivest believed she was experiencing stigmata pain, then that was surely the source of her problem. Crandell thereafter started Borland on a treatment plan that included medication and regular counseling sessions with Crandell to \"talk[ ] about [the] pain associated with [her] stigmata.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In early 2000, Borland had a falling out with Rivest and terminated their relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although she continued her sessions with Crandell, she became concerned that he was communicating with Rivest about her therapy without her permission. When Borland expressed this concern to Crandell in February 2000, he advised her that she should \"seek treatment elsewhere because he did have an on-going supervisory relationship\" with Rivest. Crandell thereafter referred Borland to another mental health facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff Kathy Bowen began grief counseling with Rivest in 1997, following the death of her mother. Rivest told Bowen that he and Crandell \"had a psychiatric/counseling business\" and that Crandell oversaw Rivest's counseling and advised Rivest with respect to all of his clients. Bowen was ultimately treated by both Rivest and Crandell. During several of her therapy sessions with Crandell, he indicated to Bowen that he was \"aware of everything that was going on with [her]\" because \"he shared information with . . . Rivest due to his supervisory relationship over Rivest.\" Bowen also joined the Cistercian Oblates and began wearing a nun's habit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In July 1999, Rivest notified Bowen in writing that he had \"consulted today with both our Medical Director and Clinical Supervisor regarding [her] case,\" and that they had concluded her therapy sessions should be terminated. A copy of the letter was sent to Crandell. Bowen ended her relationship with both Rivest and Crandell in 2000. Nevertheless, in April 2001, after not having treated Bowen as a patient for nearly six months and just after she had filed a complaint with the Charismatic Episcopal Church alleging sexual abuse by Rivest, Crandell unexpectedly called Bowen at home and asked if she \"needed [any] medication.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In 1998, following the death of her fianc\u00e9e, plaintiff Frieda Foster began grief counseling with Rivest. Rivest told her that Crandell provided Rivest with \"outside supervision\" and, according to Rivest, reviewed Rivest's counseling notes, was aware of matters discussed in therapy, and assisted Rivest with developing treatment plans. Rivest told Foster that, if it became necessary during her counseling for her to receive medication, Rivest could refer her to Crandell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Foster continued to seek treatment with Rivest over the following year, visited his church, and soon also wore a nun's habit as a member of the Cistercian Oblates, which by that time consisted entirely of Rivest, Borland, Bowen, and Foster. By mid-1999, Foster had become estranged from her family, who believed she was developing an obsession with Rivest, and was attending counseling with Rivest five to six days per week. By 2000, Foster had given Rivest over $50,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Foster ultimately began to doubt the efficacy of Rivest's counseling services and terminated their relationship in 2001. Although Rivest had mentioned Crandell to Foster several times, she never had a conversation with Crandell pertaining to her therapy, and Crandell never took part in her counseling sessions with Rivest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On 26 October 2001, Borland, Bowen, and Foster filed suit against Isaiah 61 and Rivest, each alleging: (1) Rivest had taken \"certain indecent liberties\" with them that \"were intended for the sexual gratification of Rivest\"; (2) they had engaged in \"intimate acts\" with Rivest \"involuntarily and without consent\"; and (3) Rivest had used \"mind control techniques, threats and intimidation to illegally obtain money\" from them. The parties settled in May 2004, and Borland, Bowen, and Foster voluntarily dismissed their suit against Rivest and Isaiah 61 with prejudice on 9 June 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On 27 December 2002, prior to their settlement with Rivest and Isaiah 61, Borland, Bowen, and Foster filed their initial suit (02 CVS 8569) against Crandell and his employer, PsiMed, P.A. In their complaint, plaintiffs again alleged inappropriate acts by Rivest, but also added allegations regarding Crandell's supervisory authority over Rivest's practices, claiming they were entitled to recover for the injuries they incurred under Rivest's counseling from Crandell as a result of his inadequate supervision of Rivest and from PsiMed as a result of its inadequate supervision of Crandell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On 16 June 2003, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed that action without prejudice pursuant to N.C.R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(i). They subsequently filed a second action (04 CVS 3741) against Crandell and PsiMed on 14 January 2004, containing substantially the same allegations. Plaintiffs amended their complaint on 16 September 2004 to provide additional detail with respect to Crandell's supervision of Rivest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After answering plaintiffs' complaint, defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, claiming that plaintiffs' prior settlement with Rivest and Isaiah 61 precluded recovery in this action. Judge A. Moses Massey denied defendants' motion on 20 August 2004. On 18 April 2005, following discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment, again arguing, among other grounds, that the prior settlement barred plaintiffs' recovery, but also seeking judgment on all of plaintiffs' claims based on the statute of limitations, the statute of repose, and insufficient evidence. In addition, defendants moved to exclude the testimony of plaintiffs' two expert witnesses: clinical pharmacist Thomas E. Henry, III and psychiatrist Dr. James F.T. Corcoran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On 13 June 2005, Judge Lindsay R. Davis, Jr. entered an order (the \"Partial Summary Judgment Order\") and a detailed memorandum of decision. With respect to the effect of the prior settlement, Judge Davis ruled that defendants' motion for summary judgment presented no new arguments and resolution of the motion in defendants' favor on that basis would effectively overrule Judge Massey's order. For that reason, Judge Davis denied defendants' motion for summary judgment to the extent it relied on the prior settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As for Foster's claims, the trial court determined that they were barred by the four-year statute of repose for medical malpractice actions and, therefore, granted defendants summary judgment as to those claims. The court concluded that Borland's and Bowen's claims were not time-barred and that Borland and Bowen had presented sufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment except for their claim of negligence in the management of their medications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court further granted summary judgment as to plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs and defendants have both appealed from the Partial Summary Judgment Order. Additionally, defendants have appealed from Judge Massey's order denying their motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Interlocutory Nature of the Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We first observe that this appeal is interlocutory. An order is interlocutory if it does not dispose fully of a case, but rather requires further action by the trial court in order to finally determine the rights of all the parties involved in the controversy.\n   <em>\n    Veazey v.

Because the Partial Summary Judgment Order left intact Borland's and Bowen's claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision, and medical malpractice, the parties' appeal is interlocutory.\n   <em>\n    See Liggett Group Inc. v. Sunas,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8520479\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/113/19/#p23\">\n    113 N.C.App. 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20S.E.2d%20674\">\n    437 S.E.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677 (1993) (\"A grant of partial summary judgment, because it does not completely dispose of the case, is an interlocutory order from which there is ordinarily no right of appeal.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal only if (1) the trial court certified the order for immediate review under North Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), or (2) the order affects a substantial right that would be lost without immediate review.\n   <em>\n    Embler v.

We reach a different conclusion, however, with respect to the remaining parties' appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Borland's and Bowen's claims premised upon Crandell's alleged negligent medication management do not represent a separate claim for relief, but rather constitute simply one factual theory, among others, as to how Crandell committed medical malpractice. In the absence of a final judgment on plaintiffs' medical malpractice claim for relief, there is no basis for appeal under Rule 54(b) of the exclusion of the negligent medicine management theory. Likewise, the trial court's evidentiary ruling regarding Mr. Henry does not constitute a final judgment as to a claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Similarly, with respect to both defendants' cross-appeal from the Partial Summary Judgment Order as well as defendants' appeal from the order denying their motion for judgment on the pleadings, no final judgment has been entered with respect to any defendant or claim for relief.\n   <em>\n    See Yordy v.

Consequently, the trial court's Rule 54(b) certification is also ineffective to bring defendants' appeals properly before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Wood v. McDonald's Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8410721\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/166/48/#p53\">\n    166 N.C.App. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=603%20S.E.2d%20539\">\n    603 S.E.2d 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543 (2004) (addressing, under Rule 54(b) certification, the plaintiff's appeal from an order granting the defendants partial summary judgment, but dismissing the defendants' cross-appeal as interlocutory).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We next turn to the question whether the parties have demonstrated the existence of a substantial right. The Supreme Court has previously held that plaintiffs have a substantial right in having their \"claim for punitive damages determined, if at all, before the same judge and jury which heard the claim for compensatory damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Tridyn Indus., Inc. v. Am. Mut. Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8567731\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/296/486/#p493\">\n    296 N.C. 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 493,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=251%20S.E.2d%20443\">\n    251 S.E.2d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 448 (1979). Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review the trial court's entry of summary judgment on the issue of punitive damages. As for Borland's and Bowen's arguments regarding negligence in medicine management and the exclusion of Mr. Henry's testimony, they have made no assertion that those rulings affect a substantial right. An appellant bears the burden of establishing the existence of a substantial right,\n   <em>\n    Embler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11433839\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/143/162/#p164\">\n    143 N.C.App. at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=545%20S.E.2d%20259\">\n    545 S.E.2d at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and, as we have previously stressed, \"[i]t is not the duty of this Court to construct arguments for or find support for appellant's right to appeal from an interlocutory order....\"\n   <em>\n    Jeffreys v.

They may assert those arguments on any appeal from the entry of a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants, on the other hand, have specifically argued that both the order denying their motion for judgment on the pleadings and the Partial Summary Judgment Order affect a substantial right because, according to defendants, plaintiffs' claims are barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel as a result of plaintiffs' settlement and voluntary dismissal with prejudice of their claims against Rivest and Isaiah 61. When a trial court enters an order rejecting the affirmative defenses of res judicata and collateral estoppel, the order \"can affect a substantial right and may be immediately appealed.\"\n   <em>\n    McCallum v.

The question remains, however, whether Foster has offered sufficient evidence that she asserted those claims in a timely fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   It is undisputed that Crandell never treated Foster directly and that Foster bases her claims solely on his negligent supervision of Rivest. Consequently, in order to survive the motion for summary judgment based on the statutes of limitations and repose, Foster must point to evidence suggesting that Crandell continued to supervise Rivest after 27 December 1999 - a date three years before plaintiffs filed their original complaint on 27 December 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Borland's affidavit, submitted in opposition to summary judgment, states that Crandell advised her in February 2000 that she should \"seek treatment elsewhere because\n   <em>\n    he did have an on-going supervisory relationship with Michael Rivest.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) When this evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Foster, the nonmoving party, it is sufficient to raise an issue of fact as to whether Crandell's supervisory relationship with Rivest had continued into 2000. As a result, an issue of fact exists as to whether Foster's claims were filed within the three-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   With respect to the longer four-year statute of repose, Rivest sent Bowen a letter on 13 July 1999 - copied to Crandell - stating that Rivest had consulted with \"our Medical Director and Clinical Supervisor regarding [her] case\" and that Rivest and the Medical Director/Clinical Supervisor believed \"that counseling at St. Matthew's Institute will not decrease [her] problems at this time.\" Crandell does not dispute that he was the Medical Director/Clinical Supervisor, but contends that this letter was merely an outdated \"form letter\" and any reference to Crandell should be disregarded. The fact that the letter was, in handwriting, specifically copied to Crandell runs counter to this argument. To accept defendants' contention would require that we construe the evidence in a light favorable to Crandell - an approach not permissible at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In addition, Bowen's affidavit also provides that on \"a number of occasions\" after July 1999, Crandell indicated to her that he was familiar with her situation \"because he shared information with Michael Rivest due to his supervisory relationship over Rivest.\" Indeed, Foster's own affidavit states that in mid-1999, she saw Crandell interact with Rivest at church functions and \"come over for meetings.\" Collectively, this evidence is sufficient to raise an issue of fact as to whether Crandell was supervising Rivest after 27 December 1998, four years prior to the date plaintiffs filed their original complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Thus, Foster submitted sufficient evidence to raise issues of fact as to both the statute of limitations and the statute of repose. Accordingly, the trial court's award of summary judgment to defendants on Foster's claims on statutes of limitations or repose grounds was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Alternative Grounds for Upholding the Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants nevertheless argue that, even if the trial court erred by concluding Foster's claims were time-barred, defendants were entitled to summary judgment as to Foster's claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\"), NIED, negligent supervision by Crandell, and negligent supervision by PsiMed. If, as here, an appellee is not otherwise entitled to bring an appeal, the \"appellee may cross-assign as error any action or omission of the trial court which was properly preserved for appellate review and which deprived the appellee of an alternative basis in law for supporting the ... order ... from which appeal has been taken.\" N.C.R.App. P. 10(d). Defendants have properly cross-assigned error to the Partial Summary Judgment Order's failure to award them summary judgment on Foster's claims on grounds other than the statutes of limitations and repose.

Defendants argue that \"Foster has offered no evidence or explanation as to how defendant Crandell's alleged negligent\n   supervision caused her serious emotional distress\" because Crandell did not review her records or have any professional relationship with her and because Crandell concluded his supervision of Rivest in November 1998.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   This analysis, however, views the evidence in a light most favorable to defendants. As set out above, the record contains evidence that would allow a jury to find that Crandell's supervisory relationship continued into at least 2000. Further, plaintiffs submitted an affidavit by James F.T. Corcoran, M.D., in which he stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Assuming Crandell continued to supervise Rivest after December 3, 1998, my opinion is that Dr. Crandell breached his standard of care with regard to Freida Foster, not only because Rivest was not qualified to treat Foster, but also because he knew that the LPC board had ordered Rivest to cease and desist the practice of counseling. I am aware that Crandell was responsible for reviewing Rivest's counseling records based upon the information Crandell provided to the NCBLPC. If Crandell properly reviewed Rivest's counseling notes as he was required, he knew or should have known Rivest's clients, including Freida Foster. Therefore, he had a duty to advise her of Rivest's standing with the LPC board. If Crandell did not review Rivest's counseling records as was required by the NCBLPC, he breached the standard of care as it pertains to treatment and supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Corcoran added: \"It is my further opinion that the plaintiffs' emotional trauma was exacerbated by the treatment that they received from Michael Rivest as well as Dr. Crandell. Crandell placed Rivest in a position to harm others, and Rivest in fact, did harm the plaintiffs.\" This testimony explains how Crandell's conduct caused Foster's emotional distress and-together with plaintiffs' other summary judgment evidence-is sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether it was reasonably foreseeable that if Crandell negligently failed to supervise Rivest, severe emotional distress could result in Rivest's clients, including Foster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Regarding the third element, our courts have defined \"severe emotional distress\" to \"mean[] any emotional or mental disorder, such as, for example, neurosis, psychosis, chronic depression, phobia, or any other type of severe and disabling emotional or mental condition which may be generally recognized and diagnosed by professionals trained to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Ruark Obstetrics,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2497384\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/327/283/#p304\">\n    327 N.C. at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=395%20S.E.2d%2085\">\n    395 S.E.2d at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1D-15(a), punitive damages may be awarded only when a claimant proves that a defendant is liable for compensatory damages and that one of three \"aggravating factors\" - fraud, malice, or willful or wanton conduct - was both present and related to the injury for which compensatory damages were awarded. Our General Assembly has defined \"malice\" as \"a sense of personal ill will toward the claimant that activated or incited the defendant to perform the act or undertake the conduct that resulted in harm to the claimant.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1D-5(5) (2005). \"Willful or wanton conduct,\" in turn, \"means the conscious and intentional disregard of and indifference to the rights and safety of others, which the defendant knows or should know is reasonably likely to result in injury, damage, or other harm.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1D-5(7). More specifically, it \"means more than gross negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20S.E.2d%20360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The claimant must prove the existence of the aggravating factor by clear and convincing evidence. N.C.

Instead, \"[p]unitive damages may be awarded against a person only if that person participated in the conduct ... giving rise to the punitive damages....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20S.E.2d%20360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, Rivest's behavior - including any sexual misconduct - cannot serve as a basis for plaintiffs to obtain punitive damages from Crandell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Here, plaintiffs do not contend that either fraud or malice exists, but rather rely upon the \"willful or wanton conduct\" aggravating factor. In support of their claim for punitive damages, plaintiffs argue only that (1) \"since they alleged a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, those allegations are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   and (2) \"Crandell's conduct as it pertained to his reckless supervision of Rivest evidences a disregard and indifference to the rights and safety of others.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Since we have held that summary judgment was properly granted as to Foster's claims for IIED and negligent supervision, Foster has, on appeal, made no argument that would support her claim for punitive damages. We therefore hold the trial court properly entered summary judgment on Foster's claim for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   With respect to Borland's and Bowen's IIED claims, we note that plaintiffs rely only upon their \"allegations\" of IIED. In opposing a motion for summary judgment, however, the non-moving party \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" N.C.R. Civ. P. 56(e). Accordingly, the issue is whether plaintiffs were able to \"produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating that [they] will be able to make out at least a prima facie case at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Collingwood v.
