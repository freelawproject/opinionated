For the reasons below, we find defendant received a trial free of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 16 April 2005, at approximately 11:00 am, Mario Hernandez drove to a store in Winston-Salem, North Carolina to put air in his spare tire. As he bent over to inflate the tire, he put his wallet down on the ground beside him. Defendant approached Hernandez and said something Hernandez could not understand because he does not speak English. Defendant pushed Hernandez, grabbed Hernandez's wallet and ran. Hernandez chased defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   That same morning, Sergeant Michael Weaver of the Winston-Salem Police Department was parked across from the store in an unmarked vehicle and observed the incident. As defendant ran away from Hernandez, he ran right beside Sergeant Weaver's unmarked vehicle. Sergeant Weaver observed that defendant was carrying a wallet in his left hand and a knife in his right hand. Sergeant Weaver drove to a point where he anticipated he could intercept defendant, maneuvered in front of the chase and got out of his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At this point Hernandez had caught up with defendant and defendant was turned around facing Hernandez. Defendant was walking backward, away from Hernandez, but toward Sergeant Weaver, with the wallet in his left hand and a knife in his right hand. Defendant, unaware that Sergeant Weaver was behind him, told Hernandez to \"come and get it, I'll f___ you up.\" Sergeant Weaver, drew his sidearm and instructed defendant to stop and drop the knife. Defendant then began to put the knife in his back right pocket, but was instructed to stop. Defendant was taken into custody and Hernandez's wallet was returned to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On 27 June 2005, the Forsyth County Grand Jury indicted defendant for robbery with a dangerous weapon. This charge was tried before a jury at the 10 October 2005, Criminal Session of Forsyth County Superior Court, the Honorable William Z. Wood, Jr., Judge presiding. On 13 October 2005, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of robbery with a dangerous weapon. The trial court entered a judgment consistent with the jury verdict dated 13 October 2005, sentencing defendant to 103 to 133 months in prison. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant raises the issues of whether: (I) there is sufficient evidence to support defendant's armed robbery conviction; (II) the trial court erroneously denied defendant's special jury instruction request about mere possession of a dangerous weapon; (III) the trial court erroneously admitted the State's detailed cross-examination of defendant regarding prior charges and convictions; (IV) the trial court erroneously admitted non-corroborative inadmissible hearsay evidence; (V) the trial court erroneously admitted inadmissible hearsay evidence about the neighborhood; and (VI) the trial court erroneously coerced the verdict by instructing jurors they must reach a unanimous verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant first argues his conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon must be vacated because there is insufficient evidence he took property by use or threatened use of a dangerous weapon and he endangered or threatened the life of Hernandez with a dangerous weapon. Defendant moved to dismiss the charge on the ground of insufficient evidence at the close of the State's evidence and again at the close of all the evidence, both of which motions were denied by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[W]hen a defendant moves to dismiss a charge against him on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence, the trial court must determine `whether there is substantial\n   evidence of each essential element of the offense charged and of the defendant being the perpetrator of the offense.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

After Hernandez finished his testimony, Officer K.C.

Officer Bell testified that Hernandez told him \"he was kneeled over and had his wallet on the ground in front of him and that someone had come up ..., a black\n   male, had pushed him over, [took] his wallet, and ran away[.]\" Defendant argues Officer Bell's testimony is hearsay evidence not admissible to corroborate Hernandez's prior testimony as it actually contradicted Hernandez's trial testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Contrary to defendant's argument, the testimony of Officer Bell does not contradict the testimony of Hernandez.
