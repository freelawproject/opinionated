We dismiss plaintiff's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September 1999, Hurricane Floyd flooded portions of Eastern North Carolina. Following the hurricane, Pamlico County (\"the County\") instituted a flood acquisition program that allowed the County to purchase property located in the 100 year flood plain. The County purchased a house from Ray and Virginia Respers (the \"Respers\"), located in the flood plain at 439 Jones Road in Vandemere, North Carolina. The County paid approximately the appraised value of $45,000.00 for the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The flood acquisition program included a demolition and clearance project that required removal of improvements located in the flood plain. The County solicited bids for the removal and/or demolition of houses purchased, which were located in the flood plain. During the bidding process, defendant submitted a demolition bid in the amount of $60,797.00. The County awarded and executed a contract with defendant to demolish or remove a group of houses, including the Respers' former house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The contract allowed defendant an option to salvage the houses scheduled for demolition, if the houses were severed from their current lots and relocated to lots outside the flood plain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In August 2002, plaintiff purchased the Respers' house from defendant's agent John Harrelson (\"Harrelson\") for $500.00. Harrelson told plaintiff the house must be moved, but failed to disclose the County's contract requirement to relocate the house outside the flood plain. Plaintiff showed defendant a lot on Swan Point Road where she intended to relocate the house. Defendant recommended plaintiff contact defendant Rodney Turner (\"Turner\") to move the\n   house. Plaintiff paid Turner $4,300.00 to move her house from Jones Road to Swan Point Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about 20 September 2002, Pamlico County inspectors learned that plaintiff's and two other houses had been relocated from their original lots to other lots located inside the flood plain. The North Carolina Division of Emergency Management gave the County three possible ways to resolve this issue: (1) the houses could be removed to another location outside of the flood plain; (2) the houses could be demolished; or (3) the houses could be removed from the buyout program by reimbursement of the County for the full amount it had paid to the original owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The County informed defendant that the houses relocated to other lots in the flood plain violated the terms of the demolition and clearance contract, explained the three choices, and gave defendant a deadline of 10 December 2002 to \"complete corrective action.\" The County later threatened legal action against defendant if the provisions of the contract were not performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant met with plaintiff and informed her the Swan Point lot did not comply with the County's contract. Defendant told plaintiff they had located a lot outside the flood plain on Water Street in Bayboro, North Carolina and offered to relocate her house at its expense. Defendant told plaintiff the lot owner had offered to sell the lot for $12,000.00, and defendant agreed to pay for the first two months. Plaintiff told defendant she did not want to live on Water Street. She contacted a realtor and began to make arrangements to purchase a lot in the Town of Reelsboro and move the house there. On 5 December 2002, plaintiff provided defendant with written certification that the Reelsboro lot was outside the flood plain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On 6 December 2002, four days before the County's deadline, defendant hired Turner to move plaintiff's house from her Swan Point lot to the Water Street lot that defendant had rented at its own expense. Defendant acknowledged at trial that plaintiff never gave permission to move the house, but testified defendant was under pressure from the County to bring the contract into compliance by 10 December 2002. Plaintiff discovered her house had been moved on her drive to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On 9 December 2002, defendant sent a letter to the County which requested payment on its contract with the County and stated: \"Please consider this request and its urgency because [defendant] has incurred considerable expense in trying to resolve these issues.\" The County was not satisfied because \"the house was still in a potential movable position, still had steel underneath of it, ... and could still easily be moved back into the flood zone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On 13 January 2003, defendant's attorney sent a letter to plaintiff's attorney, which requested, \"that your client make satisfactory arrangements for governmental approval of the location of this house by securing approval at its current location, by moving it to an appropriate location, or otherwise, putting the controversy to rest before January 29, 2003.\" The letter also stated that \"[a]bsent governmental approval, [defendant] must have the house removed by February 6, 2003. The time period between January 29, 2003, and February 6, 2003 will be used to raze the house if your client fails to make arrangements as set forth above.\" Plaintiff or her counsel failed to respond. Defendant demolished the house where it sat on the Water Street lot on 4 February 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On 10 November 2003, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant and defendant Rodney Turner d/b/a Rodney S. Turner Housemovers, asserting claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conversion, and unfair and deceptive trade practices (\"UDTP\"). Defendant filed an answer on 20 January 2004. After Turner failed to file an answer and made no appearance, plaintiff obtained an entry of default on 2 March 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Both plaintiff and defendant unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment, and the case was set for trial in February 2005. Defendant moved to bifurcate the compensatory and punitive damages stages of the trial, pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1D-30. At the conclusion of plaintiff's evidence in the liability phase of the trial, defendant moved for a directed verdict on all issues. The trial court\n   denied defendant's motion, and the case proceeded with defendant's evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the close of all the evidence, the trial court denied defendant's renewed motion for a directed verdict. At that time, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her negligent misrepresentation claim, leaving her claims for fraud, conversion, and UDTP before the court. During the charge conference, however, the trial judge stated that he was revisiting his decision on defendant's motion for a directed verdict and granted that motion with respect to plaintiff's UDTP claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff's claims for fraud and conversion were submitted to the jury. The verdict sheet returned by the jury read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We, the jury, by unanimous verdict, find as to the Issues as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ISSUE ONE: Was the plaintiff damaged by the fraud of the Defendant? Answer: Yes\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ISSUE TWO: What amount of damages is the Plaintiff entitled to recover? Answer: $31,815\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ISSUE THREE: Did the Defendant convert the house relocated at Swan Point Road by the Plaintiff? Answer: Yes\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ISSUE FOUR: Did the Plaintiff abandon the home? Answer: No\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ISSUE FIVE: What amount is the Plaintiff entitled to recover for the damages for the conversion of the property of the Plaintiff? Answer: $30,000\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant moved: (1) for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\"JNOV\") as to both claims; (2) for \"judgment as a matter of law on the issue of punitive damages;\" or (3) in the alternative, for a new trial on all issues. The trial court orally granted defendant's motion for JNOV, dismissing the fraud claim, but denied defendant's motion regarding the conversion claim. The court also entered judgment for defendant dismissing plaintiff's claim for punitive damages and denied both defendant's and plaintiff's motions for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On 18 March 2005, plaintiff filed a motion pursuant to N.C.R. Civ. P. 52(a)(2) and requested the trial court make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to its rulings. The court denied plaintiff's motion and, instead, on 10 May 2005, entered a short judgment, specifying the jury's verdict, setting forth the court's rulings on the parties' various motions, and entered judgment in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $30,000.00. Plaintiff appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    II. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant has filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's appeal as interlocutory on the grounds the default judgment against Turner was not entered until after plaintiff had appealed to this Court. \"An interlocutory order is one made during the pendency of an action, which does not dispose of the case, but leaves it for further action by the trial court in order to settle and determine the entire controversy\"\n   <em>\n    Veazey v. Durham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8629835\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/231/357/#p362\">\n    231 N.C. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 362,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20S.E.2d%20377\">\n    57 S.E.2d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 381 (1950). Defendant is correct that, at the time of plaintiff's notice of appeal, her appeal was interlocutory. Plaintiff's notice of appeal was filed 1 June 2005, and the default judgment was not entered until 8 December 2005. Plaintiff's claims against Turner were still pending at the time of her appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although the appeal was interlocutory at the time it was filed, judgment has since been entered against Turner, leaving nothing to be resolved at the trial court. In such circumstances, we have ruled:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   the interests of justice would be furthered by hearing the appeal. All claims and judgments are final with respect to all the parties, and there is nothing left for the trial court to determine. Therefore, the rationale behind dismissing interlocutory appeals, the prevention of fragmentary and unnecessary appeals, does not apply in this case. In fact, any delay on our part would impede, rather than expedite, the efficient resolution of this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Tarrant v.

To dismiss Jones' appeal for failure to include language necessarily implicit in the assignment of error itself-or, in other words, for failing to state the obvious-is to elevate form over substance to an extent that our Supreme Court could not have intended in\n   <em>\n    Viar.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Indeed, the majority's approach cannot be reconciled with our Supreme Court's analysis of assignments of error with respect to orders granting summary judgment, in which the trial courts similarly weigh the sufficiency of the evidence to go to the jury. In\n   <em>\n    Ellis v. Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4741625\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/319/413/\">\n    319 N.C. 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=355%20S.E.2d%20479\">\n    355 S.E.2d 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals when it dismissed an appeal because the appellant had failed to list any exceptions or assignments of error to a summary judgment order at all. The Supreme Court held:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The purpose of summary judgment is to eliminate formal trial when the only questions involved are questions of law. Thus, although the enumeration of findings of fact and conclusions of law is technically unnecessary and generally inadvisable in summary judgment cases, summary judgment, by definition, is always based on two underlying questions of law: (1) whether\n   there is a genuine issue of material fact and (2) whether the moving party is entitled to judgment. On appeal, review of summary judgment is necessarily limited to whether the trial court's conclusions as to these questions of law were correct ones. It would appear, then, that notice of appeal adequately apprises the opposing party and the appellate court of the limited issues to be reviewed. Exceptions and assignments of error add nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   This result does not run afoul of the expressed purpose of Rule 10(a). Exceptions and assignments of error are required in most instances because they aid in sifting through the trial court record and fixing the potential scope of appellate review. We note that the appellate court must carefully examine the\n   <em>\n    entire record\n   </em>\n   in reviewing a grant of summary judgment. Because this is so, no preliminary \"sifting\" of the type contemplated by the rule need be performed. Also, as previously observed, the potential scope of review is already fixed; it is limited to the two questions of law automatically raised by summary judgment. Under these circumstances, exceptions and assignments of error serve no useful purpose. Were we to hold otherwise, plaintiffs would be required to submit assignments of error which merely restate the obvious; for example, \"The trial court erred in concluding that no genuine issue of material fact existed and that defendants were entitled to summary judgment in their favor.\" At best, this is a superfluous formality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 415-416,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=355%20S.E.2d%20479\">\n    355 S.E.2d at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).

With respect to the remaining assignments of error, I do not believe that those questions need to be resolved on appeal and, therefore, it is unnecessary to consider whether those assignments of error comply with the Appellate Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Substantial Compliance Precludes Dismissal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Even if Jones could be viewed as having violated the appellate rules, the violations would at best be merely technical ones that in no way affect the ability of the appellee or this Court from addressing the questions that she has raised on appeal. Only three years ago, this Court wrote: \"This Court has held that when a litigant exercises `substantial compliance' with the appellate rules,\n   <em>\n    the appeal may not be dismissed for a technical violation of the rules.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Spencer v. Spencer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9189508\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/156/1/#p8\">\n    156 N.C.App. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=575%20S.E.2d%20780\">\n    575 S.E.2d 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 785 (2003) (emphasis added). Today, in direct opposition to this proposition, certain panels of this Court hold that appeals must be dismissed even for technical violations of the rules. For the reasons stated in my dissent in\n   <em>\n    Stann v. Levine,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12636989\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/636/214/\">\n    636 S.E.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 222 (2006), I do not believe that this approach is mandated-or even intended-by\n   <em>\n    Viar.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   I am not unmindful of the fact that the current state of affairs is the result, to a large extent, of the somewhat casual attitude adopted by many in the North Carolina Bar towards North Carolina's appellate courts and the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Apparently, not all attorneys necessarily experience the same degree of urgency with respect to state court appeals. This perspective is troubling and cannot be ignored. Nevertheless, as I indicated in my dissent in\n   <em>\n    Stann,\n   </em>\n   I would address violations of the rules that do not impact this Court's ability to decide issues properly preserved for review by imposing sanctions on counsel under Rules 25 and 34 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. In addition to not punishing parties for the mistakes of their attorneys, this approach would also ensure that counsel for appellants and appellees alike are subjected to the same scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   I believe such an approach is mandated by Rules 25 and 34 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Rule 25(b) provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   A court of the appellate division may, on its own initiative or motion of a party, impose a sanction against a party or attorney or both when the court determines that such party or attorney or both\n   <em>\n    substantially failed to comply with these appellate rules.\n   </em>\n   The court may impose sanctions of the type and in the manner prescribed by Rule 34 for frivolous appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Dismissal of an appeal is the ultimate sanction and is authorized by Rule 34(b)(1) (\"A court of the appellate division may impose one or more of the following sanctions: (1) dismissal of the appeal....\"). Yet, Rule 34 expressly limits the instances in which sanctions may be imposed:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   (a) A court of the appellate division may, on its own initiative or motion of a party, impose a sanction against a party or attorney or both when the court determines that an appeal or any proceeding in an appeal was frivolous because of one or more of the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   (3) a petition, motion, brief, record, or other paper filed in the appeal was so grossly lacking in the requirements of propriety,\n   <em>\n    grossly violated appellate court rules,\n   </em>\n   or grossly disregarded the requirements of a fair presentation of the issues to the appellate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   N.C.R.App. P. 34(a)(3) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In short, the Appellate Rules themselves seem to limit this Court's ability to dismiss an appeal for rules violations to those when the party or attorney has \"substantially\n   failed to comply\" or when there has been a gross violation of the rules. I do not believe that we should disregard the plain language of the appellate rules. Under those rules, because Jones has not substantially failed to comply and there has been no gross violation of the rules, I do not believe dismissal is a permissible sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   I would also point out that although the majority opinion states that the Rules of Appellate Procedure are mandatory, it is silent with respect to violations by the appellee. Under Rule 28(c), an appellee is not required to include a statement of facts in its brief, but if it does so, it must be \"a non-argumentative summary of all material facts underlying the matter in controversy which are necessary to understand all questions presented for review, supported by references to pages in the transcript of proceedings, the record on appeal, or exhibits, as the case may be.\" N.C.R.App. P. 28(b)(5). H &amp; S' statement of facts is replete with argument-indeed, it is almost entirely argument.\n   <em>\n    See Stann,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12636989\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/636/214/\">\n    636 S.E.2d at 216-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing appeal in part because appellant included insufficient citations to the record in the statement of facts). Further, in the final section of H &amp; S' brief, H &amp; S urges this Court to grant it a new trial rather than simply reverse the trial court's rulings. H &amp; S, however, in violation of Rule 10, did not cross-assign error to the trial court's denial of its motion for a new trial, and, in violation of Rule 28(b)(6), did not cite any authority at all supporting the grant of a new trial to H &amp; S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In sum, I do not believe that Jones has substantially violated the Rules of Appellate Procedure. I would address the merits and, for the reasons, set out below, I would reverse the trial court as to the fraud and UDTP claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    The Merits of the Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Grant of JNOV on Fraud Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Jones' first argument is that the trial court erred in granting H &amp; S' motion for JNOV on the fraud claim.

There is no dispute that H &amp; S had knowledge of the requirement that the houses be relocated outside the flood plain. Further, Jones showed Harrelson, a principal of H &amp; S, where she planned to move the house, which would permit a jury to infer that H &amp; S knew she intended to move the house within the flood plain. Jones offered evidence that, despite this knowledge, Harrelson said nothing about the requirement that the house be moved outside of the flood plain, but rather helped her find a house-mover to move the house to the new location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Jones' evidence also indicated that once H &amp; S learned that the county was aware that the salvaged house had not been moved outside the flood plain, H &amp; S falsely told the county's agent that it had written contracts\n   requiring the new owners to comply with the flood plain requirement. H &amp; S then, according to Jones' evidence, created after-the-fact \"contracts\" designed to cover-up H &amp; S' failure to disclose the flood plain requirement and failure to have written contracts. Finally, there was evidence in the record that H &amp; S fabricated documents pertaining to other elements of its contract with the county and similarly misled two other purchasers of houses-evidence from which the jury could conclude that H &amp; S had an overall scheme of deceit with respect to the contract with the county in order to maximize its profit. A jury could infer an intent to deceive from this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Apart from challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to prove an intent to deceive, H &amp; S argues on appeal that the form signed by Jones, stating that it was her responsibility to move the house outside the flood plain, amended the parties' contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to H &amp; S, Jones was, therefore, limited to suing for breach of contract. H &amp; S, however, cites no authority supporting its assumption that a plaintiff cannot sue for fraud if she has a breach of contract claim. The law is, in fact, to the contrary: a plaintiff may assert both claims, although she may be required to elect between her remedies prior to obtaining a verdict.\n   <em>\n    See First Atl. Mgmt.

I would, therefore, remand for entry of judgment in favor of Jones on her UDTP claim and for trebling of her fraud damages. Upon remand, the trial court would also be required to consider whether to exercise its discretion to award attorney's fees under N.C.

Even if this is viewed as a technical violation of the appellate rules, it cannot be deemed a lack of substantial compliance or a gross violation as required by Rules 25 and 34 of the Appellate Rules. Because I disagree with the majority opinion as to whether Jones violated the Rules of Appellate Procedure, and I disagree with the\n   majority opinion's implicit conclusion that it has authority under those rules to dismiss an appeal that is in substantial compliance, this dissent represents a different scenario from that presented in\n   <em>\n    Steingress v.
