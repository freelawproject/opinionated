Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole on the conviction of first-degree murder and to a minimum term of 157 months and a maximum term of 198 months on the conviction of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, with the sentences to run consecutively. At trial, the State's evidence tended to show the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the afternoon of 1 January 2002, Andre Jackson (\"A.J.\") and his brother Malcom Jackson (\"Malcom\") were murdered beside a wooded dirt road near the Kelly Springfield plant in Cumberland County. Their friends Rodney Wilkerson (\"Rodney\") and Tracie New (\"Tracie\") witnessed the murders. The previous night, on New Year's Eve, A.J. and Defendant's uncle, Earl Shelly (\"Earl\"), had an altercation at Defendant's apartment. A.J. was removed from the apartment, but during the morning of 1 January 2002, returned with his brother Malcom and fought with Defendant and Defendant's cousin, Lamont Shelly (\"Lamont\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later that day, Defendant and Lamont drove to their grandmother's home to pick up Earl and then to Lamont's sister's home, where they picked up a 12-gauge shotgun. The three men returned to Defendant's apartment and located his .380 handgun. Later that same day, Rodney, Malcom, A.J., and Tracie were parked down a dirt road near the Kelly Springfield plant. Rodney, Malcom, and A.J. were in one car, while Tracie was alone in her own car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, Rodney testified that, while they were parked, he heard a car coming and saw Earl hanging out the window with a \"big gun.\" Malcom got out and stood behind the driver's side door, while Rodney ran around to the back of the car and put his hands into the air. After Rodney was secure behind the car, he ran away from the scene. As he was running, he heard a shot fired, glass shattering, and Malcom yelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Tracie testified she saw Malcom get out of the car and put his hands in the air before Earl shot him with the shotgun. The Shelly car then stopped, and Tracie saw Lamont get out of the car with a handgun and shoot Malcom in the head while Malcom was lying on the ground. She saw a third person in the Shelly vehicle, but could not identify that person. When Earl fired another shot through the windshield and hit A.J., Tracie drove away in her car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Rodney left the scene, he ran home and notified the police. Upon investigation, deputies found a car parked off a dirt road near the Kelly Springfield plant with the bodies of Malcom and A.J. lying near it on the ground. They found six 12-gauge shotgun shell casings and five .380 casings near the bodies. Dr. John D. Butts, Chief Medical Examiner for the State of North Carolina, determined that both A.J. and Malcom died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds. A Lorcin .380 Model L 380 handgun was recovered in the woods near the home of Defendant's cousin, Tommie Shelly. Also, a Mossberg Model 88 12-gauge shotgun was obtained from a source close to Defendant. A firearms expert examined the weapons and determined that the shell casings, buckshot and bird shot pellets, and bullets found at the scene and recovered from the bodies of the deceased, were fired from these weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After speaking with Rodney, Tracie, and other parties, Cumberland County Sheriff's investigators identified Earl Shelly, Lamont Shelly, and Defendant as suspects. At the time of Defendant's detainment, on 2 January 2002, a .380 round of ammunition was found in his pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant was interviewed by investigators at the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office, where, after executing a General Adult Rights Form, he confessed to shooting Malcom in the head with the handgun. On 23 July 2002, a grand jury indicted Defendant on two charges of first-degree murder and two charges of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, in the deaths of A.J. and Malcom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant's counsel filed a motion to suppress Defendant's confession and a supporting affidavit as required by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-977. After hearing arguments on the motion, the trial court orally entered the following findings of fact into the record: (1) the interrogation occurred while Defendant was in custody and lasted approximately one hour; (2) Defendant asked \"about whether an attorney can come . . . up here and see me?\"; (3) Defendant indicated, \"I am very ignorant of all this\"; (4) a conversation ensued about the availability of a public defender; and (5) Defendant never expressly stated that he wanted a lawyer present, did not understand his rights, or wanted to stop talking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On these findings, the trial court denied Defendant's motion to suppress his confession. The case was then tried in Cumberland County Superior Court between 29 September and 8 October 2004. At the end of the trial, the jury found Defendant not guilty of first-degree murder or conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the death of A.J. The same jury found Defendant guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the death of Malcom. From the judgments entered upon these convictions, Defendant appeals. We find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant first assigns error to the trial court's admission of his confession. Defendant argues that his confession should have been suppressed because he invoked his right to counsel and it was not honored by the police; the police advised Defendant of his right to counsel and then effectively blocked the assertion of this right; the confession was made under the hope of leniency created by the interrogating officer; and the trial court failed to make written findings of fact and conclusions of law after the suppression hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant contends that the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the voluntariness of the confession constitute reversible error because there were material conflicts in the evidence during the motion to suppress hearing. That is, Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the confession because there was competent evidence presented at the suppression hearing supporting his position that he invoked his right to counsel, the assertion of his right to counsel was blocked by the interrogating officer, and his confession was made under the hope of leniency. Findings of fact relating to the voluntariness of a confession are binding on our Court if supported by competent evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Until a suspect makes such an unambiguous request, the police may continue to question him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20S.E.2d%20892\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   During questioning, Defendant said to the investigator, Officer Disponzio, \"I don't know if I go ahead an tell you then when I do get my lawyer ... I've done wrong, because I went ahead and said anything or-I don't know.\" This statement is ambiguous because Defendant neither refused nor agreed to answer Officer Disponzio's questions without an attorney present. This ambiguous statement fails to meet the standard established by\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   as a guide for police investigation and interrogation. We hold that no reasonable officer under the circumstances would have understood Defendant's words as an \"actual request\" for an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Additionally, questions from Defendant such as, \"Oh, so I can have a lawyer come here now?\", and \"one won't be appointed to me now?\", when examined in the context in which they were made, also fail to meet the current standard for invoking one's right to counsel. That is, after a thorough review of the interview transcript, we note the informative nature of the conversation between Defendant and the officer in the beginning of the interview, and believe that Defendant asked these questions and received answers from Officer Disponzio in an effort to understand his rights and the interview process before choosing to invoke or forego his constitutional right to counsel. In no way did Officer Disponzio badger, intimidate, or threaten Defendant into waiving his rights, nor did he ignore an unambiguous invocation of Defendant's right to counsel. For example, when Defendant asked these questions, Officer Disponzio offered a clear\n   and truthful answer by telling Defendant that \"unless you have your own personal lawyer ... [o]ne will be appointed to you when you go to court.\" After obtaining an understanding of the process of having an attorney appointed, Defendant chose to sign the waiver form and proceed with the interview. Therefore, in asking these questions, we do not believe that Defendant unambiguously requested counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Furthermore, Defendant's questions are clearly distinguishable from the circumstances present in\n   <em>\n    Torres.\n   </em>\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Torres,\n   </em>\n   the defendant \"`asked [Sheriff] Nelson [Sheppard] did she need a lawyer and he told her no that it was best right now to cooperate and tell the truth and that they had been friends for a long time.'\"\n   <em>\n    Torres,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2509197\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/330/517/\">\n    330 N.C. at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=412%20S.E.2d%2020\">\n    412 S.E.2d at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, Defendant did not ask the investigating officer if he needed an attorney and was not told by the officer that he did not need one. Rather, Defendant asked general questions about his right to counsel and explained his discomfort with the situation in which he found himself. In return, the officer, after explaining to Defendant that \"I can't legally tell you to do something[,]\" informed him about the logistics of the process. Since Defendant did not clearly and unambiguously invoke his right to counsel, his statements to the officer were admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Next, Defendant argues Officer Disponzio \"blocked\" the exercise of his right to counsel by emphasizing the difficulties and time delay involved in obtaining a court-appointed attorney. In support of his contention, Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    State v. Steptoe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8570161\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/296/711/\">\n    296 N.C. 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=252%20S.E.2d%20707\">\n    252 S.E.2d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979). However, unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Steptoe,\n   </em>\n   Defendant had not invoked his right to counsel or requested a court-appointed attorney during interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant in this case never specifically requested that an attorney be present during interrogation and thus never invoked his right to counsel. Rather, Defendant made numerous ambiguous statements and asked numerous ambiguous questions. By way of explaining Defendant's options, Officer Disponzio responded, \"[T]his is totally your choice.... No one can make you do anything.\" Officer Disponzio went on to explain:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Tomorrow morning you'll have a first appearance in court. At that time the judge is gonna read you your rights ... you'll tell him I need a public defender and he'll assign you one and then from there it's up to your public defender to come and contact you. We don't contact you any more after today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant then asked Officer Disponzio, \"Would there be like-somebody to come up here and see me?\", to which Officer Disponzio replied, \"Today? Not today, no.\" While Officer Disponzio's responses to Defendant's questions were intended to eventually procure a voluntary statement from Defendant, at no point did Officer Disponzio \"block\" Defendant's right to remain silent or Defendant's ability to \"actually request\" an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Furthermore, Officer Disponzio did not suggest, as did the officer in\n   <em>\n    Steptoe,\n   </em>\n   that Defendant might not receive appointed counsel; instead, he merely informed Defendant that the appointment of counsel would not occur immediately. Thus, at no point was Defendant inhibited from unambiguously articulating his desire to have counsel present. On the contrary, as a result of Officer Disponzio's explanations, Defendant was fully informed of his rights and knowingly, understandingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel, as evidenced by his execution of a waiver form.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=252%20S.E.2d%20707\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=252%20S.E.2d%20707\">\n    at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=252%20S.E.2d%20707\">\n    252 S.E.2d at 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, this argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant further argues, however, that his statement was rendered involuntary by statements of the officer which created a hope of leniency. Specifically, Defendant contends that Officer Disponzio's comment, \"I can tell you that a person who cooperates and shows remorse and is honest and has no criminal background-when it goes to court, has the best chance of getting the most leniency because he cooperated[,]\" created a hope of leniency that induced Defendant to confess to the murder, where he would have otherwise made no statement. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   When evaluating the voluntariness of a confession, \"[t]he proper determination is whether the confession at issue was the product of `improperly induced hope or fear.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
