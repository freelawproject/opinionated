Acosta (\"plaintiff\") appeals from an order dismissing her complaint against David R. Faber, II, M.D. (\"Dr.Faber\") with prejudice. For the reasons stated herein, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The issue in this case is whether the trial court properly dismissed plaintiff's complaint as to Dr. Faber. Plaintiff argues that the complaint stated a valid claim against Dr.\n   Faber for negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 12 May 2005, plaintiff filed an action alleging invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Robin Byrum (\"Byrum\") and negligent infliction of emotional distress against Dr. Faber. Similar additional claims were made against two other defendants not associated with Psychiatric Associates of Eastern Carolina (\"Psychiatric Associates\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff was a patient of Psychiatric Associates, which is located in Ahoskie, North Carolina. She was also employed by Psychiatric Associates from September 2003 until early spring of 2004. Psychiatric Associates is owned by Dr. Faber, a citizen and resident of Alabama. Byrum was the office manager at Psychiatric Associates during the time period at issue. Plaintiff alleged that Byrum had severe personal animus towards plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleged that Dr. Faber improperly allowed Byrum to use his medical record access number. Numerous times between 31 December 2003 and 3 September 2004, Byrum used Dr. Faber's access code to retrieve plaintiff's confidential psychiatric and other medical and healthcare records. Byrum then provided information contained in those records to third parties without plaintiff's authorization or consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff alleged in her complaint that by providing Byrum with his access code, Dr. Faber violated the rules and regulations established by University Health Systems, Roanoke Chowan Hospital, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\"). Plaintiff alleged that she experienced severe emotional distress, humiliation, and anguish from the exposure of her medical records to third parties. Plaintiff alleged that Dr. Faber knew or should have known that his negligence would cause severe emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Responding to these claims, Dr. Faber filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(2) and (6). After a hearing, the trial court granted Dr. Faber's motion to dismiss. Plaintiff appeals from that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I. Interlocutory Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We must first decide whether this appeal is properly before the Court. When multiple parties are involved in a lawsuit, the trial court may make \"a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties[.]\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 54(b) (2005). Appeal of an order dismissing one of the parties to a suit is interlocutory.\n   <em>\n    Hoots v.

Interlocutory appeals are heard only in two circumstances: (1) when a judge certifies that there is no reason to delay the appeal; or (2) a substantial right of the appellant is affected.\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Davis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795905\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/360/518/#p524\">\n    360 N.C. 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 524-25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12636049\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/631/114/#p119\">\n    631 S.E.2d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119 (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here, plaintiff's appeal is interlocutory as only the complaint against Dr. Faber was dismissed and claims remain against the other three defendants. Since the trial court made no certification, the dismissal must affect a substantial right of plaintiff in order for this appeal to be heard. Avoiding two trials on the same factual issues affects a substantial right because separate trials might render \"inconsistent verdicts on the same factual issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Green v. Duke Power Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8572803\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/305/603/#p608\">\n    305 N.C. 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 608,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=290%20S.E.2d%20593\">\n    290 S.E.2d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 596 (1982). The claim against Dr. Faber is factually similar to the claims against the other three defendants. Thus, a dismissal of the claim against Dr. Faber raises the possibility of inconsistent verdicts in later proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See Clontz v. St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9186458\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/157/325/#p327\">\n    157 N.C.App. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327-28,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=578%20S.E.2d%20654\">\n    578 S.E.2d 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 657 (2003) (motion to dismiss two of the defendants subject to review because of \"the right to try the issues of liability as to all parties before the same jury as well as the right to avoid inconsistent verdicts in separate trials are implicated\"). Dr. Faber does not dispute that this matter affects a substantial right of the plaintiff. Accordingly, we review plaintiff's appeal under the substantial right exception to the general rule prohibiting interlocutory appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II. Sufficiency of the Complaint\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the complaint should not have been dismissed because it sufficiently stated a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress against Dr. Faber. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The appropriate standard of review for a motion to dismiss is \"`\"whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint . . . are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted[.]\"'\"\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 8(a)(1) (2005). The rule further states: \"Each averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 8(e)(1). Moreover, notice pleadings \"need not contain detailed factual allegations to raise issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Southern of Rocky Mount v.

The substantive elements of negligent infliction of emotional distress are: \"(1) the defendant negligently engaged in conduct, (2) it was reasonably foreseeable that such conduct would cause the plaintiff severe emotional distress . . ., and (3) the conduct did in fact cause the plaintiff severe emotional distress.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Therefore, in analyzing the sufficiency of the complaint, the dispositive question becomes whether plaintiff sufficiently stated a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress for which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When analyzing a 12(b)(6) motion, the court is to take all factual allegations as true, but should not presume legal conclusions to be true.\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

In the instant case, plaintiff alleges all the substantive elements of negligent infliction of emotional distress. Moreover, plaintiff alleges sufficient facts to support these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff first contends she sufficiently alleged defendant's negligence. Plaintiff alleged that defendant negligently engaged in conduct by permitting Byrum to use his access code in violation of the rules and regulations of the University Health Systems, Roanoke Chowan Hospital, and HIPAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff does not cite the exact rule or regulation of the University Health Systems, Roanoke Chowan Hospital, or HIPAA which allegedly establish Dr. Faber's duty to maintain privacy in her confidential medical\n   records. She merely alleges that these rules provide the standard of care. Plaintiff, however, is not required in her complaint to cite the exact rule or regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 8. She only must provide Dr. Faber notice of how she plans to establish the duty that was negligently breached. To require plaintiff to describe particular provisions of the rules and regulations would defeat the purpose of simple notice pleadings, i.e., to place the opposing party on notice of all claims and defenses. Further specificity is reserved for the discovery process.\n   <em>\n    See Sutton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8561932\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/277/94/#p103\">\n    277 N.C. at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=176%20S.E.2d%20161\">\n    176 S.E.2d at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (the complaint deemed sufficient since it put plaintiff on notice of the nature and basis of the negligence claim; \"`\"notice pleading\" is made possible by the liberal opportunity for discovery . . . to disclose more precisely the basis of both claim and defense and to define more narrowly the disputed facts and issues'\"). Here, defendant has been placed on notice that plaintiff will use the rules and regulations of the University Health Systems, Roanoke Chowan Hospital, and HIPAA to establish the standard of care. Therefore, plaintiff has sufficiently pled the standard of care in her complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff next contends she sufficiently alleged facts to state a claim that Dr. Faber's breach proximately caused severe emotional distress. Plaintiff's complaint alleges that Dr. Faber knew or should have known that providing the medical access code to Byrum would cause plaintiff's severe emotional distress.

Personal Jurisdiction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Dr. Faber was subject to the personal jurisdiction of North Carolina. Since personal jurisdiction was proper, plaintiff contends, the complaint should not have been dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dr. Faber's motion to dismiss also alleged that defendant was not subject to personal jurisdiction in North Carolina. Dr. Faber is a citizen and resident of Alabama. He, however, is the owner of Psychiatric Associates, a company doing business in North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For jurisdiction to be proper, North Carolina's long arm statute must authorize jurisdiction and the defendant must be afforded his constitutional right to due process.\n   <em>\n    Better Business Forms, Inc. v.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-75.4(4)(a) (2005). Dr. Faber was the owner of a medical practice whose activities were carried on within North Carolina. Thus, North Carolina's long arm statute applies to Dr. Faber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   North Carolina cannot assert personal jurisdiction over Dr. Faber unless he is afforded his due process rights. That is, Dr. Faber must have \"minimum contacts\" with North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    International Shoe Co. v.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    326 U.S. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    66 S.Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    90 L.Ed. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102 (1945).

As owner of a business in North Carolina, Dr. Faber purposefully availed himself within the state and invoked the protection of the laws. Thus, Dr. Faber had minimal contacts with the state. Accordingly, since the long arm statute reaches Dr. Faber and he had minimum contacts with the state, jurisdiction over Dr. Faber is proper in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   III. HIPAA violation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff contends that no claim for an alleged HIPAA violation was made and therefore dismissal on the grounds that HIPAA does not grant an individual a private cause of action was improper. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In her complaint, plaintiff states that when Dr. Faber provided his medical access code to Byrum, Dr. Faber violated the rules and regulations established by HIPAA. This allegation does not state a cause of action under HIPAA. Rather, plaintiff cites to HIPAA as evidence of the appropriate standard of care, a necessary element of negligence. Since plaintiff made no HIPAA claim, HIPAA is inapplicable beyond providing evidence of the duty of care owed by Dr. Faber with regards to the privacy of plaintiff's medical records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   IV. Rule 9(j)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that as the complaint does not allege medical malpractice, plaintiff was not required to comply with Rule 9(j) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Rule 9(j) requires plaintiffs alleging medical malpractice to obtain, prior to filing suit, certification from an expert willing to testify that the doctor did not comply with the applicable standard of care. N.C. Gen Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 9(j) (2005). A medical malpractice action is defined as \"a civil action for damages for personal injury or death arising out of the furnishing or failure to furnish professional services\n   <em>\n    in the performance of\n   </em>\n   medical, dental, or other health care by a health care provider.\" N.C.

Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint should not have been dismissed because plaintiff sufficiently stated a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress against Dr. Faber, personal jurisdiction over Dr. Faber was proper, no HIPAA violation was alleged in the complaint, and Rule 9(j) is inapplicable. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the trial court dismissing plaintiff's complaint against Dr. Faber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Judges HUDSON and CALABRIA concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
