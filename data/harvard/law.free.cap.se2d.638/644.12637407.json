The appeal was heard before this Court 12 September 2006, almost five months after the order ceased to be effective. For this reason, we find the issue is moot and accordingly dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts of the case were that at an 8 April 2005 hearing on this matter, Plaintiff\n   James Williams testified that on 15 February 2005 Defendant Christopher Vonderau and his wife, along with several people who lived in the neighborhood, came to the edge of Williams' property, while Vonderau repeatedly demanded Williams come out and face him. Vonderau stated, \"[c]ommit some more felonies, sell some more drugs, don't you have anything better to do.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the hearing, Williams and his wife recited, without objection, details of the 15 February incident, where Vonderau stood in front of Williams' house yelling insults, racial slurs and challenges to confrontation. Williams testified that Vonderau \"lived up the street\" and would \"come down and harass\" him and his family. Williams stated, \"We're slowly building the house and they don't want blacks in their neighborhoods and they keep coming down harassing us.\" Mrs. Williams also testified, regarding the conduct of Vonderau and his wife. She stated, \"it's just been horrible. They've been stalking and harassing our family for years. . . . We definitely need an order for them to stay away. I don't even know why they wouldn't want to stay away. Why would they want to keep coming around us.\" The Williamses also testified, at length, regarding other incidents of confrontation with Vonderau and his wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court heard testimony of a 2004 confrontation between Williams and the Vonderaus' children. Following a complaint from Mrs. Vonderau, Williams was charged with two counts of assault and communicating threats. Williams was not convicted of either charge. Further testimony indicated that Vonderau later prompted Building Code Enforcement officials to inspect the Williams' house to determine if the Williamses were occupying the house before a certificate of occupancy had been issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the hearing, the trial court issued a civil no-contact order in favor of Williams which ordered that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1. The defendant not visit, assault, molest, or otherwise interfere with plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2. The defendant cease stalking the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3. The defendant cease harassment of the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   4. The defendant not abuse or injure the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   5. The defendant not contact the plaintiff by telephone, written communication, or electronic means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   6. The defendant not enter or remain present at the plaintiff's residence, place of employment, or other places listed below at times when the plaintiff is present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On 18 April 2005, Vonderau filed a Rule 59 motion for a re-hearing. On 8 August 2005, the trial court heard arguments, denied the motion, and on 25 August 2005 entered its judgment. From the trial court's order denying a re-hearing, Vonderau appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, Vonderau raises several arguments regarding the validity of the underlying civil no-contact order; however, we must dismiss this matter as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"A case is considered moot when a determination is sought on a matter which, when rendered, cannot have any practical effect on the existing controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Lange v.

Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On 7 March 2005, James Williams (\"plaintiff\") filed a complaint against defendant for a civil no-contact order for stalking. Plaintiff alleged defendant came to his residence on 15 February 2005 and threatened him with bodily injury. Plaintiff sought a permanent no-contact order. Plaintiff asked the trial court to order defendant to: (1) stop stalking him; (2) cease harassing him; and (3) refrain from entering or remaining present at his residence, school, or place of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On 8 April 2005, a hearing was held at which both parties testified and presented evidence. During the hearing, the trial court expressly stated, \"the `or otherwise harassed' [portion of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50C-1(6) (2005)], the way it was written, doesn't require the more than one occasion that the stalking does require.\" The trial court issued a civil no-contact order in plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On 18 April 2005, defendant moved for a new trial pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 59. Defendant based his motion, in part, upon plaintiff presenting insufficient evidence to justify entry of the judgment and \"the judgment is contrary to the prevailing\n   law.\" On 8 August 2005, the trial court heard and denied defendant's motion in open court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant timely appealed the trial court's denial of his motion for a new trial and argues the trial court's interpretation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50C-1 was erroneous as a matter of law. I agree, vote to reverse, and respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    II. Mootness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The majority's opinion dismisses defendant's appeal as moot on the grounds: (1) the civil no-contact order became effective on 8 April 2005 and expired on 8 April 2006; (2) this case was not heard by this Court until 10 September 2006, five months after the civil no-contact order ceased to be effective; and (3) the record before us contains no information the order has been extended or that plaintiff has sought an extension. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This Court has not previously addressed when an appeal from a civil no-contact order for stalking issued pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 50C-1 is considered moot. We have addressed the issue of whether an appeal from an expired domestic violence protective order issued pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50B-1 is moot. This Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [W]e note that the domestic violence protective order in this case [has] expired[.] Generally, when an issue is no longer in controversy, the appeal is dismissed as moot. [A]n appeal should be dismissed as moot when . . . the underlying controversy . . . cease[s] to exist. [W]hen the relief sought has been granted or . . . the questions originally in controversy between the parties are no longer at issue, the case should be dismissed, for courts will not entertain or proceed with a cause merely to determine abstract propositions of law[.] However this Court has held that a defendant's appeal of an expired domestic violence protective order is not moot because of the stigma that is likely to attach to a person judicially determined to have committed [domestic] abuse and the continued legal significance of an appeal of an expired domestic violence protective order. Thus, we address the merits of . . . [the] appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Wornstaff v.

This same stigma is also likely to attach to a person who has been judicially found to have stalked or harassed another. Potential collateral and future consequences exist for a person who has been judicially determined to have stalked another. This Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [T]here are numerous non-legal collateral consequences to entry of a domestic violence protective order that render expired orders appealable. For example, a Maryland appellate court in addressing an appeal of an expired domestic violence protective order, noted that a person applying for a job, a professional license, a government position, admission to an academic institution, or the like, may be asked about whether he or she has been the subject of a[n] [order].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The same rationale applies to someone who has been judicially determined to have stalked or harassed by another person. A potential employer or institution may consider whether a protective order has been entered against an applicant\n   in evaluating an applicant's fitness and ability to work in harmony with others.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=549%20S.E.2d%20912\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The majority's opinion erroneously dismisses defendant's appeal as moot.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50C-1(6) defines stalking as:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Following on more than one occasion or otherwise harassing, as defined in G.S. 14-277.3(c),\n   </em>\n   another person without legal purpose with the intent to do any of the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   a. Place the person in reasonable fear either for the person's safety or the safety of the person's immediate family or close personal associates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   b. Cause that person to suffer substantial emotional distress by placing that person in fear of death, bodily injury, or continued harassment and that in fact causes that person substantial emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (Emphasis supplied). This Court has not previously interpreted N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50C-1(6), which became effective on 1 December 2004. However, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-277.3(c) is specifically referred to in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50C-1(6), which incorporates the definition of criminal stalking by reference. We have interpreted and applied N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-277.3(c) in previous cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-277.3 (2005) states \"a person commits the [criminal] offense of stalking if the person wilfully\n   <em>\n    on more than one occasion\n   </em>\n   follows or is in the presence of, or otherwise harasses another person.\" (Emphasis supplied). Prior precedent interpreting N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-277.3 holds that the \"on more than one occasion\" language applies to the \"otherwise harasses\" language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50C-1(6) applies to the stalking language of the statute and to the \"otherwise harassing as defined in G.S. \u00a7 14-277.3(c)\" portion of the statute.
