For the reasons stated below, we find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Wooten and a witness, Sherquanda Fields (Fields), both had a relationship with the victim, Jamal Pearsall (Pearsall). On 23 August 2003, Pearsall saw the two together while they were looking for defendant Wooten's brother in a car driven by defendant Wooten's aunt. Pearsall became upset and ordered Fields to get out of the car. An argument ensued and defendant Wooten broke the window out of Pearsall's car with her hand. She then rode off, with Fields still in the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later that night, defendant Wooten, Pearsall, and others met to discuss payment for the car window. Defendant Wooten's boyfriend, \"Don Don,\" arrived, and attacked Pearsall. Following the confrontation, Pearsall departed with Fields, and the two spent the night at Fields's house. Pearsall set out the next morning for his mother's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Witness Nora Robinson (Robinson) testified that on 24 August 2003 she saw a man with a gun behind a tree. She went inside, and then heard gunshots. She looked outside, where she saw defendant Sloan walking away from Pearsall's car, trying to cock a jammed gun and muttering. Specifically, defendant Sloan said, \"I'm going to kill this mother f____.\" Robinson watched as defendant Sloan got into a white car. She then heard Leanne Sutton (Sutton) yell from the car, \"You should have shot the mother f____ in the head.\" Defendant Sloan denied that he had hidden behind the tree or fired the gun. He claimed that a housemate of his, Antonio Woods (Woods), shot the gun. He also testified that he never said, \"I'm going to kill this mother f____,\" and that no one ever said he should have shot Pearsall in the head. After defendant Sloan got into the white car, defendant Wooten, who was driving, followed Pearsall's car as it drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The evidence showed that there was a high-speed chase, during which the car Wooten was driving ran a stop sign, and Pearsall's car hit a parked car. Further testimony indicated that the white car driven by Wooten pulled even with Pearsall's car, and an unidentified black arm stuck out of the white car's window and shot into Pearsall's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the incident, defendant Sloan came forward voluntarily, accompanied by his mother and father, to discuss the matter with the authorities. SBI Agent Barbara Lewis (Agent Lewis) interviewed him, and testified from her notes. She stated that defendant Sloan said he had argued with Pearsall over some speakers that he believed Pearsall to have stolen. He told Agent Lewis that he had shot at Pearsall as he drove past Pearsall in a car driven by defendant Wooten. Agent Lewis further testified that\n   defendant Sloan informed her that he did not intend to kill Pearsall, and that no one else in the car was aware that he had a gun prior to the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Wooten also talked to Agent Lewis. Agent Lewis stated that defendant Wooten told her that when defendant Sloan pulled out the gun and fired twice, she screamed at him, \"Why did you do that, why did you do that?\" Defendant Wooten told Agent Lewis that defendant Sloan responded, \"[J]ust drive, don't worry about it, just drive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, both defendants were convicted of first degree Murder. Each now raises several assignments of error. For the purposes of this opinion, we will deal with the defendants separately. Defendant Sloan claims (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because there was insufficient evidence to uphold his conviction, (2) the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay statement of Leanne Sutton, (3) the trial court lacked jurisdiction as a result of a faulty indictment, and (4) the trial court erred in admitting photographs of Pearsall. We address these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Defendant Sloan's Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant Sloan first argues that the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient to persuade a rational trier of fact of each essential element beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically, defendant Sloan contends that the evidence showed only that he recklessly discharged the weapon, not that he intentionally shot into Pearsall's vehicle. This argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant Sloan attempts in his brief to cast his argument in a constitutional light. No such argument was presented at trial, however, and defendant Sloan makes no mention of a constitutional claim in his assignment of error. \"Constitutional issues not raised and passed upon at trial will not be considered for the first time on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In his argument against the satisfaction of the other two elements, defendant Sloan relies primarily on his own evidence as to his acts and intentions.

The State maintains that this illustrated that Pearsall's blood loss continued in the time period between Hall's arrival and when the photographs were taken. It appears from defendant Sloan's brief that he objects to the use of both photographs because he believes that the one, less gory, photograph would have sufficed. Yet as defendant Sloan himself acknowledges in his brief, \"Photographs of a homicide victim may be introduced even if they are gory, gruesome, horrible or revolting, so long as they are used for illustrative purposes and so long as their excessive or repetitious use is not aimed solely at arousing the passions of the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Having conducted a thorough review of the case, we find no error in defendant Sloan's conviction for first degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Defendant Wooten's Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We turn now to defendant Wooten. She contends that the trial court erred by denying her motion to dismiss based on insufficient evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In ruling on the motion to dismiss, the trial court must view all of the evidence, whether competent or incompetent, in the light most favorable to the State, giving the State the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving any contradictions in its favor. The trial court need not concern itself with the weight of the evidence. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, the question for the trial court is whether there is \"any evidence tending to prove guilt or which reasonably leads to this conclusion as a fairly logical and legitimate deduction.\" Once the court decides a reasonable inference of defendant's guilt may be drawn from the evidence, \"it is for the jurors to decide whether the facts satisfy them beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is actually guilty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the evidence presented by the State against defendant Wooten was circumstantial, it was nonetheless substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Shortly before the shooting of Jamal Pearsall, defendant Wooten had been involved in two violent confrontations with Pearsall. One resulted in defendant Wooten breaking one of Pearsall's car windows, while another resulted in a physical altercation between Pearsall and defendant Wooten's boyfriend, Don Don.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Specifically, defendant Wooten's behavior immediately prior to Pearsall's killing established evidence of her acting in concert to join defendant Sloan in forcibly confronting Pearsall. Defendant Wooten encouraged defendant Sloan to approach Pearsall by notifying him that Pearsall may have taken defendant Sloan's car stereo. Defendant Wooten then provided defendant Sloan with transportation, and was driving the white car when the decision was made to pursue Pearsall rather than to report him to police. After the initial incident on Maple Street, defendant Wooten was aware that defendant Sloan had a gun. Defendant Wooten drove defendant Sloan and others around in the car after defendant Sloan had shot at Pearsall. Also, given defendant Wooten's proximity to where statements were made regarding the gun, it is likely she heard defendant Sloan (\"I'm going to kill this mother f____\") and Leanne Sutton (\"You should have shot the mother f____ in the head\") indicating an intent to kill Pearsall. Moreover, rather than leaving the area to remove herself from further criminal activity, defendant Wooten engaged in a high-speed chase with the car driven by Pearsall, then pulled alongside Pearsall's car after it crashed into another car, and gave defendant Sloan a perfect opportunity to fire the fatal shot. Immediately after Pearsall was shot, defendant Wooten drove away without calling for medical help or calling the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   When taken in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence against defendant Wooten, acting in concert to assault Pearsall, which actions led to Pearsall's death was substantial. This evidence was sufficient to logically and legitimately conclude defendant Wooten's guilt could be determined by the jury. As such, \"it is for the jurors to decide whether the facts satisfy them beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is actually guilty\" of the ultimate crime of first degree murder. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant Wooten's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   No error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Judge McGEE concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Judge ELMORE concurs in part and dissents in part in a separate opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n  <author id=\"p-46\">\n   ELMORE, Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   I concur in the majority opinion that there was no error in defendant Sloan's conviction for first-degree murder. However, I respectfully dissent from that part of the majority opinion holding that the State produced sufficient evidence to survive defendant Wooten's motion to dismiss.

All contradictions in the evidence are to be resolved in the State's favor. All reasonable inferences based upon the evidence are to be indulged in. While the State may base its case on circumstantial evidence requiring the jury to infer elements of the crime,\n   that evidence must be real and substantial and not merely speculative. Substantial evidence is evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find the fact to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

I would find that the State failed to carry its burden under either doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To prevail under its acting in concert theory, the State must show that defendant Wooten was present, that she had joined in purpose with defendant Sloan to commit a crime, and that the crime for which she was being tried, first-degree murder, was either \"in pursuance of [that] common purpose . . . or [was] a natural or probable consequence thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"53983\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/345/184/#p233\">\n    345 N.C. at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=481%20S.E.2d%2044\">\n    481 S.E.2d at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though the State attempts to show that defendant Wooten had a motive to murder Pearsall, the mere presence of motive does not necessitate sending the case to the jury. Likewise, while the State hopes to prove that defendant Wooten told defendant Sloan that Pearsall had stolen his stereo in order to provoke a confrontation between the two, it offers no evidence that this was, in fact, her plan. Finally, the State points out that after being near enough to see and hear the gun being shot and Sutton shouting that defendant Sloan \"should have shot the mother f____ in the head,\" defendant Wooten nevertheless drove after Pearsall with defendant Sloan in the car. Yet despite the majority's position that this evidence is sufficient, there remains no evidence of a common purpose. As stated above, the use of circumstantial evidence is permissible. Nevertheless, \"that evidence must be real and substantial and not merely speculative. Substantial evidence is evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find the fact to be proved\n   <em>\n    beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Berry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11434065\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/143/187/#p207\">\n    143 N.C.App. at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20S.E.2d%20145\">\n    546 S.E.2d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In this case, the \"common purpose\" of defendant Wooten and defendant Sloan could easily have been to recover stolen property. Such a purpose would not have been illegal and would not have led, as a \"natural or probable consequence,\" to murder. There is simply no substantial evidence that the two had joined together for the\n   <em>\n    purpose\n   </em>\n   of committing a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Though the majority does not focus on it, the State's aiding and abetting theory also must fail. It is certain that \"the crime was committed by another\", namely defendant Sloan.\n   <em>\n    Bond,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"54098\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/345/1/#p24\">\n    345 N.C. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20S.E.2d%20163\">\n    478 S.E.2d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
