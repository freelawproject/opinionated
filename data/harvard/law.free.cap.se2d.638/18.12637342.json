Because we find that the State's evidence as to Defendant's guilt was substantial enough that the testimony in question was not determinative of the jury's decision, we affirm Defendant's conviction for second-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 7 June 2005, Defendant Melvin Curtis Faulkner was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of 22-month-old Jakob Waddington, the son of Defendant's girlfriend, Janet Perkins. At trial, the evidence tended to show that Defendant and Ms. Perkins met through an America Online chat room several months before she moved to Fayetteville in March 2001 with her two children,\n   Jakob and his six-year-old sister. Ms. Perkins moved into Defendant's house within three or four weeks of her arrival in Fayetteville.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Trial testimony indicated that Defendant's relationship with Ms. Perkins was tumultuous; for example, shortly after Ms. Perkins moved into Defendant's house, Defendant asked her to move out so he could work things out with the mother of his child, who was pregnant again, possibly with his child. But a week later Defendant changed his mind, and Ms. Perkins moved back into his house. Ms. Perkins testified that, at the beginning of the relationship, Defendant \"was wonderful with Jakob,\" and that he played with the boy and had a lot of interaction with him, although he was not involved in parenting responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By the end of April 2001, however, Defendant and Ms. Perkins began to have arguments related to Jakob, including Defendant's suggestion that the boy should go to live with his father in Texas. Also around this time, Jakob began having tantrums in which he would bang his head on the floor. Jakob's doctor testified that such head banging is not unusual in children, but they are not injured by it, and it cannot produce fatal brain injury. Jakob was slightly developmentally delayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Throughout June and July 2001, the couple's relationship continued to deteriorate. In June, Ms. Perkins took an overdose of sleeping pills and had her stomach pumped at the hospital, but she denied that it was a suicide attempt. Around the beginning of July, Ms. Perkins threatened to leave Defendant because of his \"picking on\" Jakob; she packed belongings and left the house with Jakob, but the two returned a short time later, after Defendant and Ms. Perkins had spoken on the telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to testimony at Defendant's trial, Ms. Perkins put Jakob down for his nap between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m. on 18 August 2001, and she then went to the store a short time later, taking Defendant's car because of heavy rains and flooding. Ms. Perkins stated that Jakob was \"fine\" at that time. While she was out, she called Defendant, who mentioned during the course of their conversation that he had found Jakob on the floor and put him back in the bed. Defendant called her back a few minutes later, while she was on her way home, and was upset because Ms. Perkins had taken his car to the store, rather than her own. All told, Ms. Perkins estimated her trip to the store took approximately twenty to thirty minutes; no one else was in the house during that time other than Defendant and Jakob. She did not check on Jakob after she arrived back at the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Around 5:00 p.m., Ms. Perkins went into Jakob's room to wake him from his nap and found him on the floor on his stomach. When she picked him up, his eyes rolled into the back of his head, and his arms and legs went stiff. Ms. Perkins called 911, and an ambulance arrived approximately fifteen minutes later and transported Jakob to the hospital. He was transferred to Chapel Hill, but he died later that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At Defendant's trial, medical personnel testified that Jakob's pupils were unequal and slow to react to light, evidence of a serious head injury, and that there was a raised and visibly noticeable hematoma on the left side of Jakob's head. His stiff arms and legs, called \"posturing,\" indicated brain swelling from a head injury. One emergency responder testified that, in response to the question of what had happened to Jakob, Defendant appeared nervous, with the color drained from his face, and did not respond; Ms. Perkins answered that she believed Jakob had fallen out of his bed. Jakob's bed was eight inches to a foot off the floor, and testimony at trial suggested that a fall from such a height was inconsistent with and could not have caused the type of head injury suffered by Jakob.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Additional testimony was offered at trial as to Defendant's and Ms. Perkins' demeanor at the hospital and the types of treatment offered to Jakob. Five medical experts testified for the State that the cause of Jakob's death was brain swelling caused by blunt force trauma to the head. According to one expert, Jakob would have been immediately symptomatic from the injuries and would have been rendered completely unresponsive, unable to eat, walk, or communicate. None\n   of the State experts believed the injuries could have been accidental, barring an incident such as a fall from a third-story window. However, Defendant offered testimony from three expert witnesses who theorized that Jakob might have died from a stroke or series of strokes, a blockage of veins in the brain, or dissection or clotting of the carotid artery, although such cases would not have accounted for his external bruises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict finding Defendant guilty of second-degree murder. The trial court sentenced Defendant to a term of 125 to 159 months' imprisonment. Defendant now appeals that verdict, arguing that the trial court (I) erred by allowing impermissible character evidence; (II) erred by allowing impermissible profile evidence as to \"normal caretaker reaction,\" which was irrelevant and prejudicial; (III) committed plain error by allowing irrelevant and highly prejudicial evidence as to one side of a telephone conversation between Defendant and his father and as to Ms. Perkins' suspicions about Defendant's role in Jakob's death; (IV) committed plain error by admitting testimony about comments made by Jakob's grandmother about Defendant at Jakob's funeral; (V) erred by allowing lay witnesses to offer expert opinions; and (VI) committed plain error by allowing testimony as to Ms. Perkins' attitude towards Defendant after both were arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, Defendant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress testimony from Ms. Perkins' mother, Peggy Acker, regarding the June 2001 incident in which Ms. Perkins took an overdose of sleeping pills. Defendant contends that the testimony was offered solely as evidence of his character and therefore should have been disallowed under North Carolina Rule of Evidence 404.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 404 (2005) (character evidence not generally admissible to prove conduct).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The standard of review in determining whether a trial court properly denied a motion to suppress evidence is whether the findings of fact are supported by competent evidence, and whether the conclusions of law are in turn supported by those findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Given the\n   defense's attempts to suggest that Ms. Perkins may have been the perpetrator or that Jakob died from an accidental fall, evidence concerning the relationship between Defendant and Ms. Perkins was probative for a purpose other than his bad character.

Among other things, Dr. Cooper outlined three parameters used by medical personnel to determine whether a child's injuries are accidental or inflicted, namely-the consistency of the history given by the caretaker, the extent to which the caretaker's explanation is consistent with the extent of the injuries, and the behavior of the caretaker. The objected-to exchange was transcribed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Q: . . . What is the normal caretaker reaction after an injury to a child or does it vary, that type of thing?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A: Very often, when a child has been accidentally injured, and it's obvious that they're injured, for example unconscious, unable to respond to them or having seizures, if it's an immediate onset of the accident and then you see these kinds of findings, caregivers who are present and witness an accident, right away try to seek help for the child. On the other hand, the forensic pediatric literature is very clear that when children are injured intentionally, when there is an inflicted injury, it is very common, it's almost the rule more so than the exception, that the individual who has injured the child will leave them and not seek care for them. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A: Oftentimes the caregiver is not concerned about what has happened to the child. They're much more concerned about how it impacts upon them, but not so much about what has happened to the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The trial court overruled defense counsel's objections to the questions and allowed answers as to a caretaker profile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"The law wisely permits evidence not otherwise admissible to be offered to explain or rebut evidence elicited by the defendant himself.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, we find the trial court's decision to allow this testimony was reasonable and was therefore not an abuse of its discretion. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, Defendant argues the trial court committed prejudicial error and plain error by allowing testimony as to Ms. Perkins' suspicions of Defendant regarding Jakob's death, her mother's disapproval of Ms. Perkins' relationship with Defendant, and the substance of one side of a phone conversation Defendant had with his father at the hospital while Jakob was being treated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Regarding Defendant's assertion as to prejudicial error, we note that under the rules of this Court,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In order to preserve a question for appellate review, a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request, objection or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling the party desired the court to make if the specific grounds were not apparent from the context. It is also necessary for the complaining party to obtain a ruling upon the party's request, objection or motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   N.C. R.App. P. 10(b)(1). Here, Defendant made no objection at trial to any of the testimony challenged in this assignment of error; indeed, on several occasions, the objected-to statements were made under cross-examination by defense counsel. We therefore dismiss the portion of Defendant's assignment of error that asserts the trial court committed prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Nevertheless, our appellate rules state that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In criminal cases, a question which was not preserved by objection noted at trial and which is not deemed preserved by rule or law without any such action, nevertheless may be made the basis of an assignment of error where the judicial action questioned is specifically and distinctly contended to amount to plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   N.C. R.App. P. 10(c)(4). Thus, a defendant may challenge a trial court's admission of evidence under a plain error standard even if no objection was made at trial.

Other evidence showed that Defendant was alone at home with Jakob at the time the child's injuries were sustained, and that his behavior with emergency personnel and at the hospital was somewhat unusual. In light of the strength of the State's case against Defendant, the challenged statements, particularly about Ms. Perkins' suspicions in the months after Jakob's death and her mother's dislike of Defendant, were unlikely to have been determinative factors in the jury's verdict. Moreover, the testimony about the phone conversation included Defendant's denial to his father of any involvement in or responsibility for Jakob's injuries-information which could be considered exculpatory rather than harmful.

However, as noted by Defendant himself, all of the testimony being challenged was also properly admitted through other expert witnesses; each of the doctors who testified for the State explained the nature of Jakob's injuries and their belief that they could not have been caused by falling off of his bed.

Why did you do this to my family?\" In light of the other substantial evidence offered by the State, the admission of this testimony by Ms. Perkins did not rise to the level of plain error, such that it \"tilted the scales\" and convinced the jury to convict Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See Cummings,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"685069\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/352/600/#p636\">\n    352 N.C. at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20S.E.2d%2036\">\n    536 S.E.2d at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, in light of the defense theories at trial that either Ms. Perkins inflicted Jakob's injuries, or they were accidental, this evidence was probative to refute those suggestions. Given that \"[e]vidence which is probative of the State's case necessarily will have a prejudicial effect upon the defendant; the question is one of degree,\"\n   <em>\n    Coffey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5306215\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/326/268/#p278\">\n    326 N.C. at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20S.E.2d%2048\">\n    389 S.E.2d at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the obviously heightened emotional state of Ms. Perkins when she had the outburst, the degree of prejudice here was not sufficient to substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence in question.

However, Defendant's brief to this Court cites to Rule 404(b) as the basis for disallowing the evidence. Because the assignment of error references only Rule 404, without specifying which section, we address the merits of Defendant's argument and do not find that he has attempted to \"swap horses\" on appeal.\n    <em>\n     See Weil v.

Nevertheless, under either standard, we find no error in the trial court's admission of this testimony.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
