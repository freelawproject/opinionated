We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jimmy and Carol Bunce (\"the Bunces\") own approximately 250 acres of real property located in Hoke County. The Bunces leased twenty-three acres of their property to Cumulus. Cumulus leased the property with the intent to construct a 499-foot radio tower on the leasehold. Cumulus applied to Hoke County's Planning Department for a conditional use permit to construct a radio tower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bunce's property is zoned RA-20 Residential-Agricultural District. The Hoke County Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 8.6(C) RA-20 Residential-Agricultural District includes as a conditional use: \"Communications; Broadcasting, and Receiving Towers; Radio, Television, and Radar; with setbacks from all property lines of at least one (1) foot for every foot of structure height.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 9 June 2005, the Planning Board heard Cumulus's application and voted to deny the permit. On 5 July 2005, the Commission held a public hearing and voted three-to-two to deny Cumulus's application for a conditional use permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cumulus timely filed a \"Petition for Certiorari\" with the superior court asserting the Commission: (1) arbitrarily and capriciously denied the permit; (2) improperly determined that the permit should not be granted; (3) improperly determined that it was within its legal authority to deny the permit for a variance; (4) failed to follow the proper procedure in making findings; (5) acted without sufficient evidentiary basis; and (6) applied rules that violated due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a hearing on 3 October 2005, the superior court reversed the Commission's decision. The superior court remanded the matter to the Commission for approval of the application and issuance of a conditional use permit. The Commission appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Commission argues the trial court: (1) applied an improper standard of review to the Commission's decision; (2) erred in finding insufficient evidence in the record to support the Commission's decision; (3) erred in reaching conclusion of law numbered 1; (4) erred in reaching conclusion of law numbered 2; and (5) erred by remanding this matter to the Commission with a mandate to approve and issue a conditional use permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    III. Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In reviewing a commission's decision to deny an application for a conditional use permit, a superior court must: (1) review the record for errors in law; (2) insure that procedures specified by law in both statute\n   and ordinance are followed; (3) insure that the appropriate due process rights of the petitioner are protected, including the right to offer evidence, cross-examine witnesses and inspect documents; (4) insure decisions of boards of adjustment are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence in the whole record; and (5) insure decisions are not arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    Humane Soc'y of Moore Cty., Inc. v.

In sum, Mr. Lynch concluded that the proposed subdivision would significantly increase vehicular activity in the area by approximately 300 to 800 trips a day. Ms. Gay also testified during the public hearing. During her testimony, Ms. Gay testified that approximately 100 children lived in Westwood, that existing traffic has caused near accidents involving children while they were walking and riding their bicycles, and increased traffic would endanger the health and safety of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We note that Ms. Gay based her testimony about the adverse effects of the proposed subdivision on traffic congestion and safety upon her personal knowledge and observations.

The Commission argues the trial court employed the wrong factual analysis in reaching subpart b and c of conclusion of law numbered 1. The Commission also argues the trial court erred by employing a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   approach in reaching conclusion of law numbered 2 that Cumulus \"has satisfied its burden and has made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that it is entitled to a conditional use permit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This argument is a reiteration of the Commission's argument above that the trial court applied an improper standard of review to the Commission's decision.
