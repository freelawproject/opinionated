BRADFORD CORNELL</p>\n<author id=\"b1172-7\">ANTHONY J. BATTAGLI, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1172-8\">Plaintiffs filed a motion, Doc. No. 398, to exclude the testimony of Defendants\u2019 loss causation expert Dr. Bradford Cornell. The Defendants filed an opposition, Doc. No. 399, and the Plaintiffs\u2019 filed a reply, Doc. No. 405. A hearing on the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion was held on the record on November 18, 2011, and the motion was taken under submission. Based upon the parties moving papers and arguments made during the hearing, the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to exclude the testimony of Defendants\u2019 loss causation expert Dr. Bradford Cornell is hereby GRANTED for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-9\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">Plaintiffs allege that between February 27, 2007 and November 10, 2008 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), Defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate Novatel\u2019s stock value so that Defendants could sell their stock in the company for a profit. Doc. No. 23, Consolidated Class Action Complaint, (\u201cCC\u201d), at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 12. Plaintiffs allege that throughout the Class Period, Defendants Weinert and Leparulo misrepresented the financial condition of the Company, because they told investors that the Company was seeing strong demand for its products, and did not disclose to investors that Novatel did not have an adequate \u201cproduct mix\u201d to meet the needs of its customers. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 57(a)(iii), 62(a)(ii), 66(a)(ii), 73(a)(ii). Plaintiffs also allege that Novatel covered up the slowdown in its business by shipping product \u201cearly,\u201d which purportedly violated accounting rules governing revenue recognition. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6. Plaintiffs claim that four specific stock price declines \u2014 on July 20, 2007; February 21, 2008; April 15, 2008; and August 20, 2008 \u2014 purportedly resulted from the market learning of these allegedly concealed facts. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 125-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">\n<em>Legal Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-13\">Federal Rule of Evidence 702 provides that expert testimony is admissible if \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 702. Expert testimony under Rule 702 must be both relevant and reliable. <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). When considering evidence proffered under Rule 702, the trial court must act as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d by making a preliminary determination that the expert\u2019s proposed testimony is reliable. <em>Elsayed Mukhtar v. Cal. State Univ., Hayward, </em>299 F.3d 1053, 1063 (9th Cir.2002), amended by 319 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-14\">As a guide for assessing the scientific validity of expert testimony, the Supreme Court provided a non-exhaustive list of factors that courts may consider: (1) whether the theory or technique is generally accepted within a relevant scientific community, (2) whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication, (3) the known or potential rate of error, and (4) whether the theory or technique can be tested. <em>Daubert, </em>509 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>U.S. at 593-94, 113 S.Ct. 2786; <em>see also Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). The Ninth Circuit also has indicated that independent research, rather than research conducted for the purposes of litigation, carries with it the indicia of reliability. <em>See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>43 F.3d 1311, 1317 (9th Cir.1995) <em>(\u201cDaubert II\u201d). </em>In particular, using independent, pre-existing research \u201cprovides objective proof that the research comports with the dictates of good science\u201d and is less likely \u201cto have been biased by the promise of remuneration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the testimony is not based on \u201cpre-litigation\u201d research <em>or </em>if the expert\u2019s research has not been subjected to peer review, then the expert must explain precisely how he went about reaching his conclusions and point to some objective source, a learned treatise, the policy statement of a professional association, a published article in a reputable scientific journal or the like, to show that he has followed the scientific method, as it is practiced by (at least) a recognized minority of scientists in his field. Id. at 1318-19 (citing <em>United States v. Rincon, </em>28 F.3d 921, 924 (9th Cir.1994)); <em>see also Lust v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>89 F.3d 594, 597 (9th Cir.1996). The proponent of the evidence must prove its admissibility by a preponderance of proof. <em>See Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 593 n. 10, 113 S.Ct. 2786.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">In the instant motion, Doc. No. 398, Plaintiffs\u2019 are seeking to exclude the testimony of Defendants\u2019 loss causation expert, Dr. Bradford Cornell, as inadmissible under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). Plaintiffs are seeking to exclude Dr. Cornell\u2019s opinion that there was no loss causation or \u201ccorrective disclosure\u201d on July 20, 2007, February 20-21, 2008, April 14-15, 2008, and August 19-20, 2008. The Plaintiffs\u2019 argue that Dr. Cornell\u2019s testimony that Plaintiffs cannot show loss causation should be excluded because he employed the wrong legal standard in undertaking his loss causation analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-11\">In order to prove loss causation, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that (1) Nova-tel\u2019s stock price dropped in reaction to the disclosure of information about Novatel, and (2) this reaction resulted from learning the truth about facts previously misrepresented by Defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Ninth Circuit has clearly held that \u201cthe market need not know at the time that the practices in question constitute a \u201cfraud,\u201d nor label them \u201cfraudulent\u201d, but in order to establish loss causation, the market must learn of and react to those particular practices themselves.\u201d <em>In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>627 F.3d 376, 392 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-12\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 argue that Dr. Cornell offered an incorrect legal opinion of what is required by the Plaintiffs to show loss causation. Dr. Cornell states that corrective disclosures have to be made \u201cin such a way that a reasonable investor can reasonably infer that a fraud has occurred.\u201d <em>See </em>Cornell Report, \u00b6 25; Henssler Decl., Ex. C at 167:7-19. Dr. Cornell testified that this is the definition of loss causation \u201cthat I employ.\u201d Cornell Depo. at 44:20-45:18. Plaintiffs\u2019 also argue that Dr. Cornell identified and reviewed relevant media and analyst reports to determine whether an analyst or someone in the press \u201csuggests that something is inappropriate.\u201d Opp. at 8. Plaintiffs contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>there is no requirement under Ninth Circuit law that an analyst or someone in the press \u201csuggests that something is inappropriate.\u201d Opp. at 8. Plaintiffs\u2019 argue that Dr. Cornell\u2019s review of the media and analyst reports, and application of his erroneous legal standard, led to his opinions that Plaintiffs cannot show loss causation (or \u201ca corrective disclosure\u201d) on the four alleged disclosure dates. However, as Plaintiffs aptly point out, there is no requirement that a reasonable investor infer that a fraud has occurred, and this was confirmed by Defendants\u2019 other loss causation expert, Dr. Tabak, who Plaintiffs\u2019 contend expressly disavowed Dr. Cornell\u2019s loss causation standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Cornell Report \u00b6 25; Tabak Depo. at 167:7-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">Defendants admit that if Plaintiffs could show that Dr. Cornell\u2019s understanding of legal loss causation standards was erroneous, which Defendants argue they cannot, that would require, at most, the exclusion of the erroneous legal conclusions themselves, not the exclusion of Dr. Cornell\u2019s testimony as a whole. However, Dr. Cornell\u2019s entire rebuttal opinion addresses whether or not there was loss causation or a corrective disclosure on the four dates in question. If erroneous legal conclusions form the basis of Dr. Cornell\u2019s rebuttal opinions, the Court fails to see, and the Defendants have failed to articulate, what else Dr. Cornell would provide testimony on, aside from these opinions. The Court finds the Defendants contention that this is a question of weight, not admissibility, unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">Based upon the foregoing, the Court finds that Dr. Cornell\u2019s analysis is based on a loss causation standard that is incompatible with that set forth by the Ninth Circuit. As such, the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to exclude the testimony of Defendants\u2019 Loss Causation Expert Dr. Bradford Cornell is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-9\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">. <em>See Dura Pharms., Inc. v.
