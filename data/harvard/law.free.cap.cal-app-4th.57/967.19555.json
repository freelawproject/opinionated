In a related appeal of the underlying lawsuit <em>(Board of Administration </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1109 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 207]), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment directing issuance of a writ of mandamus, concluding that \u201cin arrears\u201d public pension financing was an unconstitutional impairment of contract. In this appeal, plaintiffs Board of Administration of the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS) and William D. Crist, PERS member and president of the PERS Board (hereafter collectively PERS) appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for attorney\u2019s fees under California\u2019s private attorney general statute (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.5; further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise designated) and the federal Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (hereafter \u00a7 1988)). Defendant Pete Wilson, as Governor of the State of California (defendant), cross-appeals from the trial court\u2019s \u201cunnecessary determination\u201d that the amount of fees and costs sought was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude the trial court correctly denied fees under section 1021.5. In this published portion, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying fees under section 1988. We shall therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion for attorney\u2019s fees and shall dismiss the cross-appeal as moot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">On January 11, 1995, the trial court entered judgment in favor of PERS, determining that the state and federal constitutional prohibitions against impairment of contracts were violated by \u201cin arrears\u201d financing of public pensions pursuant to two sequential versions of Government Code section 20822 (former section 20751)\u2014Senate Bill No. 1107 (enacted in 1992) and Senate Bill No. 240 (enacted in 1993). The trial court entered a declaratory judgment and issued a writ of mandate directing the transfer of overdue contributions and a return to a quarterly payment system. We affirmed the judgment in <em>Board of Administration </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>On March 13, 1995, PERS filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees \u201con the grounds that [PERS] enforced the constitutional rights of CalPERS\u2019 members and beneficiaries protected under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 [hereafter \u00a7 1983] and is therefore entitled to fees pursuant to . . . section 1988, and in addition acted as a \u2018private attorney general\u2019 and is entitled to recover its fees under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Before the hearing, the trial court issued a tentative ruling denying attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Following the hearing, the trial court on June 15, 1995, issued its written order denying the motions for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. With respect to the private attorney general statute (\u00a7 1021.5), the order stated: \u201cAn award under this statute is denied on the grounds stated in <em>California Teachers Association </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 494 [202.Cal.Rptr. 611]. [PERS\u2019s] suggestion that the case is distinguishable is not persuasive. A fundamental premise of that case (unaffected by subsequent events), and the principle here determinative is that large sums will inure to the direct benefit of the members of PERS, making an award of fees under a private attorney general theory inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">With respect to the section 1988 claim, the trial court\u2019s order stated in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\">\u201c[PERS] make[s] a more persuasive argument for an award of fees under . . . section 1988.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-8\">\u201ca. The Court is inclined to [PERS\u2019s] view that an action to vindicate rights guaranteed by the contract clause of the U.S. Constitution falls within the evolving scope of . . . section 1983, as most recently expressed in <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Higgins </em>(1991) 498 US 439 [111 S.Ct. 865, 112 L.Ed.2d 969].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-9\">\u201cb. [PERS] recognize[s] that an award of fees to a prevailing party under section 1988 may properly be denied where \u2018special circumstances\u2019 exist . . . . And, the U.S. Supreme Court has stated that section 1988 gives a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>court discretion to deny fees \u2018in cases in which a postjudgment motion unfairly surprises or prejudices the affected party.\u2019 (See <em>White </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Department of Employment Services </em>(1982) 455 US 445, 454 [102 S.Ct. 1162, 1167-1168, 71 L.Ed.2d 325].) The Court cannot ignore the fact that this case was neither pled nor litigated as a section 1983 case. The parties did not request, and the Court did not make, findings peculiar to a 1983 claim. Issues related to compensatory and consequential damages, pre-judgment interest, and statutes of limitation were at no time argued or decided within a [section] 1983 context. This Court cannot say (and ought not indulge speculation regarding) whether such issues would have been decided identically were the remedial aspects of section 1983 deemed before the Court prior to judgment. Until the issue of attorney fees and the motions before the Court, no aspect of section 1983 was argued by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-4\">\u201cc. Notwithstanding that in retrospect the pleadings in the case can be read as technically supporting a 1983 claim,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] the Court finds that it would be prejudicial to respondents and unfairly surprise them (and the Court) to belatedly invoke this one remedial aspect of section 1983. Unless <em>Green </em>v. <em>Obledo </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d [678] [207 Cal.Rptr. 830] precludes such determination, the proper and sound exercise of discretion in this case at this time is to deny attorney fees under . . . section 1988. Careful review of <em>Green </em>suggests that it is authority-granting, not discretion limiting; and the Court does therefore deny attorney fees under section 1988.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The trial court\u2019s order continued: \u201cThere is, of course, no facet of this case which will not experience appellate oversight. Thus, notwithstanding that it is unnecessary to its decision, judicial economy suggests that the Court ought [to] make findings regarding the issue of the reasonableness of the fees and additional costs sought to be recovered.\u201d The trial court then made findings that the amounts sought were reasonable, and stated that if the court were to grant attorney\u2019s fees and additional costs, it would do so in the full amounts requested. The amount sought by PERS for attorney\u2019s fees, though not stated in the order, was $268,953.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">PERS appealed from those portions of the order which denied attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988 and section 1021.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>Defendant filed a cross-appeal from those portions of the order which stated (1) the court\u2019s belief that a contract clause case falls within the evolving scope of federal civil rights law, and (2) the amount of fees sought was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for attorney\u2019s fees is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>(City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Drew </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1287, 1297-1298 [255 Cal.Rptr. 704] [review of section 1021.5 fee denial]; <em>Kreutzer </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 62, 75 [200 Cal.Rptr. 322] [review of section 1988 fee denial].)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">An abuse of discretion may be found where the trial court applies an erroneous legal basis, which entails de novo review. \u201cThe scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied, i.e., in the \u2018legal principles governing the subject of [the] action . . . .\u2019 Action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an \u2018abuse\u2019 of discretion. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Drew, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1297-1298.) The question is whether the trial court\u2019s actions are consistent with the substantive law and, if so, whether the application of law to the facts of the case is within the range of discretion conferred upon the trial court. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1298.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">II. <em>Section 1021.5</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">III. <em>Section 1988</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">PERS argues it is entitled to section 1988<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> attorney\u2019s fees for redressing a federal civil rights violation under section 1983,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which protects persons from deprivation of constitutional rights by persons acting under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>color of state law. PERS claims that by succeeding in its contract clause claim, it corrected a federal civil rights violation under section 1983, even though it never mentioned section 1983 until its postjudgment motion for attorney\u2019s fees. PERS contends the trial court denied attorney\u2019s fees on the erroneous legal ground that fees should be denied because section 1988 was not expressly cited in the pleading. We shall conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Section 1988 authorizes attorney\u2019s fee awards, in the discretion of the court, to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in actions vindicating federal civil rights violations under specified statutes, including section 1983. \u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 1988 is to ensure \u2018effective access to the judicial process\u2019 for persons with civil rights grievances.\u201d <em>(Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 424, 429 [103 S.Ct. 1933, 1937, 76 L.Ed.2d 40, 48].)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Section 1988 attorney\u2019s fees are awardable in section 1983 cases litigated in California state courts cases; we follow the federal standard for determining section 1988 issues. <em>(EWAP, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Ontario </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 1108, 1113 [223 Cal.Rptr. 422].)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">A trial court retains discretion under section 1988 to deny fees where \u201ca postjudgment motion unfairly surprises or prejudices the affected party.\u201d <em>(White </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Dept. of Empl. Sec. </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 445, 454 [102 S.Ct. 1162, 1168, 71 L.Ed.2d 325, 333].) Here the trial court correctly relied on this rule to deny section 1988 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">PERS does not dispute the trial court\u2019s finding that PERS never mentioned possible recovery under section 1983 until its postjudgment motion for attorney\u2019s fees. At that juncture, a variety of issues affecting PERS\u2019s entitlement to a section 1983 recovery remained unadjudicated. Foremost among these was the question of the standing of PERS, a state entity, to recover under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Thus, it is a \u201cwell-established rule that subordinate political entities, as \u2018creatures\u2019 of the state, may not challenge state action as violating the entities\u2019 rights under the due process or equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment or under the contract clause of the federal Constitution. \u2018A municipal corporation, created by a state for the better ordering of government, has no privileges or immunities under the federal constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>which it may invoke in opposition to the will of its creator. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Star-Kist Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1, 6 [227 Cal.Rptr. 391, 719 P.2d 987] [addressing whether same rule applies beyond Fourteenth Amendment and contract clause, to commerce clause challenge].)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">A \u201cline of Supreme Court cases including, <em>e.g., Coleman </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>307 U.S. 433, 59 S.Ct. 972, 83 L.Ed. 1385 (1939); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>289 U.S. 36, 53 S.Ct. 431, 77 L.Ed. 1015 (1933); <em>City of Trenton </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>262 U.S. 182, 43 S.Ct. 534, 67 L.Ed. 937 (1923); and <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>City of Pittsburg, </em>207 U.S. 161, 28 S.Ct. 40, 52 L.Ed. 151 (1907), stands generally for the proposition that creatures of the state have no standing to invoke certain constitutional provisions in opposition to the will of their creator.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>State of Ala. </em>(11th Cir. 1986) 791 F.2d 1450, 1454-1455 [holding that, while no per se rule applied in that circuit, Alabama State University, as a creature of the st\u00e1te, did not have standing to sue the Alabama State Board of Education under section 1983 for Fourteenth Amendment violations]; see also cases cited in <em>Township of River Vale </em>v. <em>Town of Orangetown </em>(2d Cir. 1968) 403 F.2d 684, 686.)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">We need not and do not determine whether this rule would have applied in this case, had the case been adjudicated as a section 1983 case, or whether any exception exists which would remove this case from the general rule. We need only conclude that the question of PERS\u2019s standing constituted a substantial issue, affecting PERS\u2019s entitlement to recover under section 1983, that remained unadjudicated at the time PERS made its request for fees. The appropriate time to adjudicate issues affecting a plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to judgment is prior to judgment, either by way of trial or by an appropriate pretrial procedure such as demurrer or motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. California\u2019s courts should not be in the business of adjudicating the merits of a plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to judgment by way of a postjudgment motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Here, defendant had no reason to contest PERS\u2019s standing under section 1983 until PERS tendered a section 1983 claim in its postjudgment motion for fees. The trial court properly exercised its discretion to deny fees on the ground that PERS\u2019s postjudgment assertion of a section 1983 claim surprised and prejudiced defendants. <em>(White </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Dept. of Empl. Sec., supra, </em>455 U.S. at p. 454 [102 S.Ct. at pp. 1167-1168, 71 L.Ed.2d at p. 333].)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">PERS relies on our opinion in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Obledo </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 678 [207 Cal.Rptr. 830], where we held plaintiffs could recover fees under section 1988 even though they had not pleaded a claim under section 1983 in their complaint. This case is distinguishable from <em>Green, </em>because we there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>stated the case presented \u201ca classic section 1983 claim,\u201d and \u201c[t]he state point[ed] to no issue concerning the section 1988 award not subsumed in the prior adjudication.\u201d <em>(Green, supra, </em>161 Cal.App.3d at pp. 682-683.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Similarly, <em>Best v. California Apprenticeship Council </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1448 [240 Cal.Rptr. 1], held denial of section 1988 fees was improper where the complaint, despite its failure to mention section 1983, \u201cclearly alleged\u201d a section 1983 action. (193 Cal.App.3d at p. 1464.) \u201c[T]he labeling of a pleading is not determinative, but rather the subject matter of the action is to be determined from its allegations, regardless of what they may be called.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1463.) Here, PERS\u2019s pleadings did not clearly allege a section 1983 claim, because the pleadings alleged claims by a state agency against its own state through state officials acting in their official capacity. As we have mentioned, this creates serious standing questions, because a state agency, as a creature of the state, generally lacks standing to challenge its own state\u2019s actions in a section 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying fees to PERS. Since PERS fails to show any basis for reversal of the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees, we need not address the cross-appeal, which is now moot. Defendant shall recover his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The order denying the motion for attorney\u2019s fees is affirmed. The cross-appeal is dismissed as moot. Defendant shall recover his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Davis, J., and Morrison, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Although the motion for attorney\u2019s fees was filed by \u201cpetitioners\u201d in the trial court, it appears the attorney\u2019s fees were incurred by the PERS Board, not by Dr. Crist. PERS does not argue on appeal that attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded to Dr. Crist in the event an award to the PERS Board is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Also named as defendants were the State Controller and State Treasurer. The State Controller and State Treasurer advised this court they would not be filing respondents\u2019 briefs on appeal but stood ready to comply with this court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Interveners\u2014Association of California State Attorneys and Administrative Law Judges, California Association of Professional Scientists, Professional Engineers in California Government, California Department of Forestry Employees Association, and Retired Public Employees\u2019 Association\u2014also appealed from denial of their own motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. However, no appellate brief was filed, and we dismissed the interveners\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">We granted the joint request of the parties on appeal to take judicial notice of the record in <em>Board of Administration </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th 1109, our case No. C020118.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-10\">This statement in the trial court\u2019s order also appeared in the court\u2019s tentative ruling. At the hearing on the motion for attorney\u2019s fees, PERS\u2019s counsel expressed the view that the court\u2019s statement reflected a determination by the trial court that PERS had presented a viable section 1983 federal civil rights case but without the label (a construction which in our view is unsupported by the language of the ruling). At the hearing, the trial court clarified its statement merely meant the court\u2019s reading of the authorities suggested the federal courts will ultimately hold that the subject matter of the lawsuit\u2014an impairment of contract claim\u2014is not necessarily outside the scope of section 1983 (though the court noted even that issue was a close question). On appeal, PERS ignores the trial court\u2019s clarification and repeats its erroneous construction of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">We disagree with PERS\u2019s construction that the trial court found PERS had in substance prevailed on a section 1983 claim. In context, it is clear the trial court did not make a determination that there was a viable section 1983 claim but merely indicated allegations in the complaint \u201csupported\u201d a section 1983 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\">This statement also appeared in the tentative ruling.

The trial court noted the issue had been raised in PERS\u2019s memorandum of points and authorities, denied the request and heard defendant\u2019s oral argument on the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b791-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 967.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b791-12\">Section 1988(b), provides in part: \u201cIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section[] . . . 1983 ... of this title, ... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs &gt;&gt;</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b791-14\">Section 1983 provides: \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b792-10\">We shall assume for purposes of this appeal that a contract clause claim is within the scope of section 1983.
