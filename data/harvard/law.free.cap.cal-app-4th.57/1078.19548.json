Co. </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1809, 1817-1824 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 182], we held that a plaintiff may obtain mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from a dismissal entered under the discretionary dismissal statutes (\u00a7 583.410 et seq.) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> only if it occurred because the plaintiff\u2019s attorney failed to oppose the defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal; the plaintiff may not obtain mandatory relief merely by filing an affidavit in which his or her counsel avows that the dismissal came about through counsel\u2019s fault. Here we hold that, for all the reasons stated in <em>Peltier, </em>section 473 does not mandate relief from dismissal for failure to serve a complaint within three years (\u00a7 583.210 et seq.) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> where the plaintiff\u2019s counsel files an affidavit avowing fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Plaintiff Bernasconi Commercial Real Estate originally filed suit against two named defendants and fifty Does, then later named four other defendants in place of Does (\u00a7 474). <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With one business day remaining before the three-year anniversary of the complaint\u2019s filing, plaintiff named defendants St. Joseph\u2019s Regional Health Care <em>(sic: </em>Healthcare) System and St. Joseph\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>Heathcare <em>(sic: </em>Healthcare) Corporation, but did not then serve them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff first attempted service well after the three-year anniversary had passed. Defendant successfully moved for dismissal (\u00a7\u00a7 583.210, 583.250) and for sanctions (\u00a7 128.5). Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then moved to vacate the dismissal under section 473, averring the dismissal occurred as a result of his fault, because he had failed to calendar the three-year anniversary of the filing of the complaint. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Plaintiff appeals from the judgment, and from postjudgment orders awarding sanctions and denying his section 473 motion. In the published portion of this opinion we affirm the judgment of dismissal and the denial of the section 473 motion. In the unpublished portions we reject plaintiff\u2019s contention that dismissal was improper because defendant was in default, but reverse the award of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Factual and Procedural Background*</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">Plaintiff contends section 473 mandated the dismissal be set aside because it occurred as a result of counsel\u2019s fault. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">In <em>Peltier </em>v. <em>McCloud River R.R. Co., supra, </em>34 Cal.App.4th 1809, we analyzed the interrelationship of two statutory provisions governing dismissals of complaints: (1) section 473, which (since its amendment by Stats. 1992, ch. 876, \u00a7 4) on its face mandates relief from \u201cany . . . dismissal\u201d shown by affidavit to have been caused by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fault (fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>and (2) the discretionary dismissal statutes (\u00a7 583.410 et seq.; see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>permitting trial courts to dismiss complaints for failure to serve within two years or to bring to trial within three years, which the Legislature did not alter when it amended section 473. We concluded that the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>portion of section 473 could not be read literally, for the following reasons: To do so would effectively abrogate the discretionary dismissal statutes, since few if any dismissals under those statutes would ever be final. The abrogation or repeal of statutes by implication through the enactment or amendment of other statutes is strongly disfavored, and courts will avoid any statutory construction yielding such a result unless the legislative history of the statute at issue compels that result. The history of the 1992 amendment to section 473 shows no legislative intent to abrogate discretionary dismissals; indeed, it does not even show that the Legislature considered whether its action might affect the discretionary dismissal statutes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, those statutes serve important policies (to promote the speedy trial of cases and to expedite the administration of justice), and nothing in the history of the amendment to section 473 shows any legislative intent to abandon these policies. <em>(Peltier </em>v. <em>McCloud River R.R. Co., supra, </em>34 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1815-1822.)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Based on this reasoning, we held in <em>Peltier </em>that the relevant provision of section 473 may be reconciled with the discretionary dismissal statutes only if limited to those dismissals which are the procedural equivalent of defaults \u2014i.e., those which occur because the plaintiff\u2019s attorney has failed to oppose a dismissal motion. <em>(Peltier </em>v. <em>McCloud River R.R. Co., supra, </em>34 Cal.App.4th at p. 1824.)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">All of the above reasoning applies squarely here. Just as a literal reading of section 473 would abrogate the discretionary dismissal statutes by implication, so would it do to the mandatory dismissal provisions of section 583.250. The silence of the legislative history of the 1992 amendment to section 473 with respect to the discretionary dismissal statutes is equally profound with respect to section 583.250. And the policies underlying the discretionary dismissal statutes are even more compelling as to the mandatory dismissal provisions of section 583.250, since the sloth in prosecution which compels dismissal is graver than that which merely invites it.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Plaintiff cites <em>Metropolitan Service Corp. </em>v. <em>Casa de Palms, Ltd. </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1481 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 575] and <em>Lorenz </em>v. <em>Commercial Acceptance Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 981 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 362] as authority for the contrary conclusion. They are not. Because they discuss only relief from default under section 473, not relief from dismissal (whether under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>the discretionary or the mandatory dismissal statutes), they are simply inapposite.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Plaintiff was not entitled to mandatory relief from dismissal under section 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Ill, IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The order of sanctions is reversed. In all other respects the judgment and postjudgment orders are affirmed.

(Peltier </em>v. <em>McCloud River R.R. Co., supra, </em>34 Cal.App.4th at p. 1819, fn. 5.) Having discussed the significance of that legislative history there <em>(id. </em>at pp. 1818-1822), we need not do so again, as plaintiff makes no arguments about it which we did not consider and reject in <em>Peltier.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Plaintiff asserts that the court in <em>Lorenz </em>declined to \u201cextend the rationale of <em>Graham </em>[v. <em>Beers </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1656 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 765]] and <em>Tustin Plaza [Partnership </em>v. <em>Wehage </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1557 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 366]]\u201d\u2014two <em>pre-Peltier </em>decisions which construed section 473\u2019s provision for relief from dismissals in the same way we did in <em>Peltier.

It is true that the court in <em>Lorenz </em>declined to \u201cextend\u201d that rationale to section 473\u2019s provision for relief from default.
