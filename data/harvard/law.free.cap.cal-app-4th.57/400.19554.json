We disagree and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">On March 21,1995, Madrigal pleaded guilty to transporting (counts 1 and 2) and possessing for sale (counts 3 and 4) heroin and cocaine. He also admitted soliciting a minor to participate in the transaction (count 5) and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>school-zone enhancement (Health &amp; Saf. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 11353.6, subd. (b)). The court suspended imposition of sentence and placed Madrigal on three years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">On July 24, 1995, Madrigal admitted violating probation. The court revoked and reinstated his probation on condition he spend 90 days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">On September 5, 1995, the day he was released from jail, Madrigal allegedly sold narcotics to an undercover police officer. Although a jury deadlocked on the charge, the court found there was sufficient evidence to find Madrigal in violation of his probation. Thereupon, the court sentenced him to ten years in prison, consisting of four years on count 1, two years on count 5 and four years for the school-zone enhancement. Sentencing on the remaining counts was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Madrigal contends imposition of the school-zone enhancement violated Penal Code section 1170.1, which, subject to certain exceptions, limits the term of imprisonment to twice the base term. If that limitation applies, Madrigal\u2019s maximum allowable sentence would be eight years, double the four-year base term. We find the limitation inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (g)(1) provides in pertinent part, \u201cThe term of imprisonment shall not exceed twice the number of years imposed by the trial court as the base term . . . , unless ... an enhancement is imposed pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 186.10 or Section 667, 667.15, 667.5, 667.8, 667.83, 667.85, 12022, 12022.2, 12022.4, 12022.5, 12022.55, 12022.6, 12022.7, 12022.75, or 12022.9 of this code, or an enhancement is being imposed pursuant to Section 11370.2, 11370.4, or 11379.8 of the Health and Safety Code[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">At first blush, it would appear the double-the-base-term limitation controls because section 11353.6, subdivision (b), the school-zone enhancement, is not listed among the excepted enhancement provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>subdivision (e) of section 11353.6 states, \u201cThe additional terms provided in this section shall be in addition to any other punishment provided by law and shall not be limited by any other provision of law.\u201d As we now explain, this language controls over the general sentencing provisions set forth in Penal Code section 1170.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1840 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 301] is instructive. There, Hernandez\u2019s base and subordinate sentencing terms were each enhanced three years because his narcotics offenses involved a minor who was at least four years his junior. (\u00a7 11353.1, subd. (a)(3).) On appeal, Hernandez claimed his sentence violated Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (a), which states the subordinate term for nonviolent offenses \u201cshall exclude any enhancements.\u201d In rejecting this argument, the court noted section 11353.1, subdivision (c) states the age-difference enhancement \u201cshall be <em>in addition </em>to any other punishment provided by law and shall not be limited by any other provision of law.\u201d (Italics added.) Because this language is unambiguous, the rule of lenity (requiring a statute capable of two interpretations to be construed in the defendant\u2019s favor) did not apply. (18 Cal.App.4th at p. 1845.) Moreover, because section 11353 dealt specifically with Hernandez\u2019s particular criminal act, the court found it prevailed over the more general provisions of Penal Code section 1170.1. (18 Cal.App.4th at p. 1846.)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Like the age-difference enhancement in <em>Hernandez, </em>the school-zone enhancement states it <em>shall apply in addition to </em>any other statutory punishment provision. Because the enhancement language is unambiguous and relates to Madrigal\u2019s specific conduct, i.e., dealing narcotics within a school zone, it logically prevails over the general sentencing provisions of Penal Code section 1170.1. This construction also comports with the legislative intent behind section 11353.6 to eliminate drug trafficking with schoolchildren and shield minors from the evils of the drug trade. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1389, 1394 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 379].) Therefore, the trial court correctly found the double-the-base-term limitation inapplicable to the school-zone enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Ill, IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Wallin, Acting P.
