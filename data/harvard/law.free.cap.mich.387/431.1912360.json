Kelley, </em>Attorney General, <em>Robert A. DerengosM, </em>Solicitor General, <em>William L. Cahalan, </em>Prosecuting Attorney, <em>Dominick </em>R. <em>Carnovale, </em>Chief, Appellate Department, and <em>Patricia J.

Brennan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa6\">Defendant was convicted, along with five others, of possession of heroin; conspiracy to possess heroin; and control of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The conviction was affirmed on appeal to the Court of Appeals, Holbrook, J., writing an extensive opinion treating nine issues raised in great detail. The other members of the appellate panel concurred. <em>People </em>v <em>Iaconis (People v Bercheny), </em>29 Mich App 443 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">We granted leave to appeal. This writer and my Brother Williams dissented from grant of leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Nothing presented in the briefs or oral arguments persuades me that the decision of the Court of Appeals was clearly erroneous; or that the subject matter of the appeal involves legal principles of major significance to the jurisprudence of the state; or that the decision of the Court of Appeals is in conflict with other decisions of that Court or decisions of this Court. GCR 1963, 853.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">The case of <em>State </em>v <em>McGee, </em>473 SW2d 686 (Mo, 1971), is distinguishable on its facts. <em>McGee </em>involved marijuana in containers; here we have heroin in open piles. In <em>McGee, </em>the defendant lived in the house, his presence therefore did not raise the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>inference as in the instant case. In <em>McGee, </em>the table was cluttered with objects unrelated to narcotics. The description of the table in this case whs of a far different character.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">I therefore adopt the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case, and vote to affirm conviction for the reasons^stated therein.</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-7\">Black, Adams, Swainson, and Williams, JJ., concurred with T. E. Brennan, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b511-8\">T. M. Kavanagh, C.

Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApS\">(dissenting). In <em>People </em>v <em>Sinclair, </em>387 Mich 91 (1972) for different reasons, a majority of this Court held that the statute proscribing the possession of marijuana was unconstitutional. For the reasons set forth in my opinion in <em>Sinclair, </em>I am convinced that the statute\u2019s proscription of <em>possession </em>and <em>use </em>of heroin is equally impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">In my opinion the defendant\u2019s conviction here for possession of heroin; conspiracy to possess heroin; and control of heroin should not be permitted to stand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
