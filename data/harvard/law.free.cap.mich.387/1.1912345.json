Subsequently, the prosecution added a second count of unlawfully driving away an automobile. With the representation of counsel, defendant pled guilty to the added count on May 7, 1969. <em>Boykin </em>was decided on June 2, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">At the plea proceeding defendant\u2019s attorney promised to file a written statement, previously signed by the defendant, in which defendant asserted that his plea was understandingly and voluntarily made. In response to the court\u2019s concern that a record be made demonstrating the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s plea as required by the court rule on the taking of guilty pleas, defendant\u2019s lawyer proceeded to question him regarding the factual details of the crime and his participation therein. The court personally inquired of defendant whether his plea was motivated by any threats, promises or other inducements. The court accepted defendant\u2019s plea. On appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals affirmed the plea conviction in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion. Deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>that <em>Boykin </em>applied prospectively only, the Court of Appeals opined that the <em>Barrows </em>rule that the court \u201cexamine the accused\u201d to ascertain a factual basis for the plea and presumably the requirement that the plea he freely, understandingly and voluntarily made could be complied with in a form and manner in the discretion of the trial court. Thus, the examination of defendant by his lawyer in open court at the time the plea was offered satisfied the requirement of ascertaining a factual basis for the plea. As for the failure to advise the defendant of his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, the Court of Appeals found \u201cnothing exists which would show that the plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made,\u201d etc. We granted leave to appeal primarily to decide the retroactivity of <em>Boykin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The United States Supreme Court has not yet passed on the question of the retroactivity of <em>Boykin. Brady </em>v <em>United States, </em>397 US 742, 747; 90 S Ct 1463, 1468; 25 L Ed 2d 747 (1970). However, several state supreme courts have considered the question of <em>Boykin\u2019s </em>retroactivity and have uniformly given <em>Boykin </em>prospective application only. <em>In re Tahl, </em>1 Cal 3d 122; 460 P2d 449 ; 81 Cal Rptr 577 (1969); <em>Ernst </em>v <em>State, </em>43 Wis 2d 661; 170 NW2d 713 (1969); <em>State </em>v <em>Urbano, </em>105 Ariz 13; 457 P2d 343 (1969); <em>Ward </em>v <em>People, </em>172 Colo 244; 472 P2d 673 (1970); <em>People </em>v <em>Williams, </em>44 Ill 2d 334; 255 NE2d 385 (1970); <em>State </em>v <em>Jackson, </em>173 NW2d 567 (Iowa, 1970); <em>Crego </em>v <em>State, </em>447 SW2d 550 (Mo, 1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v <em>Godfrey, </em>434 Pa 532; 254 A2d 923 (1969). We agree with our sister states. See also <em>Linkletter </em>v <em>Walker, </em>381 US 618; 85 S Ct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>1731; 14 L Ed 2d 601 (1965) and <em>Halliday </em>v <em>United States, </em>394 US 831; 89 S Ct 1498; 23 L Ed 2d 16 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Having determined that <em>Boykin </em>has only prospective effect, we turn to the question whether the plea in this case is valid under Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The written statement signed hy the defendant specifically contains a waiver of the right to jury trial. It also states that defendant understands that he is presumed innocent until proven guilty and that his guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Another written statement asserts that defendant had an adequate opportunity to \u201cconverse and counsel\u201d with his lawyer. In fact, the trial court and counsel have quite meticulously compiled a most exemplary record except for the failure to advise the defendant of his right against self-incrimination. This right is a right guaranteed both by the Federal and Michigan Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The underlying principle in both Federal and Michigan law relating to the taking of guilty pleas is that the defendant in pleading guilty waives a number of important constitutional rights and can be permitted to do so only if he does so understandingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">This principle is articulated in Michigan through MCLA 768.35; MSA 28.1058, and GCR 1963, 785.3, and <em>People </em>v <em>Barrows, supra. </em>For full discussion see <em>People </em>v <em>Jaworski, </em>387 Mich 21 (1972) released this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">The four cases of <em>People </em>v <em>Hobdy, </em>380 Mich 686 (1968); <em>People </em>v <em>Dunn, </em>380 Mich 693 (1968); <em>People </em>v <em>Stearns, </em>380 Mich 704 (1968); and <em>People </em>v <em>Winegar, </em>380 Mich 719 (1968), indicate that the mandates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>of the statute, court rule, and <em>Borrows </em>are satisfied by substantial compliance. <em>People </em>v <em>Rufus Williams, </em>386 Mich 277 (1971). The issue in this case therefore becomes whether there is substantial compliance where the record shows that in taking the guilty plea the defendant was properly advised of his rights except his right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Logically there are two ways of looking at this. First, \u201cyou must advise the defendant of <em>substantially all of his </em>rights,\u201d or second, \u201cyou must <em>substantially advise </em>defendant of all of his rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The cases hold that a defendant must be substantially advised of each of his rights. <em>People </em>v <em>Winegar, supra, People </em>v <em>Dunn, supra, </em>and <em>People </em>v <em>Jaworski, </em>387 Mich 21 (1972). As noted previously, a thorough review of the record of the lower court proceedings in the instant case fails to disclose that the defendant was ever advised concerning his constitutional right against self-incrimination. Therefore we must vacate the defendant\u2019s conviction and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings consonant with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Regarding defendant\u2019s claim that <em>People </em>v <em>Barrows, supra, </em>necessitates direct personal inquiry of the defendant for purposes of ascertaining the factual basis of the plea, defendant\u2019s counsel interrogating defendant as to how he drove the car away more than satisfied <em>Barrows, People </em>v <em>Rufus Williams, supra, People </em>v <em>Stearns, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">We emphasize that what we say in Part II has no application to pleas of guilty taken after April 1, 1972. This Court has invited members of the trial and appellate bench along with members of the bar to review GCR 1963, 785.3 to determine whether it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>best expresses the practical and legal principles for accepting a plea of guilty, and, if not, to recommend a better one. It is the Court\u2019s intention that the new rule shall be effective for all guilty pleas taken on and after April 1,1972. As of that time the new rule shall be followed specifically and strictly, and where a judge shall fail to follow the prescribed procedures, it shall be treated as reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Reversed, conviction vacated, and remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consonant with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b85-7\">T.

Together they consider the principal rules of law relating to the taking of guilty pleas. <em>Williams </em>relates more particularly to the requirement that the trial judge ascertain the factual basis of the alleged crime to which the defendant is pleading guilty, especially in light of <em>People </em>v <em>Barrows, </em>358 Mich 267 (1959). <em>Jaworski </em>deals with whether the plea was <em>understandingly </em>made, more specifically with whether the defendant was adequately advised of his rights so that his guilty plea constitutionally waived them. <em>Jaworski </em>also considers the general implications of <em>Boykin </em>v <em>Alabama, </em>395 US 238; 89 S Ct 1709; 23 L Ed 2d 274 (1969). <em>Butler </em>is a pre<em>Boykin </em>case. Its main point is whether substantial compliance requires advising defendant of substantially all of his rights or substantially advising defendant of all his rights. <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>main consideration is whether the guilty plea was <em>voluntarily </em>made, more specifically whether it was made without <em>duress </em>or <em>promise of leniency. </em>It also deals with the <em>Boykin </em>challenge. Procedurally, since <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>main point is not a guilty plea record matter, <em>Johnson </em>also considers how and when such review should be handled.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">These cases also conclude that the state of the law on this subject and the general understanding of the law leaves much to be desired. The Supreme Court has set up a committee to consider the whole matter and recommend clarifying and definitive rules to be strictly followed after adoption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\"> This is the same issue raised in <em>Jaworski. </em>However, <em>Jaworski </em>is <em>post-Boykin </em>and <em>Butler </em>is <em>pre-Boykin.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\"> Defendant pled guilty May 7 and was sentenced June 12, 1969. Before the month was out appeal at public expense was initiated. Dor reasons set forth in footnote 3 to <em>Jaworski, </em>this writer believes the better and_ correct procedure \u2014 and the cheaper and more expeditious one \u2014 is to move in the trial court to vacate the conviction and withdraw the plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b89-21\">T.E.Brennan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxZ\">(dissenting). Boykin v <em>Alabama </em>395 US 238; 89 S Ct 1709; 23 L Ed 2d 274 (1969), has not been uniformly understood in these parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>To put the controversy in focus, the following excerpt from <em>Boykin </em>should he re-examined:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u201cA plea of guilty is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts; it is itself a conviction; nothing remains hut to give judgment and determine punishment. See <em>Kercheval </em>v <em>United States, </em>274 U.S. 220, 223 [47 S Ct 582; 71 L Ed 1009 (1927)]. Admissibility of a confession must be based on a \u2018reliable determination on the voluntariness issue which satisfies the constitutional rights of the defendant.\u2019 <em>Jackson </em>v <em>Denno, </em>378 U. S. 368, 387 [84 S Ct 1774; 12 L Ed 2d 908; 1 ALR3d 1205 (1964)]. The requirement that the prosecution spread on the record the prerequisites of a valid waiver is no constitutional innovation. In <em>Carnley </em>v <em>Cochran, </em>369 U. S. 506, 516 [82 S Ct 884; 8 L Ed 2d 70 (1962)], we dealt with a problem of waiver of the right to counsel, a Sixth Amendment right. We held: \u2018Presuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible. The record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u201cWe think that the same standard must he applied to determining whether a guilty plea is voluntarily made. For, as we have said, a plea of guilty is more than an admission of conduct; it is a conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ignorance, incomprehension, coercion, terror, inducements, subtle or blatant threats might he a perfect cover-up of unconstitutionality. The question of an effective waiver of a federal constitutional right in a proceeding is of course governed by federal standards. <em>Douglas </em>v <em>Alabama, </em>380 U. S. 415, 422 [85 S Ct 1074; 13 L Ed 2d 934 (1965)].</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201cSeveral federal constitutional rights are involved in a waiver that takes place when a plea of guilty is entered in a state criminal trial. First, is the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth. <em>Malloy </em>v <em>Hogan, </em>378 U. S. 1 [84 S Ct 1489; 12 L Ed 2d 653 (1964) ]. Second, is the right to trial by jury. <em>Duncan </em>v <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U. S. 145 [88 S Ct 1444; 20 L Ed 2d 491 (1968)]. Third, is the right to confront one\u2019s accusers. <em>Pointer </em>v <em>Texas, 380 </em>U. S. 400 [85 S Ct 1065; 13 L Ed 2d 923 (1965)]. We cannot presume a waiver of these three important federal rights from a silent record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u201cWhat is at stake for an accused facing death or imprisonment demands the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.

If a defendant refuses to plead or if the court refuses to accept a plea of guilty or if a defendant corporation fails to appear, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty. The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea. (As amended Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">GrCB 1963, 785.3(2) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">\u201cImposing Sentence. If the accused pleads guilty, after such plea and before sentence the court shall inform the accused of the nature of the accusation and the consequence of his plea; and regardless of whether he is represented by counsel, the court shall examine the accused, not necessarily under oath, and as a condition of accepting the plea of guilty and imposing sentence shall ascertain that the plea was freely, understandingly, and voluntarily made, without undue influence, compulsion, or duress, and without promise of leniency. Unless the court deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>mines that the plea of guilty was so made, it shall not be accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">I have read and re-read the Michigan and Federal Rules. I cannot perceive any substantial difference between them. If anything, the Michigan rule seems more precise and demanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Nor can I comprehend, much less agree with the argument that <em>Boykin </em>requires more ritual, more formalism in state court guilty pleas than Federal Rule 11 requires of the United States District Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The Bench and Bar must be weary of our hyper-scrupulous efforts to codify the imponderable.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On August 24, 1966, we promulgated proposed Amendments to GCR 785.3. A storm of protest led to reconsideration and the eventual entry of our June 8, 1967 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u201c \u2018The various amendments of GCR 1963, 785, adopted since January 1, 1963, are repealed effective instanter.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">\u201c \u2018The Court wishes to advise the profession and bench generally that the Rules Committee of the Michigan Judges Association, the Prosecuting Attorneys Association and the Special Committee on Revision of the Criminal Code of the State Bar of Michigan have been requested by the Court, and have accepted the assignment, to draft for recommended adoption such amendments of original Rule 785 as may in their judgment be required in view of constitutional interpretations and constitutional changes taking place since the General Court Rules of 1963 were considered and adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">\u201c \u2018Pending submission and approval by the Court of such forthcoming amendments, the bench and bar will proceed in accordance with original Rule 785, in accordance with article 1 of the Constitution of 1963 and in accordance with such decisions of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>States Supreme Court and of the Supreme Court of Michigan as m\u00e1y he deemed applicable to the particular criminal matter at hand.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u201cIt is ordered that all amendments of GCR 1963, 785, adopted since January 1, 1963, be and the same are repealed effective this date and that the Court Administrator be directed to furnish copies of this order to all trial judges, all judges of the Court of Appeals, the President of the Michigan Judges Association, the President of the Prosecuting Attorneys Association and the Secretary of the State Bar.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">That loudly heralded committee came to naught.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">I see no point in announcing or commissioning a new committee; I see no point in amending the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Post conviction proceedings will always be with us. Appeals from guilty pleas will continue. We ought to be content to decide the cases as they come to us, without shaking our fists at the sky, and bewailing the absence of mandated magical minutia which would relieve us of the burden of doing what the taxpayers are paying us to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Turning to this case of <em>Butler. </em>The record of the plea is set forth in full in my Brother\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">The sum and substance of appellant\u2019s objection to the plea is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">\u201cIn the instant case the United States Supreme Court via the <em>Boykin </em>(supra) decision has super-ceded G-.C.R. 1963, 785.3(2). In Michigan, as well as every state in the Union, a Defendant must be advised <em>on the record </em>that:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">\u201c(1) He has the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">\u201c(2) He is entitled to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">\u201c(3) He has the right to confront his accusers.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">\u201cAnything less than advising of <em>all </em>three of the above will fall short of the United States Constitutional standard and will not be acceptable in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>State proceedings regardless if the State standard is less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The answer to that contention is simply NO. The United States Supreme Court has NOT, via <em>Boykin v Alabama, </em>superceded Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The United States Supreme Court has not yet adopted, \u2014 and hopefully never will adopt \u2014 the dangerous and novel requirement that a trial judge must play the role of defense counsel and give the defendant legal advice from the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">I would affirm this conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u201c4 \u2018A ,plea of guilty is more than a voluntary confession made in open court. It also serves as a stipulation that no proof by the prosecution need be advanced .... It supplies both evidence and verdict, ending controversy.\u2019 <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>State, 42 </em>Ala. App. 552, 558, 171 So. 2d 462, 469 [1965].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u201c5 In the federal regime we have Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which governs the duty of the trial judge before accepting a guilty plea. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459 [89 S Ct 1166; 22 L Ed 2d 418 (1969)]. We said in that case:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u201c \u2018A defendant who enters such a plea simultaneously waives several constitutional rights, including his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, his right to trial by jury, and his right to confront his accusers. For this waiver to be valid under the Due Process Clause, it must be \u201can intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464 [58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461] (1938). Consequently, if a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is not equally voluntary and knowing, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore void. Moreover, because a guilty plea is an admission of all the elements of a formal criminal charge, it cannot be truly voluntary unless the defendant possesses an understanding of the law in relation to the facts.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 466.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u201c6 Among the States requiring that an effective waiver of the right to plead not guilty appear affirmatively in the record are Colorado, Colo.
