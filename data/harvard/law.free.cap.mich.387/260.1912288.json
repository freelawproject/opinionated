Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqP\">This suit involves the question of a public utility\u2019s right to reimbursement costs in relocating its equipment in connection with an urban renewal project.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The City of Center Line began condemnation proceedings to acquire property for urban renewal pursant to the provisions of MOLA 125.71 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.3501 <em>et seq. </em>the rehabilitation of blighted areas (NBA) act. Michigan Bell\u2019s petition to intervene in the proceedings was denied by the trial judge, but the Court of Appeals reversed<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and remanded for determination of Michigan Bell\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Because the precise question was a matter of first impression we granted leave to speak to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The claim of Michigan Bell is that by virtue of its franchise it has an irrevocable contract right to use the highways of the state which may not be impaired under the provisions of US Const, art I, \u00a7 10, and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10 nor taken away without payment of just compensation under the provisions of the US Const, Am XIV, \u00a7 1 and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, and art 10, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">The City of Center Line maintains that whatever property rights Michigan Bell may have in the affected city streets, they are subject to the regulation by the city under the police power of the state, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>that no taking is involved here which entitles Michigan Bell to reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The Court of Appeals noted the \u201cmultitude of decisions from other jurisdictions\u201d holding a utility company had no compensable right under facts similar to those presented here. It cited:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"><em>\u201cCounty of Santa Barbara </em>v. <em>United States </em>(CD Cal, 1967), 269 F Supp 855; <em>City of Wichita </em>v. <em>Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Company </em>(1970), 204 Kan 546, 464 P2d 196; <em>Consolidated Edison of New York </em>v. <em>John Lindsay as Mayor </em>(1964), 24 NY2d 309 (300 NYS 2d 321); <em>New York Telephone Company </em>v. <em>City of Binghamton </em>(1966), 18 NY2d 152 (272 NYS2d 359 (219 NE2d 184); <em>State Highway Commission </em>v. <em>Clackamas Water District </em>(1967), 247 Ore 216, 428 P2d 395; <em>Western Union Telegraph Company </em>v. <em>Tarrant County </em>(Tex Civ App, 1970), 450 SW2d 763.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The Court held, however, that for two reasons Michigan Bell is entitled to reimbursement: 1) the development of the property acquired would be by a private developer who would otherwise benefit by the utility company\u2019s loss, and 2) since urban renewal is a \u201csocially orientated program operating under the guise of the police power\u201d the burden of its costs should be borne by the general taxpaying public, and unless the utility be reimbursed by the condemning authority, the rate paying users of the utility will ultimately bear the cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">We are not persuaded by the first reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">In <em>In re Slum </em>Clearance, 331 Mich 714 (1951), it was claimed that <em>the </em>condemnation proceedings for slum clearance was unconstitutional because the real estate, while taken for a public use, is, after objectionable buildings are razed, to be sold for redevelopment by private persons and that, considering the purposes of the condemnation as a whole, the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>posed action is improper and unconstitutional, as condemning the lands of one private person to be devoted to the uses and purposes of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">This Court held the slum clearance act constitutional saying (p 720):</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u201cIt seems to us that the public purpose of slum clearance is in any event the one <em>controlling </em>purpose of the condemnation. The jury were not asked to decide any necessity to condemn the parcels involved for any purpose of resale, but only for slum clearanee. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u201cIn the instant case, the resale [abating part of the cost of clearance] is not a primary purpose and is incidental and ancillary to the primary and real purpose of clearance. Reconstruction was asked for in the petition and resale is necessary for such purpose, but the resale is not for the purpose of enabling the city nor any private owner to make a profit.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The same reasoning applies here. The <em>controlling </em>purpose of the city\u2019s plan is to rehabilitate a blighted area. The property is acquired, not for the purpose of redevelopment at a profit to the city or any private developer, but to protect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Since the controlling purpose is a public use, the circumstance of a private developer\u2019s benefit would not change its character.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The second reason is sound, although its expression may be unfelicitous. Whether it is \u201cinappropriate\u201d for the rate payers to pay these costs or whether they \u201cshould\u201d be borne by the general taxpaying public are legislative rather than judicial judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">The conclusion that the legislature did so determine however, is inescapable from a fair reading of the RBA act.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>The whole tenor of the act is for the city to acquire private interests through purchase. The inclusion in the definition or real property in section 2(e) of \u201cevery estate, interest, <em>privilege, easement\u201d </em>and the direction to the city to acquire such real property in section 5 obviates the constitutional question of whether it is necessary to reimburse a utility for relocation costs when a public use entails the removal and relocation of equipment. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">We hold that the KB A act requires that the city reimburse a utility for costs for removal and relocation of its equipment necessitated by the implementation of an urban renewal plan under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">No costs, a public question.</p>\n<judges id=\"b342-8\">T.

My considered view is that Division 2 was right in its determination of <em>both </em>points made by Judge Danhoe, for the panel (26 Mich App 659).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The Judge\u2019s review of the two points starts on page 661 of his Court\u2019s report. To me, it reasons with due judicial vigilance in keeping the ever indispensably leashed police power within constitutional bounds, and in concluding that the real issue before it and now here is one of ascertainment of the pertinent legislative purpose; referring to 1945 PA 344 (MCLA 125.71 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.3501 <em>et seq.) </em>as that statute stood when Center Line instituted this low rent housing project.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Judge Danhoe\u2019s opinion correctly construed the definition of \u201cReal property,\u201d found in section 2(e) of the act of 1945. That being true, I suggest respectfully that Center Line had no authority, under section 3 of the act of 1945 or otherwise, to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Michigan Bell\u2019s property interests without paying just compensation therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">As I read the Court\u2019s instant opinion it stands for affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I therefore concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b343-5\">Swainson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5G\">(dissenting). I dissent from the conclusion that the City of Center Line, in this matter, is required to pay Michigan Bell Telephone Company for the cost of relocating its utility lines. I do not believe that Michigan Bell had property taken for which compensation was required. Michigan Bell acquired the right to run its lines pursuant to MCLA 484.4; MSA 22.1414. It pays no taxes on this property, and it is difficult to understand of what compensable interest it is being deprived. If Michigan Bell does have a compensable property right, then it should be taxed pursuant to Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Michigan Bell has a right under Michigan law to recover all costs of doing business, plus a reasonable profit. The cost of relocation of its lines would be considered a cost of doing business. Hence, Michigan Bell will be able to recover these costs through its rate structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">I believe that MCLA 125.74(2) (e) (ii); MSA 5-.3504(2) (e) (ii), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201cThe plan shall designate the location, extent, character and estimated cost of the improvements contemplated for the area; and <em>may </em>include any or all of the following improvements * # # \u201d (emphasis added),</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">grants the municipality an option as to what area to include under the blighted area rehabilitation act. The City of Center Line chose not to include the relocation costs of Michigan Bell in its plan and, I believe, under the weight of authority it has the power to do this without paying compensation to Michigan Bell Telephone Company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b344-5\">Adams, J., concurred with Swainson, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\"> \u201cThe legislature shall provide for the assessment by the state of the property of those public service businesses assessed by the state at the date this constitution becomes effective, and of other property as designated by the legislature, and for the imposition and collection of taxes thereon.
