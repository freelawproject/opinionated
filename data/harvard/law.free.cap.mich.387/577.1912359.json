Plaintiffs filed an action in the Wayne Circuit Court based upon the dog-hite statute and common-law liability.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Trial proceeded before a jury, the Honorable Charles Kaufman presiding.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">At the conclusion of the circuit judge\u2019s charge to the jury, both counsel and the judge retired to his chambers accompanied by the court stenographer. A colloquy ensued regarding the charge to the jury, at the conclusion of which the record shows that the following was said:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>* * * I am satisfied what I gave is substantially the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">\u201cNow, would you gentlemen waive the administration of the oath to the sheriff?</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\"><em>\u201cMr. Barr [plaintiffs\u2019 </em>attorney] : I will waive administration of the oath and I will waive being present at the time the jury returns and would request that the jury be polled.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Mr. Mulcahy?</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\"><em>\u201cMr. Mulcahy [defendants\u2019 </em>attorney]: I will waive the sheriff\u2019s oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>What about \u2014 will you waive your presence at the verdict ?</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\"><em>\u201cMr. Mulcahy: </em>Yes, your Honor. I will stick around for a while. If I am not here, go ahead and take it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">The jury retired to commence its deliberations about 10:10 a. m. Approximately fifty minutes later, the jury returned to the courtroom presumably in the absence of counsel and the following took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Members of the jury, I saw your note in which you indicate you wish to hear the testimony of Mr. Smolinski. I would prefer not to read it back to you because of a number of reasons. First, I would rather not have the testimony of any one particular witness emphasized at this point. I mean you have to listen to the whole case and listen to all the testimony. Try to have your collective minds recall what Mr. Smolinski testified if you think that anything he testified is material. As I recall his testimony, he was not an eye-witness to the incident. He came in afterwards and I don\u2019t think that his testimony would put too much light on what actually happened when Mrs. Zaitzeff entered the house. However, if after your deliberations you still feel that you want his testimony read back, well, let me know and perhaps we can work it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>\u201cJuror Derro: </em>Could I say it off the record, the one point? The reason we want it is \u2014 it has nothing to do with the incident of the dog hut, rather, prior to that.

A poll of the jurors disclosed that the verdict was by a vote of ten to two.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">Plaintiffs filed a motion for new trial, which was denied. Therefore, plaintiffs appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion. 31 Mich App 87 (1971). We granted leave to appeal. The most succinct explanation of our object in reviewing this cause can be found in an intracourt memorandum by one of the Justices:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">\u201cI would grant leave. The trial judge entered the juryroom for whatever confab took place there; we know not what. That alone should result in a summary order for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">\u201cHow in h- can the defeated party \u2018prove prejudice\u2019 in such a case? He has had no invisible witness there, and the opportunity of and for concealed prejudice alone should be enough for a Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>which prates regularly its devotion to the sanctity of the right of trial by jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Plaintiffs concede that the reading to the jury of a portion of testimony given at the trial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. But plaintiffs argue here that the record is silent as to the portion of witness Smolinsld\u2019s testimony which was re-read to the jury. In further support of plaintiff Mary Zaitzeff\u2019s position, she points to the commentary to G-CB 1963, 512 in Michigan Court Buies Annotated, volume 2, p 493, where it was said:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\u201cAll communications between the trial judge and the jury, after submission of the case, must take place in open court and in the presence of, or after notice to, the parties or their counsel, and the court has no right, without the consent of counsel, to send to the jury room an answer to a question propounded in writing to him by the jurors. M.L.P. Trial \u00a7 306: and see, Donville v. Bussell, 1879, Howell, N.P. 8; Finkel v. Atto Misch Co., 1940, 291 Mich. 630, 289 N.W. 276; Hopkins v. Bishop, 1892, 91 Mich. 328, 51 N.W. 902.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Defendants on the other hand argue that the instant suit is controlled by the precedent to be found in the <em>Loose </em>v <em>Deerfield Twp, </em>187 Mich 206 (1915). Defendants quote from that opinion as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">\u201cAfter deliberating for a time, the jury came into court and indicated that there was some disagreement between them as to the testimony of certain witnesses who had testified upon the trial. Thereupon the court ordered the stenographer to read the testimony of two witnesses, after which the jury again retired to their room. <em>This action of the trial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>court is assigned as error, because it was done in the absence of defendant\u2019s counsel, and because certain other testimony should have been read in order to give them a correct understanding of the matter in doubt.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">The Court continuing, held:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">\u201cIt is sufficient to say of those objections that counsel was aware that the jury were deliberating, and they were also aware of the fact that such requests are not infrequently made by juries during their deliberations and granted. With this knowledge, <em>if they chose to absent themselves from the courtroom, they are in no position to complain of the trial court because he complied with the request of the jury, </em>nor because he omitted to have read certain other testimony in the record which would have thrown some light on the question about which inquiry was made.\u201d (Italics supplied by defendants.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The defendants further argue that the witness whose testimony was re-read to the jury was a witness called by the plaintiffs. Defendants point out that the testimony of Mr. Smolinski was helpful to the plaintiffs and that the re-reading of any portion of such testimony could only have been to the advantage of the plaintiffs. From this defendants argue that no prejudice to the plaintiffs\u2019 cause was shown by the procedure followed and here objected to. A close reading of the testimony of Mr. Smolinski bears out the defendants\u2019 argument. Even the cross-examination of Mr. Smolinski could hardly be called adverse or prejudicial to plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">\u201cCBOSS EXAMINATION BY MB. MULCAHY:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Just a couple things, Sergeant. May I examine from here, your Honor?</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>\u201cQ. </em>(By Mr. Mulcahy) You were parked in your car across the street from Mr. and Mrs. Raschke\u2019s home, is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, at a slight angle.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>By a slight angle you mean you weren\u2019t directly in front of her home?</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Not directly, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And you were parked on the opposite side of the street, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Would you have to look over your left shoulder to see the front of Mrs. Raschke\u2019s home?</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No. I just had to move my head.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Toward the left, is that it?</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What time of day was this?</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>This was in the afternoon. I don\u2019t know the exact time. Early afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And you indicated that Mrs. Zaitzeff stayed on the porch for about two minutes\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b660-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-17\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>\u2014 before she went into the house, is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b660-18\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-19\"><em>\u201cMr. Mulcahy: </em>I think that\u2019s all, Sergeant. Thank you very much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-21\">Based upon the record made and certified here, we cannot conclude that any prejudice resulted in the reading to the jury of a portion of the testimony of witness Smolinski. And if the events described had occurred in the courtroom the language quoted from <em>Loose </em>v <em>Deerfield Twp, </em>supra, would be directly in point and controlling without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-22\">However, the fact that the judge entered the juryroom in the company of the court stenographer and permitted the testimony to be re-read to the jury in the juryroom rather than in the courtroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>remains a troublesome point as the quoted intracourt memorandum discloses. My colleague seems to believe that the mere <em>place </em>of the reading makes error presumptive. The record does not support any assumption that the proceedings which took place in the juryroom were anything other than what ought to have taken place in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">The jurors were not engaged in their deliberations, they were in fact attending upon the court and listening to the reading of testimony in the presence of the court. No dark suspicions should be entertained by reason of the situs of these happenings. A familiarity with the demands upon courtroom space in Wayne County suggests reasons of convenience, for attending to this bit of business in the jury\u2019s room, rather than the courtroom, where other litigants may well have been gathered.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In my judgment, the difficulty here could best have been avoided had counsel remained in attendance. I see no reason to require a busy trial judge to duplicate his efforts as a means of sending a message to the trial bench. Rather let the word go forth to the Bar that the prevention of irregularities in the conduct of jury deliberations is in part the responsibility of lawyers. And where they voluntarily absent themselves from the courtroom they should not be heard to complain of informalities and shortcuts indulged in by a busy circuit judge in good faith which result in no prejudice to either party. I would affirm the decision of the trial judge and the Court of Appeals, with costs to the appellees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b661-6\">Adams, J., concurred with T. E.
