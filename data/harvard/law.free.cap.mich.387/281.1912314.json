No costs, a matter of public importance.</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-5\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Adams, T. G. Kavanagh, Swainson, and Williams, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<author id=\"b359-6\">Black, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7g\"><em>(for reversal). </em>According to the profession\u2019s moccasin telegraph, humming as it has been since the allegedly promissory Supreme Court campaign of 1970, the case at bar is due to result in still another order for overrulement of another long line of settled decisions this Court has handed down. Construing and applying 1961 CLS 242.1<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>; MSA 9.591, the mentioned decisions have resulted in what we know as the \u201ctwo-inch rule\u201d. For pro and con details, see <em>Harris </em>v <em>Detroit, </em>367 Mich 526 (1962), particularly the majority opinion of present Chief Justice Kavanagh. That opinion, which I endorsed, ended at 528 with these words:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u201cIt is to be noted that most.of these cases are unanimous opinions of this Court. Plaintiff would have us abolish this long-established rule of law without citing any reason or authority for the change in position. We find no reason for doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The facts giving rise to this section 242.1 action appear sufficiently in the opinion of Division 3 (30 Mich App 396). To them I would add that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>plaintiff failed to measure, photograph or otherwise preserve the then readily available evidence which might tend to establish her charge of failure on the part of the defendant city to maintain the sidewalk, at the place of her alleged injury, \u201cin reasonable repair, and in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Under the rule of <em>Perkins </em>v <em>Delaware Twp, </em>113 Mich 377, 379 (1897); <em>Brown </em>v <em>Detroit United Railway, </em>216 Mich 582, 585 (1921), and <em>Baldinger </em>v <em>Ann Arbor R Co, </em>372 Mich 685, 691 (1964), all followed in <em>Schedlbauer </em>v <em>Chris-Craft Corp, </em>381 Mich 217, 232 (1968), plaintiff failed to make out a submissible case of actionable negligence within the statute. See, in particular <em>Brown </em>v <em>Detroit United Rwy, supra, </em>at 584-586 and the requirement of measurement stated therein. To quote <em>Schedlbauer </em>at 231:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u201cIn every action for negligence it is the duty of the plaintiff to prove by the most accurate evidence that is reasonably available to him the particular defect or act or omission which to him was the cause of the injury for which he would recover. (See quotation, <em>post; Perkins </em>v <em>Delaware Twp).\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">I hold that plaintiff failed by proof, or permissible inference from proof, to establish negligence under the statute, and that her cause cannot be sustained excepting as authorized by that statute. The statute still includes the qualifier \u201creasonable,\u201d before \u201crepair\u201d. The next phrase included the qualifier \u201creasonably\u201d before \u201csafe and fit for travel\u201d and now includes that word before \u201csafe and convenient for public travel\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed with remand to circuit for entry of judgment upon the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-10\">T. E. Brennan, J., concurred with Black, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\"> The applicable wording of section 242.1 dates back to 1887 PA 264; 1897 CL 3441. Mrs. Buie\u2019s injury was sustained March 16, 1964, prior to the effective date of 1964 PA 170; MOLA 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102), which is the successor to section 242.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
