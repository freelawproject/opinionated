Woll. A formal complaint was filed on September 10, 1970, charging Woll with solicitation of workmen compensation cases through the use of touters or \u201crunners,\u201d particularly one David Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Hearing was held before Wayne County Hearing Panel No. 2 on November 3, 1970. Mr. Wood never personally appeared before the hearing panel because of poor health. He testified by deposition and, by stipulation of the parties, his deposition included two statements he had previously given. In the first statement, given to an investigator of the State Bar on March 6, 1970, he stated that defendant had paid him money for steering business to defendant. On the basis of this statement, the request for investigation was filed. Mr. Wood stated to the State Bar investigator that he had taken approximately ten people to defendant\u2019s office for processing of workmen\u2019s compensation claims and had been paid $10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>to $15 for each referral. The second statement was prepared by defendant and signed by Mr. Wood. At defendant\u2019s request, Mr. Wood went to defendant\u2019s office on April 17, 1970, and executed an affidavit in which he denied receiving any money for soliciting business for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In his deposition, taken October 22, 1970, Mr. Wood testified that he had taken several different people to Mr. Woll\u2019s office; that he (Wood) had borrowed money from Mr. Woll on several occasions and that the loans were paid from his (Wood\u2019s) workmen\u2019s compensation settlement check in April, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Defendant Woll was called as a witness pursuant to Rule 15.11 of the Procedure and Administrative Rules of the State Bar Grievance Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Woll testified that he had loaned Mr. Wood money on several occasions, all of which had been repaid out of the proceeds of Mr. Wood\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation settlement. In the course of his examination, the following occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\"><em>\u201cMr. Colombo [Member of Hearing Panel]: </em>And I want to direct a question to you in reference to Paragraph 4, Subparagraph A of that Complaint which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\u201c \u2018That the charges of misconduct against said respondent are as follows: A, soliciting professional employment through touters, and in particular to one David Woods, to whom respondent between April of 1968 through June of 1969 paid money to Mr. Woods to bring in new clients who had Workmen\u2019s Compensation claims.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Is that allegation true or false?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\"><em>\u201cMr. Woll: </em>I believe it\u2019s false, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\"><em>\u201cMr. Colombo: </em>May we have a\u2018yes\u2019or\u2018no\u2019?

Now, any person \u2014 I\u2019m not limiting to Mr. Woods\u2014 any person, to solicit law cases for you.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">\u201cDo you understand my question?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\"><em>\u201cMr. Woll: </em>I do, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\"><em>\u201cMr. Colombo: </em>What is your answer?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\"><em>\u201cMr. Woll: </em>I will not answer that question. I will take the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\"><em>\u201cMr. Colombo: </em>That\u2019s all.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-17\"><em>\u201cMr.Maiullo [Member of Hearing Panel]: </em>Would this reporter please go back and read Mr. Colombo\u2019s last question.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-18\">\u201c(Whereupon the reporter reads back the last question.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-19\"><em>\u201cMr. Hyman [Defendant\u2019s attorney]: </em>May I confer with my client? * * # [Recess]</p>\n<p id=\"b233-20\"><em>\u201cMr. Colombo: </em>The charge says \u2018soliciting professional employment through touters.\u2019 I am directing this question now to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-21\"><em>\u201cMr. Woll: </em>No.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-22\"><em>\u201cMr. Colombo: </em>Your answer is no?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-23\"><em>\u201cMr. Woll: </em>My answer is no. Might I clarify\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b233-24\"><em>\u201cMr. Hyman: </em>No.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>\u201cMr. Colombo: </em>\"Was there any doubt in your mind when you answered the other question and decided to take the Fifth Amendment?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\"><em>\u201cMr. Woll: </em>Yes, there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\"><em>\u201cMr. Colombo: </em>What was the doubt?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\"><em>\u201cMr. Woll: </em>I wasn\u2019t sure what the question was.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\"><em>\u201cMr. Colombo: </em>The question was pretty clear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">In closing arguments, counsel for the State Bar argued as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">\u201cThe other damaging piece of evidence against Mr. Woll goes to the general question propounded him by Mr. Colombo as to whether or not he had at any time and from anyone solicited clients \u2014 employed people or solicited clients. I put it to you that the question was quite clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">\u201cMr. Woll is a practitioner of some years; he knows as well as you gentlemen of the Panel know that if a question is unclear, that the witness has a perfect right to ask the examiner to rephrase the question. In this case Mr. Woll did not see fit to ask for such rephrasal but answered it categorically by taking what is known as the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\"><em>\u201cIn this type of proceeding we can be confident that the tahing of the Fifth Amendment at that time \u2014even though it was subsequently retracted by Mr. Woll </em>\u2014 and <em>I will point out to you gentlemen that there is something to </em>hide, <em>there was something to hide; and that was the reason why the answer was so given. </em>[Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">\u201cWe have nothing here but testing credibility, actually, who is telling the truth. We have to add inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">\u201cThe inferences can be added by the taking of the Fifth as an indication in this case, even though subsequently denied \u2014 after, I might add, a recess at which time he had an opportunity to confer with counsel and think over the matter of the answer he gave in the heat of cross examination, where, as you gentlemen know, the truth usually comes out.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>\u201cThis is something that you must consider very seriously in reaching a result.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The hearing panel found Woll guilty and on February 10, 1971, filed its Order for Discipline, suspending him from the practice of law for three months and requiring him to pay $278.95 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">On appeal to the full Grievance Board, counsel for the State Bar contended that it was proper to draw inferences of guilt from the fact that defendant availed himself of the right to avoid self-incrimination, thusly:</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u201cNow, regardless of what my brother says, and 1 respect and admire him, but I think he is wrong in this instance, and in fact I am pretty sure he is wrong. There is an obligation on the part of an attorney to testify in proceedings of this kind. The rules specifically say that he may be called as an adverse witness, the same as any other adverse witness, and his testimony taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u201cNow, Spevack versus Kline [sic] [385 US 511; 87 S Ct 625; 17 L Ed 2d 562 (1967)] goes only to one thing, an attorney may refuse to answer because of the fifth amendment as jeopardizing his rights under the fifth amendment. But once that attorney takes the stand, he has waived his rig\u2019ht to take the fifth amendment, particularly in a situation of this kind, where Mr. Woll had answered the question, I refuse to answer because of the fifth amendment, and then, after consultation with his attorney, then goes back and answers the question. That is a clear waiver of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">\u201cWe have a right to take that testimony and we have a right to draw inferences from that testimony and from the fact of his previous testimony of his taking the fifth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">\u201cNow, I submit, if the members please\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\"><em>\u201cThe Chairman: </em>May I interrupt you, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u201cWhat inference may you take from his taking the fifth amendment and then recanting and answering the question?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u201cWhat inference can the State Bar take?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\"><em>\u201cMr. Rosensweig: </em>I think the State Bar can take the inference that Mr. Woll was getting cases from Mr. Wood and was paying money for cases, because the question was specifically asked not only about Mr. Wood but the specific question is \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The State Bar Grievance Board affirmed Woll\u2019s conviction on June 18, 1971. He filed timely claim of appeal on June 30, 1971.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The problem we are dealing with is one of first impression in this state. Counsel for the State Bar Grievance Board contend that the case of <em>State Bar of Michigan </em>v <em>Block, </em>383 Mich 384 (1970), is controlling. We disagree. <em>Bloch </em>also involved the disbarment of an attorney from the practice of law. Block was called to testify at the disbarment hearing, pursuant to Rule 15. He objected to being called, but then answered all of the questions put to him and made no further objection. He contended on appeal that the procedure provided by Rule 15 violated his right against self-incrimination. Our Court held that Block was not coerced into answering the questions and, hence, his right against self-incrimination was not violated. Speaking for the Court, Justice Black stated (p 391):</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\u201cWe respond directly to the issue stated. There is no such fact or inference [of coercion]. Mr. Block took the oath voluntarily and answered all questions freely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">Justice Black further stated (p 392):</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u201cThere simply was no threat by the grievance committee, or anyone else acting for the State Bar, of loss by Mr. Block of his license to practice. Nor was the testimony given by him incriminatory, as in <em>Garrity </em>[v <em>New Jersey, </em>385 US 493; 87 S Ct 616; 17 LEd 2d 562 (1967)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">If Woll had contended in this Court, as his attorney did at the grievance hearing, that he should not have been required to answer any of the questions put to him, we would have the same situation our Court dealt with in <em>Block. </em>Mr. Woll, however, is not objecting to the provisions of Rule 15. Rather, he is objecting to the comments that were made before the Hearing Panel and the Grievance Board by counsel for the State Bar. Counsel for the State Bar contends it was proper to comment upon defendant\u2019s initial refusal to testify. Defendant contends it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Although it is not necessary to observe all of the rules of criminal law and procedure in a disbarment proceeding,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nevertheless our Court has long recognized that a disbarment proceeding is quasi-criminal in character. As this Court stated in <em>Matter of Hamilton Baluss, </em>28 Mich 507, 508 (1874):</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u201cWhile not strictly a criminal prosecution, it is of that nature, and the punishment, in prohibiting the party following his ordinary occupation, would be severe and highly penal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">See, also, <em>In re Clink, </em>117 Mich 619 (1898).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Thus, many of the safeguards afforded accused criminals contained in the United States Constitution have been made applicable to disbarment proceedings. In <em>Spevack </em>v <em>Klein, </em>385 US 511; 87 S Ct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>625; 17 L Ed 2d 574 (1967), the United States Supreme Court overruled <em>Cohen </em>v <em>Hurley, </em>366 US 117; 81 S Ct 954; 6 L Ed 2d 156 (1961), which held that the privilege against self-incrimination does not apply in a disbarment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In <em>SpevacJc, </em>the United States Supreme Court reversed a disbarment of a New York attorney who had failed to produce records demanded in a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>and who had refused to testify at the judicial inquiry. The Court stated (p 514):</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u201cAnd so the question emerges whether the principle of <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan </em>[378 US 1; 84 S Ct 1489; 12 L Ed 2d 653 (1964)] is inapplicable because petitioner is a member of the Bar. We conclude that <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Hurley </em>[366 US 117; 81 S Ct 954; 6 L Ed 2d 156 (1961)] should be overruled, that the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment has been absorbed in the Fourteenth, that it extends its protection to lawyers as well as to other individuals, and that it should not be watered down by imposing the dishonor of disbarment and the deprivation of a livelihood as a price for asserting it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The Court further said in <em>Spevack </em>(p 516):</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\u201cWe find no room in the privilege against self-incrimination for classifications of people so as to deny it to some and extend it to others. Lawyers are not excepted from the words \u2018No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\u2019; and we can imply no exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Thus, the privilege against self-incrimination granted by Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, and the US Const, Am V, do apply to defendant Woll in this disbarment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">The questions of comment by the prosecutor or the judge on the failure of a defendant to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>were answered by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Griffin </em>v <em>California, </em>380 US 609; 85 S Ct 1229; 14 L Ed 2d 106 (1965). In that case petitioner had been convicted of murder. He had refused to take the stand at that segment of the trial concerned with his guilt or innocence. The trial judge, based on art 1, \u00a7 13, of the California Constitution, instructed the jury that it could draw inferences on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify concerning matters within his knowledge. If he failed to explain or deny facts within his knowledge, it could be taken as evidence that those facts were true. The prosecutor also commented on defendants\u2019 failure to testify and implied that this failure indicated the truth of the assertions of the prosecutor. The Court stated (pp 613-614):</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u201cThe question remains whether, statute or not, the comment rule, approved by California, violates the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u201cWe think it does. It is in substance a rule of evidence that allows the State the privilege of tendering to the jury for its consideration the failure of the accused to testify. No formal offer of proof is made as in other situations; but the prosecutor\u2019s comment and the court\u2019s acquiescence are the equivalent of an offer of evidence and its acceptance. * # #</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u201cFor comment on the refusal to testify is a remnant of the \u2018inquisitorial system of criminal justice,\u2019 <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Waterfront Comm\u2019n, </em>378 U.S. 52, 55 [84 S Ct 1594; 12 L Ed 2d 678 (1964)], which the Fifth Amendment outlaws. It is a penalty imposed by courts for exercising a constitutional privilege. It cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The Court continued (p 615):</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u201cWe said in <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, supra, </em>[378 US 1; 84 S Ct 1489; 12 L Ed 2d 653 (1964) ] p. 11, that \u2018the same standards must determine whether an accused\u2019s silence in either a federal or state proceeding is justified.\u2019 We take that in its literal sense and hold that the Fifth Amendment, in its direct application to the Federal Government, and in its hearing on the States by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment, forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Thus, it is clear that a disbarment proceeding is a quasi-criminal proceeding <em>(Matter of Hamilton Baluss, </em>supra); that the privilege against self-incrimination does apply to such a proceeding' <em>(Spevack </em>v <em>Klein, </em>supra); and that comments made to a fact-finding body by a prosecutor concerning an accused\u2019s silence, are prohibited by the self-incrimination clause of the US Const, Am V, and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Counsel for the State Bar contends that if error was committed, it was merely harmless error. <em>Chapman </em>v <em>California, </em>386 US 18; 87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967). However, as the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Chapman </em>(pp 23-24), the prosecution must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that any error which occurred was harmless error. It has failed to meet its burden in this case. The evidence against defendant consisted of the statement given by one David- Wood to the State Bar investigator. This statement was later repudiated in an affidavit prepared by Mr. Woll and signed by Mr. Wood and, also, by deposition given by Mr. Wood while under oath. The only other evidence was the inference that counsel for the State Bar asked the Hearing Panel and the Grievance Board to draw by defendant\u2019s silence. Counsel for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>State Bar vigorously advocated that the Hearing Panel and the Grievance Board draw an inference of defendant\u2019s guilt by his initial silence on a question propounded by Mr. Colombo. While, as counsel for the State Bar points out, the Hearing Panel is made up of lawyers who should not he swayed by emotional arguments, the full Grievance Board does consist of two laymen<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> who may not be familiar with the extent of the privilege against self-incrimination. Moreover, counsel for the State Bar did argue to the Hearing Panel that they should take defendant\u2019s failure to answer as evidence of his guilt, and he cannot now assert that because they were lawyers they must have known that he was making an improper argument and, thus, disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Counsel for the State Bar further contends that because defendant later answered the question put to him, he waived any privilege afforded him under the Fifth Amendment. However, defendant\u2019s waiver only went to the fact that he agreed to answer all questions put to him and it, therefore, cannot now be argued that those questions and his answers were improper. Defendant did . not waive his Fifth Amendment rights by testifying under the provisions of Rule 15 and comments by counsel for the State Bar on his initial refusal to answer a specific question, based on the US Const, Am Y, were im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>proper. The comments made by counsel for the State Bar violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, and the US Const, Am V, and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The order of the Grievance Board is reversed. However we do not remand for a further hearing, the defendant having served the penalty of suspension under the Order for Discipline. Costs of this appeal to defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b242-7\">T.
