The information charged violation of those laws in three counts over a period from July 15, 1964, up to and including August 5, 1964. At arraignment on May 20, 1965, all defendants stood mute and not guilty pleas were entered for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">On August 5, 1964, a search warrant had issued for 5656 Lawton, Detroit. Numerous items of gambling and office paraphernalia, including a large quantity of mutuel tickets were seized. Motions to suppress evidence and quash the information on the basis that the warrant for 5656 Lawton and other warrants executed in the case were issued without probable cause, were filed on behalf of defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>and denied on January 4, 1966. Defendants were found guilty on October 12, 1966. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals-, that Court affirmed the convictions. (22 Mich App 410.) Defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal to this Court was granted. (384 Mich 792.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Leave was granted in this case primarily to reexamine the holdings of this Court in <em>People </em>v <em>Hobson, </em>369 Mich 189 (1963), and <em>People </em>v <em>Gorka, </em>381 Mich 515 (1969). The controlling opinion in <em>Hob-son, </em>written by Justice Dethmers, was joined in by \u2022Justices Kelly and Carr. Justice Black concurred in the result. Justice Souris wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justices T. M. Kavanagh and Otis Smith. The Dethmers\u2019 opinion affirmed the ruling of the trial court admitting into evidence various reports of police officers made over a period of time of their observations with regard to a gambling operation. As in this case, the officers made fragmentary notes each day. At the end of the day, a report was prepared from their notes and their memory of the day\u2019s events. The fragmentary notes made during the day were destroyed. The officers\u2019 reports were ruled to be admissible in evidence as past recollection recorded. The officers were called to testify and to be cross-examined as to the contents of the reports. Justice Souris\u2019 opinion contains a strenuous dissent on the grounds that defendants\u2019 constitutional right to confrontation and to effective cross-examination had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In <em>Gorha, </em>once again the situation was much the same as in <em>Hobson, </em>and as in this case. However, in <em>Gorha, </em>the reports were not admitted in evidence but were used to refresh the recollection of the police officers. This Court held that the reports prepared at the end of each day could be so used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>and that the destruction of the fragmentary notes made during the course of the day did not deprive defendants of effective means of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">In the present case, Officer Aldo Corso testified that he did not have any independent recollection as to any of the facts of his investigation and surveillance without referring to his notes. The prosecuting attorney, proceeding on the theory of <em>Hobson, </em>stated that he intended to offer the officer\u2019s reports into evidence. The court ruled them inadmissible, whereupon the following took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><em>\u201cMr. Sage \u2022[Assistant Prosecuting </em>Attorney]: Well, I would be glad to lay a further foundation as to whether or not we can refresh the witness\u2019s recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Well, refreshing it of course is a totally different thing. What the witness has indicated so far is that he has no independent recollection of the facts of this case without referring to his notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\"><em>\u201cMr. Sage: </em>That\u2019s true.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Now, I would think that if that were true, the next step is to refer to the notes to see if it does refresh his recollection and if it does then to testify and the evidence then is the testimony given by the witness, not the document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">A recess was taken by the Court to give Officer Corso an opportunity to read his report. He was then questioned by the assistant prosecutor as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>After having read it, does it refresh your recollection as to the events that occurred and the things which you observed on that day from 12 -.00 noon on?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Not in its entirety, no.\u201d # * #</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\"><em>\u201cQ. (By Mr. Sage): </em>In order to make these notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>which you indicated that you made, did you draw on just written memoranda or did you draw on something else?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I also drew from memory in my own mind, what I saw that particular day and fragmentary notes that I had written down.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>When did you write down or type up the notes in connection with your observations?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>When I wrote them down or when I typed them?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Well, let me ask you this: When did you type up the notes which you have there in your hand, People\u2019s Proposed Exhibit 1?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, I came into the office at 4:30 or 5:00, whatever time it might have been. I typed them immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>The same day you made the observations?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The same day, that\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Your express purpose in making these notes was to help prepare the case for court?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\"><em>\u201cMr. Sage: </em>I have no further questions. I might say that at this time I intend to use the notes which the officer has in his hand for the purpose that he might read them in as a past recorded recollection \u2014 past recollection recorded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">One of the attorneys for defendants objected, stating that he wished to see the original memoranda used by the officer to prepare his report in order to compare them with the report the prosecutor was offering in evidence. Thereupon the court took over as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-17\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>I doubt that we need to get to the original memoranda or whatever you want to call the fragmentary notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-18\"><em>\u201cMr. Massey [attorney for defendants\\: </em>I think that the\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Excuse me. The witness has indicated that by looking at those observations they do refresh his recollection as to these events but not in their entirety. In other words, I gather he could testify in substance as to what his observations were by looking at that document and refreshing his recollection. There would be I take it certain details of the observation that would not be refreshed by looking at this memoranda and as to those he really wouldn\u2019t be refreshed in his recollection; is that correct, witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>That\u2019s correct, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>In other words, I take it that if you read over your observations on the days in question, that yon could probably put down the memorandum in substance as to what you saw; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>You might not remember a license plate or an exact time o\u00ed color of dress of a person, that type of thing, but I take it that you would remember that on this day yon followed Mary Doe No. 1 and saw her go into certain addresses and remain a few minutes and come out; is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir, that\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Well, as I understand the witness\u2019s position, he doesn\u2019t need the document. Let me put it this way: There is no necessity to put the document in evidence because the witness could testify to substantially what happened based upon refreshing his recollection. When you talk about refreshing recollection, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have the original document or copy of the document or a picture, a record. Anything that refreshes a witness\u2019s recollection may be used to refresh that recollection because it is not the picture or the document or the note or the paper that is the evidence but rather the testimony of the witness based upon a refreshed recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\u201cSo in view of that, it seems to me we don\u2019t need to go into the question were there fragmentary or original notes destroyed or why they were destroyed. If the document is the evidence and is admitted as evidence under the past recollection recorded rule\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\"><em>\u201cMr. MacLecm [attorney for defendants]: </em>Now, your Honor, I think that the rule of evidence \u2014 the original document is the best evidence. This is something that just happened. This man testified he has been here for years and been through other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Mr. MacLean, I don\u2019t think \u2014 either I am not making my position clear or you don\u2019t follow it. The original document is pertinent perhaps when you\u2019re speaking possibly of the best evidence hut that deals with documentary evidence. When you speak of best evidence you are talking about a document that is the evidence. Now, in this case, the document is not the evidence. It is the testimony, the verbal testimony of this witness that is the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">As a result of the court\u2019s ruling, the police officers were permitted to testify from their reports on the basis that their recollection had been refreshed. A few samples of the testimony of the police officers follow. The first excerpts are from the testimony of Officer Corso.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And can you recall what your first observation was that day without refreshing your recollection or do you have to refresh your recollection?</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>As I stated before, I have to testify accurately and honestly. I would have to refer to my notes to give you the correct times, the correct type vehicle, the correct license number, and so on.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>All right. And would you please look at your first day\u2019s notes on your first day\u2019s observation to see if you can refresh your recollection?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>\u201cA. </em>As I stated earlier, I was in position at 12:00 noon in the vicinity of Blaine and Dexter. I was observing a 1956 Chevrolet, license number Adam Lincoln 3503. At 12:30 P.M., I observed a lady later identified as Janie Cade enter the Chevrolet, Adam Lincoln 3503 and she drove away. At this time I followed. \u00abU\u00bb \u00aby. \u00abU, \u2022JF tF tF</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What was the next day and date of your observations ?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Monday, July the 20th, 1964. And at 11:30 P.M. I took up\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Excuse me. I don?t like to interrupt but evidently I\u2019m not getting my point across here to the witness or to counsel. It appears to me and I could be incorrect but it appears to me that the witness is simply reading verbatim from this document. Is that what you\u2019re doing, witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Not verbatim, your Honor, but almost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Sgt. William Hart\u2019s difficulty in recalling what happened can be seen from the following short excerpt from his testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And after you arrived there, what did you observe? Now, \u2014 exhausting your memory as to what you recall without refreshing your recollection. Do you recall?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Not accurately without reading what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>All right. Would you care to read it to see whether or not it refreshes your recollection?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir, I will. At 2:40 on that date while in the Dairy Bar I observed Iziac Rucker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">Later on in the testimony by Sgt. Hart, the following occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-16\"><em>\u201cMr. Massey: </em>Your Honor, I would like to indicate that the man is reading from the book. He has it up there and is looking right at it.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Are you. reading, witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir, I\u2019m reading as I go so I won\u2019t get \u2014this is a little involved, this particular thing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Well\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I can tell it in my own words.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>That is exactly what we want you to do, tell it in your own words ?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>All right, sir. After Mr. Reginald Jones parked, Mr. William Jones then went to Mr. Reginald Jones\u2019 car where he gave him a brown paper bag and contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\"><em>\u201cQ. (Mr. Sage): </em>All right. Then what happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>After that entry, Mr. Reginald Jones left and went to the grocery store, Tip Top Grocery store.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Then what happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>After that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\"><em>\u201cMr. Massey: </em>He\u2019s reading again, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-16\"><em>\u201cMr. Sage: </em>I think he\u2019s entitled-\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b268-17\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>He isn\u2019t reading because there is nothing being said. He is referring to the document and I assume it is to refresh his recollection which is perfectly permissible. If you have done that, witness, you may put it aside and testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-18\">Upon cross-examination, Sgt. Hart testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-19\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I was observing the vicinity of Roosevelt and McGraw at that time. Now, you mean where specifically I was standing or sitting or\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b268-20\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Well, who did you see at that time ?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-21\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, I saw the people I described.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-22\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>I mean what people?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-23\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I couldn\u2019t tell you, sir. That\u2019s been two years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-24\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>I mean to say you looked at your book just a little while ago ?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-25\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I refreshed my memory as to that time, yes, sir, as to when I was testifying and in order to give you an accurate answer I would have to refer to them again. Then I could tell you perhaps.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>\u201cQ. </em>In other words, you cannot do that as to any of these times, can you?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Not independently without referring to my notes, no, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Richard Y. Smith, who was with the Detroit Police Department in 1964, and who testified for the people, likewise had difficulty in remembering the events in question. A sample of his testimony follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What was your next observation using your notes wherever necessary?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>At 1:29 PM, she parked on 30th Street near McGraw. She entered a house, 4547 McGraw. Approximately 6 minutes she was back to the car and she drove away and I continued to follow her. 1:38, she parked on 28th Street and she walked from my view. She was back to the car in 3 minutes and drove away and I continued to follow her. At 1:48 I saw her park on West Grand Blvd. near Milford and she walked to and entered several houses on the east side of the street, returning to the car at 2:30 P.M., driving away, and I continued to follow. 2:32 P.M. she parked on Vinewood near Scovel and she walked from my view and I noticed at 2:38 she returned to her car and drove away and I continued to follow. 2:52 PM, she parked on Roosevelt south of McGraw and she walked from my view. She was back to the car\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Are you reading those, witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Part of it, sir. Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\"><em>Hobson, Gorka, </em>and the present case present two troublesome and continuing problems. The first is the question of the destruction of the fragmentary notes made by the police officers while making their observations. The second is the correct way to treat the reports prepared at the end of each day by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>officers from, their fragmentary notes and from their memory of the day\u2019s events.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">We have searched the record in this case in vain for a satisfactory explanation as to why the fragmentary notes made each day by the police officers must be destroyed. We have been unable to find one.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We conclude that if the reports of the officers prepared at the end of a day\u2019s work are to be allowed in evidence, they must be accompanied by the fragmentary notes from which each report was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>prepared. Only in this fashion will it be possible for counsel for a defendant to proceed with a meaningful cross-examination of the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The record in this case amply demonstrates the fact that in a matter of this kind, where there have been a myriad of observations over days or weeks and where there has also been a considerable lapse of time between when those observations were made and the officers are called upon to testify, it is practically pure fiction to assume that the officer has had his recollection refreshed by the notes and is able to testify as if he had a present recollection of the many details contained in the notes. It is perfectly understandable that during surveillance a police officer may be obliged to take only fragmentary notes of what he observes and, consequently, that he should, at the end of each day, prepare from those notes and his memory a coherent, detailed narrative of the day\u2019s events. What is not understandable is why the fragmentary notes should he destroyed for so-called security reasons. We conclude that the fragmentary notes and the report should he treated as a single record of the events of the day. Neither is complete without the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The proper procedure to he followed in future cases will be to call the officer for such testimony as he is able to give from his present recollection. The judge may permit him to refer to the notes to refresh his recollection. <em>Merrill </em>v <em>Leisenring, </em>166 Mich 219, 227 (1911); <em>People </em>v <em>Johnson, </em>215 Mich 221 (1921); 2 Gillespie, Michigan Criminal Law <em>So </em>Procedure (2d ed), \u00a7 598, p 775. If his recollection cannot be refreshed, the fragmentary notes and the reports prepared on a day-to-day basis may he offered in evidence in the usual fashion as past recollection recorded. Before they are received, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>should he fully authenticated by the police officer, with opposing counsel afforded an opportunity to cross-examine as to authenticity. If the notes and reports are received in evidence, the defense should he given an opportunity for full cross-examination with regard to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">On August 5,1964, Officer Aldo Corso executed an affidavit for a search warrant for 5656 Lawton, Detroit. This affidavit (reproduced as an Appendix to this opinion) consists of a one-page printed form with various insertions typed in and three typewritten pages setting forth observations of the officer. It will be noted that the printed form states that the officer has probable cause to believe that the premises for which the warrant was sought are used as and for a common gaming house. The basis for probable cause is stated in the printed form to be the fact that the officer is thoroughly familiar with all the methods and manners in which a mutuel numbers gambling enterprise is operated. The printed form also states that certain persons had been identified to the officer either by name or by description as participating in the operation of a mutuels gambling business. How this information was obtained by the officer or the reliability of the same is not stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The typewritten portion of the affidavit following the printed form details the observations of the officer with regard to various persons seen by him entering and leaving various premises. The only statements by the officer with regard to the activities of these persons, other than the fact that he saw them enter and leave various premises, are: \u201cdeponent saw him carrying a brown paper bag\u201d; \u201che got out of the car carrying a large paper hag, and walk to and enter 5656 Lawton\u201d; \u201cdeponent saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Mary Doe No. 2 walk from the east carrying a large handbag and enter 5656 Lawton\u201d; \u201che got out of the car carrying a package under his arm and entered 5656 Lawton\u201d; \u201cHe got out of the car carrying a package under his right arm and entered 5656 Law-ton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The officer then concludes \u201cthat from his observations of the people, packages and parcels in the manner described, and the use of the automobiles hereinbefore mentioned, that the persons aforementioned, whose names are unknown but whose persons are well known, have conspired to violate the gambling laws of the State of Michigan, and that they are operating an unlawful gambling enterprise and that the premises are used to collect, store and conceal memoranda of bets and other gambling paraphernalia * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The use of a printed form was condemned by this Court in <em>I% the Matter of Sarah Way, </em>41 Mich 299, 301 (1879).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In the case of <em>People </em>v <em>Effelberg, </em>220 Mich 528 (1922), an affidavit with striking similarity to the one in this case was considered by Justice Clark, writing for the whole Court. He states (p 531):</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u201cRejecting the parts of the complaint avowedly stated on information and belief, there remain the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\u201c \u2018Which said premises are occupied by one George Effelberg as a public place where liquors are manufactured and furnished and possessed. * # *</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">\u201c Wine, whisky, etc., * * * are being manufactured and possessed for the purpose of being sold, furnished or given away as a beverage, contrary to the provisions of Act No. 338 of the Public Acts of the State of Michigan for the year 1917, as amended. \u25a0y. TP * \u00cdP</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201c \u2018Numerous persons frequent the said building at various times of night and daytime unlawfully. # # #</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u201c \u2018That intoxicating liquors are sold there and given away unlawfully.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\u201cIn each of the statements just above quoted, the affiant attempts to find and determine the ultimate fact that a violation of the law had been committed. It was not for him but for the magistrate to determine whether there was probable cause to justify issuing the search warrant. His statements are his conclusions and have no more force than if expressly stated on information and belief. Affiant should have stated to the magistrate on oath or affirmation the facts and circumstances, if any were known to him, which induced the beliefs and the conclusions stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">See, also, <em>People </em>v <em>Knopka, </em>220 Mich 540 (1922). The requirement for a search warrant is stated as follows by this Court in <em>People </em>v <em>Fons, </em>223 Mich 603, 606 (1923):</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">\u201cThe warrant does not issue from the mere fact of the filing of an affidavit, but from the finding of good cause based on legal evidence. The law contemplates a showing before a magistrate, such a showing as satisfies him that a crime has been committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">In <em>People </em>v <em>Moten, </em>233 Mich 169, 171 (1925), this Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">\u201cIt is settled law in this jurisdiction and generally elsewhere that an affidavit for a search warrant made only on information and belief is insufficient to move the judicial discretion of the issuing officer. It must also contain, as distinguished from mere conclusions or belief, known material facts directly stated as affiant\u2019s grounds for such belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">2 Gillespie, Michigan Criminal Law &amp; Procedure (2d ed), \u00a7 868, p 1129, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u201cThe affidavit must contain facts within the knowledge of the affiant, as distinguished from mere conclusions or belief. An affidavit made on information and belief is not sufficient. The affidavit should clearly set forth the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the person making it, which constitute the grounds of the application. The facts should be stated by distinct averments, and must be such as in law would make out a cause of complaint. <em>It is not for the affiant to draw his own inferences. He must state matters which justify the drawing of them.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">In view of the fact that the affidavit in this case clearly does not meet the requirements for the issuance of a search warrant under the Michigan Constitution and holdings of this Court with regard to the same, it is scarcely necessary to consider Federal requirements also controlling upon the states under the Fourteenth Amendment. It is sufficient to note that in <em>Spinelli </em>v <em>United </em>States, 393 US 410; 89 S Ct 584; 21 L Ed 2d 637 (1969), the affidavit was found to be insufficient for failure to give information why the informant could be found to be reliable and because the FBI surveillance did not independently suggest criminal conduct. In that case, it was held that various trips to and from an apartment and the fact that it was shown to have two telephones were insufficient facts to ripen into a judgment that a crime was probably being committed. As Justice White, in his concurring opinion, stated (p 423):</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u201cBut if the officer simply avers, without more, that there is gambling paraphernalia on certain premises, the warrant should not issue, even though the belief of the officer is an honest one, as evidenced by his oath, and even though the magistrate knows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>him to be an experienced, intelligent officer who has been reliable in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The search warrant should have been suppressed. Other issues raised by defendants upon this appeal need not be considered in view of our disposition of this case. The convictions of defendants are vacated and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-5\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Black, T. E. Brennan, T. O.

But my Brother Adams properly observed \u201cHow this information was obtained by the officer or the reliability of the same is not stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Likewise such connector could be the purchase of a \u201cnumbers ticket\u201d or any similar evidence of sale or traffic at any of the many stops so minutely described.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
