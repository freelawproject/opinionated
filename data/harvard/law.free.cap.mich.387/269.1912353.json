Kelley, </em>Attorney General, <em>Robert A. Derengoski, </em>Solicitor General, <em>William L. Gahalan, </em>Prosecuting Attorney, <em>Dominick R.

Groat in Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court to the offense of assault with intent to rob being armed on December 22, 1965. She was sentenced to 3 years\u2019 probation with the first 90 days to be served in the Detroit House of Correction. After violating her probation, the defendant was sentenced in July of 1968 to serve 2 to 20 years in prison. Her motion to vacate plea of guilty was denied by Judge Thomas L. Poindexter of Recorder\u2019s Court on September 26, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The Court of Appeals remanded this case to the trial court with instructions. <em>People </em>v <em>Carlisle, </em>19 Mich App 680 (1969). The Court of Appeals held that a factual basis is necessary for the acceptance of a guilty plea. The only evident factual basis for the defendant\u2019s guilty plea is her confession which was admitted into evidence at the preliminary hearing. The defendant alleged that the confession was involuntarily given. The Court of Appeals therefore remanded the case to Recorder\u2019s Court for a <em>Walker </em>hearing <em>(People </em>v <em>Walker </em>[On Rehearing], 374 Mich 331 [1965]) to' determine the legality of the obtaining of the confession. Prior to the remand, we granted the people\u2019s application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The people contend that it is not necessary that the trial court establish a factual basis for a defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ant\u2019s guilty plea before accepting it. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">In <em>People </em>v <em>Barrows, </em>358 Mich 267 (1959) this Court recognized the necessity on the part of the trial judge to establish a factual basis prior to the acceptance of a plea of guilty. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice George Edwards stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u201cThe direct questioning of a defendant by the trial judge on plea of guilty is required by the rule [Court Bule No 35A (1945)] for the purpose of establishing the crime and the participation therein of the person pleading guilty.\u201d 358 Mich 267, 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We reaffirm our holding in <em>Barrows. </em>No plea of guilty should be accepted by a trial judge until facts sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt have been set out in the record. Preferably, these facts should be brought forth through a direct examination of the accused by the trial judge at the time the plea of guilty is accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In the instant case, the trial court did not establish a factual basis for the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty at the time such plea was accepted. The portion of the record of the plea proceeding set out below makes this clear:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Is there any question in your mind about it? If there is, tell this Court right now. The Court wants to know. We don\u2019t want anybody to plead guilty unless they are guilty of this crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I did drive the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>I beg your pardon?</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I did drive the man to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>I didn\u2019t ask you what the facts were. You know what happened. I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t heard the facts in this case. You know whether you\u2019re guilty or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>GrCR 1963, 785.3(2) requires that the court make an examination \u201c # * * to ascertain that the plea was freely, <em>understcmdingly </em>and voluntarily made * * * .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The trial court cannot ascertain that the accused \u201cunderstanding'ly\u201d pled guilty unless the trial court knew what the defendant thought her crime was, otherwise the defendant might plead guilty to something that was not a crime at all \u2014 and that would he the height of lack of understanding. See <em>People </em>v <em>Merhige, </em>212 Mich 601 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Unfortunately, because of lack of clear precedent perhaps, in the case at bar the trial judge was confused as to who should know what. He told the defendant \u201cYou know what happened\u201d and \u201cYou know whether you\u2019re guilty or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The court rule, however, requires that the <em>trial court </em>should \u201cknow what happened\u201d so that the <em>trial court </em>would know whether the defendant was \u201cguilty or not\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The trial court here honestly confessed its ignorance and its determination to remain in ignorance. \u201cYou know what happened. I don\u2019t know.\u201d When the defendant tried to tell the trial court what the trial court should have been trying to ascertain, the trial court responded \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you what the facts were * * * I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t heard the facts in this case * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Under these circumstances, there is only one thing to do \u2014 reverse, vacate the plea of guilty and order the trial court to proceed thereafter as appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The defendant\u2019s confession was obtained by a detective without counsel present after the defendant had stated to the assistant prosecuting attorney a few hours before that she did not want to talk, and asked \u201cIf I want a lawyer what do I do?\u201d <em>People </em>v <em>Carlisle, </em>19 Mich App 680, 684 (1969). We need not consider the admissibility of such a confession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the trial court on the record accepted the plea without knowledge of these facts, the confession cannot serve to establish a factual basis for the acceptance of defendant\u2019s plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Though this issue was not raised by the appellee, a trial judge accepting a plea of guilty must adequately advise the defendant of the nature of the accusation against him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record of the plea proceedings in the instant case fails to reveal that defendant was advised of anything further than the name of the offense to which she was pleading guilty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Since the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty was accepted prior to the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Boykin </em>v <em>Alabama, </em>395 US 238; 89 S Ct 1709; 23 L Ed 2d 274 (1969), we do not hold the plea proceedings before us today to the more stringent standards enunciated in <em>Boykin. </em>For our holding that <em>Boykin </em>will not be applied retroactively, see <em>People </em>v <em>Butler, </em>387 Mich 1 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Reversed, plea of guilty vacated, and remanded to the trial court to proceed as appropriate.</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-7\">T.

Is that correct ?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\"><em>A. </em>Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\"><em>Q. </em>And he advised the Court that you wish to plead guilty to that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\"><em>A. </em>Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>Q. </em>Now, did anyone threaten you if you did not plead guilty?</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><em>A. </em>No.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><em>Q. </em>Did anyone offer you any reward or inducement if you do plead guilty?</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\"><em>A. </em>No, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\"><em>Q. </em>Guilty of assault with intent to rob being armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\"><em>A. </em>No, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\"><em>Q. </em>This plea of guilty to the crime of assault with intent to rob being armed is of your own wish and will and free and voluntary on your part. Is that correct,?</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\"><em>A. </em>Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\"><em>Q. </em>You plead guilty to this offense of assault with intent to rob being armed that occurred on the 30th day of July, 1965 when you did assault with intent to rob being armed one Joseph Wasyl. Is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\"><em>A. </em>Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\"><em>Q. </em>Now, you\u2019ve discussed this matter with your Attorney about your right to a trial by jury, which you have that right, until the Court accepts your plea. Until the Court accepts your plea you have that right. You can change your mind. I don\u2019t want anybody to plead guilty in this Court unless they are guilty. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\"><em>A. </em>Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\"><em>Q. </em>And you understand that you have that right to a trial by jury or that you can waive that and be tried by a Judge who resolves the question of law and fact. The findings of the judge alone by himself or you can have a jury trial. It\u2019s your prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\"><em>Mr. Ward [attorney for </em>defendant]: Do you understand?</p>\n<p id=\"b353-17\"><em>Defendant Carlisle: </em>Yes, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\"><em>The Court: </em>It\u2019s the law of the State of Michigan and all the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-19\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-20\"><em>Q. </em>Now, you plead guilty to this charge of assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>with intent to rob being armed because you are guilty of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><em>A. </em>Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\"><em>Q. </em>Is there any question in your mind about it? If there is, tell this Court right now. The Court wants to know. We don\u2019t want anybody to plead guilty unless they are guilty of this crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\"><em>A. </em>I did drive the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\"><em>Q. </em>I beg your pardon?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\"><em>A. </em>I did drive the man to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\"><em>Q. </em>I didn\u2019t ask you what the facts were. You know what happened. I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t heard the facts in this case. You know whether you\u2019re guilty or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\"><em>A. </em>Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\"><em>Q. </em>If you\u2019re not guilty say so. If you are guilty of this crime of assault with intent to rob that is strictly up to you and nobody else.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\"><em>A. </em>I am, guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\"><em>Q. </em>You are guilty of the crime of assault with intent to rob being armed.

And if you wish to change your mind now you\u2019re entitled to a trial; and if you want the Court to accept your plea of guilty to this crime of assault with intent to rob being armed that is strictly up to you. Up to now you have said you wanted the Court to accept your plea of guilty to this crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-20\"><em>A. </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-21\"><em>Q. </em>And you understand \u2014 I want to go over this again. You understand that you have this right. It\u2019s every citizen\u2019s right to have a trial by jury. Or you can waive that and he tried by the Court. Do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>you understand that? I want you to fully understand it.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><em>A. </em>Yes, your Honor.

You want the Court to accept your plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\"><em>A. </em>Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\"><em>The Court: </em>Very well, the Court will accept the plea of guilty of the crime of assault with intent to rob being armed. I\u2019ll refer this matter to the Probation Department and Psychiatric Clinic with a report on \u2014 any particular date?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\"><em>Mr. Ward: </em>No. Could your Honor make it any time after the 11th of January?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\"><em>The Court: </em>The 12th?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\"><em>Mr. Ward: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> The necessity of such examination of the defendant by the trial judge is evident from the surprises it often turns up. See, for instance, the record of a guilty plea proceeding in another case recently decided by this Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">\u201cLet me see if you are really guilty of anything.

E. Brennan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATE\"><em>(dissenting). </em>I respectfully dissent from the Opinion of my learned Brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-16\">First, I do not agree with the conclusion that the trial judge eschewed knowledge of the factual basis for the plea. The trial judge asked the defendant if she had assaulted Joseph Wasyl on the 30th day of July, 1965, with the intent to rob him, being armed. The defendant answered in the affirmative. The later colloquy in which the defendant made reference to driving an automobile, prompting the trial judge to remark that he had not heard the facts in the ease, did not, in my judgment, demonstrate any failure on the part of the trial judge to ascertain that there was a factual basis for the plea. I do not believe it is necessary for the trial judge to elicit a detailed recital of an accused\u2019s actions in order to satisfy our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>rule <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> or to accept the plea in good conscience. It is sufficient, in my judgment, that the accused admit of his having committed the offense. This can he done in the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Second, I must respectfully disagree with my Brother and the Court of Appeals on the question of the need for remand where it is claimed that a guilty plea stems from an inadmissible confession. For myself, I subscribe to the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>McCann </em>v <em>Richardson, </em>397 US 759; 90 S Ct 1441; 25 L Ed 763 (1970):</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u201cHis later petition for collateral relief asserting that a <em>coerced </em>confession induced his plea is at most a claim that the admissibility of his confession was mistakenly assessed and that since he was erroneously advised, either under the then applicable law or under the law later announced, his plea was an unintelligent and voidable act. The Constitution, however, does not render pleas of guilty so vulnerable.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The third issue treated by my Brother is an issue admittedly not raised in these proceedings. My views on that issue are expressed in my dissent in <em>People </em>v <em>Jaworski, </em>387 Mich 21 (1972).</p>\n<judges id=\"b356-9\">Black, J., concurred with T. E.
