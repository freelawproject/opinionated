It was uncontested that deceased was involved in at least one fight and that he had previously purchased a gun. If the deceased had the gun, the trial testimony would have backed up the defense theory that the deceased shot himself. To show that he would be likely to draw a gun in a fight would not combat the testimony that defendant had the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">I agree with the ruling of the trial judge that no foundation was laid for the introduction of testimony pertaining to the deceased\u2019s character and consequently vote to affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b471-9\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. G. Kavanagh, Swainson, and Wiliams, JJ., concurred with Adams, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b472-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Black, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdO\"><em>(for affirmance). </em>Nothing submitted on review of this case, either in the briefs or by the factually uncertain oral arguments of respective counsel, persuades me that trial judge George W. Crockett, Jr., and in turn the assigned panel of the Court of Appeals (30 Mich App 102), erred in deciding as they did the two questions that were raised below and brought here.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">I adopt the cited opinion of Division 1 and vote to affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b472-7\">T.
