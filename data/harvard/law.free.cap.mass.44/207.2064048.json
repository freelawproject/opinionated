That note and mortgage, together with' other property, were assigned to Selden Braynard, who assigned the same, on the 1st of September 1826, to the demandant and John B. Yates, then partners transacting business in New York, as collateral security for a note of about $ 12,000 due to said Yates and M\u2018Intyre from said Braynard, which has never been paid. That note was given in part for the price of lottery tickets sold and delivered in New York by the said Yates &amp; M\u2018Intyre to said Braynard, then an inhabitant of Boston, and in part for money received of them by him. A part of said tickets were sold by said Braynard in Massachusetts, a part in Maine, and a part in New Hampshire ; and at the time when they were sold to Braynard, Yates &amp; M\u2018Intyre knew that he intended to sell them in those States, as well as elsewhere.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-9\">Said John B. Yates died in 1836, and on the 3d of May 1840, the demandant commenced this suit, as surviving partner of the firm ; the tenants then, and ever since, being in the adverse occupation of the demanded premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-10\">The tenants claim under a subsequent deed from said Braynard, made to the tenant Parks, and taken with a knowledge, by both tenants, of the prior assignment by Braynard to Yates and Mc In tyre. Part of the consideration of said deed, from Braynard to Parks, was the price of lottery tickets sold in Bostoc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>by Parks to Braynard ; and part was money advanced by Parks to Braynard for the purpose of running expresses from Delaware to Boston, with the numbers of the drawings of Delaware lotteries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-5\">It was agreed, at the argument, that the lottery tickets, mentioned in the foregoing statement, were in lotteries not authorized by law in this Commonwealth. It was also agreed that the deposition of said Braynard, which was taken in the cause, might be referred to by either party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-6\">The tenants were to be defaulted, or judgment to be rendered for them, as the court should direct.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-7\"><em>Peabody, </em>for the demandant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApZ\">Though the sale of the tickets would have been illegal, and would not have been a good consideration for the note which the mortgage was assigned to secure, if the sale had been made in this Commonwealth ; yet as it was made in New York, where it was valid, it was binding upon the party here. ' In <em>Pellecat </em>v. Angell, 2 Crompt. Mees. &amp; Rosc. 313, Lord Abinger says, \u201c it has never been said that merely selling to a party who means to violate the laws of his own country is a bad contract.\u201d See also <em>Holman </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>Cowp. 341. <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>6 Mass. 358. <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 296.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-8\"><em>G. Minot, </em>for the tenants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGC\">It appears from Braynard\u2019s deposition that part of the tickets for which (among other things) the $ 12,000 note was given, were bought by letter sent by him from Boston to New York. This was a contract in Boston ; and if so, it was clearly void for illegality. Where part of the consideration of an entire contract is unlawful, it vitiates the whole contract. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Gillmore, </em>3 Taunt. 226. <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Whitcher, </em>5 N. Hamp. 196.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-9\">As the demandant knew that Braynard bought the tickets for the purpose of selling them in violation of the law of this Commonwealth, it is submitted that the contract of sale, though made in New York, does not furnish a ground of action here. See Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws (2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7251-257, and <em>notes.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b216-10\">Wilde, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ\">The demandant\u2019s title is derived from a mortgage given by Andrew Wait, which was legally assigned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Selden Braynard, and by him assigned to the demandant and his partner since deceased. The tenants object to the legality of the assignment to the demandant and his partner, on the ground that the consideration was lottery tickets, the sale of which was prohibited in this Commonwealth. But it appears by the deposition to which the parties have referred, that the contract was made in the State of New York, and was by the laws of that State a valid contract. It is no legal objection to the validity of the contract, that the demandant, when the lottery tickets were sold to Braynard, knew that he intended to sell them, or part of them, in this Commonwealth. The case of <em>Holman </em>v. Johnson, Cowp. 341, cited by the counsel for the demandant, and other cases, are clear and decisive on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Nor is it of any consequence that the proposal of Braynard to purchase the lottery tickets was made by a letter dated at Boston. It was the assent to the sale, which completed the contract. The tickets were sold and delivered in New York, as appears by the statement of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\n<em>Tenants defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
