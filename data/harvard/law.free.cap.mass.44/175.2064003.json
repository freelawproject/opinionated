Jonathan Hunt, aged 81 years, who testified, that he was the son of Nathaniel Hunt, who was the brother of John Hunt, that he lived in the immediate vicinity, on the next farm, at his father, Nathaniel Hunt\u2019s, and knew the said Paul, Israel, and Ebenezer, when they were boys ; that as early as he could remember, his uncle John lived on the farm, with his wife and the boys, and that he lived there until he died ; that sometimes he was insane and sometimes regular ; that at the times when he was well, he carried on the farm, and saw to the business himself, and managed well. His children were most of the time at home, and when under age they worked on the farm. When he was not regular, his wife took care of the farm. His son Ebenezer went to Ackworth when he was young, bought a farm there, and stayed two or three years, and then returned. The father remaiaed on his own farm, and Israel (the demandant) took care of it whilst Ebenezer was gone. Paul Hunt was there several years, but the witness did not know that he saw him .here after Ebenezer came back from Ackworth. Ebenezer mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>ried soon after he returned, viz. in 1796. Lydia Hunt, the daughter, married Sawteli about the year 1798. Israel (the demandant) was married about 1794, and lived in Dracut, and then in Nashua. After Ebenezer returned, he had the principal management of the farm. The father occasionally did some work, but was often insane and incapable of doing business. Ebenezer remained on the farm after his father died, until his own death. The witness believed that Israel (the demandant) remained on the farm sometime after Ebenezer came back, and that they lived there together.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\">2. Betsey Bailey, aged 72 years, deposed, that she was the daughter of the said Nathaniel Hunt, and lived in the house next to the demanded premises ; that John Hunt lived on tbe farm until his death ; that \u201c they carried on the farm amongst them ; that is, when John Hunt was unable to work, his wife and chil dren carried it on that after Ebenezer Hunt came there, they used to-eat together as one family ; that from her earliest recollection, her uncle John Hunt was most of the time insane ; that Ebenezer Hunt was twice married, and when he was in preparation for his first marriage, he built an additional room at one end of the house. Ebenezer Hunt, when he died, had a large property \u2014 three or four farms\u2014besides this farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">This witness also deposed, that John Hunt and Lydia Hunt lived on the farm until their respective deaths, and that she had no reason to doubt that Ebenezer did all he could to make them both as comfortable as they could be. She furthermore deposed, that Israel (the demandant) frequently visited Ebenezer while he lived on the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">3. Jonathan Butman, 70 years old, testified to the same facts substantially, as stated by the preceding witnesses ; and also, that he believed he had seen Israel Hunt at work on the farm after Ebenezer returned from Ackworth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-8\">The tenant, to establish her title, gave in evidence the will of Ebenezer Hunt, dated August 1839, duly proved and allowed, whereby he devised the whole of his real estate to the tenant, who is his widow ; and she then proved, that from the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>John, in 1807, said Ebenezer had been in the sole and exclusive occupation of the premises. And there was no evidence that any of the other children ever made any claim to a share of the demanded premises, until since the death of Ebenezer Hunt in 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-5\">The tenant then called sundry witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-6\">1 William Rogers, aged 62 years, testified that he lived within one and a half miles of the farm, and had for 50 years been acquainted with Ebenezer Hunt and the farm; that Ebenezer occupied the farm as other people did their farms\u2014worked and sold the produce : His father and mother were there till their deaths. The farm was taxed, when the witness knew any thing about it, to Ebenezer Hunt: He never knew it taxed to any one else. Several years whilst Ebenezer was on the place, John Hunt, his father, was roving abroad. Ebenezer took care of his father and mother. Israel and Paul did not take care of them after Ebenezer lived on the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-7\">In 1796, Ebenezer made an addition to the house. The value of the estate was then small compared with its present value; not worth more than $ 1000. He afterwards built a barn. When the house was repaired, Ebenezer had the apparent general charge of the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-8\">2. Samuel Hardy, aged 60 years, testified that he assist ed in building the barn, and was employed and paid by Ebenezer. It was built in 1805 or 1806, while John Hunt was alive Ebenezer had the management of the farm, and the witness never knew any one else to claim it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-9\">3. Oliver Clark, 61 years old, testified that he had always lived within half a mile of the farm in question, and that Ebenezer Hunt had been the principal occupant of it for 45 years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-10\">4. James Kelley, 75 years old, testified that he had known Ebenezer Hunt, and the farm in dispute, ever since he could recollect ; that he was employed by Ebenezer, and paid by him for working on the house when an addition was made to it, and also for other work done previously and afterwards. The witness remembered the time when Ebenezer came from Ackworth, and believed it to be between 50 and 60 years ago. He occu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>pied the farm after that time, and carried it on until he died. When he came back from Ackworth, his father was delirious. He used to be two or three years crazy, running about; and then two or three years still, saying nothing. He was not able, the last part of his life, to take care of himself. Before Ebenezer returned, his father used to be put into confinement; but not afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">5. Philip Rogers, 80 years old, testified that he had known the Hunts nearly 70 years ; he knew when Ebenezer came back, and that he was at Ackworth two or three years, and when he returned, he took possession of the farm and occupied it until he died. John Rogers, 85 years old, Edward Wood, 71 years old, Eldad Worcester, 78 years old, and Dudley Marston, 59 years old, also testified to the same facts, substantially as stated by the other witnesses introduced by the tenant, respecting the occupation of the farm during the last fifty years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">The witnesses for the tenant, on cross-examination, all stated, that as long ago as they could recollect, John Hunt, together with his wife and children, lived on the demanded premises. That John Hunt was insane at times, and that the farm was carried on by the family. Nearly all of said witnesses knew John Hunt when his children were boys, and they testified that ever since they knew him, he had lived on the farm ; and that he continued there till he died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-7\">The evidence on both sides being all in, and several objections to the demandant\u2019s right to recover being ruled in his favor, for the purposes of this trial, a verdict was taken for the demandant, by consent, subject to the opinion of the whole court, upon the facts and evidence to be reported, and all such just inferences as may be drawn from them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-8\">If the court are of opinion, upon the whole case, that the demandant is not entitled to recover, the. verdict to be set aside and the demandant to be nonsuit.

His seizin was inquired into under the notice attached to the plea of the general issue. The exclusive possession of Ebenezer, from 1807 till his death, gives the tenant the three first stages or degrees of a perfect title, viz. possession, apparent right of possession, and actual right of possession. This is a strong presumption of the right of property in the tenant, and she ought not to be deprived of this title, unless on very clear proof of the mere right of the demandant. 2 Bl. Com. 195-198. 3 Bl. Com. 178, 190, 191.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-6\">What title has the demandant shown ? Admitting that it is proved that the demandant\u2019s father lived on the farm 40 years, from 1767 to 1807, and that this possession is presumptive evidence of a seizin in fee ; still it is but a presumption of title, because he might, for aught that appears, have been tenant for life, for years, or by the curtesy. His possession was not long enough to give him the absolute right of possession ; because, before <em>St. </em>1807, c. 75, fifty years\u2019 possession was necessary to give such right. The demandant, therefore, has not shown so high a degree of title as the tenant. There is, then, presumption against presumption : Presumption in favor of the tenant \u2014 possession, apparent right of possession, and actual right of possession. Presumption in favor of the demandant\u2014possession and apparent right of possession only. The tenant has the stronger presumption. <em>Jayne </em>v. <em>Price, </em>5 Taunt. 326.

This doctrine of the different degrees of title, and different degrees of presumption, and different kinds of proof to enabl\u00e9 the demandant to recover, is supported, not only by the above cases, and by the best elementary writers, but results from the theory of real actions. Co. Lit. 239 a, <em>note </em>(155). 3 Bl.

This indeed is mere evidence of title, and not necessary where a record title is shown. But where there is no record title, as in this case, the taking of esplees ought to be proved, as that is necessary to establish possession. And it must be shown that the ancestor took esplees, if there were any, within forty years. <em>Widdowson </em>v. <em>Earl of Harrington, </em>1 Jac. &amp; Walk. 547, 548. <em>Dumsday </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>3 Bing.

The action was commenced in the year 1839, before the limitation of real actions by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Rev. Sts. c. 119, took effect The demandant counts on the seizin of John Hunt, his father, within forty years before the commencement of the action ; and the first question to be decided is, whether the seizin of John Hunt is satisfactorily proved by the evidence reported. No record title in John Hunt, nor in any other person, was produced at the trial ; but it was proved by sundry aged witnesses, that from seventy to eighty years since, and as far back as the memory of any of the witnesses extended, the farm in question was in the possession and occupation of the said John Hunt; that he lived on it with his wife and children, taking the profits, and continued his resi dence there, until his death in 1807. There is no evidence of any prior possession or elder title ; and it cannot be doubted that proof of such an ancient and long continued possession and occupation is good <em>prima, facie </em>evidence of a seizin in fee simple. In a writ of right, as well as in a writ of entry, a title by disseizin is a good and sufficient title, unless a better can be shown by the tenant. Lit. \u00a7 478. If, then, John Hunt bad no better title, he had a good title by disseizin ; for we corysider the evidence as establishing the fact beyond controversy, that he was in possession of the premises for more than forty years, and died seized ; for there is no proof that he was disseized by his son Ebenezer, under whom the tenant claims. His possession was not adverse, and .must be presumed to be under his father; and if he had concurrent possession with his father, that certainly would not constitute a disseizin.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">It has been objected, that since the time when Ebenezer first began to take the principal management of the farm, the esplees were taken by him ; but considering him as occupying under his father, this is not a valid objection. The taking by the tenant is the taking by the landlord. 4 Dane Ab. 29, 30. And from the whole evidence, there can be no question that the possession or occupation by Ebenezer was by the permission of his father, so far. as he was capable of giving permission, and with the acquiescence of his mother and the rest of the family. We are of opinion, therefore, that the seizin of John Hunt continued up to the time of his death, and that during his lifetime, the. profits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>of his farm must be considered as taken by him, or for his use and benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The next question to be determined is, whether Ebenezer Hunt had, after the death of his father, gained a good title by disseizin. He continued in the possession of the premises for more than thirty years after that event; and the tenant\u2019s counsel contend that he thereby gained a good title, by disseizin, against the other children and heirs of John Hunt. This question involves another, namely, whether the plea of darrein seizin is a good plea in a writ of right. This is said to be doubtful; but the grounds of doubt do not seem to be stated with precision, nor to be satisfactory. Roscoe, in his Treatise on Real Actions, Vol. I. p. 206, says, that \u201c the reason given against such a plea is, that the tenant may tender the demi-mark, and have the ancestor\u2019s seizin inquired into.\u201d This reason for the doubt is not stated by Judge Jackson, in his Treatise on Real Actions, p. 285; and, upon the authorities, the doubt does not seem to rest on any reasonable and substantial ground. In the writ of <em>mort (P </em>ancestor, in formedon in the descender, in <em>nuper </em>obiit, and in a writ of cosinage, as well as in a writ of entry, it is a good plea that the demandant himself was seized after the death of the ancestor. Roscoe, <em>ubi sup. </em>And we think, notwithstanding the doubts suggested, that it is a good plea or defence in a writ of right. The tenant, however, has failed to make out any such defence. There is no evidence that the demandant ever entered the premises after the death of his father, and became actually seized of his share therein ; and before the revised statutes, he could not maintain an action, counting on his own seizin. In a writ of entry, or a writ of right, the demandant must count on an actual seizin, and a seizin in law is insufficient. Before entry by the heir, after the death-of the ancestor, or an equivalent act, he cannot maintain an action of trespass, or writ of entry on his own seizin, unless the land be vacant and unoccupied. Plowd. 142. 2 Rol. Ab. 553. <em>Wells </em>v. Prince, 4 Mass. 67. <em>Dally </em>v. King, 1 H. B. 1. Bac. Ab. Trespass, E. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The law, in relation to .the question under consideration, is correctly stated in 2 Preston\u2019s Abstracts, 345. \u201c The wri' of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>entry sur abatement,\u201d he says, <em>\u201c </em>must necessarily be grounded on the seizin of the ancestor ; and therefore fifty years is the limitation within which a writ of entry sur abatement must be brought. It does not seem to have ever been supposed that the disseizin was to the heir, so as to bar him, unless he should bring his action within thirty years.\u201d Nor can it be maintained, as a ground of defence, that by the entry of Ebenezer Hunt, after the death of his father, all the heirs became actually seized ; because, unless his entry was adverse to the claims of the other heirs, there is no evidence of a disseizin ; and on that ground the defence fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The remaining ground of defence in support of the tenant\u2019s title, and that on which his counsel seem principally to rely, is the presumption, arising from the long possession of Ebenezer Hunt, that the premises were conveyed to him by his father, or that the other children and heirs have relinquished their shares therein to him, since the death of their father. As to the pre sumption of a deed from the father, we think there is clearly no ground on which it can be maintained. Nor was it much relied on at the argument. The father had not the mental capacity to make a legal conveyance of his property, or any other binding contract; and the occupation of Ebenezer with his father is no ground for the presumption of a conveyance from him, had he been of a capacity to make a legal conveyance. Ebenezer, for a number of years before his father\u2019s death, had the principal but not the sole management of the. farm, as the demandant had, before the return of Ebenezer from Ackworth ; but the fathei and the mother assisted. This joint or mixed possession and occupation is certainly no foundation for the presumption of a grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The question then is reduced to this, namely, whether the possession of Ebenezer, after the death of his father, is a sufficient foundation for the presumption of a grant or release from the other children. It must be admitted that there is no legal or artificial presumption of any such grant. \u201c In general,\u201d as remarked by Story, J. in <em>Ricard </em>v. Williams, 7 Wheat. 110, \u201c it is the policy of courts of law, to limit the presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>grants to periods analogous to those of the statute of limitations, in cases where the statute does not apply. But where the statute applies, it constitutes ordinarily a sufficient title or defence.\u201d So Lord Mansfield says, in <em>Eldridge </em>v. Knott, Cowp. 216, <em>\u201c </em>there is no instance of setting up any length of time within the imitation fixed by the statute, as a bar to the demand.\u201d And so Aston, J. remarked, in the same case, that mere length of time, unaccompanied with other circumstances, ought not to alter the limitation fixed by the statute, and set up another. If the law were otherwise, it would effectually alter and do away with the intended operation of the statute of limitations. That impliedly declares, that in a writ of right no disseizin or adverse possession shall be a bar unless it continues for forty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Now in the present case there are no circumstances super-added to the adverse possession of Ebenezer Hunt \u2014 if his possession were adverse \u2014 leading to the conviction or belief that he ever had a grant from the other children and heirs. On the contrary, the circumstances, which were proved, rather tend to weaken the presumption of any such grant. There would have been more reason for the presumption, if the occupation had been by a stranger. Ebenezer had a right to continue his occupation as one of the heirs ; and there is no clear proof that his occupation was intended to be adverse to the claims of the other heirs. He had made considerable advances during the life of his father, in repairing the house, building a barn, and for other expenses, for which he expected, probably, to be reimbursed from the profits of the farm. To this the other heirs could not reasonably object. And this may account for their forbearance to claim any share of the profits. Another circumstance, suggested by the demandant\u2019s counsel, might have some influence to prevent them from interposing any such claim. It appeared that Ebenezer had acquired a large estate, which his brothers and his sister might reasonably expect to inherit; and if so, they might have been unwilling to advance claims that perhaps might give offence. But whether these suppositions arc probable or not, <em>we </em>think there is no evidence to warrant the inference, that a conveyance to Ebenezer from the other heirs has ever been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>made. The probability of such an act is not sufficient. The evidence to support a natural presumption of a fact must be such as to lead the mind to a conscientious belief of its existence, beyond a reasonable doubt This the evidence in the present case fails to do.; and, as it seems to us, it fails to establish a reasonable probability of any such conveyance as is set up by the tenant to defeat the demandant\u2019s right. That right is not barred by the statute of limitations, and ought not, therefore, to be defeated by any presumption or inference not supported by convincing and satisfactory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
