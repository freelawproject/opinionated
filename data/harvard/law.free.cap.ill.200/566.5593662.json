Said lots 3 and 4 have been owned and occupied by the corporation with a church and rectory for many years. Said lot 2 was acquired by the corporation, by purchase, about 1895, for the purpose of enlarging the facilities of the parish for public worship, including Sunday school and such sub-organizations of the church and parish as are conducted in connection with and part of the public worship of the said church. Said lots are each 66 by 150 feet, being a total of 198 feet on Joliet street by 150 feet on VanBuren street, and is a parcel of ground of reasonable size for the location of the church building and affords no more space than is required. The rectory or residence of the minister is located on the east part of said lots 3 and 4, and is assessed as residence property, though in construction it is actually connected with the church building. Lot 2 is separated from lots 3 and 4 by a public alley 16 feet wide. Christ church is the only place of public worship for the Episcopalians in a population of 40,000 people. The whole machinery, excepting one small chapel in a distant part of the city, is concentrated on these three city lots 1, 2 and 3, as hereinbefore described, and Christ church parish is one of the largest in the State outside of the city of Chicago. There is no revenue or income from the property claimed to be exempt. It is used exclusively for public worship, and the three lots are only of a reasonable size for the location of the church. The only sworn testimony heard by the board of review was that of William Bohler Walker, rector of the church. The conclusion of the board of review was based on sworn testimony and such facts as were learned from the town assessor and others having knowledge of the situation, and was and is that the said lot 2 is exempt from taxation for the reason that it is church property actually and exclusively used for public worship, owned by the congregation; and that the entire holding of the congregation in land is no more than of reasonable size for the location of the church building's.\u201d Appended to such statement, and made a part thereof by the certificate of the board of review, are the minutes taken by the board of the sworn testimony of William Bohler Walker, rector of said church, as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\" pgmap=\"568(167) 569(211)\">\u201cThe property was a lot and dwelling house, separated from the church building by a public alley 16, feet wide. The church building is close on the line of the alley. There is no room on the church lot for the erection and maintenance of such a building that is essential to the purposes of the corporation, the church standing close on the street line and alley line. The entire space, aside from that occupied by the church building, is occupied by a residence for the minister, and such residence is assessed and taxed. The church lot is lots 3 and 4, block 19, original town of Joliet, and is a plot of ground 132 by 150 feet. Christ church has owned and occupied said lots 3 and 4 for church purposes many years. The development of the church work required more room, and said lot 2 was purchased about 1895 for the express purpose of providing more room for accomplishing the purposes of the corporation, namely, Sunday school purposes, social purposes of the congregation, and such meetings of the congregation as cannot be held in the auditorium or the room consecrated and set apart for the religious exercises of the congregation. This lot 2, when purchased, was occupied by a dwelling house, which was prepared for the use needed by removing partitions, making rooms suitable for use until such time as the corporation can erect a suitable building for its needs. The building has not been used for any secular purpose whatever from the time when acquired by the corporation to April 1, 1902. About May, 1902, the rooms on the second floor were, and now are, occupied as janitor\u2019s rooms by the janitor having the care of the church building and Sunday school rooms. There is no revenue or income of any kind or character from this building and property, said lot 2. The entire holding of said corporation is said lots 2, 3 and 4, each 66 by 150 feet, and is scant room for the actual needs of the parish for public worship. It is now used exclusively for public worship, and it is the purpose of the corporation to so use and occupy it permanently.\u201d</summary><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-5\" pgmap=\"569\">Coll McNaughton, and Cowing &amp; Young, for petitioner.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-6\" pgmap=\"569\">H.

(People v. Anderson, 117 Ill. 50.) The General Assembly, at its session in the year 1872, in pursuance of these constitutional provisions, adopted a general act entitled \u201cAn act for the assessment of property and for the levy and collection of taxes,\u201d approved March 30, 1872, (Starr &amp; Cur. Stat. 1896, chap. 120,) and in section, 2 of said act specified the classes of property which, in the wisdom of the law-making body, should not be called upon to contribute to the revenues of the State. The second subdivision of said section 2 of said act relates to and governs the exemptions of the property of religious corporations and organizations. It is as follows: \u201cAll church property actually and exclusively used for public worship, when the land (to be of reasonable size for the location of the church building) is owned by .the congregation.\u201d It will be observed that while the constitution authorizes the General Assembly to relieve all property \u201cused exclusively for * * * religious purposes\u201d from assessment for taxation, the law-making department of the State did not deem it the better part of wisdom to extend the exemption to that extent, and only authorized the exemption of such \u201cchurch property\u201d as should be exclusively used for \u201cpublic worship.\u201d i</p> <p id=\"b570-5\" pgmap=\"570\">It then arises for decision whether said lot No. 2 is used for \u201cpublic worship.\u201d There are many uses, religious in purpose, to which property may be devoted other than that of \u201cpublic worship.\u201d It is, therefore, clearly not sufficient that the lot and building thereon is used for \u201creligious purposes,\u201d but it is essential that it shall be used for that particular character of \u201creligious purposes\u201d which is properly known as \u201cpublic worship.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b571-4\" pgmap=\"571\">All statutes for the exemption of property from taxation are to be strictly construed against the exemption and in favor of the State and taxation. An exemption cannot be raised by implication, but the intention to relieve from the burden of taxation must appear affirmatively. If there be an ambiguity as to what is exempt, it must operate against the owners of the property and in favor of the public, and all reasonable doubts as to the proper interpretation of a statute providing for exemptions from taxation must be solved in favor of the State. (Northwestern University v. People, 80 Ill. 333; Bloomington Cemetery Ass. v. People, 170 id. 377; Sanitary District of Chicago v. Martin, 173 id. 243; People v. Chicago Theological Seminary, 174 id. 177.) It is therefore essential to the exemption of church property under said second subdivision of section 2 of the Revenue act that it shall be \u201cactually and exclusively used for public worship,\u201d within the meaning of those words as employed in the statute. The words \u201cpublic worship\u201d do not seem to have been defined by the courts when used in a statute as descriptive of property to be exempted from the burden of taxation. If susceptible of more than one meaning the words are, as is the statute itself, to be given the meaning\" which is the most favorable to the right of the State to subject the property to taxation. A more liberal construction and definition might, perhaps, be adopted if it became necessary to construe those words when employed in a statute designed to protect assemblages of people from interruption and disturbance. But that question is not here involved.</p> <p id=\"b571-5\" pgmap=\"571(69) 572(199)\">In Hamsher v. Hamsher, 132 Ill. 273, we were called upon to determine whether the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association of Decatur, Illinois, was a corporation organized for the purpose of \u201creligious worship.\u201d If formed for the purposes of \u201creligious worship\u201d the association could not take a tract of one hundred and sixty acres of land devised under the will of one David F. Hamsher, for the reason section 42 of the \u201cAct concerning corporations,\u201d approved April 18,1872, (1 Starr &amp; Cur. Stat. 1896, p. 1026,) prohibited any corporation \u201cformed for religious purposes\u201d from receiving, by devise, gift or purchase, land exceeding in \"quantity (including that already held by the corporation) ten acres, etc. We there adopted one of the definitions given by Mr. Webster of the word \u201cworship,\u201d as follows: \u201cThe act of paying honor to the Supreme being; religious reverence or homage; adoration paid to God, or a being viewed as God,\u201d and held that the association, though formed to \u201cpromote growth in grace and Christian fellowship among its members and ag'gressive Christian work, expressly by and for young men, and to seek out and aid worthy poor,\u201d was not to be regarded as formed for purposes of religious worship, and hence not inhibited to accept and \u00a1hold the land devised to it by said will. Worship, as'there defined, may be that of an individual, and for that reason, if not for others, the definition of the word is not sufficiently comprehensive to be accepted as a definition of the term \u201cpublic worship\u201d found in the statute under consideration.</p> <p id=\"b572-4\" pgmap=\"572\">Section 3 of article 2 of the constitution of 1870 is as follows: \u201cThe free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination, shall forever be guaranteed; and no person shall be denied any civil or political right, privilege or capacity, on account of his religious opinions; but the liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not be construed to dispense with oaths or affirmations, excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practices inconsistent with the peace or. safety of the State. No person shall be required to attend or support any ministry or place of worship against his consent,- nor shall any preference be given by law to any religious denomination or mode of worship.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b572-6\" pgmap=\"572(30) 573(140)\">Religion is defined by Mr. Webster to be \u201cany system of faith and worship; as the religion of the Turks, of Hindoos, of Christians; true and false religion.\u201d In Board of Education v. Menor, 23 Ohio St. 250, the word \u201creligion,\u201d as used in the constitution of the State of Ohio, was defined to mean \u201cthe religion of all mankind, and not the religion of any class of men.\u201d Said section 3 of article 2 of our constitution therefore constitutes a guaranty of absolute freedom of thought and faith, whether orthodox, heterodox, Christian, Jewish, catholic, protestant, liberal, conservative, Calvinistic, Armenian, Unitarian or other religious belief, theology or philosophy, and also the right of the free exercise and enjoyment of religious professions and worship of any variety or form, the only restraint upon the free exercise of liberty of conscience being, that oaths and affirmations shall not thereby be dispensed with, licentious acts excused or practices justified which are dangerous to the peace and safety of the State.</p> <p id=\"b573-5\" pgmap=\"573(196) 574(72)\">Any definition of \u201cpublic worship\u201d to be acceptable must be sufficiently broad and comprehensive to include within the beneficial operation of the statute of exemptions the church property of all congregations and every denomination or form of religious faith and worship. The difficulties attending the task of formulating a definition of the term \u201cpublic worship\u201d so that it will be applicable to and comprehend every variety of religious faith and belief and every religious philosophy of life and death, and omit none, is apparent. The question here in hand is, what is meant by \u201cpublic worship\u201d as applicable to Christ church of the city of Joliet, a corporation \u201corganized for the purpose of public worship according to the rules and observances of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States of North America?\u201d This church accepts the doctrine of the inspiration of the old and new testaments and of the divinity of Jesus Christ. Worship in that church is consequently the act of paying honor, religious reverence, homage and adoration to the God of the bible. Public worship in that church is therefore the assembling together of the members of that church in a congregation, together with others who may choose to come, for the purpose of worshiping- God in accordance with the rules and regulations and religious forms of that organization. \u201cPublic worship,\u201d as applied to Christ church, means congregational worship of Almighty God. In the United States the word \u201ccongregation\u201d means the members of a particular church who meet in one place to worship. (Bouvier\u2019s Law Dic. title \u201cCongregation.\u201d)</p> <p id=\"b574-4\" pgmap=\"574(269) 575(58)\">Every church building- which has been constructed for or is to be devoted to the purpose of providing a room or place in which the congregation of the church, and other persons who may desire to attend, may assemble for the purpose of engaging in those devotional, exercises which are properly known as \u201creligious worship,\u201d should, if in no part devoted to secular uses, be regarded as exclusively devoted to public worship, and, together with the land or lot, of sufficient size for the location of the building, be deemed exempt from taxation, though such church building- should also contain such adjuncts to the audience room or place for the assembling of the congregation as room for the safe keeping of the outer coats, wraps, umbrellas, etc., of the persons who are to participate in the religious exercises of worship, or rooms required in order to secure the comfort of such persons composing such worshiping congregation, or a study room for the use of the pastor in the preparation of his sermons, or rooms for Sunday schools or for sub-organizations of the church, or other purposes wholly nonsecular and as aids to general religious designs of the congregation, provided the title to the exempted property is in the church organization. A church building which has been erected or provided by the church organization for the purpose or with the view of providing a room or place for public worship does not lose its character as a church building exclusively devoted to \u201cpublic worship\u201d by reason of the occasional, or even regular, additional use of the audience room for other religious purposes of the organization, though such other purposes are not strictly \u201cpublic worship,\u201d but only auxiliaries intended to aid in the growth and development of the religious faith and character of the communicants of the church and others, and advance the general welfare and purposes of the organized church.</p> <p id=\"b575-4\" pgmap=\"575(312) 576(24)\">Church buildings which are maintained for the purpose of providing a room or place where audiences or congregations are to assemble for the purpose of engaging in \u201cpublic worship,\u201d and which would not be so maintained but for the desire to provide such room or place, are in the true sense maintained exclusively for that purpose, though, as we have before said, the building may also be used for other non-secular purposes consistent with and in aid of the primary and sole purpose for which the building is maintained. It appears here that the building on said lot No. 2 here sought to be exempted from taxation has no room or place in it for \u201cpublic worship,\u201d but that the church building of said Christ church having the room for the purpose of \u201cpublic worship\u201d of the congregation of the church is situated on another lot, to-wit, lot No. 3. It further appears from the record of the case as made by the board of review, that said lot 2 is separated from lot 3, on which the church building is maintained for \u201cpublic worship,\" by a public alley sixteen feet in width; that the building situate on said lot 2 was erected for and was formerly used as a dwelling until purchased by the congregation of Christ church; that the rooms on the second floor are now used and occupied by the janitor of the church,\u2014whether as a residence for the janitor and his family, or rooms in which he may sleep, or in which to store articles used in the care of the church, is not disclosed; that the first floor of the building is used (1) for Sunday school purposes; (2) \u201cfor social purposes of the congregation;\u201d (3) for such meetings of the congregation as cannot be held in the auditorium or iu the room set apart and consecrated for the religious exercises of the congregation; and (4) for the sub-organizations of the church.</p> <p id=\"b576-5\" pgmap=\"576(332) 577(45)\">The meetings of the congregation to be held in this building are \u201csuch as (for some reason not disclosed) can not be held in the auditorium or room (in the church building) set apart and consecrated for the religious exercises of the congregation.\u201d These meetings of the congregation are clearly not for \u201cpublic worship,\" for if they were, they could be held in the auditorium or room set apart in the church building' for such meetings of the congregation. Such meetings may have been or may be to consider merely business interests of the church or benevolent or charitable undertakings, or matters pertaining to the welfare of the church or of its pastor or members of the congregation. In the absence of affirmative proof as to the purposes and character of such \u201cmeetings,\u201d the doubt, if any should or ought arise whether they were for purposes of \u201cpublic worship,\u201d must be, as we have seen, solved in favor of the State and against the exemption of property from taxation. \u201cSub-organisations of the church or of the congregation\u201d may fairly be entitled to the presumption that they wer.e created and are conducted for the highest and most commendable uses and purposes, yet it cannot be assumed the exercises of such sub-organizations constitute \u201cpublic worship.\u201d In the absence of affirmative proof that such is the case, the assumption, as we have seen, is to the contrary, for the right to enjoy exemption from taxation can only be established by strict proof of the existence of all facts necessary to create the exemption. The exercises at Sunday schools are more nearly akin to those of \u201cpublic worship.\u201d The use of the auditorium or other room in a church building proper for the exercises of a Sunday school would be entirely consistent with the view that such church building was exclusively used for the purpose of public worship; but the fact that one or more of the rooms on the first floor of this building on lot No. 2 is or are used as Sunday school rooms cannot give to the whole building, and the lot on which it stands, the character of a building \u201cused exclusively for public worship.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b577-3\" pgmap=\"577\">The privilege of exemption from taxation was not established, and the board of review erred in declaring said lot No. 2 to be exempt.
