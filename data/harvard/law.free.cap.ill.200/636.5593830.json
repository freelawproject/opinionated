The sh pellant\u2019s railway, and was mou lee on a car furnished by appe, shipment was as follows: (1j ellee in the circuit court t, for the recovery of the appellee from Joliet to ament was made via apted and loaded by appelant.

The cause was submitt 1 to the court without a jury, and there was a finding &lt; d judgment in favor of appellee for \u00a71200. Upon appea, to the Appellate Court the judgment was affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b638-21\" pgmap=\"638(32) 639(25)\">Two reasons are urged why bhe case should be reversed: First, that the court t red in refusing to find that the liability of appellant b\u00a1 limited to its own line; and secondly, that the proof shows that the proximate cause of the injury to the fly-wheel was the improper loading of the same by appellee.</p> <p id=\"b639-3\" pgmap=\"639\">The bill of lading offered in evidence was a \u201cthrough freight\u201d contract, and the undertaking of the appellant was to carry the fly-wheel safely from Joliet to Louisville, Kentucky, and it was liable for any injury or damage that mig'ht occur to the goods in transit, either upon its own line or that of a connecting carrier, unless its liability was limited by contract.

Calumet Stock Farm, 194 id. 9; Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Carter, 165 id. 570.</p> <p id=\"b639-4\" pgmap=\"639\">In Toledo, Peoria and Warsaw Railway Co. v. Merriman, supra, the bill of lading provided that appellant would transport the freight \u201cover the line of this railway to the company\u2019s freight station at its terminus, and deliver in like good order to the consignee or owner, or to such company, (if the same are to be forwarded beyond the limits of this railway,) whose line may be considered a part of the route to the place of destination of said goods or packages, it being distinctly understood that the responsibility of this company as a common carrier shall cease at the station where such goods are delivered to such persons or carrier.\u201d In that case, as in this, it was contended that appellant was not liable as common carrier beyond the terminus of its road, and that as it was not shown the loss happened on its road appellee could not\u2019 recover. In discussing this question the court said: \u201cThis defense is utterly groundless, as the receipt or bill of lading offered in evidence shows upon its face it was a \u2018through freight contract,\u2019 and it was in proof by the defendant\u2019s agent that freight received by this company as through freight was never unloaded or delivered at their terminus, but forwarded on to its place of destination in the cars in which it was received.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b640-2\" pgmap=\"640\">We regard the contract in tl much more favorable to appel one now before us. We are una bill of lading which limits the age occurring upon its own li destination on appellant\u2019s ro\u00ed contract, nor was the road to t to deliver the car for carriage point of destination mentioned of freight that was to be paid connecting carrier stated.
