GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b817-33\">Defendant, Timothy S. Lee, appeals his guilty plea conviction for being a previously convicted felon in possession of a firearm, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>and 924(a)(2). For the following reasons, we affirm in part, vacate in part and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">On July 15, 2000, Timothy S. Lee was stopped when Officer Atkins of the Haltom City Police noticed an expired inspection sticker displayed on the windshield of the vehicle Lee was operating. While waiting for an assist unit to arrive on the scene, Officer Atkins performed a computer search and learned that Lee\u2019s license had been suspended. Lee was placed under arrest and a search of the vehicle incident to the arrest was conducted at the scene. During the search, a 9mm handgun and ammunition were discovered. It was later learned that Lee had five prior felony convictions, that the firearm had been stolen, and that the handgun had been manufactured outside of the state of Texas, and, therefore, that the firearm had traveled in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">On January 17, 2001, Lee was charged by indictment with two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). \u2022Lee filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional, both on its face and as applied. His motion was denied. Lee subsequently entered a conditional guilty plea pursuant to a written plea agreement. As part of the plea agreement, Lee reserved the right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d or \u201creport\u201d) calculated Lee\u2019s base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. The report concluded that Lee\u2019s prior conviction for Unauthorized Use of a Motor Vehicle (\u201cUUMV\u201d) was a crime of violence. Accordingly, the PSR adjusted Lee\u2019s offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), resulting in a base offense level of 20. Lee objected to the use of a base offense level of 20, arguing that his UUMV conviction should not be considered a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) and \u00a7 4B1.2. The district court overruled the objection, and on August 3, 2001, sentenced Lee to 78 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release. Lee subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">We first address Lee\u2019s arguments regarding the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. Lee posits that \u00a7 922(g), which proscribes possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, is unconstitutional on its face because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Alternatively, Lee submits that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional as applied for the same reason he claims it is unconstitutional on its face \u2014 because prosecutions under the statute need not allege or prove any substantial effect on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">At the onset, Lee concedes that his arguments are foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1150, 122 S.Ct. 1113, 151 L.Ed.2d 1007 (2002). Lee raises the issue here in order to preserve it for Supreme Court review. In <em>Daugherty, </em>we found that the defendant\u2019s commerce clause challenge to \u00a7 922(g) must necessarily fail because \u201cthe constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question.\u201d <em>Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d at 518 (quoting <em>United States v. DeLeon, </em>170 F.3d 494, 499 (5th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 863, 120 S.Ct. 156, 145 L.Ed.2d 133 (1999)). We also made clear that stipulated evidence showing that a weapon was manufactured outside of the state in which it was possessed was sufficient to support a conviction. <em>See Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d at 514, 518 (firearm that was manufactured in Egypt and imported through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Tennessee found sufficient to maintain a \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Here, as in <em>Daugherty, </em>there is stipulated evidence that the firearm was manufactured outside the state of Texas and, therefore, that the firearm had previously traveled in interstate commerce. Because we are bound by our prior precedent, Lee\u2019s argument regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) must fail. <em>See Martin v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>254 F.3d 573, 577 (5th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 807, 151 L.Ed.2d 693 (2002)(\u201ca panel of this court can only overrule a prior panel decision if such overruling is unequivocally directed by controlling Supreme Court precedent\u201d)(internal quotation and citations omitted). This portion of the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">We next address the issue of Lee\u2019s prior state conviction for UUMV as it relates to his sentence. Lee argues that his conviction for UUMV should not be considered a crime of violence and therefore should not have been used to increase his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) and 4B1.2. Lee acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>220 F.3d 635, 639 (5th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 988, 121 S.Ct. 1640, 149 L.Ed.2d 499 (2001), which held that UUMV <em>is </em>a crime of violence. Although <em>Jacksonm&amp;y </em>have been controlling precedent at the time, our recent case law \u2014 in particular, our decision in <em>United States v. Charles, </em>301 F.3d 309 (5th Cir.2002) \u2014 requires that the issue be further scrutinized.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">A defendant may appeal a sentence imposed under the sentencing guidelines if the sentence \u201c(1) was imposed in violation of the law; (2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines; or (3) is greater than the sentence specified in the applicable guideline range....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). Because Lee raised his objection below, the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines is reviewed de novo, and its findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Stevenson, </em>126 F.3d 662, 664 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">As previously noted, the base offense levels for crimes involving the unlawful possession of a firearm are set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, and an enhanced base offense level of 20 is applied if the defendant has a previous felony conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). The guideline commentary clarifies that, for the purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1, crime of violence \u201chas the meaning given that term in \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and Application Note 1 of the Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n. 5). According to Section 4B1.2(a):</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-14\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-15\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Application Note 1 to this section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-17\">\u201cCrime of violence\u201d includes murder, manslaughter, kidnaping, aggravated assault, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d if (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>the conduct set forth <em>(i.e., </em>expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted involved the use of explosives (including any explosive material or destructive device) or, by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axu\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">As noted above, the PSR recommended that Lee\u2019s base offense level be calculated at 20 because his prior felony UUMV offense constituted a crime of violence. According to the PSR, this recommendation was based on our decision in <em>United States v. Galvan-Rodriguez, </em>169 F.3d 217 (5th Cir.1999). Lee objected, raising the same issue currently being reviewed, but also conceding that his contention had been rejected in <em>Jackson. </em>The district court, in overruling Lee\u2019s objection, expressly relied on our holding in <em>Jackson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\"><em>United States v. Galvarir-Rodriguez. </em>In <em>Galvan-Rodriguez, </em>the defendant was convicted of illegal reentry into the United States and received a sixteen-level enhancement based on his prior Texas conviction for UUMV. <em>See Galvan-Rodriguez, </em>169 F.3d at 218. The enhancement was imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, under which a defendant who has been deported and unlawfully reenters the country will receive an increased offense level if he has previously been convicted of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Section 2L1.2 defined aggravated felony, in pertinent part, as any \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as that phrase is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 7)(Nov.l995). According to Section 16(b), a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is a felony offense \u201cthat, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 (1994). This Court held that UUMV is a crime of violence as defined by \u00a7 16 and is, therefore, also an aggravated felony for purposes of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2) offense level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\"><em>United States v. Jackson. </em>In <em>Jackson, </em>as in the case currently before us, a defendant with a prior UUMV conviction was subsequently convicted for wrongfully possessing a firearm. <em>See Jackson, </em>220 F.3d at 636. The <em>Jackson </em>panel noted that the holding in <em>Galvan-Rodriguez </em>\u2014 that UUMV is a crime of violence \u2014 was based on the fact that UUMV creates a substantial risk that the vehicle might become involved in an accident, resulting in damage to the vehicle, other property and innocent persons. <em>See id. </em>at 639. It was also noted that the misdemeanor crime of driving while intoxicated had been held to be a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. DeSantiago-Gonzalez, </em>207 F.3d 261, 264 (5th Cir. 2000)). After reviewing these cases, the <em>Jackson </em>court held that the \u201crisk to persons is likewise sufficient to render [UUMV], as a categorical matter, a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)\u2019s residual clause.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>220 F.3d at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\"><em>United States v. Charles. </em>In <em>Charles, </em>a panel of this Court, considering itself bound by <em>Jackson, </em>affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that theft of a vehicle is a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>See Charles, </em>301 F.3d at 311. After rehearing the case en banc, however, this Court overturned <em>Jackson, </em>and limited the holding of <em>Galvan-Rodriguez </em>to its property aspects and to \u00a7 16(b) cases. <em>Id. </em>at 314. We clarified that \u201csentences involving possession of a firearm by a felon, which also involve a prior conviction for an alleged \u2018crime of violence,\u2019 are to have the \u2018crime of violence\u2019 determination made only in accordance with the definition in \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) and its accompanying commentary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312. We held that, for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2, an offense is considered a crime of violence \u201conly if, from the face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>of the indictment, the crime charged or the conduct charged presents a serious potential risk of injury to a person. Injury to another need not be a certain result, but it must be clear from the indictment that the crime itself or the conduct specifically charged posed this serious potential risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">After considering Charles\u2019 indictment for vehicle theft, this Court concluded that simple theft of a vehicle is not a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>Id. </em>Although the defendant\u2019s conduct \u2014 i.e., theft of a car \u2014 \u2022 presented a risk of injury to property, there was no suggestion in the indictment that Charles\u2019 conduct presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another person. <em>Id. </em>Charles \u201csimply exercised control over property (the automobile) and drove it without the owner\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\"><em>Analysis. </em>As a practical matter, our decision in <em>Charles </em>overruled the basis for the district court\u2019s determination that Lee\u2019s prior UUMV conviction is a crime of violence. It should be noted, however, that this Court specifically stated in <em>Charles </em>that it had granted rehearing en banc \u201cto determine whether theft of a motor vehicle is a crime of violence under United States Sentencing Guideline CU.S.S.G.\u2019) \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310. In Texas, theft and unauthorized use of a vehicle are distinct offenses. <em>See </em>TEX. PENAL CODE ANN., \u00a7\u00a7 21.03 and 31.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">The crime of theft involves \u201cunlawfully appropriating] property with intent to deprive the owner of property.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 31.03(a). Unauthorized use of a vehicle is defined as \u201cintentionally or knowingly operating] another\u2019s boat, airplane, or motor-propelled vehicle without the effective consent of the owner.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 31.07(a). Thus, UUMV involves essentially the same elements as theft, but does not require the intent to deprive the owner of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has held that UUMV is a lesser included offense of theft. <em>See Neely v. State, </em>571 S.W.2d 926, 928 (Tex.Crim.App.1978). This would suggest that, because simple theft is not a crime of violence under <em>Charles, </em>UUMV \u2014 as a lesser included offense of theft \u2014 could not be a crime of violence either. Recent case law from the Texas Court of Appeals, however, implies that the Court of Criminal Appeals now reads <em>Neely&amp;s </em>requiring an examination of the facts of each case to determine whether or not UUMV is a lesser included offense of theft under the particular circumstances. <em>See Brady v. State, </em>2001 WL 459719, *2-3 (Tex.App.2001)(unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Because our decision in <em>Charles </em>overturned <em>Jackson, </em>limited <em>Galvanr-Rodri-guez, </em>and held that vehicle theft is not a crime of violence, it is likely that Lee\u2019s UUMV offense cannot be considered a crime of violence. However, we held in <em>Charles </em>that the face of the indictment should be examined, and in this case, Lee\u2019s state indictment for UUMV is not in the record. Given that the indictment should be reviewed \u2014 and that such a review would aid in clarifying the proper application of the somewhat ambiguous Texas law \u2014 we therefore VACATE the sentence and REMAND for re-sentencing consistent with <em>Charles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part, the judgment of sentence is VACATED and we REMAND the matter for re-sentencing in the light of this opinion and our decision in <em>Charles.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
