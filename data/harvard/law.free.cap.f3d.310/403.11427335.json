(Sunbelt). For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-25\">Garcia filed this action seeking damages for Sunbelt\u2019s termination of him after it allegedly requested that he perform an illegal act and he refused to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also sought attorneys\u2019 fees, arguing that his at-will employment relationship with Sunbelt constituted an oral contract, and Texas law provides for the right to recover attorneys\u2019 fees if the claim is for an oral or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>written contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In prosecuting his claims, Garcia relied primarily on <em>Sabine Pilot Service, Inc. v. Hauck, </em>in which the Texas Supreme Court allowed an employee to assert wrongful discharge for refusal to perform an illegal act, thereby creating a \u201cvery narrow exception\u201d to the general doctrine that employees-at-will can be discharged at any time for any reason.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant urged that he should be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees because the <em>\u201cSabine Pilot </em>exception recognizes that an employer effectively breaches an at-will agreement when an unlawful motive for firing is found by the trier of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The district court rejected Garcia\u2019s claim to attorneys\u2019 fees, finding that <em>Sabine Pilot </em>\u201cdid not indicate that the cause of action [for wrongful discharge for refusal to perform an illegal act] sounded in contract law, nor did the court address the issue of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 38.001(8).\u201d Therefore, Garcia did not \u201cestablish a right to sue for a contractual violation of his at-will employment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Our review of Texas law indicates that the district court reached the correct result. Most glaringly, <em>Sabine Pilot </em>itself does not explicitly provide for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to a plaintiff who prevails in a wrongful discharge cause of action based on refusal to perform an illegal act. To the contrary, its only reference to damages suggests that attorneys\u2019 fees are specifically disallowed in such cases. In his concurrence, Justice Kilgarlin explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-12\">because of the limited issues presented in this case, the court does not address the matter of [the plaintiffs] measure of damages. Logically, Tex.Rev.Stat. Ann. Art. 8307c (prohibition of filing an employee for filing a worker\u2019s compensation claim) should serve as a guide. If so, damages would include loss of wages, both past and those reasonably anticipated in the future, and employee and retirement benefits that would have accrued had employment continued. It would also include punitive damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">By excluding attorneys\u2019 fees, the concurrence implies that such an award is not contemplated in claims for wrongful discharge based on <em>Sabine Pilot </em>This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that, subsequent to <em>Sabine Pilot, </em>the Texas Supreme Court affirmatively held that attorneys\u2019 fees are not recoverable for wrongful discharge claims brought pursuant to Article 8307c.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">Additionally, in general, no Texas court has held that an at-will employment relationship constitutes an oral contract warranting recoupment of fees under \u00a7 38.001(8). To the contrary, we have before noted that \u201cTexas courts have denied attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in wrongful termination suits brought pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>ant to Texas law.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Guerra v. Brown, </em>a case substantially similar to the one at bar, the trial court had awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to an employer pursuant to \u00a7 38.001(8) after it successfully defended an at-will employee\u2019s wrongful termination claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A Texas court of appeals reversed the award, however, finding that \u00a7 38.001(8) \u201callows recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees if the claim involves breach of contract\u201d and the plaintiffs claim against her employer \u201csounded more in tort than contract,\u201d thus rendering the statute inapplicable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Furthermore, a review of statutes providing for wrongful discharge claims similar to the cause of action created in <em>Sabine Pilot </em>further reinforces the district court\u2019s determination. Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 122.001(a) provides for a cause of action for wrongful discharge if an employee is terminated because he or she serves as a juror.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 122.002 requires that a court award a prevailing plaintiff reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for prosecuting such a claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Similarly, Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code provides for recoupment of attorneys\u2019 fees for discriminatory practices such as retaliatory discharge.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These types of attorneys\u2019 fees provisions would be unnecessary if \u00a7 38.001(8) covered at-will employment agreements. That the Texas Legislature explicitly provided for attorneys\u2019 fees awards for these types of wrongful discharge claims indicates that \u00a7 38.001(8) does not include them within the purview of claims arising from a contract entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-16\">.

The district court rejected this argument, explaining that since the plaintiff did not plead that any or all of the conditions precedent to the recovery of attorneys' fees had been satisfied, the defendant was not required to specifically deny any conditions in order to force the plaintiff to meet his burden of proof.
