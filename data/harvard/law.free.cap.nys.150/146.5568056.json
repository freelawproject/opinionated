Plaintiff claimed to be entitled to three items of damages: $26.07, expense of attempting to trace the trunk; $85.07, clothing purchased to replace part of that lost; and $40.43, expenses of the trip on which such purchases were made. The clothing, the delivery of which was delayed, seems to have been of the value of about $900. The learned judge below awarded plaintiff $85.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-21\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> The defendant claims that the measure of damages is the value of the use of the clothing during the period of delay. This is quite correct. Under the circumstances of the case, the difference between the cost of plaintiff\u2019s intermediate purchases and their value to her at the time of the delivery of the missing trunk is the reasonable measure of this damage. See Cardozo v. Bloomingdale, 79 Misc. Rep. 605, 140 N. Y. Supp. 377. It is, if anything, more favorable to the defendant than, the precise rule to which it appeals. I also regard as a proper element of the cost of the articles purchased her expenses necessarily incurred in making the purchases. She is also entitled to recover the cost of her reasonable efforts to trace the lost property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>There is nothing in Brown v. Weir, 95 App. Div. 78, 88 N. J. Supp. 479, or Katz v. C., C., C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co., 46 Misc. Rep. 259, 91 N. Y. Supp. 720, which is relevant to the present controversy; nor does the decision in Palmer v. D. &amp; N. R. R. Co. (Sup.) 123 N. Y. Supp. 47, hold anything contrary to this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Defendant\u2019s claim that the limitation to $150 damage, contained in its published rates, applies, is answered by the case of Robinson v. N. Y. Central R. R. Co., 145 App. Div. 391, 129 N. Y. Supp. 1030, in view of the fact that no inquiry was made by defendant\u2019s agent as to the value of the contents of the trunk at the time it was delivered for transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
