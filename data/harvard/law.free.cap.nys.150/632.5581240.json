The order appealed from is merely an indorsement upon the summons of the words, \u201cDemurrer sustained.\u201d No formal order and no interlocutory judgment is in the record. This court has repeatedly held that no appeal will lie from an order of this character. Smith v. Ely, 46 Misc. Rep. 458, 92 N. Y. Supp. 310; Muttart v. Muttart, 93 N. Y. Supp. 468; Kemp v. Tonnele Co., 51 Misc. Rep. 49, 99 N. Y. Supp. 885; Brown v. Reiter, 51 Misc, Rep. 646, 99 N. Y. Supp. 861; Siegel v. Cantwell, 132 N. Y. Supp. 1146; Binder v. Robinson, 59 Misc. Rep. 155, 110 N. Y. Supp. 229; McManus v. McManus (October, 1914, Appellate Term) 150 N. Y. Supp. 87, not yet officially reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Section 334 of the Municipal Court Act provides: \u201cWhere a judgment is rendered on the trial of a demurrer, the prevailing party shall recover * * * costs, etc.\u201d This clearly intimates that a judgment, without calling it interlocutory or final, is contemplated. And section 145 provides that, \u201cwhere a demurrer is interposed and disallowed, the court must, notwithstanding the return day has passed, grant leave to plead as if no demurrer had been interposed.\u201d Such disposition of a demurrer is necessarily interlocutory in its nature. It cannot be a final judgment, else there would be no leave given to plead over: and as an appeal will lie from such orders only as are mentioned in sections <em>253-256 of </em>the Municipal Court Act, it follows that, before an appeal can be taken, a judgment must be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Appeal dismissed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
