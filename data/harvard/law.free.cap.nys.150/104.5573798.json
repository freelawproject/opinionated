Death benefits are paid under the provision\u2019s of the following by-law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-15\">\u201cOne year\u2019s membership and the payments for all dues, taxes, and fines having occurred against him, in the event of death, his widow or beneficiary may receive as a death benefit the sum of $100.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-16\">The case was heard on the pleadings and the by-laws, as a matter of law, and no evidence was introduced except a copy of the defendants\u2019 by-laws. The plaintiff sued as an administrator of the estate of the decedent. It appears that he was an uncle of the deceased member. As a matter of law, on the allegations of the pleadings and under the by-laws of the defendant lodge, we do not see how he is entitled to recover. The by-laws specifically state that no recovery may be had except by the widow or the beneficiary of a deceased member. Concededly, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate neither left a widow nor named a beneficiary. The by-laws are a binding contract between the lodge and its members. Hellenberg v. Ind.

Supp. 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-17\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and judgment entered for the defendant on the pleadings, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
