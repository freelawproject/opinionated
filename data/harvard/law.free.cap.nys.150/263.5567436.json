Plaintiff holds under a deed from Willard M. Smith, as executor and trustee under the last will and testament of Edwin H. Smith, deceased, who in his lifetime was the owner of the property in question. Edwin H. Smith died August 17, 1908, leaving him surviving no widow, but six children, all of whom were then infants, and were his only heirs at law. He left a will by which, after providing for the payment of his debts and funeral expenses, he disposed of his property as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\">\u201cSecond: I give, devise and bequeath to my brother, Willard M. Smith, my executor hereinafter named, all my estate, real, personal and mixed, and wherever situated, with full power to sell and dispose of the same as. he may see fit and the proceeds thereof to use for the maintenance, education and support of my following named children until the youngest surviving child shall have reached the age of 21 years, or shall be self-supporting; Loretta. Valles Smith, Edwin Mapes Smith, Florenc\u00e9 Maynard Smith, Willard Howard Smith, Bradley Walter Smith and Mary Frances Smith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-12\">\u201cThird: In the event of there being a surplus after the youngest of said children shall have reached the age of 21 years, said surplus to be distributed among all of said children share and share alike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-13\">\u201cFourth: In the event of the death of any of my said children without issue him or her surviving, then the share which he or she would take shall be divided among the remaining children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">The defendants\u2019 construction of the will, upon which it bases the claim of invalidity, is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-15\">\u201cThe words \u2018until the youngest surviving child shall have reached the age of 21 years\u2019 must be construed to mean until the majority of the youngest survivor of the six children of the testator named in the will (and who survived him) who shall reach the age of 21 years, or, in other words, until the youngest of said children attaining the age of 21 years should attain that age.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-16\">If this construction be upheld, it is clear that the will is violative of the statute against perpetuities, since the absolute power of alienation might be suspended for more than two lives. The plaintiff, however, contends that the true construction of the will is that the trust is limited upon the majority, or earlier death, of the youngest child surviving the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>In our opinion the latter construction is the natural and proper one to be adopted. Even if the language were ambiguous, it would be our duty so to construe it as to uphold the will, if under any reading that is possible. Hopkins v. Kent, 145 N. Y. 367, 40 N. E. 4; Jacoby v. Jacoby, 188 N. Y. 124, 80 N. E. 676. A somewhat similar use of words is found in the will under consideration in Matteson v. Falser, 56 App. Div. 91, 67 N. Y. Supp. 612, where the trust was to continue \u201cuntil the youngest survivor of my said nieces and nephews shall arrive at the age of thirty years.\u201d A majority of this court was of opinion that this meant the youngest living at the death of the testator. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, but expressly declined to pass upon this question. 173 N. Y. 404, 66 N. E. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\">In Coston v. Coston, 118 App. Div. 1, 103 N. Y. Supp. 307, the trust was to continue \u201cuntil the youngest of said children [of William F. Coston, deceased] shall attain the age of twenty-five years.\u201d The court held (Miller, J., writing) that the trust was valid, being limited upon the coming to the age of 25 years, or earlier dying, of the youngest of the children living at the death of the testatrix. A similar construction was given by the Court of Appeals to a will which suspended the apsolute power of alienation \u201cuntil the youngest child of them,\u201d to wit, of four named children, \u201cshall have attained the age of twenty-one years.\u201d Jacoby v. Jacoby, 188 N. Y. 124, 80 N. E. 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In our opinion, the construction of the will contended for by plaintiff is the correct one, and there should be judgment for her as prayed for in the submission, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
