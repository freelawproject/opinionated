The sharpening was done by repeatedly heating and hammering the cutting end of the drill. When sufficiently heated the drill was hammered out on a small slab of steel resting on the end of a bench or table supporting a lathe operated by artificial power and vibrating from the effect thereof. To enable him to hold and manipulate the drill, plaintiff was furnished with a pair of ordinary gas pliers, more or less defective from use. I am satisfied that the judgment was right so far as defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s absence from contributory negligence are concerned. The only question of any seriousness arises from the admission of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> One of the questions sharply contested on the trial was the appropriateness of the gas pliers and the steel slab with its uncertain support. Plaintiff contended that the proper implements with which he should have been furnished were a pair of blacksmith\u2019s tongs and a firmly supported anvil. To sustain this contention, testimony was offered in his behalf, tending to show a custom to use these latter devices. Such testimony was proper (Drummond v. Norton, 156 App. Div. 126, 133, 141 N. Y. Supp. 29), and the custom might have been of a limited character, in which case proof of defendants\u2019 knowledge was necessary, or it must have been so general as to have raised a presumption of knowledge on their part. Rickerson v. Hartford Ins. Co., 149 N. Y. 307, 316, 43 N. E. 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\"><bracketnum>[2-4]</bracketnum> Danks, a witness for plaintiff, testified that he had been a button cutter for 13 or 14 years, and had worked for defendants. He had worked in four or five shops in New York City and in Massachusetts shops. He was asked, \u201cWill you state ho'w that [the work of sharpening] was done in other shops?\u201d This was objected to on the ground that: (1) It called for a conclusion; '(2) expert 'testimony for the purpose of showing custom; (3) the witness is not <em>qualified </em>to testify on those subjects. None of these objections was tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The witness then answered that-in the other shops \u201cthere was either a man kept specially for that purpose of forging out drills * * * or they had proper tools.\u201d He was then asked, without objection, to describe the method customarily pursued, and he answered, without objection, \u201cThere is a blacksmith\u2019s anvil and a blacksmith's tongs.\u201d A sample of such tongs was offered in evidence, and the following question was asked: \u201cQ. Is that the tongs customarily used in this other place you have referred to? A. That is just the kind.\u201d After he had answered, plaintiff offered the tongs in evidence, and defendants\u2019 counsel said, \u201cI make the same,objection; it does not .tend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>to show <em>universal </em>custom\u201d; but he took no exception and asked for ri\u00f3 ruling, nor did he move to strike out the answer already received. Then, by the court\": <em>\u201cQ. </em>Is that the kind of tongs that is customarily used in the trade in doing the work which you have testified that you and the plaintiff were doing at the time of the accident? A. Yes, sir.\u201d The tongs were then offered and received in evidence over defendants\u2019 \u201csame objection\u201d and exception. I take it that \u201csame objection\u201d means that it did not tend to show universal custom; but the question formulated by the court was perfectly proper in form; the only possible objection being that there had been no proof that in fact there was any custom whatever, general or particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Lane, another witness called by plaintiff, had been a button cutter for 50 years, and had worked in five shops in New York City and vicinity, where it was the custom for the operators to sharpen their own drills. \u201cQ. Do you <em>know </em>the method and the tools that were customarily used for that purpose? A. Certainly. Q. On and prior to the 4th of September, 1912? A. Yes, sir.\u201d After the last answer had been received, the question which had_evoked it was objected to because it did not state whether it referred to any general custom, or only to the custom in shops in which the witness worked. But the form of this question was good, and the preceding question, to. which perhaps the objection was intended to be directed, was equally proper. The only objection to which the latter was open was again the fact that the witness had not specifically sworn to the existence of any custom. But as to this it may be said that if a workman in the trade for 50 years swears that he knows the \u201ccustom\u201d pursued in any particular department, presumably there must have been a custom, or he could not know of it. The witness was then asked to state what the custom was. This question was unsuccessfully objected to on the ground, not that there had been no proof that there was any custom, but that it did not appear that the witness was <em>\u201cqualified </em>to state the general custom in the business,\u201d and the witness answered, \u201cWell, the custom is of a man when he is drawing out his drills, these blacksmith\u2019s tongs are kept in the shop for his use and likewise an anvil.\u201d _As I haye said, it was competent for plaintiff to prove a proper custom, but of course it was not competent to prove the practice pursued in particular shops. I do not think, however, that defendants\u2019 objections were directed to this point; they went, rather, to the qualification of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, defendants moved to strike out the testimony of Danks and Lane\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">\u201cupon the ground that neither of those witnesses were <em>qualified, </em>* * * to testify as to custom, inasmuch as it appears from the evidence that there are at least 50 shops where this same work is done in New York City alone, and that according to the testimony of Danks, he only knows the instruments and the manner of the work that was done in four or five of these shops, * * * and Lane is familiar only with the manner in which the work is done and the instruments used in five of the shops, and that * * * they cannot possibly be <em>qualified </em>under those circumstances to testify as to the general custom in the business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">This again goes to qualification, and bases the lack of qualification on inability of the witnesses to testify as to what was done in <em>every </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>shop, which of course was not necessary. There can be no question as to the qualification of the witnesses, who were men of many years\u2019 experience in the trade and presumably knew its usages. Had objection been made that, before they could speak, they must first show that there <em>was </em>a custom, it might have been availing on this appeal. No such objection, however, was made. . Had it been, the proper question might have been put and answered satisfactorily. The point is narrow, and I do not think this judgment should be reversed in view of the failure of defendants to squarely bring to the attention of the trial court the points they now raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The judgment and order should- be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">CLARKE and DOWLING, JJ., concur.
