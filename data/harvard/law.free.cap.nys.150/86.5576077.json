Plaintiff\u2019s taxicab was crossing Broadway at Sixty-Ninth street, when it was struck by the defendant\u2019s touring car, going south on Broadway. The defendant was driving his own car, with his chauffeur sitting by his side, and evidence was excluded by the court that at the time the defendant, who had been placed under arrest, was in an intoxicated condition. Under the provisions of Highway Law, \u00a7 290, subd. 3, the operation of a motor vehicle by a person in an intoxicated condition is expressly prohibited, and an innocent party injured in consequence of a violation of this statute is entitled to his civil remedy for damages. Massoth v. Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company, 64 N. Y. 532. The evidence was material on this ground, and it had a further bearing on the defendant\u2019s .negligence by reason of the disinterested testimony of the witness Burt. He testified that the touring car was going down Broadway in a \"wabbly\u201d condition, and that it was running at the rate of from 55 to 60 miles per hour; that the taxicab was going east across Broadway, and that when it was near the center of the street it was struck by the defendant\u2019s <em>car; </em>and that no collision would have occurred if the defendant had directed his car to the rear of the taxicab.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
