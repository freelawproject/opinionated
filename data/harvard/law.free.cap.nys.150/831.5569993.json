The contract of employment gave defendant the right to discharge plaintiff at any time if \u201chis services proved unsatisfactory.\u201d Defendant\u2019s president testified that plaintiff, was discharged because defendant was dissatisfied with the pecuniary results of plaintiff\u2019s efforts, and also because the information he gave defendant concerning details of business with which he had to do was unreliable. Defendant moved for the direction of a verdict on the ground that there was no contradiction to defendant\u2019s testimony that plaintiff was discharged because his services were unsatisfactory. Although the motion well stated the fact as to any contradiction of defendant\u2019s testimony, it was denied, and defendant excepted. The learned court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-18\">That the right to determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s services were or were not satisfactory rested solely with the defendant, and that it was not a question for either the court or jury to decide whether the plaintiff ought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>or ought not to have been satisfied. That \u201cthe sole question to be decided by the jury is whether or not the defendant company discharged the plaintiff because it was actually dissatisfied with the services of the plaintiff and discharged him in good faith for that reason. * * * If you find * * * that the defendant company was dissatisfied, and that because of that dissatisfaction alone it discharged this plaintiff in good faith, it is your duty to find a verdict in favor of the defendant company. If, however, you find the contrary on this sole question in the case, then the plaintiff may recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">At defendant\u2019s request, the court further charged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-6\">\u201cThat, in view of the defendant\u2019s right to discharge the plaintiff in the. exercise of the defendant\u2019s discretion, it is unimportant to consider the question of whether the defendant was actuated by some ulterior motive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The court refused at plaintiff\u2019s request to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-8\">\u201cThat, if the jury find that the dissatisfaction of the defendant was assumed and not real and made for the purpose of reducing expenses or any other cause than that of dissatisfaction, they may find for the plaintiff.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Accepting the law to be as charged by the court (and of its correctness there can be no doubt), there was no question for the jury, because the uncontradicted evidence showed that plaintiff was discharged because defendant was dissatisfied with his services. It necessarily follows that the verdict had no evidence to support it, and that the complaint should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">The judgment should be reversed, and the complaint dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
