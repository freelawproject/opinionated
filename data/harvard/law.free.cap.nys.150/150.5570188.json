The evidence is meager and insufficient to establish a cause of action. Plaintiff proved that he was directed by his \u201cboss\u201d to dump a box, and that while engaged in that act his finger was caught and injured. The alleged negligence of the defendant seems to have been left entirely to conjecture; certainly it was not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-16\">Judgment reversed, and complaint dismissed, with costs in this court and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
