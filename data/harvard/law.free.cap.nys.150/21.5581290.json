For a second cause of action, and in the eighth paragraph of the complaint, the plaintiff pleaded the rendition of services at defendant\u2019s request, and in the ninth paragraph the reasonable value of said services. The answer, without referring to the two \u201cseparate defenses of action,\u201d admitted so much of the eighth paragraph as alleged the rendition of services by the plaintiff, but failed to deny the ninth paragraph, which alleged their reasonable value.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">At the trial, plaintiff moved, and was allowed, to discontinue as to the first cause of action, and secured the direction of a verdict on the second cause, on the ground that it was not denied. Defendant urged that the failure to deny the reasonable value of the services was a clerical oversight, and asked to withdraw a juror and to be allowed to apply at Special Term for leave to amend, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> Defendant then sought to introduce in evidence the contract in diminution of plaintiff\u2019s claim for the value of his services. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel admits on this appeal that under ordinary circumstances, and in conformity with the law as laid down in Rubin v. Cohen, 129 App. Div. 395, 113 N. Y. Supp. 843, such proof would have been competent and material, but claims that, the value of the services having been admitted by failure to deny, proof of the contract became immaterial. This contention, however, disregards the defendant\u2019s express pleading. Although the answer admits so much of the allegations contained in paragraph eighth as alleges the rendition of services to the defendant, and fails to deny the ninth paragraph, namely, the value of such services, it nevertheless continues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-13\">\u201cThis defendant alleges that the said services so rendered by the plaintiff to the defendant were rendered under and pursuant to the -agreement set forth in the second paragraph of the complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">In other words, defendant, admitting the <em>value </em>of plaintiff\u2019s services, alleges that, so far as its <em>obligation </em>is concerned, it is to pay, not the valu\u00e9, but the contract price. The direction of a verdict in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>plaintiff for the value, rather than for the contract price, of his services, was therefore error.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As the pleadings stood at the trial, the dismissal of the third cause of action should not have been upon the merits. The cause of action is for the return of $1,000, alleged to have been advanced by plaintiff to defendant under the terms of the contract. Plaintiff\u2019s proof, however, showed that he had advanced only $500. Since there must be a new trial of this case, it will probably accord with the spirit of. the decision in Muller v. City of Philadelphia, 113 App. Div. 92, 96, 99 N. Y. Supp. 93, to allow all the parties to apply for leave to put their pleadings in such shape as to present adequately the issues which they desire to have tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
