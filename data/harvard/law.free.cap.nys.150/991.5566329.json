The in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>dictment is for seduction under promise of marriage; it was found on October 24, 1913; the defendant was arraigned on the 29th of that month, and after pleading not guilty was released, pending trial, on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The motion was properly denied on the ground of laches, and the order must be affirmed; but'there is another reason for the affirmance. The motion was addressed to the sound discretion of the court, the order is not appealable, and we are therefore without power to review it. Matter of Montgomery, 126 App. Div. 72, 110 N. Y. Supp. 793; People v. Wendel, 128 App. Div. 437, 438, 112 N. Y. Supp. 837; People v. Zerillo, 140 App. Div.. 902, 125 N. Y.
