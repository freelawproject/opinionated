The question whether or not the accident was due, in part at least, to his contributory negligence, was a close one. The court declined to charge defendant\u2019s request that plaintiff had the burden of proving that her intestate \u201cwas free from carelessness or negligence which caused or contributed to the accident in question.\u201d The further request to charge \u201cthat section 84lb of the Code of Civil Procedure is not applicable to this action\u201d was also declined. Exception was in each instance duly noted in defendant\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Section 841b, above referred to, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\u201cOn the trial of any action to recover damages for causing death the contributory negligence of the person killed shall be a defense, to be pleaded and proven by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">This subsection was added by Laws 1913, c. 228. As provided by the terms of the enactment, it went into effect September 1, 1913. (It may be noted that another subdivision of the same section, designated also as 841b, was added at the same legislative session by chapter 395 of the Laws of that year. This latter subdivision concerns a subject other than that presented in the present action, and it is not possible that the court was misled by the failure of defendant\u2019s counsel to call attention more specifically to the exact provision to which he sought to direct the court\u2019s attention by the second request to charge above referred to.) The injury to plaintiff\u2019s intestate and his death caused thereby both occurred some months before the subdivision, quoted above, became a law. Unless this law is retrospective in operation and effect, defendant was entitled to have both requests charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">That it is not retrospective has been held in Sackheim v. Pigueron, 163 App. Div. 180, 148 N. Y. Supp. 27. That case was decided on the authority of Greif v. Buffalo, Lockport &amp; Rochester R. R. Co., 205 N. Y. 239, 98 N. E. 462, in which c\u00e1se it was held that section 202a of the Labor Law (Consol. Laws, c. 31; Laws 1909, c. 36), added by Laws 1910, c. 352, by which the contributory, negligence of an employ\u00e9 in an action brought by him or his personal representative against his employer to recover damages for negligence, arising out of and in the course of his employment, was declared to be a defense to be pleaded and proved by the defendant, was not retrospective. In the case of Clancy v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 157 App. Div. 337, 142 N. Y. Supp. 258, .the Second Department cites and follows the Greif Case. In view of the restricted application of the section, above referred to, as determined by the decisions in the cases hereinbefore cited, we must hold that the refusal of the trial court to charge defendant\u2019s requests was error; and for that reason the judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial directed, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
