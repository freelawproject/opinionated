The cause of action arises out of a suit brought against the plaintiff by reason of an accident and the settlement of that suit, after ample notice to defendant to undertake the defense thereof. The insurance covered loss arising \u201cby reason of the ownership, maintenance, or use\u201d of the automobile in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Apparently the dismissal was based on the theory that plaintiff\u2019s testimony disclosed a warranty in the policy to the effect that \u201cnone of the automobiles herein described are rented to others\u201d; whereas, the automobile involved in the accident was rented to others. The warranty in the policy, however, speaks as of its date\u2014i. e., May 14, 1912\u2014and cannot be held to have been violated because the automobile was rented out at the time of the accident, April 24, 1914. See Smith v. Mechanics\u2019 Co., 32 N. Y. 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
