The Municipal Court Act undoubtedly authorizes this practice, and upon such an appeal we can consider only the question whether by service of process the Municipal Court ever obtained jurisdiction of the defendant\u2019s person. If it never obtained such jurisdiction, the judgment is void, even though it appears that the person actually served was closely related to the defendant, and even though we may suspect that the defendant knew of the action, and is appealing only to escape a judgment for money actually due.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-22\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In this case the affidavits presented by the plaintiff show that he does not personally know the defendant, but relied for his identification upon some unidentified employ\u00e9s of defendant. On the other hand, not only does the defendant deny the service, but his broth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>er and two other persons swear that the summons was served on the brother in defendant\u2019s absence. Under the circumstances, I cannot see how we can reasonably hold that the defendant was ever served.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Judgment must therefore be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">DELANY, J., concurs. WHITAKER, J., dissents, upon the ground that appellant should have applied to the court in which the judgment was entered in the first instance for relief, and that an appeal to this court, without having made such an application, is not the proper practice, and is without statutory sanction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
