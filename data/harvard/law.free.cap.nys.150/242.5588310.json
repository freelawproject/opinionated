The answer alleged neither fraud nor mistake nor was the execution of the instrument denied or reformation thereof sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-18\">The defense was that defendant\u2019s dealings prior to the delivery of the instrument were with agents of the Grieve Company, with which company, and not with plaintiffs, defendant intended to and did in fact contract. Plaintiffs did not move for judgment on the pleadings, nor for the direction of a verdict, and notwithstanding the defense tendered no issue. Gordon Malting Co. v. Bartels Brewing Co., 206 N. Y. 528, 100 N. E. 457, 461. The action went to trial, and was tried on the theory that it did.
