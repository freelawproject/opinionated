For a first cause of action, plaintiff alleged a wrongful discharge under the following contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-16\">\u201cWilbur M. Oppenheimer agrees to travel for Heilbrun, Falk &amp; Co.,\u201d and the latter agrees to employ Oppenheimer, \u201cfor one year, commencing January 1, 1912, on a commission basis of 7% per cent, on all goods shipped\u201d; Oppenheimer \u201cto receive a drawing account of $30 per week, and traveling expenses, all to be charged against commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">The third cause of action is for disbursements made during the continuance of the employment. Defendant answered as to the first and third causes of action, and demurred to the second, which demurrer the court below held to be bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-18\">The second cause of action repeats the allegations of the first (1) touching partnership of defendants; (2) the execution of the contract, a copy of which is annexed to the complaint; and (3)' that plaintiff entered upon the performance of the contract and performed the same on his part. It then alleges that plaintiff\u2019s occupation was that of an embroidery salesman, and ^iis \u201cparticular territory or route was the states'of Indiana and Illinois, all of which facts were well known to defendants\u201d; that notwithstanding plaintiff\u2019s customers were in the territory aforesaid, through which territory it was agreed that plaintiff was to travel, after he had made a single trip, defendants refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>to permit him to revisit such territory, but retained him in their store in New York City, and later sent him to canvass territory which he had never covered before, and where he had no acquaintances or business, and being thus deprived of a fair opportunity to malee sales on which his compensation under the contract depended, plaintiff was greatly damaged in his business, and reputation as well, to his damage, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\">There is not a word in the contract limiting the territory in which plaintiff was to travel or effect his sales. Under these circumstances, the contract terms must prevail in preference to any construction which the pleader may by innuendo or otherwise be pleased to place upon it. Bogardus v. N. Y. Fife Ins. Co., 101 N. Y. 328, 4 N. E. 522; Gminder v. Zeltner Brewing Co., 126 App. Div. 776, 111 N. Y. Supp. 215; Winch v. Farmers\u2019 Foan &amp; Trust Co., 12 Misc. Rep. 291, 33 N. Y. Supp. 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs, with leave to plaintiff to amend on payment of said costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
