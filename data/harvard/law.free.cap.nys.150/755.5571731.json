He brought this action, the venue being laid in the county of New York, to recover the dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>ages alleged to have been sustained, on the ground that the same were caused by defendant\u2019s negligence. After issue was joined, defendant moved to change the place of trial to Greene county for the convenience of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The moving papers showed there were at least 11 necessary and material witnesses, all residents of that county. Notwithstanding no affidavits were presented on behalf of the plaintiff in opposition, the motion was denied. I think the motion should have been granted. The cause of action arose in Greene county. All of the witnesses, unless it be the plaintiff himself, reside in that county. Such facts brought the case within the general rule, which is that transitory actions should ' be tried in the county where the transaction involved in the controversy took place. Kaufman v. Kaufman, 152 App. Div. 100, 136 N. Y. Supp. 592; Van Alstine v. Burt, 151 App. Div. 81, 135 N. Y. Supp. 779; Fluckiger v. Haber, 144 App. Div. 65, 128 N. Y. Supp. 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The order appealed from, therefore, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
