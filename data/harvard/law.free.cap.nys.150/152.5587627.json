He filed a mechanic\u2019s lien, and on the same day began two actions, one to foreclose the mechanic\u2019s lien for work done and materials furnished, and the present one to recover damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-17\">The action to foreclose the mechanic\u2019s lien was first tried, and resulted in a judgment for plaintiff, which has been paid. Defendant now seeks to set up that judgment as a bar. Without expressing any opinion as to the sufficiency of the plea, we think that defendant should be afforded an opportunity to present it in such a manner that it can be properly adjudicated upon, and tested on appeal. The defendant, however, has delayed this application for some eight months, and in the meantime the cause has reached the day calendar. The defendant should not be permitted to profit by his delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-18\">The order appealed from will therefore be reversed, without costs, and the motion granted, upon condition, however, that the supplemental answer be served within five days, and, if plaintiff so elects, the cause shall retain its present position upon the calendar. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
