Defendant Koenig failed to establish his claim that he had given the three days\u2019 notice, required under his contract, that plaintiff was failing to keep a sufficient number of men upon the work, and that he would, proceed to complete the same at plaintiff\u2019s expense. He produced no copy of the alleged notice, and his uncertainty as to its date.(he being unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>state at first whether it was sent in December or in January), coupled with his failure to produce the records of the Post Office Department to show that such a registered letter as he described had been sent, rendered ineffective his testimony in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Nor do we think that the mere fact that plaintiff could use .such rock taken from the excavations as was found fit with which to build the wall, furnished any answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for extra work, due to the increase in the width of the wall which, as shown by the plans, was to be 18 inches, but which it is well established was in places as wide as 4 to 5 feet. It appears that part, at least, of this increased width, was due to the. instructions given by the engineer representing the park department, in charge of the work, that the excavation should be made 5 feet wider than was shown on the plans at certain parts thereof. It does not appear that the plaintiff did any unnecessary blasting, or took out any more of the rock, than he was required to do in order to perform his work under the contract. We do not think that the plans and specifications, so far as they are in evidence before us, negative the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover for this additional width of the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">We think, therefore, that plaintiff\u2019s recoveries in action No. 1, for $1,326.06, balance on the contract after allowing for the payments made and for the conceded unfinished work, and for the balance of $838 due for extra work, after allowing payments of $600 on account thereof, were justified by the evidence, and the findings in those particulars should be affirmed. We think, however, that the evidence in action No. 2 fails to justify the plaintiff\u2019s recovery of the amount which he has been awarded therein ($360.10), as the proof does not satisfactorily establish the doing of that work, or, in fact, the doing of any other work, by the plaintiff between the dates when it is claimed to have been done, namely, January <em>7, </em>1913, to January 15, 1913; nor is the work shown to have been additional to, and independent of, the work done to substantially perform the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">The judgment appealed from in action No. 1 will therefore be affirmed, with costs to the respondent. The judgment appealed from in action No. 2 will be reversed, with costs to the appellants; and judgment directed therein in favor of the defendants appellants, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
