The goods were delivered to the defendant in this city, on August 14, 1913, consigned to one Rubenstein, at Hannibal, Mo. They were transported by defendant and its connecting carriers, and tendered to the consignee on November 20, 1913. The shipment was refused by him. It is conceded that a reasonable time for the transportation of a shipment of this character, in the ordinary course of events, is six days. The delay between August 14 and November 20, 1913, and the defendant\u2019s responsibility for that delay is admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">The only question in the case is the measure of damages which the plaintiff was entitled to recover by reason of such delay. The proof showed that the goods consisted of ladies\u2019 and misses\u2019 cloaks and are what is known as \u201cseasonable\u201d goods. The plaintiff is entitled to recover only such damages as were reasonably within the contemplation of the parties when the contract of shipment was made. The damages allowed by the court below were based wholly upon the fact that the goods were seasonable, and there was no proof that the defendant had notice of this fact, nor was there any testimony given from which the defendant could be charged with such knowledge. The bill of lading simply described the goods as \u201c1 case elks.\u201d Under the decision in the case of Wolfe v. Weir, 61 Misc. Rep. 57, 112 N. Y. Supp. 1078, and Lichtenstein v. Fargo, 66 Misc. Rep. 149, 121 N. Y. Supp. 327, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-18\">BIJUR, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
