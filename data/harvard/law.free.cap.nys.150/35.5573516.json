It cannot be known to the court the exact amount of excess taxes which have in fact been collected. The order of this court should therefore remit to the board of supervisors of Nassau county the percentage at which the assessed value of the real property in the town of Hempstead bore to its full value, and under section 177 of the Tax Law the board of supervisors is required to carry into effect this determination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>This mandate requires the board, at its next annual session to levy upon the towns of North Hempstead and Oyster Bay such sum as will make full restitution to the town of Hempstead for the excess of taxes which have been collected, with interest from the 19th day of July, 1912.
