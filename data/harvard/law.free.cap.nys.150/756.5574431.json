The only exception to this rule is when the proposed amendment is purely formal and of a character which does not affect the issues. No such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>proposed pleading was served in the present case, and the motion for that reason should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Even if the motion papers had been sufficient to warrant the granting of the motion, the terms imposed were quite inadequate. The desired amendment, so far as we can judge of its character by the papers before us, completely changed the cause of action, and this, too, by reason of matters which the plaintiff should have known before the suit was originally commenced. In such a case substantial terms should be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs, with leave to renew upon proper papers and upon payment of said costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
