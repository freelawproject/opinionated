The agreement to pay plaintiff a percentage of the profits to be derived from certain contracts will bear the construction that the payment was to be of the profits as such. Furthermore, the agreement between the parties expressly provides for an accounting, and .it is perfectly apparent that, on whichever side of the court the actioil is to be tried, there must ultimately be a long and complicated accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>As to the John B. Carter Company, however, we can discern in the complaint no cause of action. It made no contract with plaintiff, and owed him no duty, nor is it alleged that for any reason it will be necessary to undertake to trace the profits into the hands of the John B. Carter Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The order appealed from by the Carter Construction Company will therefore be affirmed, with $10 costs and'disbursements, with leave to said appellant to withdraw the demurrer and answer within 20 days, upon payment of costs in this court and in the court below. The order appealed from by the John B. Carter Company will be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the demurrer sustained, with $10 costs, with leave to plaintiff to amend his complaint within 20 days, upon payment of all costs in this court and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
