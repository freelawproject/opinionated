Plaintiff, as assignee, sues to recover $1,500 for the purchase price of an automobile sold and delivered by plaintiff\u2019s assignor to defendant. Defendant denies the assignment, and pleads a counterclaim against plaintiff, based upon the contention that plaintiff\u2019s assignor and defendant made and delivered to Hilder their joint promissory note for $5,000, and that, to induce the defendant to sign such note, plaintiff\u2019s assignor agreed to indemnify the defendant to the extent of one-half the amount defendant was required to pay upon that joint note. Defendant claimed that, prior to the assignment to plaintiff, he paid the amount of the note and $300 interest. The defendant paid the original note of $5,000 by giving Hilder, the payee, his individual note and $300 interest. The assignment was fully proved. The question in dispute arises upon the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> It seems to be settled law that, if the defendant paid 'the whole amount of the joint note, he is entitled to contribution against the plaintiff\u2019s assignor. The giving by the defendant of his own note was not such a payment as entitled the defendant to contribution by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, unless the note was given in payment. Auerbach v. Rogin, 40 Misc. Rep. 695, 697, 83 N. Y. Supp. 154. If the creditors received the note of the defendant in- satisfaction of the joint debt, the defendant is entitled to contribution from the plaintiff. Repeated efforts were made by the defendant, both by questions asked and offers \u2019made, to show that the individual note of the defendant was received in payment of the joint note, and that when' the individual note became due it was paid in full by the defendant; but the court ruled out such offered testimony. These rulings were erroneous, and require a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
