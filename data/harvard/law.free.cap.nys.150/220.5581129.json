These persons in no way recognize the plaintiff, and claim no interest through him. The statute clearly requires that the plaintiff be in possession of the land as a condition precedent to registering the title. It is unnecessary to make the complaint more definite and certain, inasmuch as it clearly shows that the plaintiff does not occupy the land, either directly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>indirectly, and that his assertion of possession is denied by the physical fact that there is occupation under an adverse title.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The order and interlocutory judgment should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to the plaintiff to plead over within 20 days upon payment of such costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
