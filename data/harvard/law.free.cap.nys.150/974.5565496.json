The answer consisted of a general denial and a defense to the effect that, if the merchandise in question was delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant for carriage, it was so delivered under a special contract in writing, which provided that, in the event that the goods were damaged or lost, the defendant\u2019s liability should not be greater than $50, unless the true value at the time of shipment was stated by the shipper, and that no value had been stated to the defendant by the plaintiff, which in effect concealed the true value, if over $50, in order to secure the carriage at a cheaper rate than plaintiff otherwise would have received, had the real value been stated to the defendant, and that by reason of such facts the defendant was not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-18\">The merchandise shipped consisted of 592/is dozen men\u2019s handkerchiefs and 450 dozen children\u2019s handkerchiefs. The plaintiff made a specialty of making sets consisting of seven handkerchiefs, each hand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>kerchief of the set having stamped upon it a picture of a cat or dog, and an inscription showing one of the days of the week. These were \u00abknown to the trade as \"Cat and Dog\u201d handkerchiefs. Part of the shipment consisted of 450 dozen of these \u201cCat and Dog\u201d handkerchiefs, which had already been stamped with two or three appropriate days of the week, and th\u00e9se incomplete sets were being sent to the plaintiff\u2019s factory to be laundried and boxed and to be matched with handkerchiefs representing the other days of the week.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">At the trial it developed that on November 1, 1912, the plaintiff delivered to the defendant at New York City a case containing the men\u2019s and the children\u2019s handkerchiefs for carriage to plaintiff\u2019s factory at Passaic, N. J. The case was not delivered to the factory until December 21st, when the plaintiff refused to accept it, claiming that the goods were intended for the 1912 holiday trade, that they were seasonable goods, and that it had been compelled to replace the merchandise. Finally the shipment on the plaintiff\u2019s order was sent to the Merchants\u2019 Claim Association and sold by it for $40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">At the time that the plaintiff shipped the mechandise in question, the driver of the defendant\u2019s express wagon had signed a receipt tendered to him by the plaintiff. That form of receipt had printed upon the back thereof the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-6\">\u201c(3) <em>~ \u25a0' </em>* Tlie amount of any loss or damage for which any carrier becomes liable shall be computed at the value of the property at the place and time of shipment under this bill of lading, unless a lower value has been agreed upon or is tendered by the classification upon which the rate is based, in either of which events such lower value shall be the maximum price to govern such computation. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-8\">\u201c(8) Any alteration, addition, or erasure of this bill of lading, which shall be made without the special notation hereon of the agent of the carrier issuing this bill of lading, shall be void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">The said receipt was offered in evidence by the plaintiff, and received as Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 3. There is no testimony in the case to establish that the defendant\u2019s driver tendered to the plaintiff any bill of lading furnished by the defendant, limiting the amount of liability to $50 unless a greater value was stated. On this appeal the defendant accepts the plaintiff\u2019s receipt (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 3) signed by the defendant\u2019s driver as the written contract of shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">During the trial, the trial court received evidence of a prior parol agreement concerning the shipment of the plaintiff\u2019s goods, by which parol evidence the plaintiff sought to establish that the defendant had agreed to make immediate deliveries of the plaintiff\u2019s goods, and that the plaintiff had brought to the notice of the defendant that its goods were seasonable, and unless delivered immediately would be valueless. The trial court refused to permit the defendant to examine the plaintiff\u2019s witness as to value upon the cost of the labor and material in the goods lost, and on this appeal the defendant contends that it was not afforded the right to properly cross-examine, and that it was prejudiced by the admission of the testimony concerning the prior parol agreement. The complaint alleged that by reason of the failure of the defendant to deliver the goods in a seasonable time the <em>value of the goods was greatly depreciated.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>The damages asked for in the complaint were for a depreciation in the value of the children\u2019s handkerchiefs, which depreciation was figured at 50 cents per dozen. The bill of particulars also estimated, the depreciation at 50 cents per dozen, less the $40 obtained on the sale of the goods by the Merchants\u2019 Claim Association; but on the trial the claim of depreciation was seemingly abandoned, and an attempt was made to prove the co\u00a7t of the goods alleged to have been misdelivered. The plaintiff\u2019s witness Bauer, testifying as to the value, etc., said that the <em>depreciation </em>was <em>Ifi cents a dozen </em>figured on the cost value, and that the <em>cost </em>of the goods was <em>lfl cents a dozen; </em>that he was suing for the <em>value </em>of the goods; that he had nothing to do with estimating the damages, and did not know the value the depreciation was based on in the bill of particulars. Later he said that the depreciation was based on the difference in the cost at <em>50 cents per dozen </em>and what had been finally realized for them at the sale. On redirect examination, he said that he did not mean 40 cents was the cost, that <em>to get the cost he would have to refer to his records at the factory, </em>and that 50 cents a dozen would be a <em>fair value. </em>On cross-examination he said that his estimate of the cost at 50 cents a dozen was on the completed article, and included <em>ironing, pressing, and everything else </em>to be done. Later he said that his estimate of 50 cents a dozen as the cost did not include pressing, ironing, boxing, etc. He was then asked:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-5\">\u201cQ. Didn\u2019t you give us the estimate of the completed article? A. The value of this article\u2014I couldn\u2019t state the value of the completed article; it is a trade secret. /</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-6\">\u201cThe Court: That you may state: What is the value of the completed article, the cost price\u2014what is it? A. About 65 cents a dozen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">The witness, in explaining the cost of the tearing in preparing the handkerchiefs, was asked whether it was by the dozen or by the yard, and replied that he could not answer that, as it was a trade secret. When he was asked if it cost 40 cents a dozen to manufacture the handkerchiefs, the trial judge sustained the objection of plaintiff\u2019s counsel. When asked what the cost of the handkerchiefs without the stamping was, he was sustained in his refusal to answer the question on the ground that it was a trade secret. The defendant\u2019s attorney took exceptions to the trial judge\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">It will be seen from the foregoing, and from an inspection of the record below, which is very much complicated, that the witness Bauer testified, first, to a cost price at 40 cents, then at 50 cents, then at 65 cents per dozen, and that to get the cost he would have to refer to the factory records. Throughout his testimony, he seemingly confused the terms \u201cdepreciation,\u201d \u201ccost price,\u201d \u201cvalue,\u201d \u201closs,\u201d etc., as meaning one and the same thing, and did not know on what value he based his claim of depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> The plaintiff affects to sue for the value of the depreciation of the lost goods, which he had refused to receive when offered for delivery too late. This is not the measure of damage. He claimed that it became necessary for him to replace the goods, and that he did replace them,\u201d and we may assume that the cost of replacing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>goods was the measure of the damage which he sustained. To the attempt\u2018to bring out on cross-examination the cost of production of the replaced goods, the plaintiff objected on the ground that the cost of production was a trade secret, and under exceptions these objections were sustained. This was, we think, error: First, in allowing improper evidence as to the damage; and, secondly, in denying to the defendant a proper cross-examination, which might have shown, among other things, the loss sustained. The privilege of what is called \u201ctrade secret\u201d is not available under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-3\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
