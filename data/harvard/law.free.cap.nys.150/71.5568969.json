The defendant pleaded infancy. It is conceded that the defendant was an infant at the time that the contract was made. The plaintiff seeks to overcome this defense by the claim that after the defendant became of age he wrote the plaintiff, asking that an itemized bill be sent to him. This act was not such a ratification of the contract of guaranty as to render the defendant liable upon it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>22 Cyc. 604, and cases cited; International Text-Book Co. v.
