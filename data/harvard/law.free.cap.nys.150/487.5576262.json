All these questions were excluded by the trial justice, apparently on the ground that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>immaterial under the issue raised by the pleadings. The defendant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">\u201cI do not claim there was an agreement in express words, but I am attempting to prove the circumstances which it seems to us gave rise to such an implication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The questions asked by the defendant seem to me clearly material upon the issue raised by the answer, that the option to return within 30 days was waived by an agreement that the defendant should be permitted to make a longer trial. A contract may be concluded by clear and express promises, or by acts and conversations from which such promises may be implied, and whether such an agreement as pleaded is shown by express promise or by necessary inference is immaterial, for in either event it would act as a waiver of the time limit of the original contract. The answers to the questions excluded might well be expected to show acts and conversations from which the agreement pleaded might be inferred, and their exclusion in my opinion constitutes such error as requires a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The respondent seeks to sustain these rulings upon the ground that the facts and circumstances upon which an implied agreement rests should be pleaded, but I know of no authority or reason for such a rule. He also, claims that the defendant did not show any authority in defendant\u2019s representative to make such an agreement. While some questions were objected to on this ground, it is quite evident that the objections were not sustained on this ground, and that the defendant could probably have supplied this defect, if it had constituted the real ground of exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
