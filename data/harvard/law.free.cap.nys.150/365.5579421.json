From a decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court, charging the administrator with certain funds claimed individually by him, in that they were the proceeds of moneys jointly owned by himself and intestate, his deceased wife, and also charging him with the principal of a note found among the effects of intestate, he appeals. Reversed, and remitted to the surrogate for further proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-11\">The administrator and intestate were husband and wife, and prior to May, 1906, were the owners of certain real property, which was purchased from them by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, they receiving $14,000 net, which on May 7, 1906, was deposited by both of them in the Corn Exchange Bank in their joint names. The fund remained there intact until the wife, without the knowledge or consent of her husband, on October 16, 1906, withdrew $6,0b0 of the fund and deposited it in her own name in a special account with the same bank. On July 15th she withdrew from such special ac- . count $2,500 and deposited it in her own name with the German Savings Bank, and subsequently reduced her account in these banks to the balance with which the decree appealed from charged the administrator, to wit, $1,532.05 in the Corn Exchange Bank and $2,550 in the German Savings Bank. There was also evidence of a note made to intestate by one Albert Klenk for $2,000, and claimed to be for money withdrawn from the deposits by intestate and loaned to him.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b399-12\">Argued before JENKS, P.
