It appears that upon the.trial the defendants consented to a nonsuit as to the second and third counterclaims and introduced no evidence thereupon, whereupon the court dismissed the same. So much of the decision and judgment, therefore, as adjudges the dismissal of these counterclaims upon the merits is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">As to the third counterclaim, the defendants introduced proof and the court dismissed the same at the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s case thereupon. The decision must therefore be modified by substituting in place of the third conclusion of law the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-17\">\u201cThat tile plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the defendants, Otto Lorence and Jacob Lazarowitz, dismissing the first and second counterclaims set forth and alleged in the answer of said defendants, and further dismissing the third counterclaim set forth in said answer upon the merits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-18\">The fourth conclusion of law in the decision should be modified by changing the second paragraph thereof to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-19\">\u201cI therefore direct the entry of judgment in favor of plaintiff and against the defendants, Otto Lorence and Jacob Lazarowitz, dismissing the first and second counterclaims set forth and alleged in the answer of the said defendants, and further dismissing the third separate counterclaim set forth in said answer on the merits, with one jfill of costs to all counterclaims awarded to the plaintiff against the defendants, Otto Lorence and Jacob Lazarowitz.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-20\">The judgment should be modified by changing the first paragraph of the directory clause thereof as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-21\">\u201cOrdered, adjudged, and decreed that the first and second separate counterclaims set forth and alleged in the answer of the defendants, Otto Lorence and Jacob Lazarowitz, be, and the same are, hereby dismissed, and further that the third separate counterclaim set forth in said answer be dismissed on the merits, and one bill of costs as to all counterclaims is hereby awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>to the plaintiff against the defendants, Otto Lorence and Jacob Lazarowitz, to be taxed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">As thus modified, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed, with costs to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
