that Adolph Philipp is a well-known author of German plays and a composer of music and a German actor and singer, and for upwards of 20 years last past has been connected with and has acted in German plays in the city of New York and elsewhere, and has achieved a great reputation and high esteem among the German people and German theater goers in particular, for which reason the plaintiff was incorporated under his name and he was elected its president, treasurer and manager, and the plaintiff has secured his services as an author, producer, composer, and singer, and procured said theater to be erected and took possession thereof under a binding lease for 21 years from October 1, 1912, and named the theater with a view to obtaining the benefits and advantages of the good name of Philipp, and has made large expenditures in the establishment of its business; that it opened the theater for the purpose of rendering performances therein in the German language on or about the 24th day of November, 1912, and successfully produced therein in the German language several plays adapted and staged by said Adolf Philipp, and that thereby said theater became widely known and highly reputed and esteemed by the public at large and German theater goers as a German theater of high class and wholesome entertainment and amusement in the German language; that the theater was successful and became a source of large income, revenue, and profit to the plaintiff; that owing to these facts the managers of English productions became accustomed to visit said theater whenever a new production was presented and to buy the English rights therefor on the basis of a royalty to plaintiff, and that royalties received from such source afforded plaintiff additional income and profit, all of which was known to the defendant; that prior to the month of January, 1914, the plaintiff, at a great expenditure of money, procured a certain play in the German language based upon the controversy shortly theretofore reported in the defendant\u2019s and other newspapers between several of the officers of the German army and some of the civilian residents of Zabern, in one of the provinces of the German Empire, which play was revised and adapted for the plaintiff by said Philipp, and was produced by the plaintiff at said theater under the title of \u201cZabern\u201d on the 28th of January, 1914, at an outlay of over $5,000, and proved to be a great success, and was attended by many Germans residing in the city of Greater New York and vicinity, all of whom expressed their appreciation of the play and of the production and performance thereof, and that by reason thereof the production of the play at 'the plaintiff\u2019s theater became widely known, well liked, and frequently visited by many of the German theater goers until shortly after the first publication of which the plaintiff complains; that after several performances of the play a well-known manager and producer of English plays negotiated with plaintiff and offered to buy The rights for the English production of the play, \u201cwhich the plaintiff was about to sell to him upon terms and conditions greatly advantageous and remunerative to this plaintiff\u201d; that by reason of the publication by defendant of the article, of which complaint is made, and the impression it was calculated and intended to make upon the German theater goers and the public at large, known as \u201cGerman\u00c1inericans,\u201d the offer theretofore made to the plaintiff by the prospective purchaser of the English rights of the production was withdrawn, specifically on the ground that the prospective purchaser feared to undertake the production of the play in English lest he incur the enmity and hatred of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>public, who had been enraged against the play by said publication, and that thereby \u201cthis plaintiff was deprived of the benefits of the English rights of production of the said play \u2018Zabern,\u2019 to the damage of this plaintiff in royalties and compensation to the extent of many thousands of dollars\u201d; that the defendant is a domestic corporation, and owns and publishes in the city of New York three newspapers in the German language, namely, a morning edition known as the \u201cNew Yorker Staats-Zeitung,\u201d an evening edition known as the \u201cAbendblatt der New Yorker Staats-Zeitung,\u201d and a Sunday edition known as the \u201cSonntagsblatt der New Yorker Staats-Zeitung,\u201d which have a very large circulation and were and are issued in several editions daily, and are daily read by several thousand German-speaking people throughout the United States, and particularly and mainly within the city of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1081-3\">It is then alleged in each count that the alleged libel of which complaint is therein made was <em>falsely, wizckedly, and maliciously composed, printed, and published </em>in the German language <em>and circulated </em>broadcast \u201cof, and concerning the plaintiff, its theater, its officers, its business, and its property,\u201d and that the defendant at the time of the publication was well aware of the facts hereinbefore stated, and composed and published the articles <em>with malicious and wicked intent to injure the plaintiff \u201cin its business\u201d and \u201cin the good name and reputation of\u201d its said theater and of said play, and \u201cto bring the plaintiff\u2019s theater and its business and the said play \u2018Zabern\u2019 into public scandal, infamy, and disgrace, and to hold this plaintiff, its officers, its business, and\u201d said play, which it owned, \u201cup as an object of hatred, ridicule, contempt, and obloquy.\u201d </em>Following the quotation of the alleged libelous article, it is alleged in each count, in substance, that the publication was widely circulated in the city of New York, and in other cities and states of the Union, and was read and understood by hundreds of thousands of German-speaking people, which caused \u201cthe plaintiff, its theater, and the said play \u2018Zabern\u2019 to be condemned, shunned, and boycotted by all German theater goers, including those who, prior to the said publication, visited, appreciated, and lauded the plaintiff\u2019s theater and its productions, and, as a result thereof, the German public ceased to patronize the plaintiff\u2019s theater and the said performance of \u2018Zabern,\u2019 causing this plaintiff great damage and injury in its good name and reputation with the German theater goers and great financial loss in its said business\u201d; that the publication caused and provoked the \u201cGerman theater goers in the city of New York and vicinity to shun and avoid the plaintiff\u2019s theater and to withhold their patronage from the plaintiff and its said business,\u201d and caused and incited each of several German societies and associations \u201cto adopt and promulgate among its members resolutions censuring the plaintiff and its production of said play \u2018Zabern,\u2019 and calling upon its members and other German societies to boycott and withhold their patronage and support from the plaintiff\u2019s said theater,\u201d to its great damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1081-4\">The first article is alleged to have been published in the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung on the 29th day of January, 1914, and the English translation thereof, with the innuendoes in parentheses, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1081-5\">\u201cZabern.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1081-6\">\u201cWell, last night there was given by Adolf Philipp (meaning the president and treasurer of the plaintiff), in the 57th Street Theater (meaning the said plaintiff\u2019s theater), \u2018Zabern,\u2019 a military drama, in three acts, by F.

There is no allegation with respect to the amount that plaintiff was offered for the English rights for the production of the play, or with respect to the damages sustained by the withdrawal thereof. There is no allegation that any particular patron or patrons of the theater, who otherwise would have attended, remained away on account of the publication; nor is there any allegation of any particular loss of box receipts on account of any of the publications. The allegations with respect to the withdrawal of the offer for the English rights, and instigating a boycott against the plaintiff\u2019s theater, are the only ones which it is or could be claimed constitute allegations of special damage. The general rule applicable to actions for libel and slander is that, if special damages are claimed, they must be expressly alleged, and with such particularity as to enable defendant to meet the charge, and in this respect such actions are unlike those in which the defendant\u2019s remedy is for a bill of particulars, if the damages are not alleged with sufficient definiteness. Reporters\u2019 Association v. Sun Printing &amp; Pub. Ass\u2019n, 186 N. Y. 437, 79 N. E. 710. I am therefore of opinion that such special damages are not alleged, and that the sufficiency of each cause of action depends upon whether the article therein quoted was published of and concerning the plaintiff and was libelous per se with respect to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It is to be borne in mind that the articles were all published in German. They are alleged in the complaint as published in the German language, and this is followed by the English translation thereof, with the innuendoes in parentheses. Each of the articles relates to-the production of this play at the plaintiff\u2019s theater; but neither the corporate name of the plaintiff nor of the theater is given, and it is charged that the production was given by Adolf Philipp at the Philipp Theater, or the Fifty-Seventh Street Theater. The plaintiff claims that each of the articles libeled it in its business. The defendant claims that it is not shown, and cannot be made to appear by innuendo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>that the articles were in any respect published of or concerning the plaintiff, for the reason that they relate principally to the authorship of the play and to Philipp individually as an actor, playwright, and theatrical manager. I am of opinion that there is no force in this contention. We are not now concerned with those parts of the articles relating to Philipp individually, or with the motive of the author of the play; but in so far as they reflect upon the management of the theater, and the character of the play it was producing, and the motive underlying its production by the plaintiff, they are sufficiently shown to have been published of and concerning the plaintiff by the mere allegation that the plaintiff is the lessee of the theater and producing the play thereat, and no innuendo was necessary, and, being superfluous, they are harmless. Soper v. Associated Press, 115 App. Div. 815, 101 N. Y. Supp. 342, affirmed 188 N. Y. 550, 80 N. E. 1120; Nunnally v. New York, etc., 111 App. Div. 482, 97 N. Y. Supp. 911; Weston v. Commercial Adv. Association, 184 N. Y. 479, 77 N. E. 660. See, also, Parker v. Bennett, 68 App. Div. 148, 74 N. Y. Supp. 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-3\"><bracketnum>[4-6]</bracketnum> If the articles merely constitute a libel or slander on the theater or the play, as distinguished from the plaintiff and its business, and the nature and management thereof, then they would fall within the rule that an action for libeling a \u201cplace or thing\u201d will not lie without allegation and proof of special damages. See Marlin Firearms Co. v. Shields, 171 N. Y. 384-390, 64 N. E. 163, 59 L. R. A. 310; Maglio v. New York Herald Co., 83 App. Div. 44, 82 N. Y. Supp. 509, and 93 App. Div. 546, 87 N. Y.

I am of opinion that the articles relate to the theatrical business conducted by the plaintiff, and to the plaintiff\u2019s production of the play \u201cZabern,\u201d and therefore they r\u00e9late to the plaintiff\u2019s business. It is now well settled that an article may be libelous per se against a corporation. There is, however, a marked difference between an action by an individual for libel and one by a corporation, inasmuch as the basis of an action by an individual is usually the injury to his moral character and reputation, whereas, those elements are necessarily eliminated in an action by a corporation, which can only be damaged by an attack upon its business methods of a nature calculated and tending to injuriously affect it pecuniarily in its business reputation and credit; but when it may fairly be inferred from a malicious and false publication that it will injuriously affect the corporation in its business and credit, then the article is libelous per se and damages are presumed.

I do not deem it nec\u00e9ssary, and it would unduly lengthen this opinion, to separately analyze and discuss the different articles. It is evident to me, on reading them in the light of these rules of law, that some of them do not exceed the -bounds of fair and honest criticism, and do not necessarily tend to injure the plaintiff in its business and credit, and although the line of demarcation is not so well defined that the task is easy, I am of opinion that the alleged libelous articles set forth in the first, second, and ninth counts fall in this category. On the other hand, it is quite clear that the articles which are the bases of the other causes of action alleged are not pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>tected by the qualified privilege, for they are not confined to criticism of the play, and to informing the public with respect to the nature thereof, or of defendant\u2019s views concerning it, but constitute aspersive attacks in violent and intemperate language upon the plaintiff\u2019s business, and upon its motive in producing the play by what are conceded by the demurrer to be false charges with respect to the character of the play, that are calculated and expressly stated to be intended to induce the German-speaking public to refrain from patronizing the theater, and thereby to inflict damages upon the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-3\">It follows, therefore, that the order, in so far as it overrules the demurrer to the first, second, and ninth causes of action, should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and in all other respects affirmed, without costs, but with leave to defendant to withdraw its demurrer to the other causes of action and to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\">INGRAHAM, P.

Instances are not wanting where such attack has been deliberately made, with the hope of consequent profit from the section of the community holding different views from the one attacked. In so far as the articles complained of referred to the business conducted by the plaintiff, they were criticisms directed against an enterprise which, while posing as a German theater, and appealing for support solely to the German\" element in this city, for reasons of its own chose to present a play which was repugnant to the ideas of Germans who still entertained an affection for the country of their birth. The feeling of hostility which might reasonably be supposed to be aroused by such a course of conduct was aggravated by the presentation of this play, having to do with the German military system, at a time when Germany\u2019s relations with at least one other nation referred to were strained. Tor the proprietors of a German theater to present a play involving issues vital to Germany and lying at the very root of the controversial issues then being vigorously debated, it seems to me was an open invitation to a discussion by Germans of its methods and motives, which was bound to be severe, and perhaps could not escape being abusive. So far as the English translation of these articles discloses, they contain such criticism as might be expected to be called for in response to the plaintiff\u2019s production of the play; and, having in view all the conditions under which the play was produced and the articles published, I do not think that they are libelous, or that they go further than might naturally be expected under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>There being no appropriate allegation of special damage, and the articles in my opinion not being libelous per se, I believe the demurrers to all the causes of action should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">SCOTT, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
