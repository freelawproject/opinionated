The answers put in issue all the material allegations of the complaint, with the exception of the averment that the parties are attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">The order, made on application of defendant Smith, requires that a bill of particulars be served with respect to eight matters, specified in eight paragraphs, designated (a) to (g), inclusive. Under the well-settled practice, the first six provisions were clearly authorized. The seventh, designated paragraph (f), requires a statement of the days on which the services were rendered and the specification of the \u201cexact nature of the services rendered on each day\u201d and the time devoted thereto ; and the eighth, designated paragraph (g), requires a statement of \u201cthe value of each item of service\u201d for which a recovery is sought. The preceding paragraphs of the order require an itemized statement of the services rendered. That should suffice on that particular point, for it necessarily requires a definite statement with respect to the services, which embraces the nature and extent thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">There is no occasion for requiring the plaintiff to specify the <em>particular days </em>on which the services were rendered, or the <em>time </em>occupied <em>each day. </em>The other requirements, that the defendant be furnished with a statement of the services claimed to have been rendered, if complied with, will give all the information essential to enable the defendant to defend the action, and if those requirements be not fully complied with the defendant has-a remedy by further motion. The well-settled practice requires that such a statement be sufficiently comprehensive and definite to enable an adverse party to obtain advice and to offer opinion evidence thereon with respect to the value of the services. In such a case, the value of each item of service need not be stated. The rule is that the party should state separately the value of the services claimed to have been rendered with reference to each separate action or matter in its entirety. Pace v. Amend et al., 149 N. Y. Supp. 738 (decision rendered November 6, 1914, App. Div., 1st Dept.); Aub v. Hoffmann, 120 App. Div. 50, 104 N. Y. Supp. 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">The order should therefore be modified, by striking out paragraphs (f) and (g), and inserting in place thereof the following: \u201c(f) Separately the value of the services with respect to each separate matter\u201d\u2014 and, as modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
