The only threatened interference with plaintiff\u2019s \u201crights and property\u201d ascertainable from the record is an apprehended action to enforce payment of the moneys to become due under the agreement. Plaintiff needs no injunction to protect him from an assignment by defendant of his claim for these moneys, because any such assignment would be subject to his equities. Nor should defendant be restrained from prosecuting an independent action'to recover the unpaid moneys, and thus be driven into establishing his right to such moneys by a counterclaim in this action: (1)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-15\">Because it is doubtful whether such a counterclaim could be properly interposed herein, inasmuch as the basis of this action is fraud; and (2) defendant has a right, under the circumstances, to choose his own forum for the enforcement of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-16\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary injunction denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
