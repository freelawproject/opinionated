H. Macy &amp; Co.\u2019s department store. The plaintiff testified that she was standing in one of the aisles of the store, between-the counters, upon which goods were placed for display and sale, and was directing a customer to another part of the store, when a large board, to which were attached three brass fire extinguishers, fell from one of the counters and struck her in the foot, causing the injuries of which she complains. The board in question had been resting upon an easel upon the counter, and was used to display the fire extinguishers for sale. Daniel J. Murphy, who was the person in charge of the entire basement of the department store, in which place the accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>occurred, was called by the plaintiff, and testified that he had charge of the placing of goods upon the counters, and that they were placed there under his direction. He also stated that the fire extinguishers were placed within about four inches from the end of the table.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The defendant called several of the girls employed in the plaintiff\u2019s section, who testified that the fire extinguishers had remained on the table for several weeks before the accident occurred, in the same position in which they were when they fell. One of the defendants\u2019 witnesses testified that she was within five or six feet of the accident when it occurred, and saw it, and that she saw Marian Wolfert, a saleswoman in the defendants\u2019 employ, push a pastry board, which was displayed on the same counter at the Side of the fire extinguishers, which act jarred the extinguishers and caused them to fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Maria.n Wolfert was called in rebuttal by the plaintiff. She admitted that she was selling a board from the same counter at the time of the accident, but stated that she was about five feet from the counter at the time, and did not push it, and that the board was not near the fire extinguishers.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The learned trial justice rendered a decision awarding $150 damages to the plaintiff. I am unable to find in the record any evidence of negligence upon the part of the defendants or their superintendents. The only evidence offered as to the cause of the falling of the extinguishers was that of the defendants\u2019 witness, Showing that they were pushed by one of plaintiff\u2019s fellow servants, for which the defendants would clearly not be liable. This evidence was denied by the plaintiff\u2019s witness, to whom credence was apparently given by the court in preference to the defendants\u2019 witness. There was no evidence of a defect in the easel upon which the extinguishers were displayed, and no evidence that they were placed in a dangerous position upon the counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The mere statement of one of the witnesses that they had previously fallen from another counter was no evidence of negligence, in the absence of proof as to the cause of the previous fall; and the fact that they had previously fallen would not be notice to the company that they were inherently dangerous, unless it appeared that they had inflicted damage on the previous occasion which was not shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The case is certainly not one to which the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur could apply. From the mere fact that the extinguishers fell from the counter it cannot be assumed that they were negligently placed, or that it was negligence to display them upon a counter. They may have been pushed accidentally by one of the clerks, or even by a passing customer, and the chance of a human being having the misfortune to be standing in the spot upon which they fell was so remote that the general situation could not be said to be inherently dangerous or unsafe.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">The judgment is totally unsupported by proof of negligence in the defendants, and should be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">BIJUR, J., .concurs.
