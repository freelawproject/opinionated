It seems that the learned trial court directed the verdict upon the assumption that the plaintiff had truly expended $150 for medical services, that he had been paid during his disability the same compensation that had been theretofore paid him for his services, and that under such circumstances $1,000, in addition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>to the amount of the disbursement for medical attendance, was an adequate and fair compensation for the injury he had sustained. I think that this view entirely ignores the uncontradicted testimony that plaintiff was incapacitated for 25 weeks, and that, although he was paid during that time his regular weekly compensation of $26, he was compelled during all of that time to hire help to keep up his route, and paid, such help more for their services than he received from the defendant, and that since he returned to work his physical condition, caused by his injury, has necessitated his employing an assistant at a weekly compensation of $8 to do the same work that he had done alone before the accident. The evidence establishes, without contradiction, a loss to the plaintiff resulting from his injury of at least $26 a week for 25 weeks\u2014a total of $650, which, added to the $150 paid for medical services, leaves only $250 as compensation for the pain and suffering he has concededly endured, and for his present defective and impaired physical condition, which is inadequate for the injury he sustained. Although the trial court seems to have had some doubt as to whether the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence, it permitted it to stand if reduced to $1,150. A careful consideration of the evidence satisfies me that it sustains the conclusion reached by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The order appealed from must be reversed, and the verdict of the jury in favor of the plaintiff for $2,000 reinstated, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">JENKS, P. J., and STAPLETON, J., concur. BURR and THOMAS, JJ., vote to affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
