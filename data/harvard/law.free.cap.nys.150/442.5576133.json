While it is not entirely clear that this statute properly devolves such power upon the court, we feel that we should not pass upon that question upon an ex parte application. Not only has the superintendent of banks formally approved of this petition, as required by the statute, but in attendance upon us he states that it is his best judgment that this is a wise measure, because the alternative is immediate winding up of the association by the department of banks, which would entail great loss to those interested in the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The order is experimental. If it is ultra judicial, no rights of any of the members are affected. In any event, it is made without prejudice to any present right of action which any member has against the officers or directors of the association for misfeasance or malfeasance in office. The superintendent of banks has given to the court his assurance that he will subject the association to frequent visits, which will involve almost constant scrutiny into the future conduct of the association.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b477-6\">PUTNAM, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AW2a\">By section 278 of the former Savings Bank Law (chapter 409, Laws of 1882), in certain cases of misconduct or impairment of assets, the Attorney General could institute judicial proceedings in which the court, having become regularly possessed of the cause, could look into and pass upon a measure scaling down depositors\u2019 claims. People v. Ulster Co. Savings Institution, 64 Hun, 434, 18 N. Y. Supp. 960. The court could then act judicially, and its orders were effective as against the depositors. But the present amended Banking Law (chapter 369, Laws of 1914) simply provides (by section 404) for an order made ex parte on the directors\u2019 petition, approved by the superintendent of banks, which on its face cuts, down a deposit without a hearing, and thus affects rights which the court has no means adequately to look into. An order so made, which indorses and confirms the vote of the directors, can only be administrative even if bearing the signature of a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Hence I dissent, on the ground that this amendment, which calls for a court order, but without court nroceedings, attempts to put on the court nonjudicial functions, and is therefore unconstitutional.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
