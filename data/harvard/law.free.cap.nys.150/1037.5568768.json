The question raised by the sheriff\u2019s appeal is whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to any relief as against him. Plaintiff entered a judgment in the City Court against defendant and immediately issued an execution thereon to the sheriff. Much is said in the moving papers about the action of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, from which we are asked to infer that he should not have entered judgment and issued execution when he did. All that is immaterial on the present appeal, which is prosecuted by the sheriff alone, and he is not charged with complicity in anything- which plaintiff\u2019s attorney may have done before the issue of the execution. The grounds for holding the sheriff liable to refund the poundage and keeper\u2019s fees paid to him are that the execution itself was invalid for defects appearing upon its face. These defects are: First, that the execution appeared to be issued out of the Supreme Court, and was tested in the name of a justice of that court, whereas the judgment was entered in the City Court; second, that the sheriff was directed to return the execution to the county clerk, instead of to the clerk of the City Court; and, third, that the execution was indorsed with the name of the Supreme Court, instead of the City Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The last objection is of no moment, because the indorsement of the title of the action on the back of the paper is no part of the execution, which would be valid if wholly unindorsed. The execution (the original being produced on the argument) correctly recites that the judgment was recorded in the City Court and the judgment roll filed in the office of the clerk of that court. As received by the sheriff, it directed him to return the execution to the county clerk, and was tested in the name of a justice of the Supreme Court. Later these errors were corrected by or with the consent of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the clerk of the City Court being substituted for the county clerk, and the name of a judge of the City Court being substituted for that of the justice of the Supreme Court. These corrections appear to have been made after the execution was levied, and we therefore disregard them, as the sheriff\u2019s right to poundage depends upon the validity of the execution as it was when the levy was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> The essential requisites of an execution against property are set forth in sections 1366, 1368, and 1369 of the Code of Civil Procedure. They are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>It \u201cmust intelligibly describe the judgment, stating the names of the parties in whose favor, and against whom, the time when, and the court in which, the judgment was rendered; and, if it was rendered in the Supreme Court, the county in which the judgment roll is filed. It must require the sheriff to return it to the proper clerk, within sixty days after the receipt thereof.\u201d It must specify \u201cthe sum recovered, or directed to be paid, and the sum actually due when it is issued.\u201d It must state \u201cthe time when the judginent [roll] was docketed in the office of the clerk of the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\">All of these essential recitals were correctly made in the execution complained of. Neither of the remaining defects in the execution rendered it void in the hands of the sheriff. It would have been perfectly good if it had not been tested at all, and consequently an erroneous testation did not avoid it. Douglas v. Haberstro, 88 N. Y. 611. Nor was the erroneous direction as to its return, of any consequence, because the law, and not the direction contained in the paper, was controlling upon the sheriff. Wright v. Nostrand, 94 N. Y., 31-48. The execution as it was delivered to the sheriff was a sufficient warrant for his action, and he might have subjected himself to serious responsibility if he had refused to act thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
