There are other allegations with respect to acts of the corporation in derogation of the rights of the plaintiff as a stockholder and concerning the election of officers, and there are other prayers for relief with respect thereto which we do not deem it necessary to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The grounds of the demurrer are: (1) That the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; (2) that the court has not jurisdiction of the subject of the action; (3) that there is a defect of parties defendants, in that the corporation -only is respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>sible, the defendants Rogers and Skinner, \u201cif acting at all, acting only as officers of said corporation\u201d; and (4) that two causes of action have been improperly united, in that the corporation is sued for specific performance, and another cause of action is for tort against the defendants Rogers and Skinner for the detention of the stock, or for defrauding the plaintiff with respect to the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> There is no merit in the contention that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, for it is well settled that a suit in equity will lie to compel the transfer upon the books of the company of stock to the true owner. Cushman v. Thayer Mfg. Co.; 76 N. Y. 365, 32 Am. Rep. 315; Bedford v. American Al. Co., 51 App. Div. 537, 64 N. Y. Supp. 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The contention that the court is without jurisdiction of the subject of the action is based on the claim that <em>all </em>the relief demanded, for which a foundation is laid by the allegations of fact, relates to the internal affairs of a foreign corporation, over which the courts of another state either have not jurisdiction or do not exercise jurisdiction. This is merely an action to enforce the contract rights of the plaintiff, and I am of opinion that upon principle and authority the Supreme Court of this state, acquiring jurisdiction over a foreign corporation and its officers by service of process within this state, has jurisdiction in a suit by a resident of this state to compel the transfer on the books of the company of capital stock owned by him into his name, and the issue of stock to him therefor.

St. Rep. 637. See, also, Prouty v. Mich. S. &amp; N. I. R. R., 1 Hun, 655; Ernst v. Rutherford Gas Co., 38 App. Div. 388, 56 N. Y. Supp. 403; Miller v. Quincy, 179 N. Y. 301, 72 N. E. 116; Jacobs v. Mexican Sugar Refining Co., 104 App. Div. 242, 93 N. Y. Supp. 776; Hallenborg v. Greene, 66 App. Div. 590, 73 N. Y. Supp. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The individual defendants, being within the jurisdiction of the state and representing the corporation therein, are properly joined as defendants, for the reason that they are the officers who are authorized to make the transfer and to issue the stock, and whose duty it is to do so, and jurisdiction over them personally may be required to enforce the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> I think there is no merit in the contention that causes of action have been improperly united, for the allegations with respect to damages sustained by the plaintiff, owing to the failure of the defendant corporation and its officers to transfer the stock, are incidental to the equitable relief demanded, and the damages are demanded against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">It follows, therefore, that the order should b'e affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements, with leave to the demurring defendants to withdraw demurrer and to answer, on payment within 20 days of costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">CLARKE and DOWLING, JJ., concur. McLAUGHLIN and SCOTT, JJ., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
