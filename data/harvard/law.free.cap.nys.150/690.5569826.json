The history of the case shows that the action was commenced by personal service of the summons upon one of the defendants in this city on August 4, 1914, and was returnable on August 13, 1914; that upon the return day the defendants procured an adjournment until August 25, 1914, for the purpose of filing an answer, and the case was then set down for October 1, 1914, for trial; that the defendants made no move for the issuance of a commission until September 29, 1914, two days before the day set for trial, and that the application was denied upon the hearing upon the ground of laches and want of good faith, as shown by the long delay in making such application. The moving papers did not set forth any reasons for such delay, and the motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Appeal from default judgment and from order denying motion for issuance of commission dismissed, and order denying motion to open default affirmed, with costs.
