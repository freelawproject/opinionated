It interposes a general denial of the other allegations of the complaint. One of these allegations; thus denied, is \u201cthat the defendant failed to perform the said contract upon its part, and has failed to pay the said contract price or any part thereof.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Following this allegation are statements alleging special damages by reason of the alleged failure of defendant to keep its contract, for the amount of which judgment is demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> The contract, as set out in the complaint and admitted by the answer, provided that the agreed purchase price of the premises should be paid by defendant, one-half \u201cin cash and the balance secured by a mortgage payable in five years.\u201d The contract was therefore not one for the payment of money only, in which case payment would doubtless be an affirmative defense, to be pleaded and proved. Conlding v. Weatherwax, 181 N. Y. 258, 73 N. E. 1028, 2 Ann. Cas. 740; Dowling v. Hastings, 211 N. Y. 199, 105 N. E. 194. It is defendant\u2019s breach of the contract by reason of its failure to pay the one-half of the purchase price and to secure the balance by the mortgage on the premises as the contract required, which plaintiffs have alleged. Such failure on the part of defendant it was incumbent upon plaintiffs both to allege and, if denied by defendant, to prove upon the trial. This allegation having been put in issue by defendant\u2019s denial, judgment on the pleadings could not properly be directed so long as that issue remained undisposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Without passing upon the question whether plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is defective, in that it does not allege an actual tender of the deed, or circumstances showing that such tender was unnecessary, we are of the opinion, for the reasons hereinbefore stated, that plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
