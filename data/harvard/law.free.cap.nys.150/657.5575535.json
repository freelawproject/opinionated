This was error. The testimony offered by the plaintiffs, tending to show fully the arrangement between them as to the wages earned by them, was repeatedly excluded by the the trial court upon objection by defendant\u2019s counsel; but there was sufficient testimony given, which upon a dismissal must be taken as true, to show that plaintiffs worked under an agreement for an equal division of the wages paid and to be paid by the defendant, and were partners to that extent. Under such circumstances, the complaint should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-19\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.
