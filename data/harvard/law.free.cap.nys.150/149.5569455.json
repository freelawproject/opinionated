A salesman of defendant called on plaintiff\u2019s representative and executed the contract in suit. The agreement describes the plaintiff as lessor and the other party as \u201cIsaac L. Adelman, of the Grolier Society,\u201d and is signed by Adelman in the same terms. Standing alone, this agreement might very well be construed as that of Adelman personally; but in the attestation clause it is recited that the lessee has caused these presents to be signed by its \u201crepresentative\u201d; the latter word having been written by Adelman himself at the time of execution. In this form it seems to me that the agreement sufficiently indicates that it was intended to bind the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ant in its corporate capacity. Booth v. Farmers\u2019 Bank, 50 N. Y. 396; Whitford v. Laidler, 94 N. Y. 145,46 Am. Rep. 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As to Adelman\u2019s authority, plaintiff does not claim to bind the defendant, otherwise than by ratification, and there was ample evidence to demonstrate that the agreement had been shown to defendant\u2019s officers, that they had discussed its terms with one of the plaintiff\u2019s representatives, and had orally agreed to change the stand provided for their exhibition from the one mentioned in the agreement to another one that suited them better, and that that change was actually carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Respondent urges, in favor of affirmance, the point that plaintiff proved no damages, because he did not show the value of the books which defendant, under the agreement, promised to deliver in payment of the rental of the stand. The agreement, however, expresses the consideration as \u201c$375, in books,\u201d etc. This, in itself, was sufficient prima facie proof of damage in the'amount named. See, for example, Publishing Co. v. Steamship Co., 148 N. Y. 39, 42 N. E. 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
