The transportation ticket which plaintiff received contained the limitation that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-17\">\u201cIn case of total loss of baggage, * * * the passenger shall not be entitled to receive more than $100 * * * as indemnity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASR\">In Holmes v. North-German Lloyd Co., 184 N.Y. 280, <em>77 </em>N. E. 21, 5 L. R. A. (N. S.) 650, a similar limitation of liability \u201cfor loss of luggage or personal effects\u201d was held to apply only to articles stored in the hold and not to clothing in a stateroom. The learned judge below was of opinion that the Holmes Case did not indicate \u201cthe correct interpretation of the contract between the parties to this action,\u201d on the ground, apparently, that the term \u201cbaggage\u201d was sufficiently broad to cover clothing kept by the passenger in his stateroom. In this view, however, I cannot agree. I think, on the contrary, that, if there is any difference, the word \u201cbaggage\u201d would be more readily construed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>referring to other\"than the personal effects kept by the passenger for his continued use during the voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
