The only question is whether the evidence sustains the determination of the respondent that the relator wrote the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-18\">The only direct evidence tending to show that the letter was written by the relator is the evidence of a handwriting expert. The relator testified that he did not 'write it, and had no knowledge of its having been written. No reason or motive is disclosed for his writing it, and it appears as a fact that the conditions complained of did not in fact exist. I think the case presented is to be controlled by the decision of this court in People ex rel. Hansen v. Waldo, as Police Commissioner, 163 App. Div. 665, 148 N. Y. Supp. 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>The writ must therefore be sustained, the determination annulled, and the relator restored to his position, with $50 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">JENKS, P.
