Hillenmeyer, a former linebacker for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (\u201cNFL\u201d), challenges the method by which Cleveland\u2019s municipal income tax was imposed on his earnings during tax years 2004, 2005, and 2006. In each of those seasons, the Bears played one game in Cleveland, for which Hillenmeyer was present in Cleveland two days. And for each of those years, the Bears withheld and then paid the municipal tax from his compensation according to Cleveland\u2019s allocation method known as \u201cgames played,\u201d under which the taxable portion of a professional athlete\u2019s income is based on the number of games the athlete played in Cleveland in relation to the total number of games played that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 2} As a nonresident of Cleveland, Hillenmeyer asserts that Cleveland has adopted an unlawful method of computing the amount of his compensation that is subject to its city income tax. The games-played method, he argues, dramatically overstates his Cleveland income, because his compensation as an NFL player includes earnings not only for the games he played, but also for the training, practices, strategy sessions, and promotional activities he engaged in.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">{\u00b6 3} On December 19, 2007, Hillenmeyer filed timely applications for refunds of income taxes paid to Cleveland for tax years 2004 through 2006. He appealed the denial of his applications for tax refunds to the city of Cleveland Board of Review, the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), and now this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\n<em>The issues outstanding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">{\u00b6 4} Both constitutional and nonconstitutional challenges are levied against the municipal tax: that former R.C. 718.011(B), Am.Sub.S.B. No. 287, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 11536,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the \u201coccasional entrants\u201d statute, violates both the Ohio Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (proposition of law No. 4); that Cleveland\u2019s method of income-tax allocation is contrary to former R.C. 718.01(H), 2007 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 24, and former R.C. 718.03, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 95, <em>150 </em>Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Laws, Part I, 396, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hume v. Limbach, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 387, 575 N.E.2d 150 (1991), and Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.0501(b)(1) (proposition of law No. 1); that the city\u2019s method of allocation violates the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution (proposition of law No. 2); and that it violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution (proposition of law No. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 5} We now hold that although Cleveland has the right to tax the compensation earned by a nonresident professional athlete for work performed in Cleveland, the city\u2019s application of its games-played method of allocating income violates the due-process rights of NFL players such as Hillenmeyer. We reverse and remand for calculation of the tax refund and interest due him.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\n<em>Previous proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">{\u00b6 6} Hillenmeyer filed claims for refunds of Cleveland taxes withheld and remitted for tax years 2004, 2005, and 2006. In his refund applications, he argued that the allocation ratio used by Cleveland was \u201cillegal, erroneous, and unconstitutional\u201d and taxed amounts for services that he performed outside the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 7} The Central Collection Agency (\u201cCCA\u201d), Cleveland\u2019s tax administration authority, responded to Hillenmeyer\u2019s refund applications by issuing a notice dated January 22, 2008, for each of the tax years, indicating that \u201c[y]our employer withheld the tax correctly.\u201d Hillenmeyer then requested that the CCA issue a final, appealable order. On February 19, 2009, the CCA issued a 29-page final dispositional order upholding its imposition of tax using the games-played method of allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">{\u00b6 8} Hillenmeyer appealed the CCA\u2019s order to the city\u2019s board of review, Cleveland\u2019s duly established board for income-tax appeals pursuant to former R.C. 718.11, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 95, 150 Ohio Laws, Part I, 396.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A hearing was held on July 2, 2009. Thomas DePaso, associate general counsel of the NFL Players\u2019 Association and a former player in the league, testified about Hillenmeyer\u2019s employment and compensation, and Hillenmeyer offered into evidence the NFL collective-bargaining agreement and two of his player contracts, the later of which was dated June 29, 2006, and was a six-year contract extending through 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>{\u00b6 9} On September 29, 2009, the board of review issued a nine-page decision deferring to and upholding the CCA\u2019s position. Hillenmeyer then appealed to the BTA. The parties waived a hearing before the BTA and submitted the case on the notice of appeal, the briefs filed, and the record transmitted by the board of review. BTA No. 2009-3688, 2014 WL 351128, *1 (Jan. 14, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 10} On January 14, 2014, the BTA issued a decision upholding the board of review\u2019s determination. The BTA declined to address Hillenmeyer\u2019s constitutional challenges because of its limitations as an administrative tribunal, relying on <em>Cleveland Gear Co. v. Limbach, </em>35 Ohio St.3d 229, 520 N.E.2d 188 (1988), and <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Limbach, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 195, 625 N.E.2d 597 (1994). BTA No. 2009-3688, 2014 WL 351128, *3. The BTA found that Cleveland\u2019s ordinances \u201cdo not operate in contravention of any state statute regarding municipal income taxes or Ohio case precedent.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>But the BTA made \u201cno finding regarding the propriety of the allocation methodology\u201d on the theory that that issue lay outside its jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>Hillenmeyer appealed the BTA\u2019s decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>Evidence of Hillenmeyer\u2019s compensation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 11} Because it is necessary to look at Hillenmeyer\u2019s total compensation before analyzing the legal issues in this case, we turn to the record, which explains his compensation. Hillenmeyer states in his affidavit to the board of review that he had \u201cbeen required to provide services to [his] employer from the beginning of the pre-season through the end of the post-season.\u201d He had at least 157 work days in 2004, 165 days in 2005, and 168 days in 2006. The affidavit also establishes that in each of those years, \u201cthe Chicago Bears played one game in Cleveland, Ohio, traveling to the City the day before the game and leaving the City the same day on which the game was played.\u201d Hillenmeyer himself \u201cwas present in and rendered services to [his] employer in Cleveland on those two days during each of these years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">{If 12} Hillenmeyer\u2019s statements were corroborated by the affidavit testimony of Cliff Stein, senior director of football administration and general counsel for the Chicago Bears. Stein confirmed that under the NFL standard player contract and from the time that Hillenmeyer joined the Bears in 2003, he was required to \u201cprovide services to his employer from the beginning of the preseason through the end of the post-season, including mandatory mini-camps, official preseason training camp, meetings, practice sessions, and all pre-season, regular season, and post-season games.\u201d Stein also stated that \u201c[t]he compensation Hillenmeyer receives from the Bears is paid for all of these services and not only for games played\u201d and that \u201c[f]ailure to comply with these contractual requirements would subject Hillenmeyer to termination pursuant to Paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>12 of his NFL Player Contract and/or fines under Article VIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 13} Thomas DePaso testified about Hillenmeyer\u2019s contracts, duties, and elements of compensation at the July 2, 2009 hearing. DePaso described the four distinct phases of an NFL player\u2019s work year. First, players have the mini camp, a mandatory multiple-day event involving a physical exam, meetings, and practices, which takes place after the NFL draft. Second, the preseason training camp typically lasts about six weeks. Players report two weeks in advance of the first of four preseason games, and days are filled with meetings, practices, reviewing films of previous games, and practicing the plays for upcoming games. The regular season is the third phase, which consists of seventeen weeks \u2014 sixteen games with one week off \u2014 along with the weekly game-preparation schedule. Usually, players come to work on a Monday, when the injured are treated and others view game films from the weekend. Tuesday is a day off, followed by heavy work days on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Saturday, typically the day before game day, involves a relatively light practice with refinement of game strategy and plays. Finally, the team usually travels on Saturday (if the game is away) and plays on Sunday (unless it is an off week). In a successful year, the team may qualify to play postseason games.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">{\u00b6 14} DePaso also testified about Hillenmeyer\u2019s employment contract. Under paragraphs 5 and 6 of the standard player contract, entitled \u201cCOMPENSATION\u201d and \u201cPAYMENT,\u201d respectively, a certain stated yearly base salary is furnished to the player, paid in weekly or biweekly installments during the regular season. According to DePaso, about 40 percent of the player\u2019s compensation is in addition to that baseline amount. Beyond paragraph 5 compensation, players can receive \u2014 based on their specific contracts \u2014 performance bonuses based on either individual or team performance, signing bonuses, and roster bonuses, which are paid for being a member of the roster on a certain date. Players can be fined for missing mandatory events, and fines may be deducted from their paragraph 5 compensation, but the collective-bargaining agreement imposes caps on the fines. Termination of a player during the season would lead to the prorated forfeiture of the paragraph 5 compensation, but already-earned bonuses such as roster bonuses are fully owed upon termination even if not yet fully paid out.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">{\u00b6 15} Hillenmeyer\u2019s June 29, 2006 contract provided for a term covering the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 seasons. His paragraph 5 salary began at $585,000 for 2006 and escalated year by year to $1.8 million for 2011. An addendum provided a roster bonus of $4.5 million for 2006, to be paid out in four increments by September 2007. This bonus compensated Hillenmeyer solely for being \u201ca member of the 80-man roster on July 10, 2006,\u201d and under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>collective-bargaining agreement the amount was owed and was not forfeitable once earned on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\n<em>Games played vs. duty days</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">{\u00b6 16} At the heart of the dispute before us is the method that Cleveland has chosen to allocate the taxable income of nonresident professional athletes. Cleveland imposes a 2 percent tax on the income that is allocable to Cleveland. <em>See </em>Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.0501. CCA Regulation 8:02(E)(6) sets forth a games-played method to allocate the income of a nonresident professional athlete such as Hillenmeyer. This means that Cleveland taxes the one game that Hillenmeyer played in Cleveland each year in proportion to the total number of games the Bears played during the year (approximately 20 preseason and regular-season games in a non-playoff year). Under this methodology, a visiting football player who travels to Cleveland for a single game out of a 20-game season will have one twentieth (5 percent) of his income allocated to Cleveland and then taxed at 2 percent. The Cleveland tax administrator asserts that the games-played method \u201cproperly apportions player salaries since the plain language of both [the CBA and the standard player contract] ties a player\u2019s contract salary to one thing \u2014 games played.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">{\u00b6 17} Nevertheless, except for Cleveland, municipalities that have chosen to tax professional athletes do so on the basis of the allocation offered by Hillenmeyer \u2014 the \u201cduty days\u201d approach. In this approach, the numerator represents the number of days spent in the taxing city: in this case, two days for one game. The record shows that Hillenmeyer had 157 duty days in 2004, 165 in 2005, and 168 in 2006. When these numbers are used as the denominators to represent the total number of work days, Cleveland would have been allocated approximately 1.27 percent of Hillenmeyer\u2019s income in 2004, 1.21 percent in 2005, and 1.19 percent in 2006. Under the duty-days method, Hillenmeyer claims he is entitled to refunds of $253 for 2004, $359 for 2005, and $4,450 for 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\n<em>Cleveland\u2019s allocation method not prohibited by law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">{\u00b6 18} Hillenmeyer argues that the method chosen by Cleveland to allocate to itself the income of a nonresident like himself, which is set forth in the CCA Rules and Regulations, conflicts with the underlying tax ordinance passed by the Cleveland City Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">{\u00b6 19} Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.0318 defines \u201ctaxable income\u201d as \u201call qualifying wages, net profits and all other income from whatever source derived set forth in Section 191.0501, and the Rules and Regulations as taxable.\u201d The taxing ordinance expressly imposes tax on \u201call qualifying wages, earned and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>received * * * by nonresidents of the City for work done or services performed or rendered within the City or attributable to the City,\u201d Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.0501, and it confers authority on the tax administrator to \u201cadopt and promulgate and to enforce and interpret rules and regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of taxes and the administration and enforcement of [the municipal-income-tax ordinances],\u201d subject to approval by the board of review, Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.2303.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">{\u00b6 20} Thus, the ordinances countenance that regulations will spell out how to apply the standard for taxing nonresidents\u2019 income. The ordinances do not restrict how Cleveland\u2019s tax administrator may choose to determine the \u201cwork done and services performed or rendered within the City or attributable to the City\u201d when, as here, the taxpayer\u2019s compensation derives from services performed both within and outside of Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">{\u00b6 21} Hillenmeyer also argues that the games-played method violates state law. Former R.C. 718.01(H)(10), 2007 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 24, prohibits municipal taxation of any wages that are not \u201cqualifying wages,\u201d which according to former R.C. 718.03(A)(2), Am.Sub.H.B. No. 95, 150 Ohio Laws, Part I, 396, 638, means, as relevant here, \u201cwages, as defined in section 3121(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d The Internal Revenue Code provision defines \u201cwages\u201d generally as \u201call remuneration for employment,\u201d while \u201cemployment\u201d in turn is defined as \u201cany service, of whatever nature, performed * * * by an employee for the person employing him.\u201d 26 U.S.C. 3121(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 22} From these definitions, Hillenmeyer concludes that Ohio law \u201crequires that employee wages be treated as having been earned for <em>all </em>services performed by an employee for his or her employer.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) He argues that because the undisputed record established that he performed services for the Bears other than playing in football games, Cleveland\u2019s attempt to treat him as being paid only to play in games is contrary to the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 23} This point has surface appeal. But, just as in the case of the ordinance, R.C. Chapter 718 and the federal definition of wages do not specifically address how to apportion or allocate wage income among the various jurisdictions in which the income has been earned. Municipal home-rule authority to impose taxes may be limited only by a provision of state law that expressly imposes the restriction. <em>Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co. v. Cincinnati </em>81 Ohio St.3d 599, 605, 693 N.E.2d 212 (1998). The cited statutes do not satisfy this clear-statement rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">{\u00b6 24} Nonetheless, although Cleveland\u2019s allocation method may not be prohibited by law, we turn to the arguments that it has been unconstitutionally applied to Hillenmeyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\n<em>No waiver of constitutional claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 25} As a preliminary matter, we resolve the issue of waiver of the constitutional claims. Cleveland faults Hillenmeyer for having appealed to the BTA rather than the common pleas court, where his constitutional issues could have been decided. But Cleveland cites no authority for the supposed obligation to use one appeal avenue as opposed to another. R.C. 5717.011 sets forth an appellant\u2019s right to choose the forum and imposes no restrictions on its doing so. We have held that constitutional issues may be raised before the BTA for later determination by the courts on appeal. In such cases, the BTA serves as the forum for presentation of evidence so that a record is available for the court deciding those issues on appeal. <em>Cleveland Gear Co., </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 232, 520 N.E.2d 188. We therefore reject Cleveland\u2019s contention that Hillenmeyer\u2019s election of appellate avenues has waived his constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 26} Cleveland also suggests that Hillenmeyer should have raised some hypothetical nonconstitutional argument regarding the apportionment of income as a condition precedent to his being able to raise his constitutional arguments. But Hillenmeyer did argue that the CCA\u2019s regulation conflicts with the city ordinance and that the games-played method is preempted by R.C. Chapter 718. Because there is no basis for concluding that Hillenmeyer has ignored statutory grounds for relief in order to present a constitutional argument, we reject Cleveland\u2019s waiver arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\"><em>Occasional-entrants rule </em>\u2014 former <em>R.C. 718.011(B)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">{\u00b6 27} Before discussing the method of allocation chosen by Cleveland, we first examine Hillenmeyer\u2019s equal-protection argument that he is entitled to an exemption from the tax because other taxpayers to whom he claims he is similarly situated are so entitled. Hillenmeyer asserts that a statutory 12-day grace period should apply to him because he was in Cleveland for only two days during each of the taxable years.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">{\u00b6 28} Former R.C. 718.011, Am.Sub.S.B. No. 287, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 11536,11538, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">[A] municipal corporation shall not tax the compensation paid to a nonresident individual for personal services performed by the individual in the municipal corporation on twelve or fewer days in a calendar year unless one of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">(B) The individual is a professional entertainer or professional athlete, the promoter of a professional entertainment or sports event, or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>employee of such a promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by the municipal corporation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 29} This provision, sometimes referred to as the occasional-entrants rule, applies to nonresidents who perform some but not all of their work within the taxing municipality. Hillenmeyer asserts that professional entertainers and in particular, athletes, are similarly situated to other occasional entrants and should therefore enjoy the statutory 12-day grace period during which their activities within Cleveland are exempt from local income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\n<em>Tax-law distinctions reviewed deferentially on a rational basis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 30} The classification of professional entertainers or athletes as distinct from other occasional entrants, which neither involves fundamental rights nor proceeds along suspect lines, cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose. <em>See Heller v. Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 319-320, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993). Under this standard, tax distinctions need not be drawn perfectly. <em>See Phillips Chem. Co. v. Dumas School Dist., </em>361 U.S. 376, 385, 80 S.Ct. 474, 4 L.Ed.2d 384 (1960). Moreover, the assessment of taxes is fundamentally a legislative responsibility, with the result that \u201c \u2018[t]his already deferential standard \u201cis especially deferential\u201d in the context of classifications arising out of complex taxation law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio Apt. Assn. v. Levin, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 76, 2010-Ohio-4414, 936 N.E.2d 919 at \u00b6 35, quoting <em>Park Corp. v. Brook Park, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 166, 2004-Ohio-2237, 807 N.E.2d 913, \u00b6 23, quoting <em>Nordlinger v. Hahn, </em>505 U.S. 1, 11, 112 S.Ct. 2326, 120 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\n<em>No equal-protection violation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">{\u00b6 31} Excluding entertainers and athletes such as Hillenmeyer from the 12-day grace rule does not violate the equal-protection guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">{\u00b6 32} First, professional athletes are typically highly paid, and their work is easy to find, so that a city could earn significant revenue with comparative ease. Second, the legislature could rationally find that professional athletes and entertainers and their events incur much larger public burdens relating to police protection and traffic and crowd control, among other public services, than do other occasional entrants. We conclude that these two factors, in addition to the reliance interest of municipalities in the continued levy of existing taxes, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>sufficient to justify the exclusion of a professional athlete such as Hillenmeyer from the 12-day grace period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 33} Municipal nonresident-income-tax regulations originally applied predominantly to rock stars, but a new focus on athletes developed once their salaries started to escalate. <em>See </em>Ekmekjian, <em>The Jock Tax: State and Local Income Taxation of Professional Athletes, 4 </em>Seton Hall J.Sport L. 229, 234 (1994). Cleveland\u2019s regulations for taxing athletes were adopted in the early 1990s.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 34} In 2000, the General Assembly added the 12-day grace period to former R.C. 718.01(F)(8), Sub.H.B. 477, 148 Ohio Laws 5120, 5122, later recodifying the provision at R.C. 718.011. We believe it was reasonable for the General Assembly to have restricted the further expansion of municipal taxation of nonresidents by creating the 12-day grace period without rolling back the taxes already imposed by Ohio municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 35} In addition, Ohio cities had already been imposing local taxes on entertainers and athletes when the 12-day grace period was enacted. Protection of reliance interests constitutes a valid basis for legislative line drawing. <em>Nordlinger v. Hahn, </em>505 U.S. at 12-14, 112 S.Ct. 2326, 120 L.Ed.2d 1; <em>see also United States RR. Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 178, 101 S.Ct. 453, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980). Imposing a limit on local taxation while protecting the cities\u2019 interest in collecting existing taxes constituted an adequate rational basis for the General Assembly\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 36} The United States Supreme Court has recognized that certain taxpayers such as Hillenmeyer may be caught between conflicting rationales:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">[T]he Constitution grants legislators, not courts, broad authority (within the bounds of rationality) to decide whom they wish to help with their tax laws and how much help those laws ought to provide. \u201cThe \u2018task of classifying persons for * * * benefits * * * inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line,\u2019 and the fact the line might have been drawn differently at some points is a matter for legislative, rather than judicial, consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-10\"><em>Fitzgerald v. Racing Assn. of Cent. Iowa, </em>539 U.S. 103, 108, 123 S.Ct. 2156, 156 L.Ed.2d 97 (2003), quoting <em>Fritz </em>at 179, quoting <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 83-84, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>{\u00b6 37} We hold that the exclusion of Hillenmeyer from the 12-day grace period does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\n<em>Due-process violation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 38} Although we decide that Cleveland has the power to tax nonresident professional athletes without allowing them the benefit of the 12-day grace period, we hold that the games-played method of determining the tax base fails to afford due process when applied to NFL players like Hillenmeyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">{\u00b6 39} The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that \u201c[no] State [shall] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d Cleveland\u2019s power to tax reaches only that portion of a nonresident\u2019s compensation that was earned by work performed in Cleveland. The games-played method reaches income that was performed outside of Cleveland, and thus Cleveland\u2019s income tax as applied is extraterritorial.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">{\u00b6 40} In guarding against extraterritorial taxation, \u201c[t]he Due Process Clause places two restrictions on a State\u2019s power to tax income generated by the activities of an interstate business.\u201d <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, </em>437 U.S. 267, 272-273, 98 S.Ct. 2340, 57 L.Ed.2d 197 (1978). The first is to require \u201c \u2018some definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax.\u2019 \u201d <em>Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, </em>504 U.S. 298, 306, 112 S.Ct. 1904, 119 L.Ed.2d 91 (1992), quoting <em>Miller Bros. Co. v. Maryland, </em>347 U.S. 340, 344-345, 74 S.Ct. 535, 98 L.Ed. 744 (1954). The second restriction is that \u201cthe income attributed to the State for tax purposes must be rationally related to \u2018values connected with the taxing State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. </em>at 272-273, 98 S.Ct. 2340, quoting <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. Missouri State Tax Comm., </em>390 U.S. 317, 325, 88 S.Ct. 995, 19 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">{\u00b6 41} When it first addressed the power of states to impose income taxes, the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201c[g]overnmental jurisdiction in matters of taxation * * * depends upon the power to enforce the mandate of the state by action taken within its borders, either <em>in personam </em>or <em>in rem.\u201d Shaffer v. Carter, </em>252 U.S. 37, 49, 40 S.Ct. 221, 64 L.Ed. 445 (1920). Extending a state or local income tax to all the elements of income realized by city residents rests upon the authority to legislate in personam in relation to those residents and domiciliaries. <em>See id. </em>at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">{\u00b6 42} Beyond in personam taxing jurisdiction over residents, local authorities may tax nonresidents only if theirs is the jurisdiction \u201cwithin which the income actually arises and whose authority over it operates <em>in rem.\u201d Id. </em>at 55, 40 S.Ct. 221. The <em>Shaffer </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>[J]ust as a State may impose general income taxes upon its own citizens and residents whose persons are subject to its control, it may, as a necessary consequence, levy a duty of like character, and not more onerous in its effect, upon incomes accruing to non-residents from their property or business within the State, <em>or their occupations carried on therein </em>* * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 43} Under Shaffer\u2019s principle, the income of a nonresident is the \u201cres,\u201d or thing, that lies within the taxing jurisdiction by virtue of the activity being performed within that jurisdiction. Thus, local taxation of a nonresident\u2019s compensation for services must be based on the location of the taxpayer when the services were performed. <em>See Thompson v. Cincinnati, </em>2 Ohio St.2d 292, 208 N.E.2d 747 (1965), paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 44} Two main approaches have been recognized for dividing up a nonresident\u2019s income among taxing jurisdictions. Income derived from the conduct of a unitary <em>trade or business </em>may be apportioned by a general formula, while <em>nonbusiness </em>income must usually be more specifically allocated to that place where the particular increment of income is earned. <em>See </em>Peters &amp; Miller, <em>Apportionability in State Income Taxation: The Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act and </em>Allied-Signal, 60 Tax Lawyer 57 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 45} Cleveland relies on cases involving the apportionment of business income. By stark contrast with compensation, income from a trade or business may be apportioned according to a general formula among jurisdictions in which the business has operations. The cases Cleveland relies on involve the particular difficulties of apportioning business income, and to that extent they are inapposite. Compensation invokes a simpler rule: compensation must be allocated to the place where the employee performed the work. Cleveland\u2019s case citations do not support the use of the games-played method.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">{\u00b6 46} Due process requires an allocation that reasonably associates the amount of compensation taxed with work the taxpayer performed within the city. The games-played method results in Cleveland allocating approximately 5 percent of Hillenmeyer\u2019s income to itself on the basis of two days spent in Cleveland. By using the duty-days method, however, Cleveland is allocated approximately 1.25 percent based on the same two days. By using the games-played method, Cleveland has reached extraterritorially, beyond its power to tax. Cleveland\u2019s power to tax reaches only that portion of a nonresident\u2019s compensation that was earned by work performed in Cleveland. The games-played method reaches income for work that was performed outside of Cleveland, and thus Cleveland\u2019s income tax violates due process as applied to NFL players such as Hillenmeyer.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar-I\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Hume v. Limbach</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">{\u00b6 47} Our decision that Cleveland\u2019s application of the games-played method violates the Due Process Clause as it is applied to Hillenmeyer corresponds with an analogous case construing and applying the state income tax. <em>Hume v. Limbach, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 387, 575 N.E.2d 150. In that case, the taxpayer, Thomas Hume, a pitcher employed by the Cincinnati Reds, petitioned against a state income-tax deficiency assessment issued against him. The Reds employed Hume under a contract requiring him to participate in spring training, preseason exhibition games, regular-season games, and the League Championship and World Series, if necessary, and paying him for these services an annual salary that he received in installments during the regular playing season. As a nonresident of Ohio, Hume claimed a credit on his state-income-tax returns for the number of days he attended spring training and exhibition games played outside Ohio, in addition to regular-season away games. The tax commissioner asserted that Hume could allocate to other states only the income received for the regular-season away games, not the spring training and preseason exhibition games. As in Hillenmeyer\u2019s case, the tax commissioner\u2019s allocation method led to a significantly higher percentage of Hume\u2019s compensation being subjected to Ohio income tax. The BTA affirmed, but we reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 48} We held that Hume \u201cwas compensated for the training season and exhibition games, despite receiving payment only during the playing season.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389. In other words, <em>all </em>compensation received for services was to be included as part of a ratio when allocating Ohio and non-Ohio income. Contrary to the BTA\u2019s finding in the present case, <em>Hume </em>did involve a dispute about how the allocation ratio should be constructed in terms of which activities were counted, just as the present case does.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">{\u00b6 49} Cleveland\u2019s games-played method imposes an extraterritorial tax in violation of due process, because it foreseeably imposes Cleveland income tax on compensation earned while Hillenmeyer was working outside Cleveland. Consistent with the rule that the taxing authority may not collect tax on a nonresident\u2019s compensation earned outside its jurisdiction, the duty-days method properly includes as taxable income only that compensation earned in Cleveland by accounting for all the work for which an NFL player such as Hillenmeyer is paid, rather than merely the football games he plays each year. This method therefore comports with due process and ensures that the tax collected is not \u2019 disproportionate to the income received for work in Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\n<em>Commerce Clause claims not reached</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 50} A state tax measure conforms to the requirements of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, cl. 3, if \u201c \u2018the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Internatl. Thomson Publishing, Inc. v. Tracy, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 415, 418, 683 N.E.2d 1091 (1997), quoting <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274, 279, 97 S.Ct. 1076, 51 L.Ed.2d 326 (1977). This standard is understood to be a four-prong test. <em>See Norandex, Inc. v. Limbach, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 26, 27, 630 N.E.2d 329 (1994).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ACI\">Hemenway <em>&amp; </em>Barnes, L.L.P, Stephen W. Kidder, and Ryan P. McManus; and Zaino, Hall <em>&amp; </em>Farrin, L.L.C., and Richard C. Farrin, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AH4\">Barbara A. Langhenry, Cleveland Director of Law, and Linda L. Bickerstaff, Assistant Director of Law, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">{\u00b6 51} Hillenmeyer raises a claim that the games-played method violates the fair-apportionment prong of the <em>Complete Auto </em>test. He also contends in his brief that the games-played method fails under two other portions \u2014 the fairly-related and antidiscrimination prongs of the test. But because the notice of appeal to this court specifies only fair-apportionment, we lack jurisdiction to entertain the other two claims. <em>Norandex, Inc. </em>at 31, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 52} Furthermore, Hillenmeyer\u2019s Commerce Clause claim under the fair-apportionment prong seeks no relief other than what we have already deemed appropriate pursuant to due process. Because the due-process analysis is dispositive, we decline to address the Commerce Clause challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 53} We hold that Cleveland\u2019s use of the games-played method violates due process as applied to NFL players such as Hillenmeyer. Under the duty-days method, which provides due process and satisfies Cleveland\u2019s municipal-income-tax ordinance, Hillenmeyer is entitled to a partial refund of the tax paid. While other computation methods might also provide due process, Cleveland has not suggested any method of alternative relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 54} We therefore reverse the decision of the BTA, and we remand with the instruction that tax refunds be awarded on the basis of Hillenmeyer\u2019s duty-days calculation, together with interest as appropriate, in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b262-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AmWp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Michael DeWine, Attorney General, Eric E.
