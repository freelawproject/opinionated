VII(5b), the Board on the Unauthorized Practice of Law has recommended that we approve a consent decree proposed by relator, Ohio State Bar Association (\u201cOSBA\u201d), and respondents, Wishgard, L.L.C., and Edward Tygard. We accept the board\u2019s recommendation and approve the proposed consent decree as submitted by the parties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">1. OSBA is a Bar Association whose members include attorneys-at-law admitted to the practice of law in Ohio and who practice throughout the State of Ohio. OSBA, through its Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee, is authorized by Gov.Bar R. VII to file a Complaint with the Board regarding the unauthorized practice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">2. Respondent Wishgard, LLC (\u2018Wishgard\u201d) is a foreign limited liability company incorporated in Pennsylvania with its headquarters at 145 Vanceville Road, Eighty Four, PA 15330 and with a place of business at 104 West Main Street, Baltic, OH 43804. Wishgard transacts business in Ohio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-14\">3. At all relevant times, Respondent Edward Tygard was an employee, agent, and managing member of Wishgard, LLC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-15\">4. Respondents are not attorneys-at-law in the State of Ohio admitted pursuant to Gov.Bar R. I, registered pursuant to Gov.Bar R. VI, or certified pursuant to Gov.Bar R. II, IX, or XI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-16\">5. Wishgard began operations in 2010 and, at that time, its business was aimed at assisting landowners to organize into groups and negotiate terms of oil and gas leases with third-party lessees. During this process, Wishgard and landowners would enter into Agreements to Market Oil and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Gas Rights. The Agreement to Market Oil and Gas Rights attached to OSBA\u2019s Complaint as Exhibit A is a true and accurate copy of a blank/sample Agreement. Pursuant to those Agreements, Wishgard negotiated oil and gas leases with third-parties on behalf of its landowner-clients. Wishgard received compensation for their services under the terms of those Agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">6. During 2010, Wishgard also held group meetings with landowners to educate them about the oil and gas leasing process and to offer their services. At certain times during those meetings, Edward Tygard, as a representative of Wishgard, held in-person meetings with landowners about potential oil and gas leases and answered specific questions about the terms of potential leases and the landowners\u2019 potential legal rights and duties under the terms of the proposed leases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">7. On or around January 25, 2011, Respondents received a letter from OSBA advising them that it received a complaint and information indicating that they had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">8. Respondents promptly responded to that letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">9. Upon receipt of the letter from OSBA, Respondents also ceased negotiating oil and gas leases on behalf of landowners and, instead, began executing leases with landowners directly, with Wishgard as the named lessee therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">10. Respondents also immediately stopped providing legal advice to landowners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">11. Therefore, since early 2011, Respondents have not engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">12. R.C. 4705.01 provides: \u201cNo person shall be permitted to practice as an attorney and counselor at law, or to commence, conduct or defend any action or proceeding in which the person is not a party concerned * * * unless the person has been admitted to the bar by order of the supreme court in compliance with its prescribed and published rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">13. The unauthorized practice of law is the rendering of legal services for another by any person not admitted to practice law in Ohio. Gov.Bar R. VIK2XA).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">14. The practice of law is not limited to the conduct of cases in court, but embraces advice to clients regarding their legal rights and responsibilities. <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Leingard [Lienguard ], Inc., </em>126 Ohio St.3d 400, 934 N.E.2d 337 (2010); <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Foreclosure Solu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>tions, LLC, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 107, 914 N.E.2d 386 (2009); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Brown, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 423, 905 N.E.2d 163 (2009).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">15. The unauthorized practice of law also occurs when a nonattorney acts as an intermediary to advise, counsel, or negotiate on behalf of an individual to resolve legal claims and interests with third parties. See, <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Kolodner, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 504, 817 N.E.2d 25 (2004).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">16. OSBA and Respondents have agreed that the conduct described in paragraphs five and six herein, namely, providing legal advice to others and negotiating with oil and gas lessees on behalf of landowners constitute the unauthorized practice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">17. Respondents Wishgard, LLC and Edward Tygard, as well as their successors, affiliates, assigns, officers, members, agents, [and] representatives have ceased engaging in the conduct described above, they shall not engage in such conduct in the future, and they are hereby permanently enjoined from engaging in such conduct in the future and from otherwise engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in the State of Ohio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">18. The parties jointly recommend that no civil penalty be imposed against Respondents. The factors of Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B) apply as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">(1) <em>The degree of cooperation provided by the respondent in the investigation: </em>Respondents have cooperated fully in both the pre-filing and post-filing investigation of this matter. They promptly ceased all conduct that allegedly constituted the unauthorized practice of law upon receiving notice from OSBA in early 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">(2) <em>The number of occasions that unauthorized practice of law was committed: </em>the unauthorized practice of law occurred over a matter of a few months and in a limited geographical area. OSBA received one complaint and the number of victims identified at this time is fewer than five.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">(3) <em>The flagrancy of the violation: </em>the violation was unknowing or unwitting, it did not include actual in-court representation or filings, and is far from the most severe, deliberate, ill-willed, or damaging conduct OSBA and the Board have seen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">(4) <em>Harm to third parties arising from the offense: </em>the victims and complainants have not presented information to show that they were damaged by Respondent\u2019s legal advice or negotiations.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AKU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Patrick W. Skilliter, Eugene P. Whetzel, and Jean Desiree Blankenship, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A4l\">Vorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease, L.L.P., Timothy B. McGranor, and Timothy J. Cole, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">(5) <em>Any other relevant factors: </em>after the occurrence of the conduct described above and after ceasing to engage in the conduct following receipt of the notice from the OSBA, Wishgard was the subject of bankruptcy proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Case No. 13-20613-CMB. Wishgard emerged from bankruptcy as a reorganized company by a plan of reorganization confirmed January 30, 2014, effective April 7, 2014.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">19. Respondent cooperated throughout the investigation, admitted to the unauthorized practice of law, and agreed to cease the activity. Therefore, the Panel agrees with Relator that civil penalties are not warranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Relator states that no costs have been incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b495-10\">French, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
