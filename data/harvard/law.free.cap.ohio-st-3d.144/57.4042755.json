We hold that the particular umbrella policy at issue arguably provides coverage for emotional-distress damages through its coverage for humiliation. We further hold that emotional-distress damages are not inherent in a claim for discrimination and that the inferred-intent doctrine is thus inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Steve Granger and Paul Steigerwald, appellees, established a trust together to hold certain assets; one of the assets is a rental property in Akron that they rent to tenants on a month-to-month basis. That property consists of four units: three in the main house and a fourth above a three-car garage that they call a carriage house. Granger refers to himself as \u201cthe rules Nazi\u201d and will terminate a lease at the end of the following month if a tenant is too loud. Granger paraphrases a clause in the rental agreement as stating, \u201c[I]f you make noise to disturb other tenants, your month-to-month lease will not be renewed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 3} Valerie Kozera alleged that she called Granger on June 7, 2010, to inquire about renting one of the units of the property. She wanted to move closer to her disabled mother. Granger asked Kozera who would be living in the apartment, and she responded that she and her six-year-old son would live there. Granger told Kozera that he does not rent to people with children and ended the phone call. Granger maintains that he did not specifically state that he would not lease to Kozera, but that he told her instead that the apartment \u201cwasn\u2019t conducive to children.\u201d He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want her' \u2014 I told her, now, if you come all the way here and then you do rent, I said, and there\u2019s noise, I said, you can only be here for one month. I tell everybody that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">{\u00b6 4} Kozera contacted the Fair Housing Contact Service, Inc. (\u201cFHCS\u201d), which investigated Kozera\u2019s claims by using trained testers to interact with Granger. One tester inquired about the property by e-mail, and Granger replied, \u201cTruely [sic] a lovely and large apartment and in a very well keep [sic] apartment house. No pets or children.\u201d Granger later sent an additional e-mail to the same tester, stating, \u201cYes it is still available as I am selective as to who [sic] I rent to and I run a background check on any possible tenant, just so you know. It is an adult apartment house so it is quite [sic] and very will keep [sic] with no children or pets permitted.\u201d He sent a proposed lease to at least one tester; one of its terms was \u201cNo children or pets are permitted \u2014 period.\u201d Further, FHCS related that Granger told only an African-American tester that he ran background checks on prospective tenants because \u201che didn\u2019t want a rapist in the building\u201d; he did not make the same comment to a Caucasian tester.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">{\u00b6 5} Based on information from Kozera and the testers, FHCS contended that Granger had discriminated against Kozera, an African-American, on the basis of familial status and race in violation of 42 U.S.C. 3604 and R.C. 4112.02(H). In March 2011, Kozera and FHCS filed a complaint in federal court against Granger and Steigerwald, individually and in their capacities as trustees of the trust. Kozera claimed that she had \u201cexperienced out of pocket costs and emotional distress as a result of Defendants\u2019 conduct\u201d; FHCS alleged that it had \u201cexpended its resources and was harmed in its mission by Defendants\u2019 conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>{\u00b6 6} There was potential coverage under two separate Auto-Owners Insurance Group policies. Appellant Auto Owners (Mutual) Insurance Company-covered Granger, Steigerwald, and their trust under a dwelling policy that included landlord-liability coverage. The second policy is the one at issue in this appeal; it is an umbrella policy issued by appellant Owners Insurance Company under which Granger is the named insured. For ease of reference, we refer to appellants collectively as \u201cAuto-Owners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">{\u00b6 7} On May 18, 2011, Granger and Steigerwald forwarded the complaint to their insurance agent at the Church Agency. The agency contacted Auto-Owners, seeking coverage under the dwelling policy only. On June 8, 2011, Auto-Owners sent a letter to Granger and Steigerwald explaining that the dwelling policy did not provide coverage to them. Auto-Owners pointed out that the discrimination lawsuit did not allege any bodily injury, property damage, or personal injury that was covered by the policy. Auto-Owners stated that discrimination did not fall under the policy\u2019s definition of personal injury. The letter quoted the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d from the policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">c. Personal injury means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">(1) libel, slander, or defamation of character;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">(2) false arrest, detention or imprisonment, or malicious prosecution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">(3) invasion of privacy; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">(4) wrongful eviction or wrongful entry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">{\u00b6 8} The letter denying coverage did not mention the umbrella policy. After the denial under the dwelling policy, Granger\u2019s insurance agent, Michael Coudriet, determined that the agency should submit a claim to Auto-Owners on Granger\u2019s behalf under the umbrella policy. The agency submitted the claim on June 9, 2011. Granger and Steigerwald did not hear from Auto-Owners on the question of coverage under the umbrella policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">{\u00b6 9} On July 11, 2011, Granger and Steigerwald settled the federal case with Kozera and FHCS for $32,500. Separate payments went to the two plaintiffs: $5,000 to Kozera and $27,500 to FHCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">{\u00b6 10} On July 22, 2011, appellees sued Auto-Owners, the Church Agency, Inc., and Mike Coudriet for claims relating to Auto-Owners\u2019 failure to provide coverage. In this appeal, we address only appellees\u2019 claim regarding Auto-Owners\u2019 duty to defend Granger under the umbrella policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">{\u00b6 11} The umbrella policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>DEFENSE \u2014 SETTLEMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC-\">With respect to any occurrence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">(a) not covered by underlying insurance; but</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">(b) covered by this policy except for the retained limit; we will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">(a) defend any suit against the insured at our expense, using lawyers of our choice. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">(b) investigate or settle any claim or suit as we think appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">{\u00b6 12} The policy also states that Auto Owners \u201cwill pay on behalf of the insured the ultimate net loss in excess of the retained limit which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">{\u00b6 13} The definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d is broader in the umbrella policy than in the dwelling policy \u2014 it includes particular damages rather than only particular causes of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">\u201cPersonal injury\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-12\">(a) bodily injury, sickness, disease, disability or shock;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-13\">(b) mental anguish or mental injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-14\">(c) false arrest, false imprisonment, wrongful eviction, wrongful detention, malicious prosecution or humiliation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-15\">(d) libel, slander, defamation of character or invasion of rights of privacy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-16\">including resulting death, sustained by any person * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-17\">{\u00b6 14} The umbrella policy excludes coverage for intentional acts, stating, \u201cWe do not cover * * * [p]ersonal injury or property damage expected or intended by the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-18\">{\u00b6 15} Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment in the trial court on the issue of Auto-Owners\u2019 duty to defend Granger under the umbrella policy. Auto-Owners filed a motion seeking summary judgment on its duty to defend and indemnify the appellees under the policies. The trial court denied appellees\u2019 motion and granted that of Auto-Owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-19\">{\u00b6 16} Appellees appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in granting Auto-Owners\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the issue of its duty to defend Granger under the umbrella policy. The Ninth District Court of Appeals reversed. The appellate court pointed out that \u201cAuto-Owners defined personal injury both in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>terms of certain claims, such as malicious prosecution, and in terms of resulting harms, such as humiliation or mental anguish.\u201d 2013-Ohio-2792, 991 N.E.2d 1254, \u00b6 13 (9th Dist.). The court concluded that because Kozera claimed that she had suffered emotional distress, \u201cshe arguably suffered humiliation, which is a personal injury covered under the policy,\u201d and that, therefore, \u201cit would appear that the federal complaint alleges a personal injury as contemplated by the umbrella policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">{\u00b6 17} The appellate court next addressed the policy\u2019s intentional-acts exclusion. The court drew a distinction between Granger\u2019s intent to discriminate and his intent to cause personal injury. The court held that the argument that the exclusion applies because Granger intended the discrimination \u201cignores the plain language of the policy\u201d; instead, the court reasoned, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry under the exclusion portion of the policy * * * is whether Mr. Granger expected or intended Ms. Kozera to be humiliated by his conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15. The court found that Auto-Owners had not yet made an argument on that point, let alone introduced evidence. <em>Id. </em>The court also rejected the idea that the intent to injure could be inferred from Granger\u2019s acts: \u201c \u2018An insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment may be properly granted when intent may be inferred as a matter of law. In cases such as this one, where the insured\u2019s act does not necessarily result in harm, we cannot infer an intent to cause injury as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 186, 2010-Ohio-6312, 942 N.E.2d 1090, \u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 18} The court thus held that \u201cAuto-Owners [was] not entitled to summary judgment on the issue of whether it breached the contract by failing to defend Mr. Granger pursuant to the umbrella policy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">{\u00b6 19} The cause is before this court upon the allowance of Auto-Owners\u2019 discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">{\u00b6 20} An insurance policy is a contract; in interpreting contracts, courts must give effect to the intent of the parties, and that intent is presumed to be reflected in the plain and ordinary meaning of the contract language. <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. CPS Holdings, Inc., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 306, 2007-Ohio-4917, 875 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 7. In this case, there are several factors in play that affect how we interpret the policy at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">{\u00b6 21} First, this case concerns the duty to defend. The duty of an insurer to defend an insured is a broad duty \u2014 broader than the duty to indemnify \u2014 that is absolute when the complaint contains any allegation that could arguably be covered by the insurance policy. <em>Sharonville v. Am. Emps. Ins. Co., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-2180, 846 N.E.2d 833, \u00b6 13. An exception to the absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>duty exists when all the claims are each clearly and indisputably outside the coverage. <em>Id. </em>Another way of stating the exception is that the insurer need not provide a defense if there is no set of facts alleged in the complaint that, if proved true, would invoke coverage for any claim. <em>Cincinnati Indemn. Co. v. Martin, 85 </em>Ohio St.3d 604, 605, 710 N.E.2d 677 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">{\u00b6 22} In this appeal, we are also interpreting a policy exclusion; \u201c \u2018 \u201can exclusion in an insurance policy will be interpreted as applying only to that which is <em>dearly </em>intended to be excluded.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Hunter, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 540, 2011-Ohio-1818, 948 N.E.2d 931, \u00b6 11, quoting <em>Sharonville </em>at \u00b6 6, quoting <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd., </em>64 Ohio St.3d 657, 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, the policy at issue is an umbrella policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\u201cAn umbrella policy is a policy which provides excess coverage beyond an insured\u2019s primary policies.\u201d <em>Midwestern Indemn. Co. v. Craig </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 158, 164, 665 N.E.2d 712. See, also, <em>Cleveland Builders Supply Co. v. Farmers Ins. Group of Cos. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 708, 657 N.E.2d 851. Umbrella policies are different from standard excess insurance policies, since they provide both excess coverage (\u201cvertical coverage\u201d) and primary coverage (\u201chorizontal coverage\u201d). <em>Am. Special Risk Ins. Co. v. A-Best Prods., Inc. </em>(1997), 975 F.Supp. 1019, 1022. \u201cThe vertical coverage provides additional coverage above the limits of the insured\u2019s underlying primary insurance, whereas the horizontal coverage is said to \u2018drop down\u2019 to provide primary coverage for situations where the underlying insurance provides no coverage at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1022.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\"><em>Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 306, 2007-Ohio-4917, 875 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">{\u00b6 24} The umbrella policy in this case contained a more expansive definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d than did the dwelling policy. Its inclusion of coverage for particular harms rather than just for particular causes of action creates the crux of the case: did the umbrella policy\u2019s inclusion of coverage for humiliation give rise to a duty to defend under the particular facts of this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">{\u00b6 25} We address Auto-Owners\u2019 propositions of law in reverse order. We will first determine whether Kozera\u2019s claim for \u201cemotional distress\u201d damages is within the policy\u2019s coverage for humiliation. Then, we will determine whether any potential duty to defend is obviated by the policy\u2019s intentional-acts exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">\n<em>Emotional Distress as a Form of Humiliation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">{\u00b6 26} Auto-Owners\u2019 second proposition of law reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>A claim for emotional distress does not constitute \u201chumiliation\u201d sufficient to trigger a duty to defend under an umbrella policy of insurance. The duty to defend can only be triggered by actual facts, not an inference of potential recoverable damages where no covered conduct is even alleged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">{\u00b6 27} The issue is whether Kozera\u2019s allegation that she suffered \u201cemotional distress\u201d was sufficient to trigger Auto-Owners\u2019 duty to defend under the umbrella policy. The umbrella policy in this case includes coverage for particular harms \u2014 \u201csickness, disease, disability or shock; * * * mental anguish or mental injury [and] humiliation.\u201d We hold that Kozera\u2019s claim of emotional distress invoked coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">{\u00b6 28} First, emotional-distress damages were available to Kozera under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">Courts have held, under the Fair Housing Act, that plaintiffs may recover, as compensatory damages, out-of-pocket expenses for property damage and damages for emotional distress. * * * The Sixth Circuit has used a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d standard in evaluating a plaintiffs right to such damages in housing discrimination cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\"><em>Byrd v. Brandeburg, </em>932 F.Supp. 198, 200 (N.D.Ohio 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">{\u00b6 29} In <em>Bishop v. Pecsok, </em>431 F.Supp. 34, 38 (N.D.Ohio 1976), another case involving discrimination in housing, the court held that \u201c[i]n calculating the amount of compensatory damages this Court is required to consider not only out-of-pocket expenses, but also the emotional distress and humiliation suffered by plaintiffs.\u201d Under R.C. 4112.99, \u201cthe availability of \u2018damages\u2019 and \u2018other appropriate relief fairly encompasses an award for pain and suffering, mental anguish, humiliation, and the like.\u201d <em>Keys v. U.S. Welding, Fabricating &amp; Mfg., Inc., </em>N.D.Ohio No. CV91-0113, 1992 WL 218302, at *9 (Aug. 26, 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">{\u00b6 30} Does Kozera\u2019s claim of emotional distress encompass humiliation? The duty to defend is broad and is not dependent on magic words. We find that a broad allegation of emotional distress arguably contains an allegation of humiliation. As the appellate court noted, \u201cEmotional distress has been defined as \u2018[a] highly unpleasant mental reaction (such as anguish, grief, fright, <em>humiliation, </em>or fury) that results from another person\u2019s conduct[.]\u2019 (Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 563 (8th Ed.2004).\u201d 2013-Ohio-2792, 991 N.E.2d 1254, \u00b6 14. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Humiliation is one of the particular reactions that falls under the umbrella of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">{\u00b6 31} The policy at issue provides coverage for certain harms, including humiliation. Humiliation is a recognized injury in housing-discrimination cases. Humiliation is included within the ordinary meaning of \u201cemotional distress.\u201d Kozera alleged emotional distress. That was enough to establish that Kozera\u2019s allegation could be covered under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\n<em>Intentional-Acts Exclusion and Inferred Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">{\u00b6 32} Appellants\u2019 first proposition of law raises the question of whether the policy\u2019s exclusion for intentional acts obviates coverage for Granger even if Kozera\u2019s allegation of emotional distress was otherwise enough to trigger the duty to defend. The appellants\u2019 first proposition of law reads, \u201cDiscriminatory intent is inferred as a matter of law for purposes of an intentional act exclusion under an umbrella policy of insurance on a claim for pre-leasing housing discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">{\u00b6 33} Auto-Owners seeks application of the inferred-intent doctrine in this case. The policy in this case, like most other insurance policies, contains an intentional-acts exclusion, which relieves the obligation of Auto-Owners to provide coverage when the harm alleged is intentionally caused by the insured. Under the inferred-intent doctrine, \u201cwhen there is no evidence of direct intent to cause harm and the insured denies the intent to cause any harm, the insured\u2019s intent to cause harm will be inferred as a matter of law in certain instances.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 186, 2010-Ohio-6312, 942 N.E.2d 1090, \u00b6 9, citing <em>Gearing v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>76 Ohio St.3d 34, 36, 665 N.E.2d 1115 (1996), paragraph one of the syllabus. Auto-Owners argues that it can be inferred as a matter of law from the nature of Granger\u2019s act \u2014 pre-leasing housing discrimination \u2014 that Granger intended to cause Kozera\u2019s personal injuries; thus, since the policy \u201cdo[es] not cover * * * [personal injury or property damage expected or intended by the insured,\u201d there would be no duty to provide a defense or indemnity. Applying the inferred-intent doctrine would relieve Auto-Owners of the burden of proving intent through evidence: the evidence of intent would be inherent in Granger\u2019s act, there would be no genuine issue of fact regarding the issue, and thus summary judgment would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">{\u00b6 34} <em>Campbell </em>is the most recent of this court\u2019s decisions on the doctrine of inferred intent, and it discusses the development of the doctrine in Ohio. <em>Campbell </em>contains two important holdings. First, <em>Campbell </em>recognizes that although this court has inferred intent only in cases in which would-be insureds committed particularly heinous acts \u2014 the murder of a child in <em>Preferred Risk Ins. Co. v. Gill, </em>30 Ohio St.3d 108, 114-115, 507 N.E.2d 1118 (1987), and the molestation of children in <em>Gearing </em>\u2014\u201c[a]s applied to an insurance policy\u2019s inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tional-act exclusion, the doctrine of inferred intent is not limited to cases of sexual molestation or homicide.\u201d <em>Campbell </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. Second, this court held that \u201cthe doctrine of inferred intent applies only in cases in which the insured\u2019s intentional act and the harm caused are intrinsically tied so that the act has necessarily resulted in the harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. In making that decision, this court considered but declined to adopt the \u201csubstantially certain\u201d test in inferred-intent cases. Under that test, a harm that was substantially certain to result from an intentional act would fall under an intentional-acts exclusion of an insurance policy. Instead, this court held that for an act to fall within the doctrine, the harm must be the inherent result of an intentional act. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">{\u00b6 35} In <em>Campbell, </em>the underlying act by the potential insureds was the placement of a Styrofoam target deer on a hilly country road at night. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 2. A group of youths intentionally placed the deer in the roadway to watch the reactions of motorists. <em>Id. </em>Some motorists successfully avoided the fake deer, but one driver lost control of his vehicle and crashed; he and his passenger suffered serious injuries. <em>Id. </em>This court held that the serious harm that resulted from the act of placing the deer in the roadway was not \u201cintrinsically tied so that the act has necessarily resulted in the harm,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 48, and remanded the case to the trial court. There, the trier of fact would weigh the facts in evidence to determine whether the boys intended or expected harm. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 59. Any intent to harm would be determined by the trier of fact rather than inferred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cIn order to avoid coverage on the basis of an exclusion for expected or intentional injuries, the insurer must demonstrate that the injury itself was expected or intended.\u201d <em>Physicians Ins. Co. of Ohio v. Swanson, </em>58 Ohio St.3d 189, 569 N.E.2d 906 (1991), syllabus. We agree with the court below that \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry under the exclusion portion of the policy is whether the <em>personal injury </em>was expected or intended. Thus, the appropriate question to ask is whether Mr. Granger expected or intended Ms. Kozera to be humiliated by his conduct.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) 2013-Ohio-2792, 991 N.E.2d 1254, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">{\u00b6 37} We do not find that humiliation is so intrinsically tied to pre-leasing discrimination that Granger\u2019s act necessarily resulted in the harm suffered by Kozera. Although emotional-distress damages are available to victims of housing discrimination, such damages are not automatically awarded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">We have long held that emotional distress caused by housing discrimination is a compensable injury under the Fair Housing Act. See <em>Seaton v. Sky Realty Co., </em>491 F.2d 634, 636-38 (7th Cir.1974). However, a court may not presume emotional distress from the fact of discrimination. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>plaintiff must actually prove that he suffers from emotional distress and that the discrimination caused that distress. Cf. <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 263-64, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1052, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978) (holding in a procedural due process case that \u201cneither the likelihood [of emotional distress] nor the difficulty of proving it is so great as to justify awarding compensatory damages without proof that such injury actually was caused\u201d); <em>Spence v. Board of Education, </em>806 F.2d 1198, 1200-01 (3d Cir.1986) (applying the same principle in a first amendment case).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\"><em>United States v. Balistrieri, </em>981 F.2d 916, 931 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 38} Is this case of a kind with <em>Gill </em>and <em>Gearing, </em>cases in which insureds pled guilty to criminal acts of violence against children? We determine that it is not. Both Gill and Gearing, in the civil cases that followed their criminal convictions, claimed that they did not intend the civil injuries associated with their criminal acts. Those claims rang hollow, due to the nature of their acts. This court connected the civil claims to the underlying criminal acts, which necessarily included the intent to harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">{\u00b6 39} Here, Granger does not stand convicted of a criminal act that includes intent to harm as an element. Although he claims that he did not know he was violating the law, he did discriminate against Kozera. But Granger does not claim coverage for the discrimination; he instead claims coverage for the personal injury \u2014 the humiliation \u2014 that allegedly followed the discrimination. Included in the plain language of this umbrella policy is coverage for certain discrete injuries. Our only concern here is a specific harm, humiliation, and whether Granger intended to cause it.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">{\u00b6 40} Although <em>Campbell </em>holds that the inferred-intent doctrine is not limited to cases of murder or sexual molestation, it also warns that \u201ccourts should be careful to avoid applying the doctrine in cases where the insured\u2019s intentional act will not necessarily result in the harm caused by the act.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 186, 2010-Ohio-6312, 942 N.E.2d 1090, at \u00b6 48. The policy excludes coverage when \u201cthe personal injury * * * was expected or intended.\u201d We cannot say that the personal injury was intended in this case, nor can we say that emotional distress is inherent in the very nature of housing discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">{\u00b6 41} We note that Granger did not appeal the holding below that there was no coverage under the dwelling policy. The umbrella policy was more expansive, but even so, it arguably covers just one aspect of the damages suffered by Kozera. That is all that is necessary, however, to give rise to the duty to defend. Meanwhile, under this ruling, appellants still have the ability to demonstrate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the trier of fact that Granger intended to cause humiliation to Kozera. In this instance, the inferred-intent doctrine does not remove that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">{\u00b6 42} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b151-7\">O\u2019Donnell and Kennedy, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b151-8\">Kennedy, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ads\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">{\u00b6 43} Respectfully, I dissent. I would hold that appellant Auto Owners (Mutual) Insurance Company (\u201cAuto-Owners\u201d) had no duty to defend appellee Steve Granger against Valerie Kozera\u2019s discrimination lawsuit because the Auto-Owners\u2019 umbrella policy excluded from coverage those injuries that are expected or intended by the insured. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order of summary judgment in favor of Auto-Owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">\n<em>Insurance Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cThe duty [of the insurer] to defend [the insured] is determined by the scope of the allegations in the [plaintiffs] complaint.\u201d <em>Ward v.

However, even \u201cwhen there is no evidence of direct intent to cause harm and the insured denies any intent to cause harm, the insured\u2019s intent to cause harm will be inferred as a matter of law in certain instances\u201d (the \u201cinferred-intent doctrine\u201d). <em>Allstate Ins.

(\u201cFHCS\u201d), a nonprofit organization that promotes fair housing, filed a discrimination claim on behalf of Kozera against Granger in federal court alleging a violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq., which prevents discrimination in housing based on race and familial status. 42 U.S.C. 3604. The complaint alleged that Kozera is African-American and has a minor child. It also alleged that when Kozera called Granger about renting a house she had seen on Craigslist, Granger asked who would be living at the house and then said that \u201che would not rent the Premises to anyone with children.\u201d In his deposition, Granger denied that he refused to rent the house to Kozera.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">{\u00b6 49} The complaint alleged that as part of its investigation of Kozera\u2019s case, FHCS sent testers to inquire about renting housing from Granger.

Because discrimination and injury are intrinsically tied, the inferred-intent doctrine applies, which means that when Granger acted in a discriminatory manner, he intended injury as a matter of law, for the purpose of determining insurance coverage.
