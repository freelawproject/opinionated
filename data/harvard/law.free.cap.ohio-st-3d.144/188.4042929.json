We are asked to determine whether R.C. 519.02 requires a township to adopt a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d separately from its zoning resolution. We hold that a comprehensive plan pursuant to R.C. 519.02 may be included within a township\u2019s zoning resolution and need not be a separate and distinct document. Furthermore, a zoning resolution is enacted in accordance with a comprehensive plan, as required by R.C. 519.02, if it (1) reflects current land uses, (2) allows for change, (3) promotes public health and safety, (4) uniformly classifies similar areas, (5) clearly defines district locations and boundaries, and (6) identifies the use or uses to which each property may be put.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">I. Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, Apple Group, Ltd. (\u201cApple\u201d), purchased 88 acres of undeveloped land in Granger Township (\u201cGranger\u201d) in May 2006. The property was zoned R-l residential, which permits the construction of single-family and two-family homes on a minimum lot size of two acres. Granger\u2019s zoning resolution also provides for an R-2 residential district that allows two to three dwelling units per acre if they can be serviced by central water and sanitary sewers at the time of development. Because Apple sought to develop a subdivision consisting of 44 single-family homes situated on approximately one-acre lots on its property, it applied to appellee Granger Township Board of Zoning Appeals (\u201cBZA\u201d) for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>176 variances, four variances for each of the 44 proposed lots.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BZA denied the variance application.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">{\u00b6 3} Apple filed an administrative appeal, and the BZA\u2019s decision was affirmed by the Medina County Court of Common Pleas. The court found that the BZA\u2019s decision was supported by a preponderance of the evidence and that the request for variances was in reality an attempt to rezone the land to a new district unlike the R-l or R-2 residential districts, a request that the BZA was not authorized to grant. Apple also filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, seeking a declaration that Granger\u2019s zoning resolution establishing the R-l zoning classification is unconstitutional and beyond the authority delegated to Granger in R.C. Chapter 519. A magistrate issued a decision denying Apple\u2019s claims. With respect to the constitutional claim, the magistrate concluded, \u201cGranger Township\u2019s desire to maintain the rural character of its land is a legitimate governmental goal, which may be regulated by its zoning resolution.\u201d In denying Apple\u2019s claim that Granger exceeded its authority in enacting the zoning resolution without enacting a separate comprehensive plan, the magistrate concluded, \u201cThe zoning resolution itself meets the statutory requirement of a comprehensive plan, because it has the essential characteristics of a comprehensive plan; it encompasses all geographic parts of the community and integrates all functional elements.\u201d The common pleas court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings, and Apple appealed to the Ninth District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">{\u00b6 4} At the court of appeals, Apple argued that the trial court\u2019s declaration that Granger had complied with R.C. 519.02\u2019s requirement that a zoning resolution be adopted in accordance with a comprehensive plan was in error and was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court of appeals concluded that the township\u2019s failure to enact a separate comprehensive plan did not mean it lacks authority to adopt a zoning resolution. The court reasoned that the purpose of the requirement in R.C. 519.02 for a comprehensive plan is to prevent piecemeal zoning and ensure that someone purchasing property will be able <em>to </em>determine in advance how the property may be used. The appellate court rejected Apple\u2019s argument that a zoning ordinance cannot constitute a comprehensive plan and concluded that the trial court\u2019s decision that Granger\u2019s zoning resolution constitutes a comprehensive plan pursuant to R.C. 519.02 was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">{\u00b6 5} An appeal was taken to this court, and we accepted Apple\u2019s two propositions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>For purposes of a township\u2019s exercise of its statutory zoning power, the \u201czoning plan\u201d that R.C. Chapter 519 empowers townships to adopt by resolution, which includes the zoning regulations and a zoning map, is not identical to or a substitute for the \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d identified in R.C. 519.02, with which R.C. 519.02 requires the \u201czoning plan\u201d to be \u201cin accordance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">A township\u2019s zoning regulations, adopted by resolution under R.C. Chapter 519, are, standing alone, insufficient as a matter of law to establish that such regulations are \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan,\u201d as R.C. 519.02 requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\"><em>See </em>139 Ohio St.3d 1404, 2014-Ohio-2245, 9 N.E.3d 1062. In short, Apple argues that a comprehensive plan must be enacted separately and apart from zoning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">II. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cZoning\u201d is \u201cthe government\u2019s \u2018regulation of the character and intensity of real estate uses through police power.\u2019 [American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, <em>The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal </em>332 (1984)].\u201d <em>Developers Diversified Ltd. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 32, 36, 701 N.E.2d 975 (1998). In Ohio, the authority of a township to enact zoning ordinances derives not from the township\u2019s inherent authority or the Ohio Constitution, but from the General Assembly. <em>Torok v. Jones, </em>5 Ohio St.3d 31, 32, 448 N.E.2d 819 (1983), citing <em>Yorkavitz v. Columbia Twp. Bd. of Trustees, </em>166 Ohio St. 349, 142 N.E.2d 655 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. Chapter 519 sets forth the method by which townships may regulate land use. R.C. 519.02(A) grants authority to a township\u2019s board of trustees to regulate the size and location of buildings and other structures and the use of land for residences or other purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the interest of the public convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare, <em>the board by resolution, in accordance with a comprehensive plan, may regulate </em>the location of, set back lines for, and the uses of buildings and other structures * * * and the uses of land * * * in the unincorporated territory of the township, and may establish reasonable landscaping standards and architectural standards excluding exterior building materials in the unincorporated territory of the township.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 8} Apple\u2019s appeal does not challenge the reasonableness of Granger\u2019s zoning resolution but only whether the township\u2019s resolution may also function as its comprehensive plan. According to Apple, a comprehensive plan must be created first to assure the public that the township\u2019s zoning has been properly considered. Apple argues that a zoning resolution must implement the comprehensive plan. Granger argues that its Revised Zoning Resolution is the comprehensive plan identified in R.C. 519.02. The parties thus disagree over the meaning of the phrase \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\n<em>A \u201cComprehensive Plan\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">{\u00b6 9} There is no standard definition for \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d in the context of zoning law. The original Standard Zoning Enabling Act (\u201cSZEA\u201d), which the United States Department of Commerce issued in 1922 as a model for state legislation enabling and limiting local zoning power, included a requirement that zoning decisions be made \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u201d Hirokawa, <em>Making Sense of a \u201cMisunderstanding of the Planning Process\u201d: Examining the Relationship Between Zoning and Rezoning Under the Change-or-Mistake Rule, </em>44 Urb.Law. 295, 299 (2012). However, \u201c[t]he term \u2018comprehensive plan\u2019 was not defined in the SZEA, and so both its purpose and confines of legal sufficiency have not been well understood or enforced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300. The view of the majority of states adopting the SZEA language is that \u201ccomprehensive planning requires some form of forethought and reasoned consideration, as opposed to a separate plan document that becomes an overarching constitution guiding development.\u201d Sullivan &amp; Richter, <em>Out of the Chaos: Towards a National System of Landr-Use Procedures, </em>34 Urb.Law. 449, 454 (2002). A minority of states view the comprehensive plan as \u201can independent document separate from the comprehensive zoning ordinance.\u201d Benintendi, Comment, <em>The Role of the Comprehensive Plan in Ohio: Moving Away from the Traditional View, </em>17 U.Dayton L.Rev. 207, 217 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">{\u00b6 10} While R.C. Chapter 519 offers detailed instructions on how townships are to adopt or amend zoning plans or resolutions, it does not define the term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d or offer any specific guidance on the standard to be used to establish one. But we have considered the phrase \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan,\u201d as used in R.C. 519.02, and stated indirectly what it was not in <em>Cassell v. Lexington Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>163 Ohio St. 340, 127 N.E.2d 11 (1955). There, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">A township zoning regulation, which provides merely that a section of a township, one square mile in area, shall be zoned for farming, residential, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>commercial and recreational uses, and which does not specify therein which portions of said section may be used for any or all of such purposes or is not accompanied by a map designating such use areas, is not adopted in accordance with a comprehensive plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><em>Id., </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, by implication, a comprehensive plan consists of something more than zoning a section of a township to allow farming, residential, commercial, and recreational uses without specifying which portions of the section can be used for any of those purposes. In <em>Cassell, </em>we expressed concern over leaving the administration of zoning to the \u201cunwarranted whim or caprice\u201d of enforcement officials. <em>Id. </em>at 345-346. \u201cThe absence of any comprehensive plan in the regulation involved * * * open[ed] the door to an arbitrary and unreasonable administration of the regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">{\u00b6 11} We considered the phrase \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan\u201d more recently in <em>B.J. Alan Co. v. Congress Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1, 2009-Ohio-5863, 918 N.E.2d 501. That case addressed whether a township could rely on a comprehensive plan created at the county level. In answering yes, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">R.C. 519.02 does not require that a township create its own comprehensive plan \u2014 it requires only that a zoning resolution be \u201cin accordance with <em>a </em>comprehensive plan.\u201d (Emphasis added.) To require each township to create its own comprehensive plan is to read additional language into R.C. 519.02.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13. We emphasized that our holding in the case was limited and noted that among the issues not determined in the case was whether the township zoning ordinance was indeed \u201cin accordance\u201d with the county\u2019s comprehensive plan. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">{\u00b6 12} Neither <em>Cassell </em>nor <em>B.J. Alan </em>provides the answer to the issue before us today, but each ease sets forth principles that aid us in our decision. <em>Cassell </em>stands for the proposition that a comprehensive plan serves to protect against the arbitrary and unreasonable administration of a zoning regulation. <em>B.J. Alan </em>explains that a township is not required to create its own comprehensive plan, but that its zoning resolution must be enacted in accordance with <em>a </em>comprehensive plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">{\u00b6 13} Apple argues that the term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d is a term of art among zoning professionals and that the statutory language must be interpreted according to the meaning prevalent in that profession. This court, however, has never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>treated the term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d as a term of art, and no court has found that the phrase \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d has acquired a technical or particular meaning pursuant to R.C. 1.42. We have emphasized that \u201cthe plain meaning of a statute is always preferred.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 70, 2005-Ohio-3807, 831 N.E.2d 987, \u00b6 40, citing <em>Lamie v. United States Trustee, </em>540 U.S. 526, 536, 124 S.Ct. 1023, 157 L.Ed.2d 1024 (2004). Furthermore, \u201c \u2018[i]f a review of the statute conveys a meaning that is clear, unequivocal, and definite, the court need look no further.\u2019 <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Wilkins, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 112, 2004-Ohio-296, 802 N.E.2d 637, \u00b6 26.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 38. Our consideration of the statutory language leads us to conclude that no formally enacted comprehensive plan is required by R.C. 519.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">{\u00b6 14} We agree with Granger that the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan\u201d is that zoning regulations should be adopted pursuant to a plan that is comprehensive, or all-encompassing, in the sense that the plan addresses the specific goals and objectives for the entire township. This definition is implied in, and in keeping with, <em>Cassell, </em>which emphasizes that comprehensive plans are essential to protecting against arbitrary enforcement of zoning regulations. A court of appeals decision, however, is even more helpful in establishing a meaning of the contested phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\n<em>White Oak</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">{\u00b6 15} The Twelfth District Court of Appeals also concluded that a comprehensive plan need not be an independent document. <em>White Oak Property Dev., L.L.C. v. Washington Twp., </em>12th Dist. Brown No. CA2011-05-011, 2012-Ohio-425, 2012 WL 368254. In <em>White Oak, </em>the property owner sought declaratory relief on the basis of its claim that Washington Township\u2019s zoning resolution was unenforceable because it was not in accordance with a comprehensive plan. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4. The zoning resolution divided the territory of the township into four districts (agricultural, residential, commercial, and industrial) and reflected the primarily agricultural nature of the township\u2019s land. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 17, 24. The zoning resolution covered many topics, including land use, housing, and environmental precautions, and it incorporated a zoning map that marked the location and boundaries of each district, which the court noted allowed potential purchasers to identify the permissible uses of any particular piece of property. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 25. While the zoning resolution covered the entire township, the court of appeals emphasized that it also allowed for changes in zoning as the township\u2019s needs developed. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">{\u00b6 16} The Twelfth District agreed that the township\u2019s zoning resolution and accompanying zoning map constituted a comprehensive plan and that it therefore complied with R.C. 519.02. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23. The court considered the term \u201ccompre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>hensive plan\u201d to be a \u201cflexible term\u201d that \u201c \u2018must be sufficiently detailed that a potential purchaser might ascertain in advance to what use property might be put.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Rumpke Waste, Inc. v. Henderson, </em>591 F.Supp. 521, 534 (S.D.Ohio 1984). And furthermore, \u201c[w]ith respect to sufficient detail, the plan must \u2018define with certainty the location, boundaries and areas of the * * * districts,\u2019 and a failure to do so renders the plan invalid.\u201d <em>White Oak </em>at \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Westlake v. Elrick, </em>52 Ohio Law Abs. 538, 541, 83 N.E.2d 646 (8th Dist.1948). We adopt the factors that the <em>White Oak </em>court considered to be indicative of a comprehensive plan, i.e., that it \u201c(1) reflect current land uses; (2) allow for change; (3) promote public health and safety; (4) uniformly classify similar areas; (5) clearly define district locations and boundaries; and (6) identify the use(s) to which each property may be put.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 46, <em>citing Rumpke Waste </em>and <em>Elrick. </em>These factors are present within Granger\u2019s zoning resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\n<em>Granger\u2019s Zoning Resolution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">{\u00b6 17} Granger\u2019s Zoning Resolution is an exhaustive document, which consists of more than 100 pages and incorporates an attached zoning districts map.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">{\u00b6 18} The resolution\u2019s stated purpose is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">to promote and protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the residents of the unincorporated area of Granger Township, Medina County, Ohio, and to conserve and protect property and property values, and to provide for the maintenance of the rural character of Granger Township, and to manage orderly growth and development in said Township.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">{\u00b6 19} Thus, the zoning resolution is intended to be a comprehensive plan for the entire township. And all six <em>White Oak </em>points are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">\n<em>1. Reflects current land uses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">{\u00b6 20} The resolution contains general regulations that apply to all districts or zones within the township and sets forth specific uniform regulations for each individual district. The resolution also clearly sets forth the zoning districts and their boundary line on the attached map, which allows any potential purchaser to determine the uses to which a piece of property may be put.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">{\u00b6 21} It reflects current land uses in its intention to \u201cprovide for the maintenance of\u2019 the already-existing \u201crural character of Granger Township\u201d and its establishment of zoning districts reflecting the established rural character of the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\n<em>2. Allows for change</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">{\u00b6 22} The resolution allows for change: it establishes a process for property owners to obtain conditional zoning permits, which \u201cprovide controllable and reasonable flexibility in requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow profitable latitude for the investor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\n<em>3. Promotes health and safety</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">{\u00b6 23} The resolution promotes public health and safety: a number of provisions, such as those regulating the placement of signs that are in part \u201cintended to reduce sign or advertising distractions and obstructions that may contribute to traffic accidents,\u201d regulate potential hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\n<em>k- Uniformly classifies similar areas</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">{\u00b6 24} The resolution uniformly classifies similar areas: it creates seven distinct district types (R-l Residential, R-2 Residential, C-1 Local Commercial, C-2 General Commercial, C-3 Highway Interchange Commercial, 1-1 Industrial Commercial, and PDD Planned Development) and adopts clear regulations for each type of district.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\n<em>5. Clearly defines district locations and boundaries</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">{\u00b6 25} The resolution contains clearly defined district locations and boundaries that are set forth on a zoning-districts map incorporated into the resolution. It presents rules for interpretation in the event that \u201cuncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as shown on the zoning map.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">\n<em>6. Identifies the use or uses to which each property may be put</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">{\u00b6 26} Finally, the resolution identifies the use or uses to which each property may be put within each zoning type. For example, it allows for single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, certain manufactured homes, and certain roadside stands among the permitted uses within an R-l Residential District.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">{\u00b6 27} We accordingly conclude that the resolution satisfies the requirement of R.C. 519.02 that it be enacted \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">{\u00b6 28} We agree with those appellate courts that have considered the issue and have held<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that a comprehensive plan need not be set forth in a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>document and may be included in the township\u2019s zoning plan. A comprehensive plan is defined as one that reflects current land uses within the township, allows for change, promotes public health and safety, uniformly classifies similar areas, clearly defines district locations and boundaries, and identifies the use or uses to which each property may be put. Granger\u2019s zoning resolution was enacted in accordance with such a comprehensive plan pursuant to R.C. 519.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">{\u00b6 29} We accordingly affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b281-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b281-7\">Kennedy, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\">.

The majority defines a term that has acquired a particular meaning without reliance on authoritative or expert knowledge in a manner that is incongruous with the expert testimony presented in this matter, without consideration of the unique needs of Granger Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>{\u00b6 33} I do not believe that a comprehensive plan must be a single formal document.

Statutory Interpretation of R.C. 519.02(A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">{\u00b6 35} When interpreting a statute, a court\u2019s paramount concern is legislative intent. <em>State ex rel. United States Steel Corp. v. Zaleski, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 395, 2003-Ohio-1630, 786 N.E.2d 39, \u00b6 12. \u201c[T]he intent of the lawmakers is to be sought first of all in the language employed, and if the words be free from ambiguity and doubt, and express plainly, clearly, and distinctly the sense of the lawmaking body, there is no occasion to resort to other means of interpretation.\u201d <em>Slingluff v. Weaver, </em>66 Ohio St. 621, 64 N.E. 574 (1902), paragraph two of the syllabus. We apply the statute as written and refrain from adding or deleting words when the statute\u2019s meaning is clear and unambiguous. <em>Boley v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 510, 2010-Ohio-2550, 929 N.E.2d 448, \u00b6 20; <em>Armstrong v. John R. Jurgensen Co., </em>136 Ohio St.3d 58, 2013-Ohio-2237, 990 N.E.2d 568, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">{\u00b6 36} R.C. 519.02(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the interest of the public health and safety, the board of township trustees may regulate by resolution, in accordance with a comprehensive plan, the location, height, bulk, number of stories, and size of buildings and other structures, including tents, cabins, and trailer coaches, percentages of lot areas that may be occupied, set back building lines, sizes of yards, courts, and other open spaces, the density of population, the uses of buildings and other structures, including tents, cabins, and trailer coaches, and the uses of land for trade, industry, residence, recreation, or other purposes in the unincorporated territory of the township. Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the interest of the public convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare, the board by resolution, in accordance with a comprehen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>sive plan, may regulate the location of, set back lines for, and the uses of buildings and other structures, including tents, cabins, and trailer coaches, and the uses of land for trade, industry, residence, recreation, or other purposes in the unincorporated territory of the township, and may establish reasonable landscaping standards and architectural standards excluding exterior building materials in the unincorporated territory of the township. Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the interest of the public convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare, the board may regulate by resolution, in accordance with a comprehensive plan, for nonresidential property only, the height, bulk, number of stories, and size of buildings and other structures, including tents, cabins, and trailer coaches, percentages of lot areas that may be occupied, sizes of yards, courts, and other open spaces, and the density of population in the unincorporated territory of the township. For all these purposes, the board may divide all or any part of the unincorporated territory of the township into districts or zones of such number, shape, and area as the board determines. All such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of building or other structure or use throughout any district or zone, but the regulations in one district or zone may differ from those in other districts or zones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">{\u00b6 37} The term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d is not defined in R.C. Chapter 519. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, however, we have previously recognized that the term has acquired a particular meaning. <em>Symmes Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Smyth, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 549, 555, 721 N.E.2d 1057 (2000). R.C. 1.42 instructs that \u201c[wjords and phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning * * * shall be construed accordingly.\u201d Therefore, the testimony of experts engaged in the field of planning and zoning is relevant to determining the meaning of the term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d as it is used in R.C. 519.02(A). <em>See Order of Ry. Conductors of Am. v. Swan, </em>329 U.S. 520, 525, 67 S.Ct. 405, 91 L.Ed. 471 (1947); Evid.R. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">{\u00b6 38} We have not, however, treated the word \u201cresolution\u201d as having acquired a particular meaning. An ordinary and common meaning of \u201cresolution\u201d is \u201ca formal expression of opinion, will, or intent by an official body or assembled group.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1933 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">{\u00b6 39} The General Assembly used the phrase \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan\u201d and the word \u201cresolution\u201d in the same sentence in R.C. 519.02(A). Because \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d has acquired a particular meaning and \u201cresolution\u201d has not, they cannot describe the same thing. This interpretation is supported by the testimony of both parties\u2019 experts. Nothing in the experts\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>testimony provides support for concluding that \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d and \u201cresolution\u201d convey the same meaning. To the contrary, both of the experts who testified stated that a zoning resolution is the implementation of the comprehensive plan. Therefore, the terms cannot be interchangeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 40} Moreover, while the majority reads the phrase \u201cin accordance with\u201d out of the statute, under our rules for statutory interpretation, we are required to give each word effective meaning. \u201cAccordance\u201d is defined as \u201cagreement, accord\u201d and is \u201cnow used chiefly in the phrase \u2018in accordance with.\u2019 \u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 12. Another definition states, \u201cTo be <em>in accordance </em>is to be in conformity or compliance.\u201d (Italics sic.) Garner, <em>A Dictionary of Modem Legal Usage </em>14 (2d Ed.1995). We also recently noted that \u201cin accordance with\u201d connotes rigid compliance. <em>State v. Niesen-Pennycuff, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 416, 2012-Ohio-2730, 973 N.E.2d 221, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">{\u00b6 41} Once we strictly apply rules of statutory interpretation to R.C. 519.02(A), its meaning is clear and unambiguous. The General Assembly\u2019s language refers to two distinct items: a comprehensive plan and a zoning resolution. Therefore, the General Assembly granted townships the authority to zone, but required that the authority be exercised only in compliance with a comprehensive plan. The zoning resolution cannot comply with itself. Accordingly, the requirement of rigid compliance, coupled with the fact that \u201cresolution\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d are distinct terms, conveys the meaning that they are separate documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">{\u00b6 42} This interpretation is supported by the language in other statutes and regulations in which the General Assembly and regulatory agencies use the phrase \u201cin accordance with\u201d when identifying separate actions. In R.C. 941.21, which sets forth definitions relating to an animal disease, the General Assembly uses the phrase \u201cin accordance with\u201d numerous times. <em>See, e.g., </em>R.C. 941.21(B)(1) (\u201cnegative\u201d means animals that are determined to be negative \u201cby tests conducted in accordance with [United States department of agriculture] methods and standards\u201d). Ohio Adm.Code 3745-300-11, pertaining to the cleanup of contaminated property, repeatedly uses the phrase. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ohio Adm.Code 3745-300-11(A)(1) (\u201cwhen a phase II property assessment conducted in accordance with [Ohio Adm.Code] 3745-300-07\u201d) and 3745~300-11(C)(1) (\u201can operation and maintenance plan prepared in accordance with this rule\u201d). These sections cannot be interpreted to mean that the test is also the methods and standards, R.C. 941.21(B)(1), or the assessment or maintenance plan is also the rule, Ohio Adm.Code 3745-300-11(A)(1) and (C)(1), that they must comply with. Instead, each action is separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">{\u00b6 43} Lastly, the majority\u2019s holding requires the insertion of words into R.C. 519.02(A) that were not used by the General Assembly. Specifically, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>majority\u2019s holding, R.C. 519.02(A) would state, \u201cthe board may regulate by resolution, in accordance with itself.\u201d However, we have repeatedly held that \u201c[i]n matters of construction, it is the duty of this court to give effect to the words used, not to delete words used or to insert words not used.\u201d <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Cleveland, </em>37 Ohio St.3d 50, 524 N.E.2d 441 (1988), paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\n<em>B. Precedents and Scholarly Interpretations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 44} In addition to ignoring the rules of statutory interpretation, today\u2019s majority also ignores our precedents. While this is the first case to specifically consider whether a township zoning regulation can also be a \u201ccomprehensive plan,\u201d our precedents have acknowledged the significance of the General Assembly\u2019s term \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">{\u00b6 45} In <em>Columbia Oldsmobile, Inc. v. Montgomery, </em>56 Ohio St.3d 60, 65, 564 N.E.2d 455 (1990), this court held that \u201cthere is no statutory requirement that [a municipality] * * * enact a comprehensive community plan pursuant to its power to zone under R.C. 713.06 <em>et seq.\" </em>To reach that conclusion, the court compared the statutory language permitting municipalities to zone with the statutes permitting counties and townships to enact zoning regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 66-67. R.C. 713.06, which addresses a municipality\u2019s power to zone, states only that a municipality may create \u201czones or districts * * * in the interest of the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare\u201d and states that the municipality may adopt a plan for doing so. <em>Id. </em>But \u201cR.C. 303.02, regulating rural land use in counties, and R.C. 519.02, regulating land use in townships, <em>require </em>that zoning regulations promulgated by counties and townships be in accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Columbia Oldsmobile </em>at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">{\u00b6 46} Moreover, contrary to the majority opinion\u2019s statement, our recent decision in <em>B.J. Alan Co. v. Congress Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1, 2009-Ohio-5863, 918 N.E.2d 501, did not analyze the entire phrase \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u201d Instead, our focus was whether the term \u201ca comprehensive plan\u201d required a township to create its own comprehensive plan or whether it could follow the comprehensive plan created by the county. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13, 31. We avoided any discussion of the phrase \u201cin accordance with,\u201d stating, \u201c[W]e have not determined today * * * whether the * * * Township zoning ordinance is indeed \u2018in accordance\u2019 with the * * * County Comprehensive Plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">{\u00b6 47} Our analysis in <em>B.J. Alan, </em>however, supports the conclusion that the resolution and comprehensive plan are distinct. We did not examine whether the resolution was intended by the township to be a comprehensive plan, but instead remanded for the trial court to determine whether the resolution complied with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the separate and distinct county comprehensive plan, thus implicitly recognizing that a zoning resolution and a comprehensive plan are separate and distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">{\u00b6 48} As 'noted in the dissenting opinion of Judge Belfance in the court of appeals in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">[R]ecent case law from the Ohio Supreme Court suggests that townships are required, pursuant to R.C. 519.02, to engage in some form of planning and study that would form the basis for the creation and adoption of their zoning regulations. <em>See B.J. Alan Co. v. Congress Twp. Bd. of Zoning, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1, 2009-Ohio-5863 [918 N.E.2d 501], \u00b6 32-42 (noting that Wayne County\u2019s plan constituted a comprehensive plan as it \u201cpresented] a thorough study of the region and set[ ] forth comprehensive land-use goals for the county [ ]\u201d). It would seem that, if the Supreme Court was inclined to take the position that a zoning regulation and a comprehensive plan were one and the same, it could have used <em>B.J. Alan </em>as an opportunity to clarify the law in this area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">Thus, instead of examining whether the county\u2019s plan was a comprehensive plan, the Court could have chosen to examine the zoning regulations to see if they constituted a comprehensive plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">(Brackets sic.) 2013-Ohio-4259, 2013 WL 5437644, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">{\u00b6 49} Planning-and-zoning scholars Stuart Meck and Kenneth Pearlman contend that <em>B.J. Alan </em>\u201cresolved an important issue: zoning must be consistent with an independently prepared comprehensive plan that is adopted separately.\u201d Meck &amp; Pearlman, <em>Ohio Planning and Zoning Law, </em>Section 4:37, at 121 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">{\u00b6 50} Perhaps more troubling is the unintended consequences of today\u2019s majority opinion. Without explanation, the majority has compromised our holding in <em>B.J. Alan. </em>The language of R.C. 519.02(A) is almost identical to the language of R.C. 303.02(A), which grants authority to county commissioners to regulate building and land use. The General Assembly used the phrase \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan\u201d in both statutes to limit the exercise of police power in county and township zoning. The logical conclusion from today\u2019s majority opinion has a twofold effect. First, a county will not need to formulate a separate and distinct comprehensive plan to guide the enactment of its zoning resolutions. Second, a township will now be able to enact a zoning resolution that is merely \u201cin accordance with\u201d a county\u2019s zoning resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">{\u00b6 51} Lastly, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Cassell v. Lexington Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>163 Ohio St. 340, 127 N.E.2d 11 (1955), as providing an implied definition of the term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d is misplaced. The <em>Cassell </em>court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>not analyze the term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d as used in R.C. 519.02(A): the statement that \u201c[t]he absence of any comprehensive plan in the regulation * * * opens the door to an arbitrary and unreasonable administration of the regulation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 346, was dicta. <em>Cassell </em>was a constitutional due-process challenge to a zoning regulation in Lexington Township. In reaching its conclusion that \u201cthe power to enact zoning regulations can not be exercised in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner,\u201d the court cited <em>Youngstown v. Kahn Bros. Bldg. Co., </em>112 Ohio St. 654, 148 N.E. 842 (1925), and <em>State ex rel. Synod of Ohio of United Lutheran Church in Am. v. Joseph, </em>139 Ohio St. 229, 39 N.E .2d 515 (1942). <em>Id. </em>at 345-346. Both of those cases were decided prior to the enactment of the statute enabling townships to zone and were due-process challenges to municipal zoning ordinances. Neither case addressed the term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d because a municipality\u2019s zoning resolution does not need to be formulated in accordance with a comprehensive plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">II. Issues Decided by the Majority That Were Not Accepted for Review</p>\n<p id=\"APX\">\n<em>A. Factors of a Comprehensive Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">{\u00b6 52} The issue of what constitutes a comprehensive plan was not appealed to this court, and the parties did not brief or argue this point of zoning law. In fact, at oral argument, Apple Group\u2019s counsel, in response to questions from the bench, specifically stated that the issue of what constitutes a comprehensive plan was not before the court. Nevertheless, the majority uses this case as an opportunity to define a term that already has a particular meaning, without relying on experts or authoritative statements and without considering the unique needs of Granger Township, by adopting the six factors delineated by the Twelfth District Court of Appeals in <em>White Oak Property Dev., L.L.C. v. Washington Twp., </em>12th Dist. Brown No. CA2011-05-011, 2012-Ohio-425, 2012 WL 368254, \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">{\u00b6 53} Without engaging in any statutory analysis, the <em>White Oak </em>court, relying on cases that were decided on constitutional grounds or that involved municipalities, which are not required to have a comprehensive plan, held that a township\u2019s zoning resolution and map was a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d as that phrase is used in R.C. 519.02. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b623. That court then stated that because the township\u2019s zoning resolution had addressed six factors, the resolution and map were \u201ca comprehensive rural zoning plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">{\u00b6 54} The majority\u2019s decision to adopt these six factors to define a comprehensive plan is problematic. First, like the majority, the <em>White Oak </em>court failed to engage in any statutory interpretation of R.C. 519.02(A) and failed to acknowledge that this court had previously determined that the term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d had a particular meaning, <em>see Symmes, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 555, 721 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>1057, and ignored the commands of R.C. 1.42 that \u201c[w]ords and phrases that have acquired technical or particular meaning * * * shall be construed accordingly.\u201d The <em>White Oak </em>court also did not analyze the history of or trace the development of the term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d in the specialized field of land planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">{\u00b6 55} Second, the <em>White Oak </em>court limited its adoption of the six factors to the zoning resolution and map before it, <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 46, but today\u2019s majority broadens that application and uses those factors to define the term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d as it is used in R.C. 519.02. This determination, in my opinion, removes the unique independent considerations of what factors should constitute a comprehensive plan for each township. <em>See </em>Meck &amp; Pearlman, Section 4:32, at 102-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">{\u00b6 56} Lastly, the <em>White Oak </em>factors are nothing more than the General Assembly\u2019s statutory limitations on township trustees\u2019 authority to regulate land use. <em>See </em>R.C. 519.02(A) (\u201cin the interest of the public health and safety,\u201d \u201cpercentages of lot areas that may be occupied,\u201d \u201csizes of yards, courts, and other open spaces [and] the density of population,\u201d \u201cthe uses of land for trade, industry, residence, recreation, or other purposes,\u201d and the \u201cboard may divide all or any part of the * * * township into districts or zones of such number, shape, and area as the board determines\u201d). Land use is a component of, but not synonymous with, a comprehensive plan. <em>See B.J. Alan, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1, 2009-Ohio-5863, 918 N.E.2d 501, \u00b6 31; Meck &amp; Perlman, Section 4:32, at 102-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">{\u00b6 57} The <em>White Oak </em>factors are inconsistent with the expert opinions presented by the parties in this case and the elements discussed in the authoritative treatise by Meck and Perlman. Granger Township itself presented the expert testimony of Susan Hirsch, deputy director of the Medina County Department of Planning Services. She testified that a comprehensive plan is a document \u201clooking 20 years in to the future\u201d that serves as \u201ca guide for a community\u2019s growth and development\u201d and that it often incorporates maps and charts that show the community\u2019s likely future growth. According to Hirsch, the comprehensive plan contains \u201celements like housing, economic development, parks and recreation, agriculture,\u201d public facilities, and transportation and sets forth goals and objectives for the community as well as ways to implement those goals and objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">{\u00b6 58} David Hartt, president and sole owner of D.B. Hartt, Inc., a Cleveland-based planning-and-development consulting firm, testified as an expert for Apple Group. He stated that a comprehensive plan is \u201ctypically a community\u2019s deliberate, thoughtful statement of what their aspirations are as they look ahead * * * to how they envision the community being developed and/or preserved.\u201d He contended that the plan should take into account the pattern of economic development, traffic, public facilities, and road and infrastructure improvements as well as the implementation of the plan, typically through zoning. Additionally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Hartt stated that the map that often is included in the plan \u201ccan be a very precise map indicating a future land use for each property or it can be more of a general map where it outlines some options for some property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">{\u00b6 59} Hirsch and Hartt agree as to what constitutes a comprehensive plan. Each opined that it should set forth the community\u2019s future goals as to growth and development, discuss community facilities, land use, economic development, transportation, and implementation and should contain a map. Their opinions reflect the discussion in Meck and Pearlman\u2019s treatise, which states that a comprehensive plan should be accompanied by a map and contain the following elements: general statements of the community\u2019s planning goals, land use, transportation, community facilities, housing, an implementation framework, and plans for the specific needs of a particular community, e.g., economic-development strategy or historic preservation. Meck &amp; Pearlman, Section 4:32, at 102-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 60} It defies logic that the <em>White Oak </em>factors are indicative of a comprehensive plan when those are the factors set out in R.C. 519.02(A) as the aspects of land use that are to be regulated by a resolution in accordance with a comprehensive plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\n<em>B. Expert Opinions Whether Granger Township Has a Comprehensive Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">{\u00b6 61} The majority applies the six factors from <em>White Oak </em>to Granger Township\u2019s zoning resolution and concludes that Granger Township\u2019s resolution is a comprehensive plan. However, both Hirsch and Hartt opined that Granger Township\u2019s resolution is not a comprehensive plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">{\u00b6 62} Hirsch testified that the resolution was deficient because it did not have a statement of goals and objectives, a survey of transportation infrastructure, demographic data, or an inventory of community facilities. Hartt opined that the lack of a comprehensive plan and the failure to include the features of a comprehensive plan in the zoning resolution left nothing for a planner to consult to determine whether the preservation of the community\u2019s natural features was appropriate to meet Granger Township\u2019s goals. Nevertheless, the majority rejects out of hand this expertise and knowledge, instead finding that Granger Township\u2019s zoning resolution is a comprehensive plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\n<em>C. Comprehensive Plan Rendered Meaningless</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJ2\">{\u00b6 63} The majority\u2019s decision is a death knell to the General Assembly\u2019s limitation of a township\u2019s exercise of police power because it eliminates the requirement for a comprehensive plan independent of a township\u2019s zoning resolution. First, the majority opinion identifies land use as only one element needed for a comprehensive plan. Then, by holding that a zoning resolution may be the comprehensive plan, the majority has eliminated the distant-future-planning factor from a comprehensive plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>{\u00b6 64} The statutory procedures for townships and counties to amend a zoning resolution are not so onerous that they cannot be undertaken on a regular basis. <em>See </em>R.C. 519.12 and 303.12. This case illustrates how easily zoning regulations can change: Granger Township enacted a zoning resolution effective May 17, 2006, and a mere 15 months later enacted another zoning resolution effective August 8, 2007. The ability to amend a zoning resolution in such a short period of time is antithetical to a comprehensive plan\u2019s purpose of looking 15 to 20 years into the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">{\u00b6 65} Accordingly, the majority opinion renders the grant of authority to a township to zone pursuant only to a resolution in accordance with a comprehensive plan meaningless. Township trustees as well as county commissioners will be able to exercise this power without considering the long-term impact of their zoning decisions. Zoning resolutions will be enacted at the whims of those elected at that moment in time. Such an outcome is contrary to the majority\u2019s recognition \u201cthat a comprehensive plan serves to protect against the arbitrary and unreasonable administration of a zoning regulation.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 12, citing <em>Cassell, </em>163 Ohio St. 340,127 N.E.2d 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">III. Alternative Resolution</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\n<em>A. Judicial Review when Township Lacks a Separate, Single, Formal Comprehensive Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">{\u00b6 66} Before the rise of zoning regulations in the early 20th century, governments did not regulate land-use conflicts in advance. Meck &amp; Pearlman, Section 1:2, at 4-5, and Section 2:1, at 19. Instead, conflicts were decided primarily by the courts after a dispute had arisen. <em>Id., </em>Section 2:1, at 19. Regulating land use in this manner was limiting. Decisions affected only the parties to the suit and often the broader needs of society were not considered. <em>Id. </em>at 19-20. Further, the increasing complexity of the issues imposed upon the expertise and time of courts. Accordingly, governments turned to zoning to regulate land use so that property disputes would not arise and planning and land development could proceed appropriately. <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">{\u00b6 67} The state\u2019s authority to plan and regulate land use is derived from its police power, which is vested in the legislature. <em>See </em>Ohio Constitution, Article II, Section 1. Municipalities were the first to receive the police power to regulate by zoning in R.C. Chapter 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">{\u00b6 68} The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a municipal zoning ordinance in <em>Pritz v. Messer, </em>112 Ohio St. 628, 149 N.E. 30 (1925). Recognizing the home-rule authority of a municipality in Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution, we held that \u201c[ujnder the police power[,] society may restrict the use of property without making compensation therefor, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>restriction be reasonably necessary for the preservation of the public health, morals, or safety.\u201d <em>Pritz </em>at 637-638.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">{\u00b6 69} One year later, the United States Supreme Court held that a municipal ordinance restricting use of land in a residential area was constitutional. <em>Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 U.S. 365, 396, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303 (1926). After recognizing the validity of exercising police power for the benefit of the public welfare, the court stated, \u201cA regulatory zoning ordinance, which would be clearly valid to the great cities, might be clearly invalid as applied to rural communities,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 387, \u201clike a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 388. In reaching its determination, the court held that the burden of proof rested with the party challenging the zoning ordinance and the court\u2019s role was limited to determining whether the ordinance was reasonable to promote a valid public purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 395-397.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">{\u00b6 70} Absent the adoption of a charter, <em>see </em>Ohio Constitution, Article X, Section 3, Ohio counties\u2019 and townships\u2019 police-power authority \u201coriginates through direct statutory delegation by the General Assembly, instead of through the state constitution.\u201d Meck &amp; Pearlman, Section 3:4, at 63. The General Assembly granted the authority to regulate land use to counties and townships in R.C. Chapters 303 and 519. As stated previously, such an exercise of police power is limited \u201cto that which is expressly delegated * * * by statute.\u201d <em>See Yorkavitz, </em>166 Ohio St. at 351, 142 N.E.2d 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">{\u00b6 71} Like legislative enactments, zoning regulations enjoy a presumption of constitutionality. <em>Brown v. Cleveland, </em>66 Ohio St.2d 93, 95, 420 N.E.2d 103 (1981). The burden of proving unconstitutionality is on the party challenging the zoning regulation. <em>Negin v. Mentor Bd. of Bldg. &amp; Zoning Appeals, </em>69 Ohio St.2d 492, 495, 433 N.E.2d 165 (1982); <em>Ketchel v. Bainbridge Twp., </em>52 Ohio St.3d 239, 245, 557 N.E.2d 779 (1990). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is presumed that the procedure necessary to the legal adoption of legislation by a public legislative body has been followed.\u201d <em>Smith v. Juillerat, </em>161 Ohio St. 424, 119 N.E.2d 611 (1954), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b6 72} It is against this historical backdrop and with these legal principles in mind that I turn to the issues presented currently. Apple Group asserts two propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">{\u00b6 73} The first proposition of law states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">For purposes of a township\u2019s exercise of its statutory zoning power, the \u201czoning plan\u201d that R.C. Chapter 519 empowers townships to adopt by resolution, which includes the zoning regulations and a zoning map, is not identical to or a substitute for the \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d identified in R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>519.02, with which R.C. 519.02 requires the \u201czoning plan\u201d to be \u201cin accordance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 74} As stated above, the clear and unambiguous language of R.C. 519.02(A) requires a comprehensive plan separate and distinct from the zoning resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 75} Apple Group\u2019s second proposition of law states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">A township\u2019s zoning regulations, adopted by resolution under R.C. Chapter 519, are, standing alone, insufficient as a matter of law to establish that such regulations are \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan,\u201d as R.C. 519.02 requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">{\u00b6 76} Apple Group seemingly argues in both propositions of law that a comprehensive plan is a document drafted after professionals complete studies of the area and its future growth. While I agree that a comprehensive plan would best be drafted as a single formal document, there is no textual support for such a requirement in the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">{\u00b6 77} The General Assembly did not define the term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d in R.C. Chapter 519. While zoning-and-planning experts agree with our precedents that the term has a particular meaning, it is clear that those experts believe that a plan should nevertheless be flexible and controlled by the unique needs of each township. I agree with Apple Group that what is appropriate for an agricultural township might not be what is appropriate for a more cosmopolitan township. However, I reject the argument made by Apple Group and amicus curiae, Ohio Township Association, that to be valid, a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d must be drafted by a professional planner, which could require the expenditure of \u201ctens of thousands of dollars.\u201d The statute does not require a comprehensive plan formulated by professional planners after the completion of expensive studies. Instead, the statute requires a zoning commission, in the development of the zoning plan, to make use of \u201cinformation and counsel\u201d from \u201cpublic officials, departments and agencies,\u201d but it leaves to the discretion of the township, and its financial health, whether to employ \u201cplanning consultants.\u201d <em>See </em>R.C. 519.05. It would be unreasonable to find that a comprehensive plan must be created by professional planning consultants when it is clear that the General Assembly considered the fiscal limitations of townships and granted townships the discretion whether to employ them.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">{\u00b6 78} I further reject Apple Group\u2019s determination that Granger Township does not have a comprehensive plan separate from the zoning resolution. The statement that Granger Township does not have a comprehensive plan for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>guidance for the proposed rezoning, which is found in a staff report from the township\u2019s planning department, is subject to multiple meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">{\u00b6 79} A comprehensive plan does not need to be a single document. Instead, I believe that a comprehensive plan may rely on numerous sources. In other words, the township\u2019s rationale for ensuring the appropriate use and development of land may be derived from several sources. This conclusion balances the need to rely on experts to formulate the comprehensive plan, <em>see Order of Ry. Conductors, </em>329 U.S. at 525, 67 S.Ct. 405, 91 L.Ed. 471, against the fact that the General Assembly has failed to provide a definition for the term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d and the mechanisms by which it is to be formulated. I refuse, however, to speculate as to the source or sources from which a comprehensive plan might be formulated, because this determination would fall within the province of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b6 80} Lastly, contrary to Apple Group\u2019s argument, the determination that Granger Township lacks a separate, single, formal comprehensive plan does not render the township\u2019s zoning resolution invalid. Instead, I believe that the failure to have a separate comprehensive plan means only that the presumption of the resolution\u2019s validity is rebuttable. <em>See Raabe v. Walker, </em>383 Mich. 165, 178, 174 N.W.2d 789 (1970); <em>Forestview Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Cook Cty., </em>18 Ill.App.3d 230, 242, 309 N.E.2d 763 (1974). Therefore, if the party challenging the zoning resolution shows that a township does not have a separate comprehensive plan, the burden shifts to the township to present evidence that notwithstanding its failure to formulate a plan, the resolution is a valid exercise of police power granted by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>B. Remand to Trial Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 81} Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Ninth District Court of Appeals, and I would remand this matter to the trial court with instructions to determine, relying upon the knowledge and experience of experts, what would constitute a comprehensive plan formulated for the unique needs of Granger Township. Thereafter, Apple Group would have the burden to prove that Granger Township does not have a separate comprehensive plan. Whether Apple Group is successful in establishing that Granger Township does not have a separate comprehensive plan will dictate which party carries the burden of proving that the resolution is a proper exercise of police powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">{\u00b6 82} Respectfully, I dissent. \u201cIn Ohio, the authority of a township to enact zoning ordinances derives not from the township\u2019s inherent authority or the Ohio Constitution, but from the General Assembly.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 6. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>fore, township trustees can exercise only the authority specifically granted by the legislature.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Azh\">Berns, Ockner <em>&amp; </em>Greenberger, L.L.C., Sheldon Berns, Benjamin J. Ockner, and Gary F. Werner, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AOeT\">Dean Holman, Medina County Prosecuting Attorney, and Brian M. Richter, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aya\">Brosius, Johnson &amp; Griggs, L.L.C., Donald F. Brosius, Peter N. Griggs, and Jennifer L. Huber, urging affirmance for amicus curiae, Ohio Township Association.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 83} The unambiguous language in R.C. 519.02(A) demonstrates that the General Assembly intended to limit a township\u2019s exercise of zoning power to regulations enacted \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u201d Since a township\u2019s zoning resolution and a comprehensive plan cannot be one and the same, I would hold that a comprehensive plan must be separate and distinct from a zoning resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 84} Moreover, I would neither delineate the factors that are indicative of a comprehensive plan nor determine whether Granger Township even has a comprehensive plan. These issues were not raised as propositions of law in this appeal, and the parties neither briefed nor argued these matters. The majority crafts its own definition for a term that has a particular meaning in the field of zoning. The majority\u2019s definition is inconsistent with the expert testimony presented in this matter and does not consider the unique needs of Granger Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 85} Further, I do not believe that a comprehensive plan must be a single formal document. Instead, it may be derived from several sources. In the event, however, that Apple Group is able to prove that Granger Township does not have a comprehensive plan, even one derived from a compilation of sources, Granger Township\u2019s zoning resolution would not be presumptively invalid. Instead, the burden of proof would then shift to Granger Township to establish that its resolution is a valid exercise of the police power granted to it by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">{\u00b6 86} Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
