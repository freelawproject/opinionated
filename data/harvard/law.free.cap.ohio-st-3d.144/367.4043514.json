The Tenth District Court of Appeals granted the writ. Because the court of appeals independently reevaluated the medical evidence and substituted its judgment regarding weight and credibility for that of the board, we hold that the court of appeals abused its discretion, and we reverse. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">{\u00b6 2} In 1989, Woodman suffered a hemorrhage in the pons, an area of the brainstem. In 1989 and 1991, she underwent surgery, and part of her pons and part of her cerebellum were removed. As a result of the surgery and the original hemorrhage, the muscles on the right side of Woodman\u2019s face are weak, she has lost vision in her right eye and some of her hearing, and she is confined to a wheelchair.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">{\u00b6 3} In 1999, the Ohio State University English Department hired Woodman as an office assistant. Her position was eliminated in November 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">{\u00b6 4} In October 2011, Woodman submitted a disability-retirement application to the board. In the application, Woodman indicated that her condition had progressively worsened over the years, and she identified three specific limitations. Her \u201cbiggest problem,\u201d she wrote, was her eyesight. In addition, she stated that her handwriting has become illegible even to herself. And third, she spelled out in some detail her worsening hearing problems.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">As I have been getting older, I\u2019ve found that my hearing ability is decreasing and my vision has become much worse. I now have trouble hearing students and co-workers when they are in the office. Over the years, my condition has progressively worsened. * * * My hearing has also become jumbled. I find that if I\u2019m in an office setting with various noise [sic] and sounds occurring, I am unable to hear and understand the individual student that I might be speaking to at my front desk. I try to lean over my desk to hear the individual, but this has become too limiting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">{\u00b6 5} In support of her application, she submitted a report, dated October 13, 2011, from Donald Mack, M.D., which noted the following disabling conditions: (1) pontine hemorrhage with hemiparesis, (2) wheelchair bound, (3) carpal-tunnel syndrome, and (4) decreased hearing. Dr. Mack described her prognosis for recovery as poor and described her deficits as permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">{\u00b6 6} The board required Woodman to submit to an independent medical examination with Dr. Robert Shadel. Dr. Shadel prepared a report in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>concluded that Woodman was not disabled. In response to the specific question whether Woodman\u2019s hearing loss affected her ability to perform her job functions, Dr. Shadel wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">In my medical opinion, Ms. Woodman has demonstrated adequate hearing in the examination room to allow her to perform the necessary job functions of office assistant. She is able to hear conversation well and accurately. As I have noted above, she is bright and articulate and has no trouble responding to spoken voice in appropriate verbal manner. <em>Thus, in my medical opinion, her hearing deficit primarily in right ear does not disable her from the job of office assistant.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 7} Woodman\u2019s file, which included Dr. Shadel\u2019s report, was then sent to Managed Medical Review Organization (\u201cMMro\u201d) (the third-party administrator for the board) for review. Based on Dr. Shadel\u2019s report, Dr. Jeffrey Deitch recommended rejection of the claim. The board rejected the claim by letter dated February 16, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">{\u00b6 8} Woodman appealed. In support of the appeal, she submitted an examination report from Dr. Gerald Steiman. In his report, Dr. Steiman noted that testing on April 4, 2012, showed reduced hearing. Woodman displayed moderate-to-severe neurosensory hearing loss on her right side, with poor speech recognition. And otoacoustic-emission testing \u201crevealed absent in all frequencies in the right ear.\u201d Based on her test results and his own examination, Dr. Steiman concluded that her hearing dynamics had been altered such that her discrimination is \u201cmarkedly reduced\u201d on the right side.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">{\u00b6 9} Dr. Steiman opined that Woodman was unable to perform the functions of an office assistant. However, his report did not indicate whether Woodman\u2019s disabling condition was her hearing loss, her vision loss, her paralysis, her memory problems, or some combination of these and other conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">{\u00b6 10} MMro scheduled a second independent medical examination, this one to be conducted by Dr. Eric Schaub. However, there is no indication in the record that the exam ever occurred, or if it did, that the results were considered in subsequent reviews of the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">{\u00b6 11} On November 27, 2012, Dr. Elena Antonelli issued a report, which included a review of the supplemental information from Dr. Steiman. Dr. Antonelli concluded that Woodman\u2019s subjective complaints \u201cdo appear to correlate with the objective clinical findings in the medical documentation,\u201d but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Woodman was not disabled from performing her occupation. In support of her conclusion, she offered two rationales:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">There is no evidence that the claimant has significantly worsened since she was last able to do her job and she was terminated from her job due to termination of the job itself and not due to disability. There is no evidence that she is unable to be accommodated sufficiently to be able to do her job as she has done in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Dr. Deitch submitted a second report, again recommending that OPERS deny the claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 12} The board officially rejected Woodman\u2019s appeal and again found that she was not permanently disabled, by letter dated December 20, 2012. Woodman then filed suit for a writ of mandamus in the Tenth District Court of Appeals. The magistrate recommended denial of the writ, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">Although there is some evidence in the record which would indicate that [Woodman\u2019s] disabling condition continues to slowly worsen, the magistrate finds that [the board] did not abuse its discretion when it determined that [Woodman] had not demonstrated that her disabling condition was preventing her from being able to perform her job duties as a part-time receptionist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">However, the court of appeals did not follow the magistrate\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">{\u00b6 13} Instead, a majority of the court noted that Woodman had complained of worsening hearing that made it impossible to hear what students and coworkers were saying and that Dr. Steiman had confirmed that Woodman had trouble hearing if there was other noise in the room, including other people talking. The majority opinion criticized Dr. Shadel for evaluating Woodman\u2019s hearing in an examination room only, not in a room where background noise was present.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-11\">Woodman had informed OPERS and the [independent-medical-exam] doctors who examined her at OPERS\u2019s request that she had major trouble hearing in her environment at the OSU Department of English. None of the [independent-medical-exam doctors] tested her in anything approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>mating a normal work environment with background noise. The doctors who evaluated her with a view to such a work environment all concluded that she could not do her work any more [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">Based upon this hole in the medical evidence, the decision by OPERS was arbitrary and unreasonable. There was simply no evidence to support a finding that her hearing allowed her to return to work as a receptionist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The court therefore granted the writ and ordered the board to award benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 14} Judge Sadler dissented, asserting that the court could not raise an issue regarding the testing environment sua sponte, when the parties had never challenged the adequacy of Dr. Shadel\u2019s testing. The board timely appealed. Woodman has submitted an unopposed request for oral argument. We hold that the parties\u2019 briefs are sufficient to resolve the appeal, and therefore, we deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\n<em>Legal analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">{\u00b6 15} In its first proposition of law, the board contends that it did not abuse its discretion in denying benefits, because the record contains \u201csome evidence\u201d to support its conclusion, namely, Dr. Shadel\u2019s opinion that Woodman \u201cdemonstrated adequate hearing in the examination room to allow her to perform the necessary job functions of office assistant.\u201d By rejecting Dr. Shadel\u2019s testing as inadequate, the board contends, the court of appeals abused its discretion and overstepped its bounds by independently reviewing the weight and credibility of the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">{\u00b6 16} Mandamus is an appropriate remedy when no statutory right of appeal is available to correct an abuse of discretion by an administrative body. <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 14. Because there is no right to appeal an adverse decision regarding disability-retirement benefits, mandamus is an appropriate remedy. <em>State ex rel. Cydrus v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>127 Ohio St.3d 257, 2010-Ohio-5770, 938 N.E.2d 1028, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">{\u00b6 17} An abuse of discretion occurs when an administrative body issues a decision that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>State ex rel. Shisler v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 148, 2009-Ohio-2522, 909 N.E.2d 610, \u00b6 11. The board abuses its discretion \u2014 and a clear right to mandamus exists \u2014 if it enters an order that is not supported by some evidence. <em>State ex rel. Nese v. State Teachers Retirement Bd. of Ohio, </em>136 Ohio St.3d 103, 2013-Ohio-1777, 991 N.E.2d 218, \u00b6 26; <em>State ex rel. Schaengold v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 147, 2007-Ohio-3760, 870 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 19. Only if the board\u2019s decision is not supported by <em>any </em>evidence will mandamus lie. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>ex rel. Riddell v. State Teachers Retirement Bd., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-660, 2014-Ohio-1646, 2014 WL 1515449, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 18} The board is solely responsible for assessing evidentiary weight and credibility, and a reviewing court should not independently reweigh the medical evidence. <em>State ex rel. Hart v. Indus. Comm., </em>66 Ohio St.3d 95, 96-97, 609 N.E.2d 166 (1993); <em>State ex rel. Guthrie v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 10AP-689, 2011-Ohio-6557, 2011 WL 6584052, \u00b6 13. But that is precisely what the court of appeals did: the majority held that Dr. Shadel\u2019s medical opinion was unworthy of consideration because (in the court\u2019s view) his testing protocol was inadequate and less valid than the testing performed by the doctors supporting Woodman\u2019s application. But a board does not abuse its discretion by accepting the opinion of its reviewing physician over that of the claimant\u2019s treating physician. <em>Cydrus, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 19} Woodman argues that Dr. Shadel\u2019s report cannot constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the decision because the report is internally inconsistent. A report that is internally inconsistent cannot be \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting an agency\u2019s decision. <em>State ex rel. Wyrick v. Indus. Comm., </em>138 Ohio St.3d 465, 2014-Ohio-541, 8 N.E.3d 878, \u00b6 14. In his report, Dr. Shadel noted Woodman\u2019s facial paresis and right-eye impairments. But according to Woodman, Dr. Shadel then \u201cconcluded that poor hearing and poor vision were not reflected by objective findings,\u201d thereby contradicting his own clinical findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 20} Woodman\u2019s argument is based on a misinterpretation of a poorly written sentence in the report: \u201cSubjective complaints are primarily of poor hearing hemiplegia and poor vision are not reflected by objective findings of disabling hearing or vision dysfunction or by objective findings of extremity functioning that does not appear to be significant to a level of causing any disability.\u201d The key word in that sentence is \u201cdisabling.\u201d Dr. Shadel is not denying the existence of her problems, only their severity.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 21} <em>Wyrick, </em>which Woodman cites in support of her argument, is distinguishable. In <em>Wyrick, </em>the examining physician found that the claimant was able to use his hand, wrist, and forearm only if his elbow remained at waist level, and yet somehow concluded that the claimant retained \u201csignificant remaining function of his left upper extremity.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 14. Those two statements are in complete contradiction, unlike the statements in Dr. Shadel\u2019s report.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">{\u00b6 22} The fact that Woodman produced medical evidence to contradict Dr. Shadel\u2019s opinion is immaterial. <em>State ex rel. Am. Std., Inc. v. Boehler, </em>99 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>St.3d 39, 2003-Ohio-2457, 788 N.E.2d 1053, \u00b6 29. And in fact, it is not even clear that Woodman produced contradictory evidence. As noted above, Dr. Steiman never identified the disabling condition. Moreover, as noted in Dr. Antonelli\u2019s report, Woodman\u2019s employment ended for nonperformance reasons and there is no evidence that she was unable to perform her duties at the time her position was eliminated or that her condition had worsened since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b6 23} The board\u2019s appeal presents two additional propositions of law. In proposition No. 2, the board challenges the authority of the appellate court to raise the issue of the hearing-test protocol sua sponte. And in proposition No. 3, the board argues that even if there were legitimate questions concerning the testing of Woodman\u2019s hearing, the proper remedy was to remand for further proceedings, not to issue a writ compelling the board to pay benefits. Given our disposition of the first proposition of law, it is unnecessary to address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b624} For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b457-10\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-12\">. In its brief to the Tenth District, the board represented that Dr. Andrew Smith also reviewed the file and recommended rejection of the claim. The magistrate\u2019s report also refers to Dr. Smith. However, the record contains no medical records or reports from Dr. Smith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-10\">. Woodman also takes issue with Dr. Shadel\u2019s observation that her speech was \u201cnormal and clear,\u201d alleging that he \u201ccompletely ignorfed] her slurred speech.\u201d But here again, Woodman is attacking the quality of the examination, not identifying disqualifying internal contradictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b457-11\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Asx\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">{\u00b6 25} One paragraph from the majority opinion virtually answers the issue before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">Dr. Steiman opined that Woodman was unable to perform the functions of an office assistant. However, his report did not indicate whether Woodman\u2019s disabling condition was her hearing loss, her vision loss, her paralysis, her memory problems, or some combination of these and other conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">Majority opinion at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">{\u00b6 26} There might be other conditions? Isn\u2019t this sad laundry list of known impairments enough to warrant a declaration that Raeanne Woodman is disabled? Apparently not, because there is \u201csome evidence\u201d that Woodman might not be disabled. That that evidence is flawed because it is based on a test of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Woodman\u2019s hearing that was performed under ideal circumstances, not the circumstances attendant to fulfilling her job, is immaterial to the board and the majority. This is not a malingering malcontent. This is a profoundly disabled person who has established that she is no longer capable of performing her job.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A4r\">Daniel H. Klos, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aia\">Michael DeWine, Ohio Attorney General, and Matthew T. Green, Senior Assistant Attorney General, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 27} Instead of siphoning money that it collects to pay pension and disability benefits into a fund to pay health-care costs for people who retire before they are eligible for Medicare, the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System should attend to people, like Woodman, who are disabled. I would affirm the just decision of the court of appeals. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
