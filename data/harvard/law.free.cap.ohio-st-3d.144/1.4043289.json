Power Co. &amp; Ohio Power Co. for Approval of a Mechanism to Recover Deferred Fuel Costs Ordered Under R.C. 4928. 144, </em>Pub. Util. Comm.

In the order approving Ohio Power\u2019s first ESP, the commission (1) authorized the recovery of \u201ccarrying charges\u201d \u2014 a type of finance charge \u2014 on the deferred fuel costs until the costs were fully recovered, (2) set the rate to calculate carrying charges on the deferred fuel costs, and (3) authorized Ohio Power to recover the deferred fuel costs plus carrying charges from 2012 to 2018. <em>See In re Application of Columbus S. Power Co. &amp; Ohio Power Co. for Approval of an Elec. Sec. Plan, </em>Pub. Util. Comm.

This reduced Ohio Power\u2019s recovery of carrying charges by over $130 million. PIRR Order at 17-19; April 3, 2012 Revised Staff Comments and Recommendations (\u201cRevised Staff Report\u201d) at 5-6, available at http://dis.puc.state.oh.us/DocumentRecord.aspxTDoc ID=9203c7aa-348b-4d94-a961-efd24a568bb4 (last accessed Mar. 25, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">{\u00b6 3} On appeal, Ohio Power challenges the commission\u2019s decision to reduce its carrying-charge recovery. Ohio Power\u2019s appeal raises one argument that has merit: the commission\u2019s order violates R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a) by depriving the company of its right to withdraw the modified ESP. Therefore, we reverse the commission\u2019s order insofar as it reduces the carrying-charge rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">{\u00b6 4} Appellee and cross-appellant, Industrial Energy Users-Ohio (\u201cIEU\u201d), filed a cross-appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> raising one issue for our consideration: the commission erred when it refused to reduce the PIRR to account for Ohio Power\u2019s accumulated deferred income taxes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that IEU\u2019s cross-appeal is barred by collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">II. Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"AJN\">{\u00b6 5} On March 18, 2009, the commission issued an opinion and order approving Ohio Power\u2019s first ESP, to be in effect from 2009 to 2011. The ESP Order established caps on how much Ohio Power could increase rates during each year of the plan in order to ensure rate stability and to mitigate the effect of rate increases on customers. ESP Order at 22. It did so under R.C. 4928.144, which authorizes \u201cany just and reasonable phase-in of any electric distribution utility rate * * * as the commission considers necessary to ensure rate or price stability for consumers.\u201d To ensure that Ohio Power stayed under the rate caps, the commission directed it to phase in the rate increases approved in the ESP by deferring for future collection the portion of the fuel costs that exceeded the rate caps.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 4928.144 also authorized the commission to allow Ohio Power to recover carrying charges on the fuel costs earned but not collected in each year of the ESP. In its ESP application, Ohio Power proposed that carrying charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>be calculated using the company\u2019s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\u201cWACC\u201d). IEU did not object to using the WACC for the calculation during the ESP proceedings, but other parties did. Despite the objections, the commission accepted Ohio Power\u2019s proposal and set the carrying-charge rate at the WACC. ESP Order at 20-21, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">{\u00b6 7} As required by R.C. 4928.144, the ESP Order also provided that the deferred fuel costs would be collected through an unavoidable surcharge, meaning a charge imposed on both shopping and nonshopping customers. And the commission established a recovery period of 2012 through 2018 for Ohio Power to recover the deferred fuel costs and carrying charges by increasing its rates. ESP Order at 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">{\u00b6 8} Various parties appealed from the ESP Order. Yet no party challenged the commission\u2019s decision to calculate carrying charges using the WACC. <em>In re Application of Columbus S. Power Co., </em>128 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-1788, 947 N.E.2d 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">{\u00b6 9} This case began when Ohio Power filed an application with the commission to approve a mechanism to recover the accumulated deferred fuel costs from the first ESP period and the carrying charges. As noted earlier, consistent with the ESP Order, Ohio Power sought to implement a mechanism in the form of a nonbypassable PIRR to be in effect from January 2012 through December 2018. PIRR Order at 2; Application for Approval of Recovery Mechanism (Sept. 1, 2011) at \u00b6 3-4, available at http://dis.puc.state.oh.us/DocumentRecord.aspx7Doc ID=fd450fd8-c987-4dlb-b56e-3efddb0cl4dl (last accessed Mar. 25, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">{\u00b6 10} The commission approved, in part, Ohio Power\u2019s PIRR application. The commission, however, deemed it necessary to modify the part of the ESP Order that established the WACC as the carrying-charge rate. Specifically, the commission determined that the WACC rate would apply only during the ESP period (2009 to 2011). But once Ohio Power began to recover deferred fuel costs from customers in 2012, the commission ordered, the company was to calculate carrying charges at the company\u2019s long-term-cost-of-debt rate. PIRR Order at 17-19. The commission\u2019s decision to apply the long-term-cost-of-debt rate of 5.34 percent, which was less than half the commission-approved WACC rate of 11.15 percent, reduced Ohio Power\u2019s recovery of carrying charges during the recovery period by over $130 million. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 17; Revised Staff Report at 4-6. The commission also rejected IEU\u2019s request to reduce the deferred-fuel-cost balance to account for savings to Ohio Power from accumulated deferred income taxes (\u201cADIT\u201d) during the ESP period. PIRR Order at 19-20, 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">{\u00b6 11} Ohio Power and IEU filed timely applications for rehearing at the commission. Each was denied. Fifth Entry on Rehearing (Oct. 3, 2012), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>available at http://dis.puc.state.oh.us/DocumentRecord.aspx?DocID=bl00f2d4-6 cc5-421c-ae9d-9075cc786a45 (last accessed Mar. 25, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">{\u00b6 12} Ohio Power then filed a notice of appeal, challenging the commission\u2019s modification of the carrying-charge rate. IEU filed a notice of cross-appeal, arguing that the commission erred when it refused to reduce the deferred-fuel-cost balance to account for ADIT. As will be discussed in detail below, Ohio Power has demonstrated one instance of reversible error in the commission\u2019s order. The issue raised by IEU\u2019s cross-appeal, however, is barred by collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">III. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cR.C.\" 4903.13 provides that a PUCO order shall be reversed, vacated, or modified by this court only when, upon consideration of the record, the court finds the order to be unlawful or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, \u00b6 50. We will not reverse or modify a PUCO decision as to questions of fact when the record contains sufficient probative evidence to show that the commission\u2019s decision was not manifestly against the weight of the evidence and was not so clearly unsupported by the record as to show misapprehension, mistake, or willful disregard of duty. <em>Monongahela Power Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 571, 2004-Ohio-6896, 820 N.E.2d 921, \u00b6 29. The appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the commission\u2019s decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence or is clearly unsupported by the record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">{\u00b6 14} Although this court has \u201ccomplete and independent power of review as to all questions of law\u201d in appeals from the PUCO, <em>Ohio Edison Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>78 Ohio St.3d 466, 469, 678 N.E.2d 922 (1997), we may rely on the expertise of a state agency in interpreting a law where \u201chighly specialized issues\u201d are involved and \u201cwhere agency expertise would, therefore, be of assistance in discerning the presumed intent of our General Assembly,\u201d <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>58 Ohio St.2d 108, 110, 388 N.E.2d 1370 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">A. Ohio Power\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">{\u00b6 15} Ohio Power\u2019s appeal challenges the commission\u2019s authority to modify the ESP Order issued in 2009. According to Ohio Power, the commission has only limited authority to modify its prior orders and was prohibited from changing the carrying-charge rate established in the ESP Order in this case. Ohio Power attacks the commission\u2019s order on five grounds, but only two were properly preserved by being set forth in the notice of appeal: (1) res judicata barred the commission from modifying the ESP Order in this case and (2) the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>modified the ESP Order after the plan had expired, depriving the company of its right to withdraw a modified ESP in violation of R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a). We hold that Ohio Power\u2019s res judicata argument lacks merit, but we agree with its argument that the commission\u2019s order violates R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">1. The commission is entitled to modify a prior order, provided that it explains the change and the new regulatory course is permissible</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">{\u00b6 16} We have instructed the commission to \u201crespect its own precedents in its decisions to assure the predictability which is essential in all areas of the law, including administrative law.\u201d <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>42 Ohio St.2d 403, 431, 330 N.E.2d 1 (1975), <em>superseded on other grounds by statute as recognized in Babbit v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>59 Ohio St.2d 81, 89, 391 N.E.2d 1376 (1979). This does not mean, however, that the commission may never revisit a particular decision, only that if the commission does change course, it must explain why. <em>In re Application of Columbus S. Power Co., </em>128 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-1788, 947 N.E.2d 655, \u00b6 52, citing, e.g., <em>Util. Serv. Partners, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 284, 2009-Ohio-6764, 921 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 18. \u201cWhen the commission has made a lawful order, it is bound by certain institutional constraints to justify that change before such order may be changed or modified.\u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>10 Ohio St.3d 49, 50-51, 461 N.E.2d 303 (1984). The court has not set the explanatory hurdle very high. In a case in which the commission did not follow its earlier precedent, we said that if the commission had put \u201c[a] few simple sentences\u201d in its order to explain why the earlier case was no longer controlling, it would have been sufficient. <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>16 Ohio St.3d 21, 21-22, 475 N.E.2d 786 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">{\u00b6 17} The commission\u2019s modification power, however, is not without limits. \u201cModifying a regulatory scheme is not problematic in itself. Agencies undoubtedly may change course, provided that the new regulatory course is permissible.\u201d <em>Util. Serv. Partners, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 284, 2009-Ohio-6764, 921 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 18. And if the commission does see fit to depart from a prior order, the commission \u201cmust explain why,\u201d and \u201cthe new course also must be substantively reasonable and lawful.\u201d <em>In re Application of Columbus S. Power Co., </em>128 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-1788, 947 N.E.2d 655, \u00b6 52. <em>See also Fed. Communications Comm. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., </em>556 U.S. 502, 515, 129 S.Ct. 1800, 173 L.Ed.2d 738 (2009) (an agency \u201cneed not demonstrate to a court\u2019s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately indicates\u201d [emphasis deleted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>{\u00b6 18} In this case, the commission explained why it needed to modify the ESP Order. The issue, then, is whether the commission\u2019s new course is lawful and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">2. Ohio Power has not shown that the doctrine of res judicata applies here to bar the commission from modifying the ESP Order</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">{\u00b6 19} Ohio Power\u2019s first argument is that res judicata principles apply here to bar the commission from modifying the carrying-charge rate set in the ESP Order. Ohio Power, however, has failed to explain why res judicata applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">{\u00b6 20} In Ohio, the doctrine of res judicata includes both claim preclusion (historically known as estoppel by judgment) and issue preclusion (traditionally known as collateral estoppel). <em>See O\u2019Nesti v. DeBartolo Realty Corp., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 59, 2007-Ohio-1102, 862 N.E.2d 803, \u00b6 6, citing <em>Grava v. Parkman Twp., </em>73 Ohio St.3d 379, 381, 653 N.E.2d 226 (1995). \u201cThese doctrines operate to preclude the relitigation of a point of law or fact that was at issue in a former action between the same parties and was passed upon by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>16 Ohio St.3d 9, 10, 475 N.E.2d 782 (1985). Res judicata, whether claim preclusion or issue preclusion, applies to administrative proceedings that are of a judicial nature. <em>State ex rel. Schachter v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 526, 2009-Ohio-1704, 905 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 29; <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">{\u00b6 21} Ohio Power presents a single theory of legal error: res judicata principles apply here to divest the commission of \u201cjurisdiction to change or modify an adjudicatory determination made in a prior final order, especially one appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to Ohio Power, the commission was estopped from modifying the carrying-charge rate in this case because it lost jurisdiction over the matter once it was finally adjudicated in the ESP case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">{\u00b6 22} This claim need not detain us long. Res judicata is an affirmative defense. While raising the defense may preclude the commission from reconsidering an issue decided in an earlier order, it does not divest the commission of jurisdiction over the second proceeding. <em>State ex rel. Wilson-Simmons v. Lake Cty. Sheriff\u2019s Dept., </em>82 Ohio St.3d 37, 40, 693 N.E.2d 789 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>{\u00b6 23} Ohio Power\u2019s reliance on <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>42 Ohio St.2d 403, 330 N.E.2d 1 (1975), and <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel, </em>16 Ohio St.3d 9, 475 N.E.2d 782, in this context is equally misplaced. <em>Cleveland Elec, </em>did not involve res judicata or collateral estoppel. And while we held that res judicata/collateral estoppel did apply in <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel, </em>we did not hold in that case that the commission lacked jurisdiction over the matters under review. <em>See id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">3. The commission\u2019s order deprived Ohio Power of its right to withdraw its ESP application in violation of R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">{\u00b6 24} Ohio Power argues that the commission\u2019s orders in this case deprived it of its right under R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a) to withdraw its application for approval of the ESP after the commission decided to approve only a modified version of the ESP. When considering an ESP application, R.C. 4928.143(C)(1) requires the commission to do one of three things: (1) approve, (2) modify and approve, or (3) disapprove the application. Under R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a), if the commission issues an order that modifies and approves an application, the utility \u201cmay withdraw the application, thereby terminating it, and may file a new standard service offer.\u201d Ohio Power asserts that the commission deprived the company of the statutory right to withdraw the modified ESP, because the plan was modified well after it had expired. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">{\u00b6 25} In the ESP Order, the commission determined that carrying charges on the deferred fuel costs would be calculated using Ohio Power\u2019s WACC rate during the period when the fuel costs were deferred (2009 through 2011) and also during the period when Ohio Power would recover the deferred fuel costs (2012 through 2018). ESP Order at 20-21, 23. In this case, the commission found it necessary to depart from the WACC rate that had been approved in the ESP Order. The commission determined that the WACC rate would still apply during the deferral period, consistent with the ESP Order. But once the recovery period began in 2012, the commission determined, Ohio Power should no longer use the WACC, but instead should calculate carrying charges at its long-term-cost-of-debt rate until the costs were fully recovered. PIRR Order at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">{\u00b6 26} Despite arguments to the contrary, the commission\u2019s PIRR Order modified a previously approved term of Ohio Power\u2019s first ESP, and thereby reduced the company\u2019s recovery of carrying charges by approximately $130 million. If the commission makes a modification to a proposed ESP that the utility is unwilling to accept, R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a) allows the utility to withdraw the ESP application. The modification made below, however, occurred after the ESP had expired, making it impossible for Ohio Power to exercise its statutory right to withdraw the modified ESP. Therefore, we find that the commission\u2019s order violates R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>a. The commission\u2019s reading of R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a) is unreasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">{\u00b6 27} The commission found that the statutory right to withdraw was not implicated in this case, because R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a) \u201cspecifically pertains to the Commission\u2019s approval and modification of an <em>application </em>for an ESP.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Fifth Entry on Rehearing at 15. Because this case does not involve approval of an ESP application, the commission determined that the statutory withdrawal provision \u201cha[d] no bearing on the outcome.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">{\u00b6 28} We generally defer to the commission\u2019s statutory interpretation, but only if it is reasonable. <em>See In re Application of Columbus S. Power Co., 134 </em>Ohio St.3d 392, 2012-Ohio-5690, 983 N.E.2d 276, \u00b638. R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a) provides that \u201c[i]f the commission modifies and approves an application under division (C)(1) of this section, the electric distribution utility may withdraw the application * * *.\u201d The commission determined that the withdrawal provision applies only when the commission modifies and approves an ESP <em>application </em>within the context of an ESP proceeding, but does not apply to later proceedings in which the commission modifies an <em>order </em>that had previously approved an ESP application. We find the commission\u2019s interpretation unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">{\u00b6 29} What the commission overlooks is that when it modified the ESP Order in this case, it effectively modified the <em>application </em>that was approved by that order. R.C. 4928.143(C)(1) requires the commission to issue an <em>order </em>when it modifies and approves an ESP application, which the commission did in the first ESP proceeding. The commission\u2019s ESP Order approved the use of the WACC rate during the collection period, as proposed by Ohio Power in its ESP application. Thus, when the commission modified the ESP Order in this case to prohibit the continued use of the WACC rate, it modified a term that was proposed in the company\u2019s ESP application. And because the modification of that term occurred after the ESP had expired, Ohio Power was unable to withdraw its ESP.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">{\u00b6 30} The commission\u2019s interpretation nullifies the clear purpose of R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a), namely, to allow a utility to withdraw its proposed ESP if it dislikes the commission\u2019s modifications. But broader problems exist with the commission\u2019s reading. As read by the commission, R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a) applies only when the commission is deciding the fate of the ESP application. On this reading, the commission could modify an ESP at any time after the application has been approved \u2014 even while the ESP is still in effect \u2014 and the utility would have no recourse but to implement the change. This would hardly be a \u201cjust and reasonable result.\u201d R.C. 1.47(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">b. The commission\u2019s \u201congoing supervision and jurisdiction\u201d does not allow it to violate other statutory provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">{\u00b6 31} The commission also found that its \u201congoing supervision and jurisdiction\u201d over the rate phase-in allowed it to modify the ESP Order.

The commission also has broad discretion under R.C. 4928.144 to authorize utilities to phase in rates. <em>See In re Application of Columbus S. Power Co., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 568, 2011-Ohio-4129, 954 N.E.2d 1183, \u00b6 10-11; <em>In re Application of Ohio Power Co., </em>140 Ohio St.3d 509, 2014-Ohio-4271, 20 N.E.3d 699, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">{\u00b6 32} This authority, however, is not unlimited; the new regulatory course must also be permissible under the statutory scheme. <em>See In re Application of Columbus S.

Fundamentally, \u201c[t]he PUCO, as a creature of statute, has no authority to act beyond its statutory powers.\u201d <em>Discount Cellular, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 360, 2007-Ohio-53, 859 N.E.2d 957, \u00b6 51. So whatever authority the commission has to modify the structure of the phase-in must be exercised in compliance with other relevant statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">c. The commission\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Columbus S. Power Co., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 568, 2011-Ohio-4129, 954 N.E.2d 1183, is misplaced</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">{\u00b6 33} On rehearing, the commission cited <em>In re Columbus S. Power Co., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 568, 2011-Ohio-4129, 954 N.E.2d 1183, as authority for modifying the ESP Order. Fifth Entry on Rehearing at 14. In the order under review in that case, the commission had exempted a charge \u2014 known as the economic-development rider \u2014 from the rate caps established in the earlier ESP order. On appeal, we upheld the commission\u2019s decision to modify the ESP order to exempt the rider from the rate caps, reasoning that the commission has (1) broad discretion to phase in rates under R.C. 4928.144 and (2) inherent authority to revisit and modify prior rate orders. <em>In re Columbus S. Power Co. </em>at \u00b6 7-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">{\u00b6 34} While we agree with the commission that similarities exist between the economic-development-rider case and this one, we nevertheless find this case distinguishable for two reasons. First, the statutory right to withdraw a modified ESP in R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a) was not at issue in the economic-development-rider case. Second, we stated in the economic-development-rider case that the commission has discretion to revisit earlier regulatory orders and modify them prospectively, provided the new regulatory course is permissible. <em>In re Columbus S. Power Co. </em>at \u00b6 8. Indeed, we upheld the commission\u2019s order in that case because IEU \u2014 the appellant in that case \u2014 failed to demonstrate that the decision to modify the ESP order was unlawful or unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, Ohio Power has shown here that the commission\u2019s modification was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>4. Ohio Power has forfeited its remaining propositions of law</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">{\u00b6 35} Ohio Power offers three other propositions of law: (1) the commission may not reverse factual findings made in a prior order, (2) the precedent and rationale relied on by the commission do not justify changing the ESP Order, and (3) the commission failed to consider the financial decisions made by Ohio Power in reliance on the ESP Order. Ohio Power has forfeited the ability to challenge these alleged errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">{\u00b6 36} R.C. 4903.13 establishes that the procedure for seeking reversal of a commission order is through a notice of appeal \u201csetting forth the order appealed from and the errors complained of.\u201d Ohio Power listed two assignments of error in its notice of appeal: (1) the commission\u2019s modification of the ESP Order was barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel and (2) the commission deprived the company of its right to withdraw the ESP under R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a). We therefore lack jurisdiction to consider Ohio Power\u2019s remaining arguments. <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>103 Ohio St.3d 398, 2004-Ohio-5466, 816 N.E.2d 238, \u00b6 21; <em>In re Complaint of Smith v. Ohio Edison Co., </em>137 Ohio St.3d 7, 2013-Ohio-4070, 996 N.E.2d 927, \u00b6 25-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">B. IEU\u2019s Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">{\u00b6 37} IEU argues on cross-appeal that the commission erred when it failed to require Ohio Power to account for accumulated deferred income taxes (\u201cADIT\u201d) when calculating the carrying charges. This argument is barred, but understanding the argument requires a brief explanation of ADIT.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">1. Background on ADIT</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">{\u00b6 38} According to the Revised Staff Report, ADIT results when a fuel expense is incurred in a different period from the period in which a company collects revenue to pay the expense. If the revenue and expense occur in the same period, there is no tax impact, as the components will be treated the same for financial-reporting and tax-reporting purposes. But where, as here, costs are incurred during one period and collected from ratepayers during another, federal tax laws allow the utility to deduct the fuel expense for income-tax purposes when it is incurred. The result here was that Ohio Power was able to lessen its income-tax burden during the deferral period. For purposes of regulatory accounting, a utility records the deferred fuel costs as an expense for future recovery. Thus, when the deferred fuel costs are recovered in rates, the company\u2019s taxable income will increase and taxes then become due. That is, ADIT represents taxes that are payable in the future. Until then, the company reports ADIT in a separate account on its books. Revised Staff Report at 7-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>2. IEU\u2019s accumulated deferred-income-tax argument is barred by collateral estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">{\u00b6 39} IEU argues that ADIT reflects a temporary tax savings to the company and is a source of funds that the company can use until the taxes become payable. According to IEU, the ADIT is a source of cost-free capital that is funded by ratepayers and not investors and, thus, Ohio Power should be required to reduce the deferred-fuel-costs balance to reflect that capital and thereby reduce the carrying charges. The commission found that no ADIT adjustment was required for the purpose of calculating carrying charges. PIRR Order at 19; Fifth Entry on Rehearing at 7-8. On appeal, IEU argues that the commission\u2019s failure to adjust deferral balances for ADIT violated generally accepted accounting principles, state policy, sound regulatory practices and principles, and precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">{\u00b6 40} We hold that IEU\u2019s argument is barred by collateral estoppel. The doctrine of collateral estoppel serves to prevent the relitigation in a second action of an issue that was litigated and decided in a prior action involving the same parties. Issue preclusion applies even if the causes of action differ. <em>O\u2019Nesti v. DeBartolo, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 59, 2007-Ohio-1102, 862 N.E.2d 803, at \u00b6 7, citing <em>Fort Frye Teachers Assn., OEA/NEA v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>81 Ohio St.3d 392, 395, 692 N.E.2d 140 (1998). <em>See also Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>16 Ohio St.3d at 10, 475 N.E.2d 782 (applying collateral estoppel to bar litigation of an issue in a second commission proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">{\u00b6 41} The requisite identity of parties and issue exists here. This exact issue was litigated in Ohio Power\u2019s first ESP case, and the commission found that R.C. 4928.144 barred using ADIT to reduce the deferred-fuel-costs balance. ESP Order at 21-24. IEU was a party to the ESP proceedings, and it also raised challenges to the ESP Order on appeal. Yet IEU never raised any objection to the commission\u2019s ADIT ruling at the commission or on appeal to this court. <em>See In re Application of Columbus S. Power, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-1788, 947 N.E.2d 655. And though there are exceptions to applying collateral estoppel to administrative proceedings, IEU offers no compelling reason why the doctrine should not be applied to this matter. <em>See Jacobs v. Teledyne, Inc., </em>39 Ohio St.3d 168, 171, 529 N.E.2d 1255 (1988) (lead opinion); <em>Set Prods., Inc. v. Bainbridge Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 260, 263, 510 N.E.2d 373 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">{\u00b6 42} Therefore, we hold that IEU lost its opportunity to challenge the commission\u2019s ADIT determination when it failed to object to that ruling in the first ESP case. <em>See Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>at 10. Based on our determination, we do not decide whether the commission properly refused to adjust the deferred-fuel-costs balance to account for ADIT.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Y. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">{\u00b6 43} Ohio Power has shown that the commission violated R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a) when it modified the terms of its previously approved ESP. Therefore, we reverse the commission\u2019s orders on this issue and remand the cause to the commission for reinstatement of the WACC rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">{\u00b644} As to the cross-appeal, we hold that collateral estoppel bars IEU\u2019s challenge to the commission\u2019s refusal to adjust the deferred-fuel-costs balance to account for ADIT. Therefore, the cross-appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Orders affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b96-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b96-9\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-10\">.

Ohio Power abandons its jurisdiction theory on rebuttal in favor of a new legal theory: collateral estoppel must be applied to commission proceedings \u2014 without exception \u2014 whenever the commission seeks to reconsider a finding of fact made in a prior order.

But at its core, the modification does not affect Ohio Power Company\u2019s electric-security plan (\u201cESP\u201d) in any way. The ESP has expired and cannot be changed. The commission merely, after considering all the factors, determined that the rate of return that American Electric Power (\u201cAEP\u201d), the owner of Ohio Power, .stands to receive during the recovery period is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">{\u00b6 46} When the commission approved the ESP, the economy was at its nadir and the commission was dealing with an economic environment riddled with uncertainty. Based on what it knew then, it determined that an 11.15 percent rate of return, AEP\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, was reasonable. Several years later, after seeing the economy recover somewhat, but also seeing interest rates remain mired near zero, the commission has determined that that rate of return is excessive. It is, of course, correct in that assessment. At this time, it considers a rate of return of 5.34 percent, which corresponds with AEP\u2019s historic cost-of-debt rate, to be reasonable. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">{\u00b6 47} The commission is not changing the ESP; nothing in its order affects the rate of return that AEP has hitherto received. Instead, the commission has concluded that the rate of return should be adjusted going forward. AEP would not be harmed in any way by a change in the rate of return. It would continue to receive an excellent rate of return during the recovery period, even at the \u201cmere\u201d 5.34 percent ordered by the commission. (It is unlikely that many members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the public that AEP serves would be unhappy receiving a guaranteed rate of return of 5.34 percent.) Of course, a majority of this court has determined that AEP is entitled to the grossly excessive 11.15 percent, which is absurdly high given the current interest-rate environment.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ABt\">Matthew J.
