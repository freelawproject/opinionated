The parties entered into stipulations of fact, agreed that Biviano failed to promptly refund the unearned portion of his retainer in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.16(e), agreed that the remaining alleged violations should be dismissed, and jointly recommended that Biviano be publicly reprimanded for his misconduct. Based on the parties\u2019 stipulations and Biviano\u2019s testimony, the panel made findings of fact, found that Biviano\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.16(e), dismissed four other alleged rule violations, and recommended that Biviano be publicly reprimand for his misconduct. The board adopted the panel report in its entirety. We adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct and agree that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">{\u00b6 3} Jamie Smith retained Biviano to represent her in a child-custody matter in September 2010. On January 10, 2012, Biviano sent Smith a letter stating that he understood that she had reconciled with the child\u2019s father and requesting documentation from her so that he could close her file. Smith responded to Biviano\u2019s correspondence in a January 20, 2012 e-mail and requested that he close her file and return the unearned portion of her retainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">{\u00b6 4} On March 22, 2012, Smith again requested that Biviano close her file. He responded that day, advising her that he would close her file and that she would be contacted. Having heard nothing further from Biviano, Smith e-mailed him on July 24 and August 20, but she did not receive a response to either e-mail. Consequently, she filed a grievance with relator on September 24, 2012. Biviano provided an itemized account of his billing in the matter and returned the unearned portion of Smith\u2019s retainer on October 5, 2012.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Flevares Law Firm, L.L.C., and William M.

Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. We also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Gov.Bar R. V(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 7} Here the parties stipulated and the board found that the relevant mitigating factors include the absence of a prior disciplinary record, the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, Biviano\u2019s timely good-faith effort to rectify the consequences of his misconduct, his full and free disclosure to the board and his cooperative attitude in the proceedings, and his good character and reputation apart from the charged misconduct. <em>See </em>Gov.Bar R. V(13)(C)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">{\u00b6 8} In support of the recommended sanction of a public reprimand, the board cites <em>Lake Cty. Bar Assn. v. Kubyn, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 321, 2009-Ohio-1154, 903 N.E.2d 1215 (publicly reprimanding an attorney who, on his discharge from employment, failed to take reasonably practicable steps to protect his client\u2019s interests and failed to promptly return any unearned portion of his fee).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">{\u00b6 9} We adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct and agree that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction for Biviano\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">{\u00b6 10} Accordingly, William Richard Biviano is publicly reprimanded for his misconduct. Costs are taxed to Biviano.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-12\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-12\">.
