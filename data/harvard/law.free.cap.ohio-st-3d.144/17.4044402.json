He was 26 years old. His workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed for cervical/lumbar strain, head contusion, disc displacement, and postlaminectomy syndrome. He has not worked since the injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">{\u00b6 4} Lacroix applied for permanent-total-disability compensation in 2006 and 2008. The commission denied both applications on the basis that Lacroix was capable of working and not permanently and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">{\u00b6 5} Lacroix applied again in 2010, with a report from his treating physician, Timothy Morley, D.O. Kiva Shtull, M.D., examined Lacroix on behalf of the employer. He concluded that Lacroix was capable of full-time employment \u201cin the sedentary category, in the seated position, with the following additional restrictions: 1) The ability to change positions as necessary; 2) No foot pedal operation with the lower extremities; 3) No exposure to vibratory forces.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">{\u00b6 6} Mark A. Anderson performed a vocational assessment of Lacroix and concluded that no occupations existed that matched all of his restrictions. Craig Johnston, Ph.D., also performed a vocational assessment. In his report, he identified the medical opinions submitted and concluded that \u201cif one accepts the opinion of Dr. Shtull, then Mr. Lacroix is again capable of sedentary physical activity.\u201d Johnston examined Lacroix\u2019s nonmedical disability factors and concluded that he remained capable of sustained remunerative employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">{\u00b6 7} Following a hearing, a staff hearing officer denied Lacroix\u2019s application. The hearing officer relied on the report of Dr. Shtull as evidence that Lacroix was medically capable of performing sedentary employment. The hearing officer also reviewed all vocational evidence submitted, analyzed Lacroix\u2019s nonmedical disability factors, and determined that he was vocationally capable of returning to work or going into a rehabilitation program.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Lacroix filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus. He argued that the staff hearing officer abused his discretion when he relied on the vocational report of Dr. Johnston because the report was flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">{\u00b6 9} The court of appeals concluded that there was evidence in the record supporting the commission\u2019s decision that Lacroix was medically and vocationally capable of sedentary employment. The court noted that Lacroix did not challenge Dr. Shtull\u2019s medical opinion and that the commission independently evaluated the nonmedical disability factors. Thus, the appellate court concluded, despite any deficiencies in the Johnston report, the record nevertheless contained evidence to support the commission\u2019s denial of benefits. The court denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">{\u00b6 10} Lacroix\u2019s appeal as of right is before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\n<em>Legal Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">{\u00b6 11} Permanent total disability is \u201cthe inability to perform sustained remunerative employment due to the allowed conditions in the claim.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-34(B)(l). It can result from the injured worker\u2019s medical conditions alone or in conjunction with other nonmedical disability or vocational factors. <em>State ex rel. Guthrie v. Indus. </em>Comm., 133 Ohio St.3d 244, 2012-Ohio-4637, 977 N.E.2d 643, \u00b6 8; <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm., </em>31 Ohio St.3d 167, 509 N.E.2d 946 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">{\u00b6 12} To challenge the commission\u2019s order denying permanent-total-disability compensation, Lacroix must demonstrate an abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel. Consolidation Coal Co. v. Indus. Comm., </em>78 Ohio St.3d 176, 177, 677 N.E.2d 338 (1997). So long as there is some evidence in the record that supports the order, the commission does not abuse its discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">{\u00b6 13} Lacroix contends that the Johnston report was flawed because Dr. Johnston did not consider Dr. Shtull\u2019s limitation that Lacroix must remain in a seated position, and Dr. Johnston listed potential jobs, such as security guard and cashier, that seemed impossible for a person who relied on a walker or wheelchair.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">{\u00b6 14} A vocational expert need not list all restrictions when referring to a medical report. <em>State ex rel. Arthur v. Indus. Comm., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 05AP-1018, 2006-Ohio-6776, 2006 WL 3743831, \u00b6 45 (vocational expert is afforded latitude in describing or summarizing a medical opinion). Furthermore, the commission, as the exclusive evaluator of disability, is not required to accept vocational evidence, even if uncontroverted. <em>State ex rel. Jackson v. Indus. Comm., </em>79 Ohio St.3d 266, 270, 680 N.E.2d 1233 (1997). The commission is the expert on vocational evidence and had the discretion to accept or reject all or some of the Johnston report. <em>Id. </em>at 271; <em>see also State ex rel. Culbert v. Indus. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>Comm., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 11AP-172, 2012-Ohio-1217, 2012 WL 986760, \u00b6 3. Lacroix\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">{\u00b6 15} Next, Lacroix contends that the commission abused its discretion by relying on Dr. Shtull\u2019s report because it was contradictory. Lacroix also contends that the commission failed to explain how the additional limitations set forth by Dr. Shtull correspond with the ability to perform work at the sedentary level.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">{\u00b6 16} It is undisputed that Lacroix did not raise these arguments in the appellate court. <em>See </em>2013-Ohio-4881, 2013 WL 5963062, \u00b6 8 and 31. Consequently, they have been waived. <em>State ex rel. Roxbury v. Indus. Comm., </em>138 Ohio St.3d 91, 2014-Ohio-84, 3 N.E.3d 1190, \u00b6 14; <em>State ex rel. Rollins v. Indus. Comm., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 319, 2005-Ohio-1827, 825 N.E.2d 1104, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">{\u00b6 17} Lacroix was not entitled to mandamus relief, because there was evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s denial of permanent-total-disability compensation. Therefore, Lacroix failed to establish that he was entitled to relief in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">{\u00b6 18} Finally, both the claimant and the employer request oral argument. Neither party specifies why oral argument would be beneficial. Oral argument in an appeal as of right is subject to the court\u2019s discretion. S.Ct.Prac.R. 17.02(A). In exercising that discretion, we consider the parties\u2019 briefs to be sufficient to resolve the issue raised. We deny the requests for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">{\u00b6 19} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b104-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Aq-\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b104-12\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ary\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">{\u00b6 20} Lacroix\u2019s injuries are substantial enough that he is confined to a wheelchair, among other limitations. Even so, one of the vocational experts, whose report provides the evidence that the commission relies upon to justify its conclusion, determined that Lacroix is capable of being a security guard. That just isn\u2019t plausible, and reliance on that report is misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">{\u00b6 21} I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b104-15\">O\u2019Neill, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AhS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Nager, Romaine &amp; Schneiberg Co., L.P.A., Jennifer L.
