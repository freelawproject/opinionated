We conclude that a taxpayer\u2019s statement does not bind the tax commissioner and reverse the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee Kent Cunningham filed an \u201cAffidavit of Non-Ohio Domicile\u201d for tax year 2008 in March 2009, using the form prescribed by the tax commissioner. Cunningham filled in his name, social security number, and Cincinnati address. Cunningham declared under penalties of perjury that he \u201cwas not domiciled in Ohio at any time during taxable year 2008\u201d and that he was domiciled in Tennessee. Cunningham did not identify his out-of-state abode. He stated that he would not be filing an Ohio individual income tax return for 2008 and affirmed that he \u201chad fewer than 183 contact periods in Ohio during the taxable year.\u201d Under former R.C. 5747.24(B)(1), a person is presumed not to be domiciled in Ohio if, among other things, he has had no more than 182 \u201ccontact periods\u201d in this state during a taxable year. Sub.H.B. No. 73, 151 Ohio Laws, Part V, 9444, 9463. Cunningham signed and dated the form. Appellee Sue Cunningham (Kent\u2019s wife) did not file such an affidavit for tax year 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">{\u00b6 3} Neither of the Cunninghams filed an Ohio income tax return for 2008. They jointly filed a federal tax return using Form 1040, which listed their Cincinnati address as their home address.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>{\u00b6 4} The tax commissioner issued first a notice, then an assessment, based upon the nonfiling and nonpayment of Ohio income tax. The tax commissioner assessed tax owed ($6,597.75), preassessment interest ($318.85), and a penalty ($2,309.21), for a total assessment of $9,225.81.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">{\u00b6 5} The Cunninghams filed a petition for reassessment. After additional correspondence, the tax commissioner issued his final determination, in which he discussed R.C. 5747.24 and common-law domicile. The commissioner found that \u201cthe petitioners owned residential property in Tennessee for the entire year in question.\u201d The commissioner noted the January 24, 2008 filing of an Ohio homestead-exemption application, with its declarations under penalty of perjury that the Cincinnati house was their principal place of residence and that the Tennessee house was a second or vacation home. The commissioner found that \u201c[t]his document suggests that the petitioners were residents for at least some portion of 2008 and that the petitioners did not intend to abandon their Ohio domicile.\u201d The commissioner considered the Tennessee utility bills submitted by the Cunninghams, but noted that they were sent to the Cincinnati address. This fact was found to be further evidence that the Cunninghams did not intend to remain in Tennessee or abandon their Ohio abode.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">{\u00b6 6} Thereafter, the commissioner considered the Affidavit of Non-Ohio Domicile, which was filed after the homestead-exemption application, and found that \u201c[t]his sworn statement contradicts the petitioners\u2019 prior sworn statement that they occupied, as their principal place of residence, their home in Cincinnati, and that the Tennessee home was either a second home or a vacation home.\u201d Because of \u201ccontradictory statements made by the petitioners, the Tax Commissioner necessarily concludes that the petitioners\u2019 Affidavit of Non-Ohio Domicile contains a false statement as described in R.C. 5747.24(B)(1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">{\u00b6 7} The commissioner\u2019s determination stated that \u201cthe petitioners provided no evidence of their contact periods with Ohio, other than as sworn on the statement.\u201d As a consequence of these findings, the commissioner concluded that \u201cthe petitioners are not irrebuttably presumed under R.C. 5747.24(B) to be domiciled outside of Ohio.\u201d The consequence is that the \u201cthe petitioners are presumed to be domiciled in Ohio for the entire taxable year under R.C. 5747.24(C).\u201d <em>See </em>R.C. 5747.24(B)(1) (if \u201cthe individual fails to file the statement as required or makes a false statement, the individual is presumed under division (C) of this section to have been domiciled in this state the entire taxable year\u201d). The commissioner concluded that the Cunninghams failed to rebut the presumption of Ohio domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">{\u00b6 8} The Cunninghams appealed to the BTA. The BTA found that Kent had filed the domicile affidavit under R.C. 5747.24(B). The BTA also found that because Sue had not filed a domicile affidavit, she was unable to claim the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>irrebuttable presumption and that regardless of the number of contact periods, the totality of the evidence established that she had an Ohio domicile under common-law principles. BTA No. 2011-4641, 2014 WL 1155688, *3-4 (Mar. 6, 2014). The BTA held that because \u201c \u2018domicile\u2019 is a legal concept defined for individual income tax purposes by R.C. 5747.24,\u201d a \u201ctaxpayer may lose the irrebuttable presumption of non-Ohio domicile only if making a false statement regarding (1) contact periods, or (2) having an abode outside Ohio.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3. According to the BTA, Kent Cunningham had \u201ccomplied with the requirements of R.C. 5747.24(B)(1)\u201d and was, therefore, \u201cirrebuttably presumed to be not domiciled in Ohio for Ohio individual income tax purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The BTA reversed the commissioner\u2019s determination with regard to Kent Cunningham, and the tax commissioner has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\n<em>Income tax and domicile</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">{\u00b6 9} Ohio\u2019s income tax is levied \u201con every individual * * * residing in or earning or receiving income in this state.\u201d R.C. 5747.02(A). \u201cResident\u201d is defined as an \u201cindividual who is domiciled in this state, subject to section 5747.24 of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 5747.01(I)(1). \u201cNonresident\u201d is defined as \u201can individual * * * that is not a resident.\u201d R.C. 5747.01(J).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">{\u00b6 10} Residents generally pay tax on all of their Ohio adjusted gross income, R.C. 5747.02(A), subject to reduction by a \u201cresident credit\u201d designed to prevent double taxation when an Ohioan has been subject to tax on the same income in another state. R.C. 5747.05(B); <em>see Brachman v. Limbach, </em>52 Ohio St.3d 1, 2, 556 N.E.2d 146 (1990). A nonresident pays tax only on the portion of his income that is earned or received in Ohio. <em>See </em>R.C. 5747.01(A) (income tax \u201cis hereby levied on every individual * * * residing in or earning or receiving income in this state\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">{\u00b6 11} During the many years that the Cunninghams earned their income in Ohio from business and employment activities before their retirement, that income would have been taxable by Ohio regardless of their state of domicile. But by 2008 both had retired, and their income no longer consisted of wages or business income but was derived from sources such as pensions, interest, dividends, and IRA distributions, the allocation of which depends solely on where they are domiciled. <em>See </em>R.C. 5747.20(B)(2)(c) (income from disposition of intangible property \u201callocable to this state if the taxpayer\u2019s domicile was in this state at the time of such sale or other transfer\u201d); 5747.20(B)(6) (any item of income or deduction included in the computation of the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income that is not otherwise specifically allocated, including interest, dividends, and distributions, and IRA income, \u201cshall not be allocated to this state unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>taxpayer\u2019s domicile was in this state at the time such income was paid or accrued\u201d). Thus, the issues of domicile and residence are dispositive with respect to whether Kent Cunningham\u2019s 2008 income should be taxed by Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\n<em>Common-law domicile</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">{\u00b6 12} We recently stated that \u201cdomicile is \u2018the technically pre-eminent headquarters that every person is compelled to have in order that certain rights and duties that have been attached to it by the law may be determined.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schill v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>141 Ohio St.3d 382, 2014-Ohio-4527, 24 N.E.3d 1138, \u00b6 24, quoting <em>Williamson v. Osenton, </em>232 U.S. 619, 625, 34 S.Ct. 442, 58 L.Ed. 758 (1914). In the tax context, the BTA has observed that although \u201cthe terms \u2018resident\u2019 and \u2018domicile\u2019 are frequently used interchangeably, * * * they in fact are distinctly different, albeit related, concepts.\u201d <em>Davis v. Limbach, </em>BTA No. 89-C-267, 1992 WL 275694, *4 (Sept. 25, 1992). Domicile \u201cis generally defined as a legal relationship between a person and a particular place which contemplates two factors: first, residence, at least for some period of time and, second, the intent to reside in that place permanently or at least indefinitely.\u201d <em>Id.; accord Schill, </em>\u00b6 25. At common law, \u201cthe issue of domicile is one of intent determined by the facts of the individual case,\u201d including \u201cthe acts and declarations of the person\u201d and the totality of \u201caccompanying circumstances.\u201d <em>Davis </em>at *4, citing <em>State ex rel. Kaplan v. Kuhn, </em>8 Ohio N.P. 197, 202, 11 Ohio Dec. 321 (1901). <em>See Cleveland v. Surella, </em>61 Ohio App.3d 302, 305-306, 572 N.E.2d 763 (8th Dist.1989) (\u201c[ejvidentiary factors\u201d include \u201cfiling federal income tax returns, voting, automobile registration or location of spouse and children\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">{\u00b6 13} We have held that \u201cfor a change in domicile to be established, the person must have a physical presence in the new residence and intend to stay there.\u201d <em>Schill, </em>\u00b6 26, quoting <em>Williamson </em>at 624. Moreover, \u201c \u2018[t]he essential fact that raises a change of abode to a change of domicile is the absence of any intention to live elsewhere * * *.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Williamson </em>at 624. <em>See E. Cleveland v. Landingham, </em>97 Ohio App.3d 385, 390, 646 N.E.2d 897 (8th Dist.1994) (\u201cno one loses his old domicile until a new one is acquired\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">{\u00b6 14} The Cunninghams state in their brief that they were both \u201ccommon- law domiciliarles of Ohio during the 2008 tax year.\u201d This concession is supported by various facts, including that Kent and Sue were both born, raised, and educated in Ohio; that they were married in Ohio; that they have lived in Ohio throughout their entire marriage up to the time of the BTA hearing in 2012 (except for several years in the 1970s); that their mail was generally delivered to their Cincinnati home and not forwarded to the Tennessee address; that they have lived in the Cincinnati area and raised a family there in three houses, including the home that they currently own in Indian Hill; and that they held Ohio driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>licenses and voted in Ohio in 2008, the tax year at issue. <em>See generally In re Hutson\u2019s Estate, </em>165 Ohio St. 115, 133 N.E.2d 347 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>The \u201cbright-line statute,\u201d R.C. 5747.24</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">{\u00b6 15} In 1993, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 5747.24, which we will refer to as the \u201cbright-line\u201d statute. S.B. No. 123, 145 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1113, 1120-1122. The bright-line statute \u201csets forth certain presumptions regarding an individual\u2019s domicile\u201d for tax purposes. <em>Tyson v. Zaino, </em>BTA No. 2001-B-1327, 2003 WL 22294864, *4 (Oct. 3, 2003). Those presumptions depend on two circumstances: having an \u201cabode\u201d or place of residence outside Ohio during the entire taxable year and having no more than a certain number of \u201ccontact periods in this state\u201d during the taxable year. R.C. 5747.24(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">{\u00b6 16} Pursuant to R.C. 5747.24(A)(1), a \u201ccontact period in this state\u201d is defined in terms of two elements. The taxpayer satisfies the first element by being away, overnight, from an \u201cabode\u201d (a place of residence) of the taxpayer that is located outside Ohio. The second is satisfied if the taxpayer, while away overnight from the non-Ohio abode, spends a portion of each of two consecutive days in Ohio, however minimal the portion of each day might be. As a general matter, this can be characterized as an \u201covernight\u201d test, where the overnight stay need not be in Ohio, but probably would be in most instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">{\u00b6 17} In 2006, the legislature amended the bright-line statute, creating a presumption of non-Ohio domicile for a taxpayer with 182 or fewer contact periods in Ohio. 151 Ohio Laws, Part V, 9463 (amending R.C. 5747.24(B)(1)). The presumption is irrebuttable unless the taxpayer fails to timely file a statement verifying that he was not domiciled in Ohio and he had at least one abode outside Ohio, both during the entire taxable year. The statement must identify the abode(s). The statement is rebuttable if it contains a \u201cfalse statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">{\u00b6 18} It is well settled that \u201c \u2018the general assembly will not be presumed to have intended to abrogate a settled rule of the common law unless the language used in a statute clearly supports such intention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mandelbaum v. Mandelbaum, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 433, 2009-Ohio-1222, 905 N.E.2d 172, \u00b6 29, quoting <em>State ex rel. Hunt v. Fronizer, </em>77 Ohio St. 7, 16, 82 N.E. 518 (1907). <em>See also Carrel v. Allied Prods. Corp., </em>78 Ohio St.3d 284, 287, 677 N.E.2d 795 (1997); <em>Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Antonelli, </em>29 Ohio St.3d 9, 10-11, 504 N.E.2d 717 (1987). Although the bright-line statute creates an irrebuttable presumption, it does not affect the substantive law of domicile. <em>See Maple v. Tracy, </em>BTA Nos. 98-T-268 and 98-T-312, 1999 WL 706543, *3 (Sept. 3, 1999) (\u201cWhile R.C. 5747.24 has set forth certain presumptions and burdens with respect to domicile, it has not altered the basic concept of what constitutes a domicile\u201d); <em>Tyson, </em>BTA No. 2001-B-1327, 2003 WL 22294864, *6 (quoting <em>Maple).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Moreover, by clear implication, R.C. 5747.24 incorporates the common law of domicile and preserves it. A taxpayer who does not enjoy the irrebuttable presumption against Ohio domicile under R.C. 5747.24(B) is presumed to be domiciled in Ohio and bears the burden of rebutting that presumption. <em>See </em>R.C. 5747.24(C) and (D). To do so involves proving the substantive elements of domicile under the common law. <em>See Schill, </em>141 Ohio St.3d 382, 2014-Ohio-4527, 24 N.E.3d 1138, \u00b6 35-37 (outlining the facts in the taxpayer\u2019s testimony that would rebut a presumption against a Florida domicile under R.C. 5747.24).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">{\u00b6 20} At the time pertinent to this appeal, R.C. 5747.24(B)(1) under the 2006 amendment stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">[A]n individual who during a taxable year has no more than one hundred eight-two contact periods in this state, which need not be consecutive, and who during the entire taxable year has at least one abode outside this state, is presumed to be not domiciled in this state during the taxable year if [within a prescribed time], the individual files with the tax commissioner, on the form prescribed by the commissioner, a statement from the individual verifying that the individual was not domiciled in this state under this division during the taxable year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">The presumption that the individual was not domiciled in this state is irrebuttable unless the individual fails to timely file the statement as required or makes a false statement. If the individual fails to file the statement as required or makes a false statement, the individual is presumed under division (C) of this section to have been domiciled in this state the entire taxable year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">151 Ohio Laws, Part V, 9463.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">{\u00b6 21} The Cunninghams argue that R.C. 5747.24(B)(1) abrogated the common-law principles of domicile. They argue that the General Assembly did not intend to permit a finding that a taxpayer filed a \u201cfalse statement\u201d merely because other evidence shows that the taxpayer meets the common-law criteria for domicile. Rather, they claim, the statement required under R.C. 5747.24(B) is false only if the taxpayer does not meet the <em>statutory </em>requirements for the irrebuttable presumption of a non-Ohio domicile. They contend that the description of the statement as verifying that the individual was not domiciled in Ohio \u201cunder this division\u201d bolsters their conclusion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">{\u00b6 22} The statute is not as narrow as the Cunninghams claim. A statement verifying non-Ohio domicile can be false if it is not supported by the common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>of domicile. That the taxpayer must \u201cverify\u201d domicile status militates strongly against the argument that the underlying common-law facts of domicile do not matter. In a legal context, \u201cverify\u201d usually means either presenting evidence of a provable fact or stating a matter as being fact under oath. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1793 (10th Ed.2014). If the common law does not matter, as the Cunninghams assert and as the BTA held, then the statutory requirement that the individual \u201cverify\u201d non-Ohio domicile would be rendered meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. 5747.24(B)(1) states that when an individual satisfies the contact-period test and has an abode outside Ohio, the individual</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">is presumed to be not domiciled in this state during the taxable year if, on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year [i.e., April 15 of the following year for calendar-year taxpayers], the individual files with the tax commissioner, on the form prescribed by the commissioner, a statement from the individual verifying that the individual was not domiciled in this state under this division during the taxable year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 24} There is no factual dispute concerning the two crucial elements under R.C. 5747.24(B)(1). The record extensively documents that the Cunninghams owned a house in Tennessee throughout 2008, which would constitute an \u201cabode outside this state.\u201d Moreover, the Cunninghams presented uncontroverted evidence that they had 182 or fewer contact periods during 2008. According to the Cunninghams, this should end the matter. They argue that the statute requires nothing more than verifying the separate and discrete facts of the number of contact periods and an abode outside Ohio. We disagree for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">{\u00b6 25} First, division (B) distinguishes verification of domicile from verification of contact periods and abode; it does not conflate them. The domicile statement itself asks for a declaration not only of contact periods and an abode outside Ohio. It also asks, on a separate line, for a declaration that the individual was not domiciled in Ohio during the tax year in question and for an identification of where the individual claims to have been domiciled during that year. It follows that verifying domicile is not the same as verifying the two statutory criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">{\u00b6 26} Second, division (B)(1) states that the taxpayer statement must verify two things: (1) that \u201c[d]uring the entire taxable year, the individual was not domiciled in this state\u201d and (2) that \u201c[d]uring the entire taxable year, the individual had at least one abode outside this state [whose location must be identified].\u201d R.C. 5747.24(B)(1)(a) and (b). When the statute sets forth these precise requirements for the statement, it does not limit the concept of domicile to domicile \u201cunder this division.\u201d Because of this, we conclude that the Cunning-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>hams place unwarranted emphasis on the use of the phrase elsewhere in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\n<em>False statement under R.C. 5747.24-(B)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 27} The tax commissioner found that Kent Cunningham\u2019s verification of non-Ohio domicile was false in light of a contradictory statement, which had been made under penalties of perjury and with the purpose of obtaining the property-tax benefit of the homestead exemption for his Cincinnati home. The BTA disagreed, concluding, as the Cunninghams argue, that the statute permits a finding of falsity only for a false statement pertaining to contact periods and abode. As discussed above, we disagree. We hold that the tax commissioner stated a substantial basis for the false-statement finding: the contradictory application for the homestead exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">{\u00b6 28} The homestead-exemption application was dated January 24, 2008. It claimed the tax break both for the current year 2008 and as a belated application for 2007. It identified Sue Cunningham as the applicant. She identified herself as a \u201cdisabled person\u201d as the basis for claiming the exemption. The application also identified Kent as the spouse of the applicant, the Cincinnati house as the home address, and the Tennessee home as \u201ca second or vacation home.\u201d Both Sue and Kent signed the application, asserting, under penalty of perjury: (1) \u201cI occupied this property as my principal place of residence on Jan. 1 of the year(s) for which I am requesting the homestead exemption\u201d; (2) \u201cI currently occupy this property as my principal place of residence\u201d; (3) \u201cI have examined this application, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, this application is true, correct and complete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">{\u00b629} As the tax commissioner found, the claim of homestead exemption contradicted the income tax affidavit in two respects: it asserted that the Cincinnati house was the principal place of residence and that the Tennessee house was a second or vacation home. For purposes of the homestead exemption, R.C. 323.151(A)(1) defines \u201chomestead\u201d as \u201c[a] dwelling * * * owned and occupied as a home by an individual whose domicile is in this state.\u201d The tax commissioner found that claiming the property-tax exemption was inconsistent with claiming non-Ohio domicile for 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">{\u00b6 30} We conclude that there is a substantial factual basis for rejecting the claim of non-Ohio domicile as a false statement. (Our holding in this case should not be construed as impugning the motives of the taxpayer. The Cunninghams appear to have acted on the basis of a good-faith belief that the statements in the two affidavits were not contradictory.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">{\u00b6 31} The Cunninghams argue that the irrebuttable presumption provided by R.C. 5747.24(B)(1) loses all force if the commissioner can make a false-statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>finding with respect to the taxpayer\u2019s domicile verification. We conclude that when the tax commissioner has information that furnishes a substantial basis for rejecting the claim of non-Ohio domicile and he sets forth that basis in his determination, the statute does not fail of its essential purpose of streamlining domicile determinations. The tax commissioner would not be justified in making a false-statement finding unless he could point to specific information that warranted the finding. We hold that the commissioner must set forth his basis for determining that the domicile statement is false and that when he does so, the purposes of the statute have not been frustrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 32} As noted, R.C. 5747.24(B)(1) specifically states that \u201c[i]f the individual * * * makes a false statement, the individual is presumed under division (C) of this section to have been domiciled in this state the entire taxable year.\u201d Under division (C), a taxpayer who is not irrebuttably presumed to be domiciled outside Ohio may prove non-Ohio domicile by a preponderance of the evidence. In this case, the tax commissioner correctly proceeded, after making his false-statement finding, to consider whether the evidence rebutted the presumption of Ohio domicile under division (C); he understandably concluded that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 33} The BTA erred by reversing the tax commissioner\u2019s denial of the irrebuttable presumption created under R.C. 5747.24(B)(1). Because the Cunninghams concede that they were Ohio domiciliaries under the common law for 2008, there is no call for any further determination of that issue. We therefore reverse the decision of the BTA and reinstate the tax commissioner\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Decision reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b132-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b132-10\">Kennedy and French, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b132-11\">French, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqE\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">{\u00b6 34} Kent Cunningham demonstrated that he performed the actions R.C. 5747.24(B)(1) requires to raise an irrebuttable presumption that for purposes of Ohio\u2019s income tax, he was not domiciled in Ohio during 2008. Those actions were three in number: (1) he maintained an abode outside the state during the year at issue (here, the house in Tennessee qualified as such an abode), (2) he limited his presence in Ohio to 182 contact periods or fewer, and (3) he timely filed a statement attesting to the foregoing facts while also verifying that he was in fact domiciled outside Ohio during the entire year. Because Cunningham satisfied these three criteria, I would hold that he was entitled to the irrebuttable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>presumption the statute prescribes. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s contrary holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">{\u00b6 35} The key issue of statutory construction lies in whether the tax commissioner may make a finding that the taxpayer\u2019s verification of out-of-state domicile is false. The majority holds that the commissioner may do so based on other information in his possession. But this interpretation contradicts the irrebuttability of the presumption that arises once a taxpayer has satisfied the three criteria, as Cunningham has done here. A contrary state of the facts can defeat a rebuttable presumption, but not an irrebuttable one. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 957, </em>1377 (10th Ed.2014) (recognizing \u201cirrebuttable presumption\u201d as synonymous with \u201cconclusive presumption,\u201d which is \u201c[a] presumption that cannot be overcome by any additional evidence or argument because it is accepted as irrefutable proof that establishes a fact beyond dispute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 36} I agree with the conclusion of the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) that R.C. 5747.24(B)(1) permits a finding of false statement only with respect to out-of-state abode and number of contact periods as predicate facts. I also concur with the BTA\u2019s trenchant observation that the tax commissioner\u2019s approach \u201cessentially renders the \u2018bright-line\u2019 non-residency status established by R.C. 5747.24(B) moot, as the commissioner could always challenge the veracity of the statement that the taxpayer was not domiciled in Ohio.\u201d BTA No. 2011-4641, 2014 WL 1155688, *3 (Mar. 6, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 37} Whether a taxpayer is domiciled in Ohio is a finding of ultimate fact that includes a legal conclusion predicated on the underlying basic facts. In my view, the purpose of R.C. 5747.24(B)(1) is to premise the legal conclusion on <em>selected </em>basic facts (namely, out-of-state abode and number of contact periods) to the exclusion of other facts that would be significant under the common-law test. Indeed, the essential purpose of R.C. 5747.24(B)(1)\u2019s irrebuttable presumption is to avoid the wide-ranging and open-ended inquiry into a myriad of domicile facts that occurs under common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">{\u00b6 38} In <em>Davis v. Limbach, </em>BTA No. 89-C-267, 1992 WL 275694, *4 (Sept. 25, 1992), the BTA noted that \u201c[tjhere is no bright line test stating exactly which factors are necessary for an individual to effectively change his domicile.\u201d At the next regular legislative session, the General Assembly enacted the first version of R.C. 5747.24. S.B. No. 123, 145 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1113. In doing so, the General Assembly\u2019s stated purpose included \u201cestablishing] income tax domicile tests.\u201d <em>Id.; Tyson v. Zaino, </em>BTA No. 2001-B-1327, 2003 WL 22294864, *4 (Oct. 3, 2003). In other words, by enacting R.C. 5747.24, the General Assembly sought to create the very \u201cbright line\u201d that the BTA had acknowledged was missing. The majority\u2019s interpretation defeats this legislative purpose.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ANE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister, L.L.P., and J. Donald Mottley, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Alo\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Daniel W. Fausey and Melissa W. Baldwin, Assistant Attorneys General, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">{\u00b6 39} Also unpersuasive is the majority\u2019s acquiescence in the view that the Cunninghams\u2019 homestead-exemption application contradicts the verification of non-Ohio domicile under R.C. 5747.24. Majority opinion at \u00b6 29. Two different taxes \u2014 the state income tax and the local real estate tax \u2014 have statutory provisions that create two different tax breaks. It lies well within the authority of the legislature to adopt different domicile standards for two completely different tax provisions, particularly where, as here, the legislature\u2019s actions expand the scope of exemption and restrict the scope of taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">{\u00b6 40} The General Assembly had the authority to, and in my view did, decide to limit the reach of the state income tax as to persons who might otherwise qualify as residents under the common law. Doing so does not impair the General Assembly\u2019s authority to confer a real estate tax benefit based on a broader common-law definition of domicile. And if the law does indeed do what I have described, there is no reason why the taxpayer cannot claim the benefit of both tax breaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 41} For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the BTA and remand to the tax commissioner for a determination of the amount of Cunningham\u2019s income, which must be removed from the tax assessment. Because the majority concludes otherwise, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-7\">Kennedy, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
