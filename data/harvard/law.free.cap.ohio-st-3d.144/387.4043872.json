Appellees, political subdivisions and landowners within the Sewer District, argue and the court of appeals concluded that the Sewer District is not authorized to establish a stormwater-management program. We disagree and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">{\u00b62} The Sewer District, a political subdivision of the state of Ohio, was formed in 1972 and includes as member communities all or parts of over 60 cities, villages, and townships in and around Cuyahoga County. In January 2010, the Sewer District adopted a plan to establish a regional stormwater-management program and a structure for fees to be charged to landowners within the Sewer District whose properties contain impervious surfaces. The Sewer District then filed an action in common pleas court against its member communities seeking a declaratory judgment that it had the authority to implement the regional stormwater-management program and to impose the fees. Some of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>member communities and several intervening landowners argued that the Sewer District lacked authority to implement the program and fees under R.C. Chapter 6119 and the Sewer District\u2019s charter and that the fees were unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">{\u00b6 3} In April 2011, the trial court declared upon a motion for partial summary judgment that the Sewer District had authority under R.C. Chapter 6119 and its charter to enact a regional stormwater-management program. The court of appeals reversed. It properly concluded that as a creature of statute, the Sewer District\u2019s authority is limited by the statutory scheme that created it. 2013-Ohio-4186, 999 N.E.2d 181, \u00b640 (8th Dist.). The court of appeals stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">the purpose of a regional water and sewer district is for \u201ceither or both\u201d of the following purposes: \u201c(A) [t]o supply water to users within or without the district\u201d; and \u201c(B) [t]o provide for the collection, treatment, and disposal of waste water within and without the district.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">(Brackets sic.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 43, quoting R.C. 6119.01(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 4} The court of appeals concluded that although the statutory scheme \u201cauthorized the Sewer District to collect, treat, and dispose of waste water entering the sewer system,\u201d it \u201cdoes not authorize the District to implement a \u2018stormwater management\u2019 program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b643 and 46. This conclusion depends in large part upon the court\u2019s pronouncement that \u201c[t]he term waste water necessarily means water containing waste.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 44, citing <em>Reith v. McGill Smith Punshon, Inc., </em>163 Ohio App.3d 709, 2005-Ohio-4852, 840 N.E.2d 226 (1st Dist.).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court also concluded after a bench trial that the Sewer District is authorized by R.C. Chapter 6119 to charge fees to pay for the stormwatermanagement program. The court of appeals reversed, concluding that the fees were \u201cnot for the \u2018use or service\u2019 of a \u2018water resource project.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">{\u00b6 6} We granted the Sewer District\u2019s discretionary appeal as to Proposition of Law No. I (asserting that the program and fees are authorized under R.C. Chapter 6119) and Proposition of Law No. II (asserting that the program and fees are authorized under the Sewer District\u2019s charter). 138 Ohio St.3d 1413, 2014-Ohio-566, 3 N.E.3d 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">{\u00b6 7} Despite the great interests at stake, the issues in this ease are exceedingly straightforward: (1) is the Sewer District\u2019s regional stormwater-management program authorized by statute and by its charter? and (2) is the attendant fee structure authorized by statute and by the charter? We answer both questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\n<em>I. The regional stormwater-management program is authorized by statute and by the Sewer District\u2019s charter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 8} There are many sound policy reasons to support or oppose the creation of the Sewer District\u2019s regional stormwater-management program and its attendant fee structure. The various party and amicus briefs are testaments to this. Although we appreciate their substantive significance, they are not germane to the legal issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 9} The parties do not dispute that the Sewer District is a valid creature of statute, authorized by R.C. Chapter 6119. The Sewer District\u2019s ability to create a regional stormwater-management program must, then, have its basis in the statutory scheme, which provides only two valid purposes for a regional water or sewer district. The district must \u201csupply water,\u201d which the Sewer District does not, or it must \u201cprovide for the collection, treatment, and disposal of waste water.\u201d R.C. 6119.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 6119.011(K) defines \u201cwaste water\u201d as \u201cany storm water and any water containing sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived from the prior use of the water.\u201d Despite its plain language, the parties\u2019 interpretations of this definition are radically different.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 11} Appellees argue, and the court of appeals concluded, that \u201c[t]he term waste water necessarily means water containing waste.\u201d 2013-Ohio-4186, 999 N.E.2d 181, \u00b644. Appellees contend that the participial phrase \u201ccontaining sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived from the prior use of the water\u201d modifies the noun \u201cany storm water\u201d as well as the noun \u201cany water,\u201d which would mean that stormwater is only \u201cwaste water\u201d when it is combined with sewage or pollutants.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">{\u00b6 12} The definition provided in the statute is uncomplicated. <em>See Youngstown Club v. Porterfield, </em>21 Ohio St.2d 83, 86, 255 N.E.2d 262 (1970) (\u201cit is customary to give words their plain ordinary meaning unless the legislative body has clearly expressed a contrary intention\u201d). In our view, the statute plainly indicates that \u201cwaste water\u201d comes in two forms. One is \u201cany storm water.\u201d The other is \u201cany water containing sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived from the prior use of the water.\u201d There is no other plausible reading of the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">{\u00b6 13} The definition sought by appellees renders the words \u201cany storm water and\u201d meaningless. But the words \u201cany storm water and\u201d are in the statute, and it is well known that our duty is to \u201cgive effect to the words used, not to delete words used or to insert words not used.\u201d <em>Columbus-Suburban Coach Lines, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>20 Ohio St.2d 125, 127, 254 N.E.2d 8 (1969); <em>see also State ex rel. Carmean v. Hardin Cty. Bd. of Edn., </em>170 Ohio St. 415, 422, 165 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>918 (1960) <em>(\u201cIt is </em>axiomatic in statutory construction that words are not inserted into an act without some purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 14} We conclude that the term \u201cany storm water\u201d was not included in the statute to be mere surplusage. The Sewer District has the authority to collect, treat, and dispose of \u201cwaste water.\u201d We hold that R.C. 6119.011(K) identifies two types of \u201cwaste water,\u201d one of which is \u201cany storm water.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the regional stormwater-management program falls within the statutory authority of the Sewer District.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 15} The charter creating the Sewer District states, \u201cThe purpose of the District shall be the establishment of a total waste water control system for the collection, treatment and disposal of waste water within and without the District * * <em>In re Establishment of Cleveland Regional Sewer Dist., </em>Cuyahoga C.P. No. SD 69411 (June 15, 1972), Exhibit A, \u00b6 4. This authority includes \u201coverall control of all waste water collection systems in the area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the statutory definition of \u201cwaste water,\u201d as discussed above, it is clear that the charter governing the Sewer District authorizes it to implement a regional stormwater-management program. Moreover, the charter also states, \u201cThe District will plan, finance, construct, operate and control waste water treatment and disposal facilities, major interceptor sewers, all sewer regulator systems and devices, weirs, retaining basins, storm water handling facilities, and all other water pollution control facilities of the District.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5(c). This charter provision specifically authorizes the Sewer District to build and operate stormwater-handling facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\n<em>II. The Sewer District is authorized by statute and by its charter to assess fees to implement the regional stormwater-management program</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 16} Having determined that the Sewer District is authorized to implement a regional stormwater-management program, we must now determine whether the district has the authority to charge fees to pay for that program. R.C. 6119.09 provides that \u201c[a] regional water and sewer district may charge, alter, and collect rentals or other charges * * * for the use or services of any water resource project or any benefit conferred thereby.\u201d R.C. 6119.011(G) defines a \u201cwater resource project\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">any waste water facility or water management facility acquired, constructed, or operated by or leased to a regional water and sewer district or to be acquired, constructed, or operated by or leased to a regional water and sewer district under this chapter * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cWaste water facilities\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtPk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>facilities for the purpose of treating, neutralizing, disposing of, stabilizing, cooling, segregating, or holding waste water, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, * * * facilities for the temporary or permanent impoundment of waste water, both surface and underground, and storm and sanitary sewers and other systems, whether on the surface or underground, designed to transport waste water * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">R.C. 6119.01KL).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cWater management facilities\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">facilities for the purpose of the development, use, and protection of water resources, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, facilities for water supply, facilities for stream flow improvement, dams, reservoirs, and other impoundments, * * * stream monitoring systems, facilities for the stabilization of stream and river banks, and facilities for the treatment of streams and rivers * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">R.C. 6119.01KM).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">{\u00b6 19} Appellees argue that the Sewer District cannot charge the fees permitted for a water-resource project because the Sewer District does not own or operate the various parts of the current stormwater-management system. <em>See </em>R.C. 6119.011(G). But the statutory definition of \u201cwater resource project\u201d includes a facility that is \u201cto be acquired, constructed, or operated\u201d by the Sewer District. <em>Id. </em>The Sewer District may therefore charge fees for this purpose under R.C. 6119.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">{\u00b6 20} It is impossible to say at this time that the Sewer District will not use the fees to acquire, construct, or operate a facility that will be part of the regional stormwater-management system that it is authorized to implement. It might not, and if it does not, appellees will be within their rights to challenge the Sewer District\u2019s collection of fees that did not go toward the use for which they were statutorily authorized. But today is not that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">{\u00b6 21} As stated above, the Sewer District\u2019s charter instructs it to, among other things, \u201cfinance * * * waste water treatment and disposal facilities [and] storm water handling facilities * * <em>In re Establishment of Cleveland Regional Sewer Dist., </em>Cuyahoga C.P. No. SD 69411, Exhibit A, \u00b6 5(c)(1). The charter provides that \u201c[a]ny projects not financed through the Ohio Water Development Authority would be financed in such a manner as may be deemed appropriate by the Board of Trustees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5(e)(3). We conclude that this broad language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>encompasses the assessing of fees to pay for a stormwater-management system and that the fees are therefore authorized by the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 22} Because we conclude that the Sewer District has authority to implement a regional stormwater-management program and to charge fees for that program, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b476-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A4O\">French, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AMU\">O\u2019Donnell and Kennedy, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b476-8\">French, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADh\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 23} I agree with the majority that appellant, the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (the \u201cSewer District\u201d), has authority under both R.C. Chapter 6119 and its charter to implement a regional stormwater-management program, but I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Sewer District has statutory authority to finance that program by presently assessing the stormwater fees that are set out in Title V of its Code of Regulations, which implements the stormwater-management program. Accordingly, I concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">{\u00b6 24} Both the majority opinion and Justice Kennedy\u2019s dissent recognize that the Sewer District\u2019s statutory authority over stormwater hinges, in part, upon the meaning of the term \u201cwaste water\u201d in R.C. 6119.01(B) and, specifically, upon whether that term includes uncontaminated stormwater. I agree with the majority opinion that R.C. 6119.011(K) is unambiguous. It defines \u201cwaste water\u201d as encompassing two types of water: (1) \u201cany storm water\u201d and (2) \u201cany water containing sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived from the prior use of the water.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under R.C. 6119.01(B), the Sewer District has authority to collect, treat, and dispose of stormwater, whether or not it contains sewage, industrial waste or other pollutants.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">{\u00b6 25} Other provisions in R.C. Chapter 6119 reinforce the Sewer District\u2019s statutory authority over stormwater. A regional water and sewer district\u2019s broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>authority includes the authority to acquire, construct, improve, maintain, repair, and operate water-resource projects, including waste-water facilities and water-management facilities. R.C. 6119.011(G) and (S); R.C. 6119.06(G). Both \u201cwaste water facilities\u201d and \u201cwater management facilities\u201d encompass facilities dealing with stormwater. R.C. 6119.011(L) and (M). Additionally, R.C. 6119.19 states that \u201cthe board of trustees of a regional water and sewer district may provide a system of sanitary and/or <em>storm water sewerage, </em>herein referred to only as sewerage, for any part of the area included within the district.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Based upon these provisions and the statutory definition of \u201cwaste water,\u201d which encompasses stormwater, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Sewer District has the authority to manage stormwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b626} I likewise agree with the majority that the Sewer District\u2019s charter authorizes it to implement a regional stormwater-management program. The charter tracks the language of R.C. 6119.01(B) and states the Sewer District\u2019s purpose as \u201cthe establishment of a total wastewater control system for the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater within and without the District.\u201d <em>In re Establishment of Cleveland Regional Sewer Dist., </em>Cuyahoga C.P. No. SD 69411 (May 25, 1979), Exhibit A, \u00b64. In light of the inclusion of stormwater within the preexisting statutory definition of \u201cwaste water,\u201d the charter authorizes the Sewer District to establish a stormwater-management system, consistent with R.C. Chapter 6119.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 27} Water pollution, stemming from \u201c[t]he increase in the amount of wastewater in the Metropolitan Cleveland area resulting from the increase in population and the expansion of industry in the many political subdivisions outside of the City of Cleveland,\u201d was a driving force behind the creation of the Sewer District. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3. The charter authorizes the Sewer District to \u201cplan, finance, construct, operate and control wastewater treatment and disposal facilities, major interceptor sewers, all sewer regulator systems and devices, weirs, retaining basins, storm water handling facilities, and all other water pollution control facilities of the District.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5(c)(1). But the charter also expressly authorizes the Sewer District to undertake stormwater-control measures. Paragraph 5(m), which governs the Sewer District\u2019s authority with respect to \u201cLocal Sewerage Collection Facilities and Systems,\u201d states that \u201c[t]he District shall have authority pursuant to Chapter 6119 of the Ohio Revised Code to plan, finance, construct, maintain, operate, and regulate local sewerage collection facilities and systems within the District, <em>including both storm, and sanitary sewer systems.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) And paragraph 5(m)(3) specifically directs the Sewer District to \u201cdevelop a detailed integrated capital improvement plan for regional management of wastewater collection and storm drainage designed to identify a capital improvement program for the solution of all intercommunity drainage problems (both storm and sanitary) in the District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Appellees, political subdivisions and property owners within the Sewer District, argue that Title V of the Sewer District\u2019s Code of Regulations, which sets out the regional stormwater-management program, conflicts with the charter\u2019s provision that local communities retain authority and responsibility for maintaining and operating their local sewerage collection systems absent a written agreement placing that responsibility on the Sewer District. But Title V does not provide for the Sewer District\u2019s ownership of or responsibility for sewerage collection facilities and systems owned or operated by the member communities, and the Sewer District asserts that it does not intend to interfere with the member communities\u2019 local systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 29} Title V distinguishes between local stormwater systems and the regional stormwater system. \u201cRegional Stormwater System\u201d means \u201c[t]he entire system of watercourses, stormwater conveyance structures, and Stormwater Control Measures in the District\u2019s service area that are owned and/or operated by the District or over which the District has right of use for the management of stormwater, including both naturally occurring and constructed facilities.\u201d Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer Dist. Code of Regs., Section 5.0218. \u201cLocal Stormwater System,\u201d on the other hand, includes watercourses, stormwaterconveyance structures or stormwater-control measures \u201cowned and/or operated by a private entity or a unit of local government other than the District\u201d and \u201cnot designated as part of the Regional Stormwater System.\u201d <em>Id,., </em>Section 5.0212. So, the regional stormwater system does not include watercourses, conveyance structures or stormwater-control measures owned or operated by the local communities absent agreement between the local communities and the Sewer District. By limiting the reach of the regional stormwater system, Title V does not conflict with the Sewer District\u2019s charter, and I agree with the majority that the charter authorizes the Sewer District to build and operate a regional stormwater-management system.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 30} Despite my agreement with the majority\u2019s determination that the Sewer District has authority to manage uncontaminated stormwater, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that R.C. 6119.09 authorizes the stormwater fees set out in Title V. Appellees argue that the Sewer District cannot impose its stormwater fees for two reasons: (1) because R.C. Chapter 6119 does not authorize the fees and (2) because the fees amount to an unlawful tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 31} In her dissent, Justice Kennedy adopts appellees\u2019 second argument\u2014 that the charges amount to an unlawful tax. But I agree with the Sewer District\u2019s assertion that that issue is not properly before us. The Sewer District asked this court to adopt a proposition of law stating that stormwater-management charges based upon the amount of impervious surface a parcel contains\u2014 like the stormwater fees here \u2014 do not constitute an illegal tax. This court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>however, declined jurisdiction over that proposition of law. <em>Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer Dist. v. Bath Twp., </em>138 Ohio St.3d 1413, 2014-Ohio-566, 3 N.E.3d 1216. Having declined jurisdiction over that proposition of law, the question whether the stormwater fees are an unlawful tax is not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">{\u00b6 32} In my view, it is appellees\u2019 other argument \u2014 regarding statutory authority \u2014 that is persuasive. The majority reasons that because a \u201cwater resource project\u201d includes a facility to be acquired, constructed or operated, the Sewer District may charge fees for that purpose under R.C. 6119.09. I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">{\u00b6 33} R.C. 6119.09 authorizes a regional water and sewer district to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201ccharge, alter, and collect rentals or other charges * * * for the <em>use or services </em>of any water resource project or any <em>benefit </em>conferred thereby and contract * * * with one or more persons, one or more political subdivisions, or any combination thereof, desiring the use or services thereof, and fix the terms, conditions, rentals, or other charges * * * for such use or services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">(Emphasis added.) <em>See also </em>R.C. 6119.06(W). The Sewer District contends that its stormwater fees represent charges for the use, services or benefits of a water-resource project.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">{\u00b6 34} Although R.C. 6119.011(G) defines \u201cwater resource project\u201d to include a project \u201cto be acquired, constructed, or operated by or leased to a regional water and sewer district,\u201d the district may charge only \u201cfor the use or services of\u2019 or \u201cany benefit conferred\u201d by a water-resource project. R.C. 6119.09. R.C. 6119.09 contemplates uses or services that may be contracted for. The question, therefore, resolves to whether a water-resource project that will be acquired, constructed or operated <em>in the future </em>affords uses, services or benefits <em>in the present, </em>so as to authorize charges under R.C. 6119.09 \u2014 a question the majority does not address.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">{\u00b6 35} The Eighth District concluded that the Sewer District \u201cimproperly employed R.C. 6119.09 to generate revenues for the costs of its\u201d regional stormwater-management program because the stormwater fees are \u201cunrelated to any use or services afforded to a property owner by a \u2018water resource project.\u2019 \u201d 2013-Ohio-4186, 999 N.E.2d 181, \u00b6 53, 56. Appellees likewise contend that the Sewer District may not impose stormwater fees for a water-resource project that the Sewer District has not yet acquired, constructed or operated, because until it has done so, there is no use, service or benefit for which to charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>{\u00b6 36} The Sewer District directs this court to the trial court\u2019s factual findings regarding the uses and services the regional stormwater-management program provides. The trial court found that property owners within the Sewer District passively \u201c \u2018use\u2019 the unmanaged Regional Stormwater System as rainfall creates runoff from each parcel.\u201d The trial court also found that the Sewer District provides the \u201cservice of effective transportation of stormwater,\u201d resulting in decreased flooding and erosion. Finally, the court stated that the regional stormwater-management system will provide benefits, including improvements in water quality and wildlife habitats and the reduction of future stormwatermanagement costs. But those findings depend upon the Sewer District acquiring, constructing, and operating a water-resource project. Whether property owners would benefit in the future from the system the Sewer District intends to create and operate sidesteps the relevant issue: whether the Sewer District currently offers uses or services relating to the stormwater-management system for which it may charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 37} Nothing in R.C. 6119.09 suggests that the Sewer District may presently impose a fee for uses or services it will be able to provide only in the future. The statute requires current usage, service or benefits to justify the collection of stormwater fees. Until the Sewer District acquires, constructs or begins to operate a water-resource project relating to regional stormwater management, it has no use, service or benefit to provide in exchange for the stormwater fees it seeks to extract from property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 38} Even so, the Sewer District is not without recourse. A regional water and sewer district may levy and collect taxes and special assessments and may issue revenue bonds. R.C. 6119.06(1) and (J); R.C. 6119.12; R.C. 6119.18; R.C. 6119.42. It may receive and accept grants from federal and state agencies for or in aid of the construction of water-resource projects. R.C. 6119.06(U). And it may enter into cooperative agreements with one or more political subdivisions to fund the acquisition or construction of a water-resource project. R.C. 6119.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 39} Because I conclude that R.C. 6119.09 does not authorize the Sewer District to impose stormwater fees for the use and service of a water-resource project to be acquired, constructed or operated by the Sewer District in the future, I dissent from the majority\u2019s determination that the Sewer District is presently authorized to impose the stormwater fees set out in Title V of its Code of Regulations. In all other respects, I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-12\">. Ohio is not alone in including stormwater within its definition of wastewater. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ky.Rev.

I would hold that the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (the \u201cSewer District\u201d) lacks authority to manage stormwater as proposed in the Sewer District\u2019s Stormwater Management Code (\u201cSMC\u201d) or to charge a fee to manage stormwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\n<em>R.C. Chapter 6119</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b6 41} R.C. Chapter 6119 addresses the creation and authority of regional sewer districts. As creatures of statute, sewer districts \u201chave no more authority than that conferred upon them by the statute, or what is clearly implied therefrom.\u201d <em>See Hall v. Lakeview Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>63 Ohio St.3d 380, 383, 588 N.E.2d 785 (1992). \u201cImplied powers are those that are incidental or ancillary to an expressly granted power; the express grant of power must be clear, and any doubt' as to the extent of the grant must be resolved against it.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship of Spangler, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 339, 2010-Ohio-2471, 933 N.E.2d 1067, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 42} The Sewer District is authorized \u201c[t]o provide for the collection, treatment, and disposal of waste water within and without the district\u201d pursuant to R.C. 6119.01. \u201c \u2018Waste water\u2019 means any storm water and any water containing sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived from the prior use of the water.\u201d R.C. 6119.011(K). I agree with appellees and the court of appeals that \u201cwaste water\u201d necessarily means water containing waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">{\u00b6 43} The majority holds that R.C. 6119.011(K) authorizes the District to manage two types of water \u2014 stormwater and water that is polluted or contaminated. I disagree. In my view, the definition of \u201cwaste water\u201d is water that \u201ccontain[s] sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants.\u201d R.C. 6119.011(K). This conclusion is supported by the purpose of the Sewer District, which is \u201cto provide for collection, <em>treatment, </em>and disposal of waste water.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 6119.01. Therefore, because the Sewer District is only authorized to treat water that contains waste, it has no authority to treat stormwater runoff, which the SMC defines as stormwater \u201cthat flows into ditches, water courses, storm sewers, or other concentrated flow patterns during and following precipitation, including rain runoff, snowmelt runoff, and surface runoff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">\n<em>The SMC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">{\u00b6 44} The SMC proposes a comprehensive, broad-ranging plan to manage stormwater that is beyond the Sewer District\u2019s authority under R.C. Chapter 6119. The Sewer District found that flooding and streambank erosion are \u201csignificant threats\u201d within the District. Consequently, the Sewer District determined that a \u201cRegional Stormwater Management Program is necessary\u201d to address these threats and their impacts on northeast Ohio\u2019s water resources. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The regional stormwater-management program would include \u201c[cjomprehensive management of the Regional Stormwater System,\u201d \u201cconstruction and implementation of necessary Stormwater Control Measures to address current, and minimize new flooding and erosion issues affecting the Regional Stormwater System,\u201d as well as \u201cinspection, operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities,\u201d including but not limited to clearing debris from blocked culverts, bridge abutments, and repair of streambank erosion. The \u201cRegional Stormwater System\u201d is extensive and includes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">[tjhe entire system of watercourses, stormwater conveyance structures, and Stormwater Control Measures in the District\u2019s service area that are owned and/or operated by the District or over which the District has right of use for the management of stormwater, including both naturally occurring and constructed facilities. The Regional Stormwater System shall generally include those watercourses, stormwater conveyance structures, and Stormwater Control Measures receiving drainage from three hundred (300) acres of land or more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">{\u00b6 45} The SMC further states that it \u201cis applicable to activities and persons on all parcels within the Sewer District\u2019s service area.\u201d The District will charge every parcel of land within the District a stormwater fee to fund the aforementioned stormwater-control measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">{\u00b6 46} Nowhere in R.C. Chapter 6119 is flooding or erosion control discussed. In large part, the SMC seeks to manage \u201cpure\u201d stormwater, i.e., water resulting from precipitation that is not mixed with pollutants or contaminants and that never enters the sanitary sewer system. Management of this water is beyond the scope of the Sewer District\u2019s authority, which is to collect, treat, and dispose of waste water, which is water that contains waste, i.e., pollutants or contaminants. Therefore, I would hold that the Sewer District has no statutory authority to implement the SMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\n<em>Stormwater \u201cFees\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">{\u00b6 47} Initially, I will address the concurring and dissenting opinion\u2019s assertion that the issue of whether a stormwater fee is a lawful tax is not properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">{\u00b6 48} Even though the reasons are not typically memorialized, this court may reject one or more propositions of law or an entire discretionary appeal for any number of reasons. <em>See Williamson v. Rubich, </em>171 Ohio St. 253, 253-254, 168 N.E.2d 876 (1960), citing Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 6 (whether questions presented to this court for appellate review \u201care in fact ones of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>or great general interest rests within the discretion of the court\u201d). However, I can find no authority that a rejected proposition of law creates a bar or waiver upon a party\u2019s argument when set forth in a legitimate response to an opposing party\u2019s proposition of law that has been accepted by the court. Nor can I find any authority that would preclude the court from considering and relying upon such an argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">{\u00b6 49} The Sewer District raised three propositions of law in its discretionary appeal to this court. We accepted the Sewer District\u2019s first two propositions for review on their merits, 138 Ohio St.3d 1413, 2014-Ohio-566, 3 N.E.3d 1216, but declined to review the third proposition, which stated, \u201cStormwater management programs, paid for through charges for stormwater management services, do not violate the Ohio or United States Constitutions. Further, such charges, when based upon the amount of impervious surface on a property, do not constitute an illegal tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">{\u00b6 50} One of the two propositions that we accepted stated, \u201cA district formed pursuant to R.C. Chapter 6119 is authorized to manage stormwater which is not combined with sewage, and to impose a charge for that purpose. <em>Such a charge is one \u2018for the use or service of a water resource project or any benefit conferred thereby.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">{\u00b6 51} In response to that proposition, appellee city of Beachwood argued in its merit brief in part that \u201c[t]he Stormwater Fee is actually an unauthorized tax that the Sewer District is using to avoid other required R.C. Chapter 6119 revenue-generating procedures.\u201d Beachwood\u2019s argument is an apt challenge to the Sewer District\u2019s assertion that the proposed charge for stormwater management is authorized. To prevent Beachwood from making such an argument based on <em>our </em>initial declination to consider this issue would infringe upon Beachwood\u2019s ability to make arguments of its own choosing and to fully respond to the Sewer District\u2019s propositions of law that we accepted in this appeal. And unlike issues raised for the first time in a reply brief, where the opposing party has no ability to respond, Beachwood raised the unlawful tax argument in its merit brief, affording the Sewer District an opportunity to refute the argument in its reply brief. <em>Compare In re Z.C., </em>12th Dist. Warren Nos. CA2005-06-065, CA2005-06-066, CA2005-06-081, and CA2005-06-082, 2006-Ohio-1787, 2006 WL 902358, \u00b6 20 (raising a new assignment of error in a reply brief precludes the opposing party from responding to that argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">{\u00b6 52} Obviously, this court may reject any argument presented by a party, but this court\u2019s refusal to review a proposition of law should not bar an opposing party from later using the same or a similar issue raised in that proposition in a legitimate, responsive argument to an opposing party\u2019s proposition of law that is being considered by the court, nor should it prevent this court from relying upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>such an argument. Under the facts of this case, I would- hold that the court is justified in considering Beachwood\u2019s responsive argument that the Sewer District\u2019s proposed fee is really an unlawful tax, even though the court declined to accept the Sewer District\u2019s proposition of law on that issue for review. Having addressed this threshold issue, I will proceed to address the merits of whether the stormwater fee is an unlawful tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 53} A sewer district may \u201ccharge, alter, and collect rentals or other charges, including penalties for late payment, for the use or services of any water resource project or any benefit conferred thereby.\u201d R.C. 6119.09; <em>see also </em>R.C. 6119.06(W)(1). A \u201cwater resource project\u201d is defined under R.C. 6119.011(G) as \u201cany waste water facility or water management facility acquired, constructed, or operated by or leased to a regional water and sewer district or to be acquired, constructed, or operated by or leased to a regional water and sewer district under this chapter * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">{\u00b6 54} In this case, the Sewer District, through the SMC, seeks to impose a \u201cstormwater fee\u201d on parcels of land in the District to pay for the management of stormwater. The fee, which is \u201cbased upon a calculation of the amount of Impervious Surface on a parcel[,] shall be imposed on every parcel within the District\u2019s service area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">{\u00b6 55} In my view, this fee is actually a tax, which does not appear to have been lawfully imposed. <em>See </em>R.C. 6119.18; <em>see also Sanborn v. Hamilton Cty. Budget Comm., </em>142 Ohio St.3d 20, 2014-Ohio-5218, 27 N.E.3d 498, \u00b6 5-7, citing Ohio Constitution, Article XII, Section 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cIt is not possible to come up with a single test that will correctly distinguish a tax from a fee in all situations * * <em>State ex rel. Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Release Comp. Bd. v. Withrow, </em>62 Ohio St.3d 111, 117, 579 N.E.2d 705 (1991). Therefore, \u201c[djetermining whether an assessment is a fee or a tax must be done on a case-by-case basis dependent upon the facts and circumstances surrounding each assessment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">{\u00b6 57} Some factors that may indicate that an assessment is a fee include the following: (1) the assessment is \u201cimposed in furtherance of regulatory measures,\u201d (2) the assessment is not placed in the general fund, but is used only to fund the regulatory purpose, (3) the assessment is \u201c \u2018imposed by a government in return for a service it provides,\u2019 \u201d and (4) the assessment is discontinued when the unobligated balance in the fund reaches a certain level. <em>Drees Co. v. Hamilton Twp., </em>132 Ohio St.3d 186, 2012-Ohio-2370, 970 N.E.2d 916, \u00b6 16-20, citing and quoting <em>Withrow </em>at 111, 113, 116-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">{\u00b6 58} In <em>Natl. Cable Television Assn., Inc. v. United States, </em>415 U.S. 336, 340-341, 94 S.Ct. 1146, 39 L.Ed.2d 370, the court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Taxation is a legislative function [where the legislature] may act arbitrarily and disregard benefits bestowed by the Government on a taxpayer and go solely on ability to pay, based on property or income. <em>A fee, </em>however, <em>is incident to a voluntary act, </em>e.g., a request that a public agency permit an applicant to practice law or medicine or construct a house or run a broadcast station. The public agency performing those services normally may exact a <em>fee </em>for a grant which, presumably, <em>bestows a benefit on the applicant, not shared by other members of society.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">{\u00b6 59} An example of a fee charged for a service is found in <em>Wyatt v. Trimble Twp. Waste Water Treatment Dist., </em>4th Dist. Athens No. 1521, 1992 WL 329386 (Nov. 3,1992). In <em>Wyatt, </em>the Trimble Township Waste Water Treatment District charged a homeowner for the installation of a plug at the point where each premises was to be connected to an existing sanitary sewer system for the purpose of waste-water treatment. The court found that the fee was in return for a benefit conferred, i.e., treatment of the homeowner\u2019s waste water. <em>Id. </em>at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">{\u00b6 60} In <em>Bolt v. Lansing, </em>459 Mich. 152, 587 N.W.2d 264 (1998), the Supreme Court of Michigan addressed whether a stormwater service charge imposed by the city of Lansing on its residents for the purpose of stormwater control was a fee or a tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">{\u00b6 61} In <em>Bolt, </em>Lansing decided to separate its combined sanitary and storm sewers. To finance this project, Lansing decided to impose a stormwater service charge. Similar to the instant case, the fee was based on the amount of impervious surface that a parcel contained. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">A proper fee must reflect the bestowal of a corresponding benefit on the person paying the charge, which benefit is not generally shared by other members of society. <em>Nat\u2019l Cable Television Ass\u2019n v. United States &amp; Federal Communications Comm., </em>415 U.S. 336, 340-342, 94 S.Ct. 1146, 39 L.Ed.2d 370 (1974). Where the charge for either storm or sanitary sewers reflects the actual costs of use, metered with relative precision in accordance with available technology, including some capital investment component, sewerage may properly be viewed as a utility service for which usage-based charges are permissible, and not as a disguised tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 164-165.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">{\u00b6 62} But the court held that \u201cthe lack of correspondence between the [stormwater service] charges and the benefit conferred demonstrates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>city has faded to differentiate any particularized benefits to property owners from the general benefits conferred on the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the acknowledged goal of the ordinance is to address environmental concerns regarding water quality. Improved water quality in the Grand and Red Cedar Rivers and the avoidance of federal penalties for discharge violations are goals that benefit everyone in the city, not only property owners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">{\u00b6 63} Pursuant to my interpretation of \u201cwaste water\u201d above, I do not believe that the Sewer District has authority to manage stormwater; consequently, the assessment fails to support a regulatory purpose, which is a factor that can support a finding that it is indeed a fee and not a tax. <em>See Drees Co., </em>132 Ohio St.3d 186, 2012-Ohio-2370, 970 N.E.2d 916, at \u00b6 16-20. However, even assuming that the Sewer District has statutory authority to manage stormwater as proposed in the SMC, the purported fee fails to meet other indicia of a true fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">{\u00b6 64} In the instant case, the Sewer District found that the SMC is necessary (1) to prevent flooding to public and private property, (2) to prevent \u201c[sjtreambank erosion[, which] is a significant threat to public and private property, water quality, wildlife, and aquatic and terrestrial habitats,\u201d and (3) to prevent \u201cdamage} to] the water resources of Northeast Ohio, [which] impairfs] the ability of these waters to sustain ecological and aquatic systems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">{\u00b6 65} Despite the district\u2019s claims that the SMC will benefit private property, I would hold that alleviating these problems results in a benefit that is conferred on the general public rather than on individual property owners. <em>See Natl. Cable Television Assn., Inc., </em>415 U.S. at 340-342, 94 S.Ct. 1146, 39 L.Ed.2d 370; <em>Bolt, </em>459 Mich. at 164-165, 587 N.W.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">{\u00b6 66} Further, as evidenced by this lawsuit, at minimum there are numerous municipalities (e.g., Beachwood, Bedford Heights, Brecksville, Independence, Lyndhurst, and Strongsville) and other entities (e.g., Highlands Business Park, L.L.C., Lakepoint Office Park, L.L.C., Park East Office Park, L.L.C., and the Ohio Counsel of Retail Merchants) that oppose the SMC. Voluntary acceptance of a service is another indicator that an assessment is a fee and not a tax. <em>Natl. Cable Television Assn. </em>at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">{\u00b6 67} For all the aforementioned reasons, I would hold that the Sewer District\u2019s stormwater fee is not a fee, but an unlawful tax.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AQST\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Thacker Martinsek, L.P.A., and Mark I.
