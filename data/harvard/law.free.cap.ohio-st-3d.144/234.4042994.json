We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, Grange Mutual Casualty Company, issued an automobile policy to appellee Philip Laboy as the named insured. As part of Laboy\u2019s policy, Grange provided up to $5,000 in medical care for each person injured in any one accident. Appellees Heidi Laboy, Alexandrea Laboy, and Gabrielle Laboy, also insureds under the policy, were involved in an automobile accident on May 23, 2006. The Laboys received medical treatment and submitted some of their bills both to Grange and to their health-insurance provider, Medical Mutual. Grange did not deny any part of the claim for medical expenses. The Laboys did not exhaust their medical-payment coverage, nor did they incur any out-of-pocket expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">{\u00b6 3} The Laboys reached a settlement with the third-party tortfeasor for the May 2006 accident. When Grange exercised its contractual right to subrogation against the Laboys, the Laboys objected, arguing that Grange had overpaid the medical providers. Under Section B of the policy\u2019s medical-payments coverage, Grange agreed to pay the lesser of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">1. reasonable expenses incurred by the insured for necessary medical and funeral services because of bodily injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">2. any negotiated reduced rate accepted by a medical provider.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">{\u00b6 4} For the medicals bills submitted to both Grange and Medical Mutual, the Laboys provided a chart in discovery showing, as an example, that medical providers had billed them $1,535 for services rendered to Heidi and Gabrielle Laboy. They acknowledged that for those services, Grange paid discounted rates to medical providers for reasonable and necessary charges, totaling $1,441.36 in medical expenses. But the Laboys asserted that their own health insurer, Medical Mutual, paid only $648.32 for those same medical expenses. The Laboys contended that they would have been entitled to an increased settlement of $793.04 because Grange\u2019s subrogation claim would have been reduced by that amount if Grange had paid the rates that were available to Medical Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">{\u00b6 5} The Laboys filed a class-action lawsuit against Grange, alleging claims for breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Grange filed a motion for summary judgment. After noting that the Laboys had withdrawn their claim for breach of fiduciary duty, the trial court determined that the only reasonable interpretation of the language \u201cany negotiated reduced rate accepted by a medical provider\u201d in Section (B)(2) was that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Grange had to have access to the negotiated rate through its own contract with the medical provider. Because the claim for breach of good faith and fair dealing was contingent on finding a breach of contract, the trial court found that both claims failed as a matter of law and entered summary judgment for Grange.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">{\u00b6 6} The Laboys appealed to the Eighth District Court of Appeals. The appellate court began its analysis by stating that the language in Section (B)(2) is plain and unambiguous. But the court also noted that the disputed language is without qualification and, taken to the extreme, \u201cwould apply to rates negotiated on the other side of the globe or to the rate negotiated by someone who perhaps persuades a medical provider to accept less than that provider\u2019s normal rate for services.\u201d 2014-Ohio-1516, 2014 WL 1408142, at \u00b6 6. Although the Eighth District determined that it would be impossible for Grange to comply with such an absurd interpretation, the court of appeals disagreed with the trial court that Grange\u2019s interpretation of the policy was the only reasonable one. The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for fact-finding to determine whether Grange actually did have access to the lower rates provided by the Laboys\u2019 healthcare insurer and to ensure that was the most sensible and reasonable interpretation of the policy. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 7} We accepted Grange\u2019s discretionary appeal on the following two propositions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">1. An insurer does not breach an obligation to pay negotiated rates for medical care when it has no contractual right to pay those rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">2. When a contract is found to be unambiguous, it is error to order further fact finding about its meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cAn insurance policy is a contract whose interpretation is a matter of law.\u201d <em>Sharonville v. Am. Emp. Ins. Co., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-2180, 846 N.E.2d 833, \u00b6 6. The fundamental goal when interpreting an insurance policy is to ascertain the intent of the parties from a reading of the policy in its entirety and to settle upon a reasonable interpretation of any disputed terms in a manner designed to give the contract its intended effect. <em>Burris v. Grange Mut. Cos., </em>46 Ohio St.3d 84, 89, 545 N.E.2d 83 (1989). Words and phrases must be given their plain and ordinary meaning \u201cunless manifest absurdity results, or unless some other meaning is clearly evidenced from the face or overall contents of the instrument.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co., </em>53 Ohio St.2d 241, 374 N.E.2d 146 (1978), paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>{\u00b6 9} We have held that provisions in an insurance contract that are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation will be construed liberally in favor of the insured. <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380 (1988), syllabus. <em>See also Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, \u00b6 13. \u201cThis rule, however, will not be applied so as to provide an unreasonable interpretation of the words of the policy.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. CPS Holdings, Inc., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 306, 2007-Ohio-4917, 875 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 8, citing <em>Morfoot v. Stake, </em>174 Ohio St. 506, 190 N.E.2d 573 (1963), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">{\u00b6 10} The single issue here is the meaning of the phrase \u201cany negotiated reduced rate accepted by a medical provider\u201d in Section (B)(2) of the policy. Both the parties and the courts in this case agree that this phrase cannot be interpreted to mean \u201cany negotiated rate anywhere in the world.\u201d We agree. But this logical limitation placed on the word \u201cany\u201d does not necessarily mean that the policy is ambiguous. If a reasonable interpretation of the language exists, then we should give the agreement its intended legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 11} Grange argues that the only reasonable construction of Section (B)(2) is to read the phrase \u201cany negotiated reduced rate accepted by a medical provider\u201d as meaning a negotiated reduced rate that Grange itself is contractually entitled to pay. A healthcare insurer\u2019s negotiated rates are not available to an automobile insurer simply because they both have the same insured. Because Grange is not a party to the contract between Medical Mutual and the different medical providers, it has no right or access to those negotiated reduced rates. Grange did have access to negotiated reduced rates, which it did pay when available, through a contract with ReviewWorks, a medical-bill review company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 12} The Laboys disagree that Grange has access only to rates that it negotiates itself or that are negotiated on its behalf via a contract with Review-Works. They contend that under Section (B)(2), Grange is contractually obligated to utilize the reduced rates accepted by their health insurer when paying medical expenses. But there is no evidence in the record that the Laboys have an independent right to insist that their medical providers accept from Grange rates that were negotiated by Medical Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 13} In fact, our opinion in one tort case arising out of an automobile accident suggests that they have no such right. <em>See King v. ProMedica Health Sys., Inc., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 596, 2011-Ohio-4200, 955 N.E.2d 348. In <em>King, </em>the injured insured objected when the hospital chose to bill her automobile-insurance compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ny for its services rather than her healthcare insurance company, presumably to take advantage of a higher rate of compensation. We held that the hospital\u2019s actions did not violate R.C. 1751.60(A) (prohibiting a medical provider from seeking compensation from an insured person when the provider has a contract with the insured\u2019s health-insurance company) because the statute did not prohibit the hospital from seeking recovery from entities or insurers other than the healthcare insurer. R.C. 1751.60 is not at issue here, but the principle holds.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">{\u00b6 14} The Laboys have \u201caccess\u201d to the rates that Medical Mutual has negotiated with medical providers when they submit their medical bills to Medical Mutual for payment pursuant to their healthcare insurance policy. Here, however, they chose to seek payment for some of their medical expenses from Grange in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">{\u00b6 15} Nonetheless, the Laboys maintain that nothing in the automobile policy prevents Grange from accepting lower rates when the rates are offered without a contract. They state that Grange has reimbursed health-insurance companies if the medical services covered by Grange\u2019s policy were initially paid by the health insurer instead of by Grange. But that is not the reality of this case. The Laboys never asked Grange to reimburse Medical Mutual and apparently did not inform Grange that they had submitted some of the same bills to Medical Mutual. Instead, they submitted the bills from their medical providers directly to Grange for payment. And Grange did exactly as the Laboy contract specified, either using the discounted rates it had available for certain providers through its contract with ReviewWorks or paying the reasonable expense for that service.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">{\u00b6 16} Finally, there is no evidence that any of the medical providers offered to accept Medical Mutual\u2019s rates from Grange.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">{\u00b6 17} At oral argument, the Laboys asked this court to impose a duty on Grange to ask its insureds whether they have access to better rates through other insurance. But such an obligation does not appear in the contract. We therefore decline to interpret the policy in this manner. Instead, we agree with the trial court that the only reasonable interpretation of the policy\u2019s contested language is that \u201cany negotiated reduced rate accepted by a medical provider\u201d means a negotiated reduced rate that Grange is contractually entitled to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">{\u00b6 18} Under the medical-payments coverage, Grange is obligated to pay the expenses of an insured for medical services related to a bodily injury sustained in an accident. The only reasonable interpretation of Section (B)(2) is that Grange is obliged to pay reduced rates only when such rates have been negotiated between the medical provider and Grange or when the provider is in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>preferred-provider network that Grange has access to through its contract with ReviewWorks.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A8W\">Connick Law, L.L.C., and Thomas J.
