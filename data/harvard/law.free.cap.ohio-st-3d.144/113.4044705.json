On October 6, 2014, relator, disciplinary counsel, charged Rosen with professional misconduct for conduct that occurred between August 2007 and August 2008 while Rosen, then an Assistant Attorney General in the Ohio Attorney General\u2019s Office, was serving as general counsel for the Ohio Law Enforcement Gateway (\u201cOHLEG\u201d). OHLEG allows criminal justice agencies and their personnel access to several data systems, some of which contain confidential information reserved for law-enforcement personnel only. Relator alleged that Rosen improperly accessed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>OHLEG system to seek information about four individuals that either she or her friends were dating.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">{\u00b6 2} A panel of the Board of Professional Conduct considered the cause on the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 11.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">{\u00b6 3} In the consent-to-discipline agreement, Rosen stipulates to the facts alleged in relator\u2019s complaint and agrees that her conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">{\u00b6 4} The parties stipulate that the applicable mitigating factors include the absence of a prior disciplinary record, Rosen\u2019s cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, and her full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties agree that there are no aggravating factors. Based upon Rosen\u2019s stipulated misconduct and these factors, the parties stipulate that the appropriate sanction is a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">{\u00b6 5} The panel and the board found that the consent-to-discipline agreement conforms to BCGD Proc.Reg. 11 and recommend that we adopt the agreement in its entirety. For precedent, the panel cites a case in which we publicly reprimanded an attorney who also violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h), with similar mitigating factors and no aggravating factors. <em>See Disciplinary Counsel v. Mecklenborg, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 411, 2014-Ohio-1908, 12 N.E.3d 411 (publicly reprimanding an attorney for operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and negligently misrepresenting facts on an application to renew the attorney\u2019s driver\u2019s license).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">{\u00b6 6} We agree that Rosen violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h) and that this conduct warrants a public reprimand. Therefore, we adopt the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">{\u00b6 7} Accordingly, Erin Geralyn Rosen is hereby publicly reprimanded. Costs are taxed to Rosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-12\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A21\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Scott J.
