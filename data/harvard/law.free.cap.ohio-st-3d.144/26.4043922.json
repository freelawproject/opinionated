Respondent-appellant, State Teachers Retirement Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>(\u201cSTRB\u201d), denied the application of relator-appellee, Jason Menz, for disability-retirement benefits because, it asserts, he did not meet the criteria for permanent disability. Menz filed an action in mandamus in the Tenth District, and that court held that STRB had abused its discretion because both the treating physician and the independent physician had acknowledged that Menz had a condition that would prevent his return to work for at least a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">{\u00b6 2} The only statutory criterion for an award of disability under the State Teachers Retirement System is that the applicant is \u201cmentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of duty by a disabling condition, either permanent or presumed to be permanent for twelve continuous months following the filing of an application.\u201d R.C. 3307.62(C). Menz\u2019s treating physician specifically reported that Menz met this statutory requirement. Despite some unfavorable comments and despite his recommendation that benefits be denied, the independent medical examiner also found that Menz qualified for benefits under R.C. 3307.62(C), i.e., he found that Menz would not be able to return to work for at least 12 months due to his medical condition. The explicit reasons given by the independent examiner for recommending that benefits be denied were that granting them can be counterproductive in the management of chronic pain and that there was no objectively measurable neurological cause for the headaches. These factors are not relevant to a determination that an applicant is eligible for benefits under R.C. 3307.62(C). The court of appeals was therefore correct that STRB abused its discretion in denying Menz disability benefits, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Disability under the State Teachers Retirement System</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">{\u00b6 3} Under the statutes governing disability retirement, members of the State Teachers Retirement System who can demonstrate that they are unable to perform their duties for at least 12 months because of a physical or mental condition are entitled to disability benefits. R.C. 3307.62(C). Once an application for benefits is submitted, an independent medical examiner will evaluate the applicant and prepare a report for STRB. <em>Id. </em>If the independent examiner determines that the applicant is disabled and STRB agrees, STRB will grant the application. Ohio Adm.Code 3307:1-7-02(A)(3). If, on the other hand, the independent examiner finds that the applicant is not disabled, the application and records will be reviewed by three independent physicians on a medical review board designated by STRB. R.C. 3307.62(E); Ohio Adm.Code 3307:1-7-01(F) and 3307:1-7-02. If the medical review board recommends denial, and STRB votes to deny disability, the applicant may appeal, and a hearing will be conducted upon the applicant\u2019s request. R.C. 3307.62(F); Ohio Adm.Code 3307:1-7-06(B). The applicant may appear with an attorney, Ohio Adm.Code 3307:1-7-06(B)(3)(b), and STRB will review the application and evidence, Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Adm.Code 3307:1-7-05(B). STRB may require the medical review board to participate in the evaluation of the evidence and make a recommendation. Ohio Adm.Code 3307:1-7-05(B)(5)(e). STRB will then affirm, reverse, or modify its prior action. Ohio Adm.Code 3307:1-7-05(B)(5)(f)-Jasom Menz\u2019s application</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">{\u00b6 4} Jason Menz was employed as an elementary-school principal in Cortland, Ohio. During the 2010-2011 school year, he was absent 132 days due to personal illness. On March 10, 2011, Menz\u2019s administrative contract was not renewed, effective as of the end of the 2010-2011 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">{\u00b6 5} Menz applied for disability benefits on May 27, 2011; he stated in the application that his disability is debilitating migraine headaches. His application included a May 6, 2011 report from Menz\u2019s doctor, Robert G. Kaniecki, M.D. Kaniecki is Director of the Headache Center and Assistant Professor of Neurology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Kaniecki had been treating Menz since late 2009 and diagnosed him with chronic migraine. His report stated that Menz\u2019s major symptoms included unilateral and bilateral headaches, throbbing pain, and nausea. Physical signs include vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and fatigue. The report stated that Menz had 20 headache days per month, 10 severe and 5 incapacitating. The report also stated that Menz had taken medical leave to begin a more aggressive therapeutic program. The program was apparently unsuccessful and Menz continued to experience headaches. He approached Kaniecki about the possibility of applying for disability benefits, and Kaniecki concluded that Menz</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">is presently unable to perform his job as an elementary school principal. His migraine condition is expected to last at least an additional several years * * * and given the refractory nature of his headaches over the past 18 months, it is my expectation that he will continue to suffer intermittent disability from protracted migraine episodes. Since the definition of \u201cpermanent\u201d disability is listed as a condition extending beyond one year, I would certify him as permanently disabled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">{\u00b6 6} Albert L. Berarducci Jr., M.D., a neurologist, performed an independent medical examination on behalf of STRB in August 2011. In his report he noted that Menz had seen several neurologists. He described the history of Menz\u2019s headaches, which started when Menz was a child, abated somewhat in his teenage years, and began again in his twenties. The profile indicated that one-third of all his headaches are \u201cmaximal,\u201d that the aching is sharp and throbbing, and that he often wakes up with a headache at peak intensity. Berarducci noted that Menz\u2019s sleep quality is fair to poor and that he has a headache on awakening almost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>every morning. He also noted that \u201cdespite his debilitating headache\u201d Menz is able to exercise every day.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">{\u00b6 7} Berarducci stated that Menz \u201chas chronic daily headache that has been at the current level of severity * * * for the last eight years.\u201d He made numerous statements critical of Menz\u2019s previous treatment, concluding that \u201c[a]ll of these elements [i.e., the psychobehavioral aspects of pain intolerance and the effect of stressors] need deeper and more flexible evaluation, if Mr. Menz is going to reach a self-sustaining, more effective program of headache management at any time in the near future.\u201d After more comments on possible treatments, Berarducci stated that permanent-disability retirement for Menz would be counterproductive, \u201cas it only frees him from the stresses and pressures of his job while not actually treating the underlying problem. This headache syndrome could flower again in the future when [Menz is] faced by different stressors * * He also stated that \u201c[fjrom a purely neurological perspective, I do not think that Mr. Menz should be declared permanently disabled from teaching.\u201d However, he stated that Menz\u2019s \u201cheadache as currently described is sufficiently disabling that he likely will not tolerate an immediate return to his previous occupation without additional instruction in a different philosophy of headache pain management.\u201d Berarducci recommended that a status of temporary disability be recognized so that Menz could find a different treatment protocol. He indicated on the form provided that Menz\u2019s application for permanent-disability retirement should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">STRB requires additional treatment</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">{\u00b6 8} In response to Dr. Berardueci\u2019s report, STRB required Menz to undergo additional treatment for six months before further action would be taken on his application. As suggested by Dr. Berarducci, Menz went to the Diamond Headache Clinic in Chicago. While there, he underwent assessment and treatment, including different medications and other therapies, but still suffered debilitating headaches. His discharge diagnosis was chronic migraine without aura, considered intractable.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">{\u00b6 9} Menz then provided to STRB documentation from the Diamond clinic, as well as an updated report from Dr. Kaniecki. That report stated that Menz continued to report an underlying daily headache with severe headaches 17 days a month and incapacitating headaches 5 days a month. He had shown no significant improvement despite various new treatments and medications since August 2011. Kaniecki concluded that Menz had significant disability and was disabled from his position as school principal and schoolteacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">{\u00b6 10} STRB had Menz return to Dr. Berarducci for another evaluation. Dr. Berarducci received 60 pages of records of Menz\u2019s various treatments. He opined that there was no defined physical cause to explain Menz\u2019s intractable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>headaches. He suggested improved sleep quality would increase psychological resistance to pain and suggested that a reformulation of psychobehavioral diagnoses is necessary. He discussed possible combinations of physical and psycho-behavioral mechanisms that should be pursued. He stated that \u201c[f]rom a neurological perspective Mr. Menz has no measurable cause or reason to be permanently disabled\u201d and that \u201c[h]is inability to work resides only in his assertions [that] he cannot work.\u201d However, he also stated that for Menz, \u201csuccessful headache pain control [may] remain forever elusive,\u201d that \u201cMenz likely will not be returning to work with headache at the levels he describes today,\u201d and that \u201c[t]o that extent, he is \u2018disabled.\u2019 \u201d But Dr. Berarducci stated that he feels that a declaration of permanent disability will \u201cclose off potential for future improvement\u201d because in \u201csome patients\u201d such a declaration makes the situation worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Review by the medical review board</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">{\u00b6 11} Three members of the STRB medical review board reviewed Menz\u2019s application and recommended denial of his disability application. One reviewer recognized that Menz \u201chas a long history of chronic headache dating to age 8\u201d and that the headaches \u201chave become worse over the past decade to the point that he has stopped working.\u201d He speculated that his headache \u201cseems to best fit a chronic pain syndrome.\u201d The reviewer specifically stated that disability \u201ccan often be counterproductive in the management of chronic pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">{\u00b6 12} On September 21, 2012, STRB denied Menz\u2019s application and advised him of his right to appeal. Menz timely appealed and submitted additional medical evidence of his condition. STRB submitted this evidence to Dr. Berarducci for comment. As part of those comments, Dr. Berarducci reiterated that there is no objectively measurable physical origin for Menz\u2019s pain complaints and that Menz\u2019s complaints may be traced to somatoform disorder, a form of mental illness that can cause debilitating pain. He stated that Menz \u201chas not for at least the past 18 months and likely will not return to his previous position in teaching,\u201d that the reasons lie \u201coutside my personal expertise in the specialty of Neurology,\u201d and that Menz is not neurologically disabled, but that \u201che will not return to work in the next 12 months and to that extent he fits the legal definition of \u2018permanent\u2019 disability from teaching.\u201d (Underlining sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">{\u00b6 13} The review board again reviewed the application, generating reports by three physicians. One report again stated that \u201c[disability can often be counterproductive in the management of chronic pain\u201d and \u201ccan often create a barrier to optimal pain management.\u201d A second doctor commented that \u201cI do not believe that Mr. Menz can function on a daily basis as a school teacher,\u201d but suggested a psychiatric evaluation and/or a personal appearance by Menz before a final determination. The third reviewer stated that Dr. Berarducci\u2019s evaluation \u201cis a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>sufficient summary\u201d of the reasons Menz should not be considered for disability retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">{\u00b6 14} On March 14, 2013, STRB voted to deny Menz\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Mandamus case</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">{\u00b6 15} Menz filed an action in mandamus in the court of appeals, and the magistrate assigned to the case concluded that STRB had not abused its discretion in following Dr. Berarducei\u2019s recommendation to deny Menz\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits. 2014-Ohio-2419, 2014 WL 2565708, \u00b6 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">{\u00b6 16} However, the court of appeals, on reviewing the magistrate\u2019s decision and Menz\u2019s objections to that decision, sustained the objections and granted a writ. Specifically, the court of appeals found that both Menz\u2019s treating physician and the independent physician had stated unequivocally that Menz met the legal definition of disability and that therefore STRB had abused its discretion in denying him disability benefits. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19-20, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">{\u00b6 17} STRB appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">{\u00b6 18} A writ of mandamus \u201cis an appropriate remedy by which claimants can obtain relief from an adverse determination concerning disability retirement benefits or other retirement decisions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pontillo v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys. Bd., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 500, 2003-Ohio-2120, 787 N.E.2d 643, \u00b6 23; <em>State ex rel. Moss v. Ohio State Hwy. Patrol Retirement Sys., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 198, 2002-Ohio-5806, 777 N.E.2d 259, \u00b6 6; <em>State ex rel. McMaster v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>69 Ohio St.3d 130,133, 630 N.E.2d 701 (1994). A determination by STRB whether a person is entitled to disability-retirement benefits is reviewable in mandamus to correct an abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 14. An abuse of discretion occurs when a decision is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Menz brought the correct action to challenge the STRB decision denying his application for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">{\u00b6 19} State Teachers Retirement System disability benefits are determined by R.C. 3307.62 and require medical examination by a disinterested physician:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-13\">(C) Medical examination of the member [who has applied for disability] shall be conducted by a competent, disinterested physician or physicians selected by the board <em>to determine whether the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of duty by a disabling condition, either permanent or presumed to be permanent for twelve continuous months following the filing of an application. </em>The disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>must have occurred since last becoming a member, or it must have increased since last becoming a member to such an extent as to make the disability permanent or presumably permanent for twelve continuous months following the filing of an application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">(Emphasis added.) In other words, the independent physician\u2019s charge is to determine if the applicant meets the statutory criteria for permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">{\u00b6 20} Simply put, the statute requires the independent physician to determine whether the applicant is mentally or physically incapacitated for work by a disabling condition for 12 continuous months after filing the application. The statute does not require the physician to identify a physical or psychological cause for the disability, to prescribe treatment or pass judgment on treatments already received, or to determine the effect that a declaration of disability might have on the applicant\u2019s prospects for recovery. Any comment by the doctor regarding cause, past treatment, or possible future treatment or outcome is relevant only as it pertains to whether the disability actually exists, whether it disables the member from working, and whether the condition will last 12 months or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">{\u00b6 21} To be sure, STRB may require a benefit recipient to agree in writing to treatment recommended by the board\u2019s physician and to submit records regarding the treatment. Failing to do so can result in suspension or termination of the benefit. R.C. 3307.62(G). However, those requirements apply only to a disability benefit <em>recipient, </em>not to an applicant who has not yet received any benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">{\u00b6 22} Here, both Menz\u2019s physician, Dr. Kaniecki, and STRB\u2019s independent physician, Dr. Berarducci, found that Menz had a disability that prevented him from working as a school principal for at least 12 months. In the report submitted with Menz\u2019s application, Dr. Kaniecki concluded that Menz \u201cis presently unable to perform his job as an elementary school principal. His migraine condition is expected to last at least an additional several years * * * [and] it is my expectation that he will continue to suffer intermittent disability from protracted migraine episodes.\u201d In a later report he opined that Menz was disabled from his position of school principal and schoolteacher and that his condition had shown no improvement despite various new treatments and medications since August 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">{\u00b623} Dr. Berarducci stated in his first report that Menz\u2019s \u201cheadache as currently described is sufficiently disabling that he likely will not tolerate an immediate return to his previous occupation without additional instruction in a different philosophy of headache pain management.\u201d Berarducci recommended that benefits for temporary disability be considered so that Menz could find a different treatment protocol. In his second report, Dr. Berarducci found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Menz \u201clikely will not be returning to work with headache at the levels he describes today. To that extent he is \u2018disabled.\u2019 \u201d He further found that for Menz, \u201csuccessful headache pain control [may] remain forever elusive.\u201d He recommended that disability benefits be denied because it might interfere with successful treatment, not because the headache condition does not exist or because it does not prevent Menz from working. In his third report, Dr. Berarducci made the unequivocal statement that Menz \u201cwill not return to work in the next 12 months and to that extent he fits the legal definition of \u2018permanent\u2019 disability from teaching.\u201d (Underlining sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">{\u00b6 24} In other words, despite his discussions of Menz\u2019s past treatments, possible future treatments, the cause of his condition, and the effect a grant of disability might have on recovery, the independent examiner for STRB clearly and unequivocally concluded that Menz was sufficiently disabled by his headaches that he would not be able to return to work for at least 12 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">{\u00b6 25} The reports of the physicians comprising the medical review panel in this case, along with memos and correspondence between them, revealed a similar focus on the cause of Menz\u2019s symptoms, the lack of objective findings, recommendations for new therapies, and the barriers to recovery posed by disability retirement, none of which are relevant factors under R.C. 3307.62(C). There seems to be a consensus that Menz suffers from severe chronic headaches, but none of the reports addressed whether that condition prevents him from returning to work within the next 12 months, the only relevant criterion. Whether granting disability might be counterproductive to treatment is not mentioned in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">{\u00b6 26} Thus, contrary to STRB\u2019s first proposition of law, STRB\u2019s decision was not based on \u201csome evidence\u201d that Menz lacked a disability as described in the statute; rather, it was based on the medical reports that recommended denial of benefits for reasons that cannot support denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">{\u00b6 27} STRB contends that Dr. Berarducci\u2019s report conflicted with that of Dr. Kaniecki and that STRB has the discretion to consider conflicting reports and choose which one to believe. But the two physicians\u2019 reports were not conflicting on the only point that mattered: Menz met the criterion for disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">{\u00b6 28} Nor does <em>State ex rel. VanCleave v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 261, 2008-Ohio-5377, 898 N.E.2d 33, cited by STRB, require a different result. STRB cites <em>VanCleave </em>for the proposition that even for conditions that often lack objective findings, such as migraines, subjective complaints are not conclusive of disability, and objective evidence is still relevant to a determination of the severity of the condition. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">{\u00b629} However, <em>VanCleave </em>is distinguishable. The applicant in <em>VanCleave </em>attacked the independent physician\u2019s report because, in her view, it discounted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>her claim of fibromyalgia for an improper reason: lack of objective medical evidence. Our statement in that case about objective evidence and subjective complaints was meant to convey the notion that it is not always an abuse of discretion to deny benefits based on a report that emphasizes the lack of objective support for the claimed condition. We did not intend to say that subjective conditions can never be the basis for awarding benefits. In any event, Dr. Berarducci did not dismiss Menz\u2019s complaints as unfounded due to lack of objective support. Despite his skeptical and judgmental language, Dr. Berarducci acknowledged, that Menz suffered from a pain condition so severe that he could not return to work as a school principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">{\u00b6 30} Similarly, <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. State Teachers Retirement Bd. of Ohio, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 324, 2009-Ohio-591, 904 N.E.2d 506, \u00b6 25, is also distinguishable. There, we affirmed the denial of disability benefits despite the applicant\u2019s claim that the independent medical examiner had improperly dismissed her chronic fatigue syndrome for lack of objective evidence. Again, no such dismissal occurred here. Dr. Berarducci recommends denial not because he does not believe that Menz has debilitating headaches, but because he thinks awarding disability will affect Menz\u2019s <em>treatment </em>for his debilitating headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">{\u00b6 31} In its second proposition of law, STRB argues that Dr. Berarducci\u2019s report constituted \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the denial of benefits and that a court cannot reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for the board\u2019s. <em>See State ex rel. Kolcinko v. Ohio Police &amp; Fire Pension Fund, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 111, 2012-Ohio-46, 961 N.E.2d 178, \u00b6 2 (an abuse of discretion occurs when the board enters an order that is not supported by \u201csome evidence\u201d). But the court of appeals did not \u201creweigh\u201d the evidence in concluding that STRB abused its discretion. The court of appeals did not weigh the evidence at all. It did not compare the credibility or persuasiveness of the reports. It simply viewed the evidence in light of the statute and came to a conclusion that is objectively demonstrable: the examining physicians agreed that Menz met the statutory requirements for benefits. STRB should have granted the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">{\u00b6 32} The only statutory criterion for an award of disability-retirement benefits under the relevant statute is that the applicant is \u201cmentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of duty by a disabling condition, either permanent or presumed to be permanent for twelve continuous months following the filing of an application.\u201d R.C. 3307.62(C). In this case, Menz\u2019s treating physician and the independent medical examiner both explicitly acknowledged that Menz suffers from chronic migraines debilitating enough to prevent him working as a school principal for at least 12 months. None of the reports of the members of the medical review board addressed this criterion in recommending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>denial of benefits. Their reasons for denying disability are limited to conclusory agreement with Dr. Berarducci\u2019s recommendation of denial, the lack of a diagnosed cause for the headaches, and the possibility that disability benefits will jeopardize the success of possible future treatments; these are not criteria in the statute that would permit STRB to deny Menz disability benefits for his condition.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AUd\">Deitz Law Office, L.L.C., and James M.
