McIntyre, </em>Summit C.P. No. CR-91-01-0135. He also seeks writs of prohibition for the purported purpose of curing a number of alleged errors in the criminal proceedings. Respondents, the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, Judge Mary F. Spicer (retired), and Judge Thomas A. Teodosio (collectively \u201cthe county\u201d) have filed a motion to dismiss based on res judicata.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We deny the county\u2019s motion, deny McIntyre\u2019s motion for oral argument, grant a peremptory writ of mandamus, and dismiss the petition for writs of prohibition as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">{\u00b62} In February and July 1991, McIntyre was indicted on two counts of felonious assault and one count of aggravated burglary, plus specifications. Before trial, the trial court granted an oral motion to amend one of the felonious-assault counts to add a second victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">{\u00b6 3} The jury convicted McIntyre of aggravated burglary and one count of felonious assault. The jury was unable to reach a verdict as to the amended felonious-assault count.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court issued a sentencing entry on September 9, 1991. That entry did not dispose of the amended felonious-assault charge on which the jury had failed to reach a verdict. The entry also failed to address two new indictments that had been added to the case and were pending at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">{\u00b6 5} The state later indicted McIntyre on two new charges, again under the same case number. On May 22, 1992, the trial court issued a sentencing entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>memorializing a plea deal involving the four posttrial indictments. Once again, however, the entry failed to address the unresolved felonious-assault charge from the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 6} Finally, on June 28, 2012, Judge Teodosio signed an entry dismissing the felonious-assault charge as well as a related firearm specification. However, the court\u2019s order dismissed the felonious-assault charge <em>as indicted, </em>without disposing of the charge as amended before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">\n<em>Legal analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">{\u00b6 7} Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss argues that res judicata applies to all of McIntyre\u2019s claims. However, res judicata cannot apply if the trial court never issued a final, appealable order. <em>See State v. Griffin, </em>138 Ohio St.3d 108, 2013-Ohio-5481, 4 N.E.3d 989, \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">{\u00b6 8} A final, appealable order in a criminal case under Crim.R. 32(C) must contain four elements: (1) the fact of the conviction, (2) the sentence, (3) the judge\u2019s signature, and (4) a time stamp from the clerk of courts. <em>State v. Lester, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 303, 2011-Ohio-5204, 958 N.E.2d 142, paragraph one of the syllabus. Only one document can constitute a final, appealable order. <em>State v. Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">{\u00b6 9} None of the documents in this case is a final, appealable order. The September 9, 1991 sentencing entry did not dispose of the felonious-assault charge, nor did it address the two new indictments that were pending at the time under the same case number. Likewise, the May 22, 1992 entry memorializing the plea bargain failed to reference the earlier verdicts and also left the felonious-assault charge unresolved. And finally, Judge Teodosio\u2019s June 28, 2012 order dismissing the felonious-assault charge did not recount the prior dispositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">{\u00b6 10} In order to fashion a final, appealable order, then, one would have to consult at least three separate documents in violation of the <em>Baker </em>one-document rule. Moreover, at least one claim, the felonious-assault charge that was amended to add a second victim, has never been addressed in any court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">{\u00b6 11} For this reason, we deny respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss and issue a peremptory writ pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 12.04(C) directing the county to issue a final, appealable order disposing of all the charges against McIntyre. Given this disposition, we hold that McIntyre\u2019s petition for writs of prohibition is premature, and we dismiss the request on that basis. Finally, we conclude that it is unnecessary to hear oral argument, and we deny McIntyre\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">Motions denied, petition for writs of prohibition dismissed, and writ of mandamus granted.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A05\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Stephen P.
