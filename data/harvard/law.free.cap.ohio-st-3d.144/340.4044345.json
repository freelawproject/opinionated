The warden filed a motion to dismiss and for summary judgment on July 31, 2014, but on the same day, the court of appeals dismissed the petition sua sponte for failure to comply with the requirement of R.C. 2725.04(D) that he file a copy of his commitment papers with his petition. Holloman appealed to this court on September 9, 2014. He was subsequently released from prison under supervision on September 20, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c \u2018 \u201cIf a habeas corpus petitioner seeking release is subsequently released, the petitioner\u2019s habeas corpus claim is normally rendered moot.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel.
