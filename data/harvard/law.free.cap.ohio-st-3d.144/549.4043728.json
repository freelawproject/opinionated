Appellee Franklin County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) approved a reduction in the auditor\u2019s original valuation based upon unspecified sales-comparison and income approaches, neither of which is part of the record. The Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) affirmed the reduction, and appellant, the Columbus City Schools Board of Education (\u201cBOE\u201d), has appealed. The BOE argues that the BTA should not have affirmed the reduced valuation when the evidence for the reduction is not in the record. Because this argument was not advanced before the BTA, we find that it was waived. We therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">{\u00b6 2} On March 31, 2011, Donald Beck filed complaints against the auditor\u2019s tax-year-2010 valuations of three parcels of residential property (one on Tulsa Drive, one on Kingshill Drive, and one on Norma Road), each improved with side-by-side two-family houses, which Beck for the most part rents out to paying tenants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Franklin County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) held a hearing on May 23, 2013, at which Beck testified and offered his comparable-sales evidence as to each of the properties. In each case, the BOE filed a counter-complaint and its counsel appeared at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"AE_\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\n<em>The Tulsa Drive property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">{\u00b6 3} The auditor valued the property on Tulsa Drive at $153,700, and Beck sought a reduction to $81,066. Beck\u2019s evidence consisted of his testimony regarding the rent he received from the units in 2010 and three printouts meant to establish recent home sales in the vicinity. He testified that one side of his unit rented for $675 and the other for $600. The three printouts that were meant to establish comparables were given to Beck by a real-estate agent and were printed from a real-estate listing-service website. The printouts showed sales of three nearby properties. One sold for $74,200 in November 2009, and the comments on the printout indicated \u201cTLC needed.\u201d A second sold for $90,000 in July 2007, and the printout noted that one unit had fire damage and that the property was sold \u201cas is.\u201d A third sold in December 2009 for $79,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 4} Beck admitted on cross-examination that he judged comparability solely from the exterior of the properties and that he had no knowledge of the circumstances of the sales or whether they were arm\u2019s-length sales. Based on Beck\u2019s admissions, the BOE urged that little weight be accorded to the comparables.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">\n<em>The Kingshill Drive property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 5} The auditor valued the Kingshill Drive property at $153,700, and Beck sought a reduction to $81,066 (the valuation and requested reduction were the same as for the Tulsa Drive property). Beck testified as to occupancy and rent: in 2010, one side rented for $600, the other side for $700 (because it has an additional bedroom). This property is located near the Tulsa Drive property, so Beck relied on the same three comparables to support his reduction claim, and the BOE again asserted that little weight should be accorded to the comparables.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">\n<em>The Norma Road property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">{\u00b6 6} The auditor valued the Norma Road property at $149,200, and Beck sought a reduction to $74,666. Beck testified that one side rented for $610 and the other for $625 in 2010. Beck presented a printout from the Franklin County auditor\u2019s website as evidence of a recent sale of a nearby property for $95,000. Also, Beck presented listing entries. One was a bank-owned property that sold in October 2009 for $64,900. Another was a HUD sale in February 2010 for $80,100, and a third sold in December 2009 for $79,000. The BOE again pointed out Beck\u2019s lack of knowledge concerning the arm\u2019s-length character of the sales, and it urged that little weight be accorded to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">\n<em>The opinions of value given by the owmer are actually the opinions of an unidentified real-estate agent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">{\u00b6 7} Beck testified that he consulted with his real-estate agent in coming up with suggested values as to each of the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\n<em>The BOR\u2019s decisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 8} The BOR convened on July 9, 2013, and accepted the auditor\u2019s recommendations for the following reductions: Tulsa Drive \u2014 reduce from $153,700 to $96,000; Kingshill Drive \u2014 reduce from $153,700 to $97,500; Norma Road\u2014 reduce from $149,200 to $101,000. In each case, the reduction was ordered for three years: 2010, 2011, and 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 9} In recommending the new valuations, the auditor\u2019s delegate stated that consideration was given to both \u201cthe sales comparison approach and the income approach,\u201d with each being properly weighted. But no additional evidence was submitted; specifically, no valuation evidence based on a sales-comparison approach or an income approach was introduced by the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">\n<em>The BTA\u2019s decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 10} The BOE appealed to the BTA, which decided the three valuation matters based on the existing record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The BTA convened a hearing, but none of the parties appeared; nor did any party file a brief. Relying on <em>Dublin City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 193, 2013-Ohio-4543, 11 N.E.3d 206, the BTA affirmed the BOR\u2019s reductions. The BTA stated: The BOR \u201ctook into consideration the taxpayer\u2019s evidence, as well as the information available to it, and concluded that an adjustment to value was warranted.\u201d BTA Nos. 2013-4176, 2013-4177, and 2013-4178, 2014 Ohio Tax LEXIS 2295, 4 (Apr. 10, 2014). The BTA determined that the BOE\u2019s arguments for reinstating the auditor\u2019s valuations were insufficient and that the adjustments made by the BOR were supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 11} The BOE appealed the BTA decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Absent argumentation or evidence from a board of education, it is not error FOR THE BTA TO RETAIN A BOARD OF REVISION\u2019S REDUCED VALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">\n<em>The BOE waived its claim of error as appellant when it presented neither argument nor evidence before the BTA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">{\u00b6 12} The BTA relied on the rule set forth in <em>Dublin City Schools, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 193, 2013-Ohio-4543, 11 N.E.3d 206, that \u201cwhen a taxpayer presents evidence contrary to the auditor\u2019s valuation and no evidence is offered to support the auditor\u2019s valuation, the BTA may not simply reinstate the auditor\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Dublin City Schools, </em>\u00b6 17, citing <em>Bedford Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 449, 2007-Ohio-5237, 875 N.E.2d 913, \u00b6 11-12. Here, the taxpayer presented evidence for a reduction, but the BOR neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>adopted the taxpayer\u2019s suggested valuations (which depended on the opinion of a real-estate agent who did not appear before the BOR), nor retained the auditor\u2019s valuations. Instead, the BOR ordered partial reductions, which the BOR indicated were based on \u201cthe sales comparison approach and the income approach,\u201d with each being properly weighted. But neither the BOR\u2019s computation nor the evidence on which it relied was placed into the record. On appeal, the BOE argues under its first and third propositions of law that the BTA was required to set aside the BOR\u2019s reductions because the evidence supporting them was not placed into the record by the BOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 13} But the BOE did not advance this argument, or any other, before the BTA. The only thing that the BOE presented at the BTA was its notices of appeal as to the three properties, indicating its desire that the auditor\u2019s original valuation be reinstated. The BOE contends in its first proposition of law before this court that \u201c[i]f there is no evidence before the BTA from which it can independently determine the true value of the property, the BTA must adopt the county auditor\u2019s original appraised value of the property.\u201d The BOE implies that this proposition of law is an overriding legal principle that the BTA must apply sua sponte. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cGenerally, a party waives the right to appeal an issue that could have been but was not raised in earlier proceedings. * * * This principle has been applied in appeals from administrative agencies.\u201d <em>MacConnell v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 04AP-433, 2005-Ohio-1960, 2005 WL 995590, \u00b6 21 (when license applicant failed to object to evidentiary defects before the administrative tribunal, those defects could not be asserted as grounds for appeal). This principle has been applied to board-of-revision proceedings that come before this court on appeal from the BTA. <em>See LTC Properties, Inc. v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 111, 2012-Ohio-3930, 976 N.E.2d 852, \u00b6 6, fn. 1; <em>Plain Local Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 230, 2011-Ohio-3362, 957 N.E.2d 268, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 15} Because the BOE did not advance its argument for setting aside the BOR\u2019s reductions at the BTA, we find that it was not error for the BTA to retain the BOR\u2019s reduced valuations.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">\n<em>The BOE\u2019s claim that the BTA failed to make specific findings of fact in this case is not well taken</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">{\u00b6 16} Under its second proposition of law, the BOE contends that the BTA must \u201cdetermine the facts upon which the true value of the property must be based\u201d and \u201cset forth the relevant facts in its decision.\u201d We have rejected a similar argument in another context. <em>Columbus City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>144 Ohio St.3d 324, 2015-Ohio-3633, 43 N.E.3d 387, \u00b6 22-24. In that case, the BTA relied on the only appraisal presented and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>said so. We found no legal requirement that the BTA set forth its findings more fully under the circumstances. Here the BTA stated the rationale for its decision, and it did so in the context of receiving no argumentation or evidence from the BOE in opposition to the BOR\u2019s determination. We hold that under these circumstances, the BTA was justified in rendering its decision without offering any further explanation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ApLV\">Rich &amp; Gillis Law Group, L.L.C., and Mark Gillis, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 17} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b637-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-14\">.
