Therefore, the judge barred Wolpert from appearing in his courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">{\u00b6 4} The Code of Judicial Conduct, however, sets forth the appropriate channels through which a judge may initiate corrective action regarding an attorney who the judge believes has a mental impairment or is unfit to practice law. Specifically, Jud.Cond.R. 2.14(A) provides that if a judge reasonably believes that the performance of a lawyer is impaired \u201cby a mental, emotional, or physical condition,\u201d the judge \u201cshall take appropriate action, which may include a confidential referral to a lawyer or judicial assistance program.\u201d Similarly, Jud.Cond.R. 2.15(B) provides that if a judge knows that a lawyer has committed a violation of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a question regarding the lawyer\u2019s \u201chonesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects,\u201d the judge \u201cshall inform\u201d the appropriate disciplinary authority. Barring an attorney from practicing in a judge\u2019s courtroom is not an appropriate substitute for either referring the attorney to an assistance program or initiating the bar-complaint process.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">{\u00b6 5} Moreover, a trial court\u2019s blanket ban on an attorney\u2019s practicing before the court generally violates this court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over attorney-disciplinary matters. <em>See </em>Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 2(B)(1)(g); <em>Melting v. Stralka, </em>12 Ohio St.3d 105, 465 N.E.2d 857 (1984). \u201cTo permit each of the trial and appellate courts to establish rules that generally limit the ability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>attorneys to practice their profession, or that impose specific disciplinary standards upon the attorneys of this state, certainly would frustrate the purpose behind the Supreme Court\u2019s constitutionally authorized governance of the bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107; <em>see also State ex rel. Buck v. Maloney, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 250, 2004-Ohio-2590, 809 N.E.2d 20, \u00b6 11 (a probate court judge lacks authority to bar an attorney from practicing law in all future cases before the probate court); <em>Catholic Social Servs. of Cuyahoga Cty. v. Howard, </em>106 Ohio App.3d 615, 620, 666 N.E.2d 658 (8th Dist.1995) (a trial court\u2019s order barring an attorney from practicing law before the court \u201cconflicts with the exclusive power of the Supreme Court of Ohio to govern the practice of law\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Stokes, </em>49 Ohio App.3d 136, 551 N.E.2d 220 (8th Dist.1989) (a court\u2019s order imposing a continuing restriction on an attorney\u2019s ability to practice in that court is the \u201ctype of usurpation of jurisdiction by an inferior court which necessitates relief in prohibition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">{\u00b6 6} Notwithstanding Judge Gaul\u2019s troubling conduct, however, Wolpert\u2019s affidavit must be dismissed. Under R.C. 2701.03(A), an affidavit to disqualify a judge may be filed by \u201cany party to the proceeding or the party\u2019s counsel.\u201d As explained in previous disqualification matters, \u201cthe chief justice has strictly enforced this statutory requirement and consistently found that individuals who do not qualify as a \u2018party\u2019 or \u2018party\u2019s counsel\u2019 do not have standing to file an affidavit of disqualification.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Grendell, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 1220, 2013-Ohio-5243, 999 N.E.2d 681, \u00b6 2; <em>In re Disqualification of Cleary, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1225, 657 N.E.2d 1337 (1990). Here, Judge Gaul removed Wolpert as counsel in the underlying case and assigned the public defender\u2019s office to represent defendant. Because Wolpert is no longer counsel in the case, he is not one of the persons who may file an affidavit of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">{\u00b6 7} Accordingly, although Wolpert may have other remedies for his legal claims, he lacks standing to file an affidavit of disqualification under R.C. 2701.03. The affidavit is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
