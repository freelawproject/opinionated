We grant the writ against the board of elections and its members but not against Husted.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">{\u00b6 2} The \u201cCommunity Bill of Rights\u201d is a proposed amendment to the city charter of Youngstown. The measure would, among other things, make it unlawful to engage in the extraction of oil and gas in the city of Youngstown through the use of hydrofracturing, Section 122 \u2014 3(A); declare void any federal or state license that would violate the charter, Section 122 \u2014 3(D); make violations a first-degree misdemeanor, Section 122 \u2014 3(E); and create a civil cause of action for damages to be brought \u201cin the name of the natural community or ecosystems,\u201d Section 122-3(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">{\u00b6 3} On August 3, 2015, proponents of the Community Bill of Rights presented the amendment to the Youngstown City Council. The petitions had sufficient valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. On August 24, 2015, the Youngstown City Council passed ordinance No. 15-283, directing that the proposal be sent to the Mahoning County Board of Elections for placement on the November ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">{\u00b6 4} The board considered the charter amendment at its meeting on August 26, 2015. During that discussion, board members expressed the opinion that the proposed amendment was unconstitutional. Member Betras referred to this court\u2019s decision in <em>State ex rel. Morrison v. Beck Energy Corp., </em>143 Ohio St.3d 271, 2015-Ohio-485, 37 N.E.3d 128, \u00b6 34, and announced to the other members, \u201cI will not allow the people of the City of Youngstown to vote on a measure that is clearly and unambiguously] unconstitutional.\u201d Chairman Munroe agreed that \u201cin light of the Beck Energy case, * * * [the amendment is] unenforceable, and it conflicts with the Ohio Constitution.\u201d Member Winbush stated that the amendment was \u201cunenforceable because state law supersedes local law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">{\u00b6 5} Member Betras made a motion that the board \u201cnot certify the Community Bill of Rights to the ballot because it\u2019s an unconstitutional law.\u201d The motion carried by a four-to-zero vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">\n<em>Procedural history</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">{\u00b6 6} On August 28, 2015, the city of Youngstown commenced this mandamus action against the board of elections, its individual members, and Secretary of State Husted. The parties filed evidence and briefs in accordance with the court\u2019s scheduling order. In addition, the court received amicus briefs in support of the board of elections from (1) the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, Affiliated Construction Trades of Ohio, and the American Petroleum Institute, (2) the Youngstown/Warren Regional Chamber, and (3) the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, the Ohio Gas Association, and 17 local unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>{\u00b6 7} On September 2, 2015, the city filed an unopposed motion to correct a clerical error in the complaint. We grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\n<em>Legal analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">{\u00b6 8} A board of elections has statutory authority to \u201c[r]eview, examine, and certify the sufficiency and validity of petitions.\u201d R.C. 3501.11(K). A board of elections has greater discretion to inquire into the sufficiency of a proposed ballot measure than municipal officials do. <em>State ex rel. N. Main St. Coalition v. Webb, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 437, 2005-Ohio-5009, 835 N.E.2d 1222, \u00b6 30. Unlike municipal officials, the boards of elections have statutory authority to conduct quasi-judicial protest hearings. Id.; R.C. 3501.39(A)(2); <em>State ex rel. Ebersole v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>140 Ohio St.3d 487, 2014-Ohio-4077, 20 N.E.3d 678, \u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 3501.11(K) empowers a board of elections to determine whether a ballot measure falls within the scope of the constitutional power of referendum or initiative. For example, the right of referendum does not exist with respect to a measure approved by a city council acting in an administrative, rather than legislative, capacity. <em>Buckeye Comm. Hope Found, v. Cuyahoga Falls, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 539, 697 N.E.2d 181 (1998), paragraph two of the syllabus. Because a referendum on an administrative matter is a legal nullity, boards of elections have not only discretion but an affirmative duty to keep such items off the ballot. <em>State ex rel. Ebersole, </em>\u00b6 30. It necessarily follows that the boards of elections have discretion to determine which actions are administrative and which are legislative.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">{\u00b6 10} Likewise, a board of elections has discretion to determine whether a proposed ballot measure satisfies statutory prerequisites to be a ballot measure. <em>State ex rel. Choices for South-Western City Schools v. Anthony, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-5362, 840 N.E.2d 582, \u00b6 39, 50-55 (petition to repeal a levy exceeded statutory authority, which authorized ballot measures only to decrease levies).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">{\u00b6 11} The boards of elections, however, do <em>not </em>have authority to sit as arbiters of the legality or constitutionality of a ballot measure\u2019s substantive terms. An unconstitutional amendment may be a proper item for referendum or initiative. Such an amendment becomes void and unenforceable only when declared unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any other conclusion would authorize a board of elections to adjudicate a constitutional question and require this court to affirm its decision even if the court disagreed with the board\u2019s conclusion on the underlying constitutional question, so long as the board had not abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">{\u00b6 12} The record plainly demonstrates that the board rejected ordinance No. 15-283 <em>solely </em>because it considered the measure to be unconstitutional in its effects. In making that determination, the board exceeded its statutory authority and therefore abused its discretion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AHS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Martin S.

Any relief against him would therefore be premature, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\n<em>Defective affidavit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">{\u00b6 14} The affidavit attached to the complaint attested that the factual allegations were true \u201cto the best of [the affiant\u2019s] knowledge, information, and belief.\u201d Such an affidavit does not comport with S.Ct.Prac.R. 12.02(B). <em>State ex rel. Esarco v. Youngstown City Council, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 131, 2007-Ohio-5699, 876 N.E.2d 953, \u00b6 15-16. However, when made aware of the defect, relator submitted a motion for leave to file an amended complaint and attached, to the amended complaint a new, proper affidavit. Because relator is entitled to an opportunity to cure the defect, and because permitting the amendment will cause no delay or prejudice, we grant the motion. <em>State ex rel. Hackworth v.
