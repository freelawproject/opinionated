Hopkins, a Peabody police officer, filed suit against the defendant, Jorge Medeiros,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for negligence and for wanton and reckless conduct. Hopkins had sustained injuries while attempting to subdue a melee in Peabody. Hopkins claimed that Medeiros owed him a duty because it was foreseeable that police would respond to the dangerous situation created, in part, by Medeiros, even though Medeiros had no direct contact with Hopkins. A Superior Court jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant, with special findings that Medeiros did not owe a duty to Hopkins and that Medeiros did not act in a wanton or reckless manner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, Hopkins argues that the trial judge erred (1) by refusing to instruct the jury about the so-called rescue doctrine; (2) in giving limiting instructions to the jury about, and in restricting examination concerning, Medeiros\u2019s conviction for disorderly conduct; and (3) by giving incomplete jury instructions about the defendant\u2019s violations of law as evidence of negligence. Hopkins also argues that the firefighter\u2019s rule, an exception to the rescue doctrine, does not apply in the Commonwealth to bar his claims. Because Hopkins was entitled to a jury instruction on the rescue doctrine, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">1. <em>Facts. </em>There was testimony at trial to the following effect. On the night of October 27, 1989, Peabody police officers Bonaiuto and Waugh responded to a call to investigate a loud party at a residence in Peabody. As the officers were ticketing illegally parked vehicles, Acacio Pinto and the defendant Medeiros approached the police from the property where the party was being held. Both officers testified that Pinto and Medeiros were shouting obscenities and verbally harassing them. Medeiros in turn testified that he did not say anything. The officers asked Pinto and Medeiros for identification. Medeiros produced his driver\u2019s license, but Pinto refused, continuing the verbal abuse and threatening one of the officers. Pinto violently resisted Bonaiuto\u2019s attempt to arrest him. According to the officers, Medeiros vehemently urged Pinto to resist the arrest and shouted profanities at the police. However, Medeiros testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>left the area at that point. The officers testified that a large crowd numbering over fifty people began to form. Pinto and the two officers struggled and repeatedly slammed against a police cruiser. A group of twelve to fifteen men formed a tight semicircle around Pinto and the officers, grabbing, punching and kicking the officers. According to the officers\u2019 testimony, Medeiros was part of the semicircle. There was no way for the officers to escape without climbing over the car or breaking through the irate crowd. Bonaiuto activated the emergency \u201cofficer needs assistance\u201d button on his radio. Medeiros denied any involvement with the crowd or the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Officer Hopkins was one of the officers to respond to Waugh and Bonaiuto\u2019s call for help. Hopkins positioned himself between the officers and the violent semicircle of men and attempted to subdue the crowd. A shirtless young man with a blue baseball cap threw a can that just missed Hopkins\u2019s head.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hopkins chased him, but abandoned the chase when he felt a sharp, disabling pain in his lower back.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">2. <em>Rescue doctrine instruction. </em>Hopkins argues that the trial judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury about the so-called rescue doctrine, i.e., he did not instruct the jury as requested about normal intervening forces, specifically, how the intervention of rescuers relates to duty and proximate cause. Hopkins submitted a detailed request for jury instructions before the charge and preserved his right to appeal the judge\u2019s refusal to give his requested instructions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge instructed the jury about the basic law of duty and proximate cause, including superseding causes. Neither party argues that the instructions given were erroneous statements of the law, but Hopkins contends that he was entitled to further instructions on the rescue doctrine, and that the absence of those instructions harmed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Hopkins\u2019s theory of the case was that Medeiros owed him a duty of reasonable care because it was foreseeable that police officers, such as Hopkins, would come to restore public order and to rescue Bonaiuto and Waugh from a dangerous situation created, in part, by Medeiros. A corollary to Hopkins\u2019s theory is that there were no intervening events which broke the chain of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>causation from Medeiros\u2019s actions to Hopkins\u2019s injury, including the can thrown by the shirtless man with the blue baseball cap. Hopkins contends that he was entitled to the rescue doctrine instructions based on evidence of Medeiros\u2019s instigation of the melee, his encouragement of Pinto, and his participation in the semicircle of men who entrapped and physically harassed Bonaiuto and Waugh while they sought to arrest Pinto. Medeiros argues that the judge\u2019s instructions on general foreseeability were correct and adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The rescue doctrine has been characterized as follows: \u201cnegligence which creates peril invites rescue and, should the rescuer be hurt in the process, the tortfeasor will be held liable not only to the primary victim, but to the rescuer as well.\u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Geiger, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 365, 369 (1983). Massachusetts recognizes the rescue doctrine in that \u201crescuers are not, as matter of law, precluded from recovery because they voluntarily placed themselves in danger.\u201d <em>Migliori </em>v. <em>Airborne Freight Corp., </em>426 Mass. 629, 636 (1998), citing <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Geiger, supra </em>at 370. See <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Berkshire St. Ry., </em>281 Mass. 47, 49-50 (1932); <em>Burnett </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>299 Mass. 604, 607-608 (1938); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hathaway Bakeries, Inc., </em>312 Mass. 110, 114 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">\u201c \u2018Rescue\u2019 as used in ordinary parlance means \u2018to free from . . . danger.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 364 (1999), quoting from Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary 1930 (1993). \u201cDanger is defined as \u2018the state of being exposed to harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Schwartz, supra. </em>To be considered a rescuer, an individual must engage in a proactive attempt to free another from danger. \u201c[A] claimant\u2019s purpose must be more than investigatory. There must be asserted some specific mission of assistance by which the plight of the imperilled could reasonably be thought to be ameliorated.\u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Geiger, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In addition, such rescue missions must be voluntary. \u201c[[Inclusion within [the class of rescuers] is by virtue of a volunteered action by the putative claimant.\u201d <em>Migliori </em>v. <em>Airborne Freight Corp., </em>426 Mass. at 637. However, the notion of \u201cvoluntary\u201d does not preclude claimants who have arrived at the rescue scene as a result of their employment. In <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine R.R., </em>321 Mass. 586 (1947), the plaintiff\u2019s husband perished while attempting to extinguish a fire in a freight shed on his employer\u2019s property. The plaintiff sued on the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>that the fire had started due to the employer\u2019s negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 588. The defendant employer moved for a directed verdict, arguing that the decedent employee\u2019s effort to put out the fire and not its own negligence was the proximate cause of death. <em>Ibid. </em>In affirming the jury\u2019s verdict for the plaintiff, the court stated that \u201c[t]he deceased was under a duty to protect the property of his employer. That duty was to do what he could ... to rescue his employer\u2019s property and to prevent the spread of the fire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588-589. Therefore, the decedent\u2019s conduct in entering the building did not bar the plaintiff\u2019s recovery as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Hopkins qualifies as a rescuer. Hopkins was present at the melee because of his fellow officers\u2019 emergency call. His employment brought him to the scene where he engaged in proactive attempts to assist the other officers who were faced with a dangerous situation. Hopkins was injured during a rescue attempt and alleges that Medeiros was negligent. Therefore, Hopkins was entitled to the rescue doctrine instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Medeiros contends that he owed Hopkins no duty because, insofar as Hopkins was a professional rescuer, the \u201cfirefighter\u2019s rule,\u201d a widely recognized exception to the rescue doctrine,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> should be adopted and applied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Application of this rule would serve to preclude rescuers such as firefighters and police officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>from \u201cmaintaining a negligence action against a person allegedly responsible for bringing the officer to the scene of a crime, fire, or some other job-related incident of similar exigency where the officer is then injured because of this same person\u2019s alleged negligence.\u201d <em>Day </em>v. <em>Caslowitz, </em>713 A.2d 758, 759 n.1 (R.I. 1998). Based on the testimony at hand, it was Medeiros\u2019s alleged negligent conduct that brought Hopkins, in the course of his police duties, to the scene of the melee in process where Hopkins then sustained an injury. Were we to adopt the firefighter\u2019s rule as Medeiros suggests, Hopkins would be barred from bringing this negligence action against Medeiros.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Historically, both in this Commonwealth and many other jurisdictions, the firefighter\u2019s rule was applied to limit the liability of landowners whose property conditions had resulted in injury to firefighters or police officers entering the premises. <em>Wynn </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>294 Mass. 562, 564 (1936). <em>Aldworth </em>v. <em>F.W. Woolworth Co., </em>295 Mass. 344, 346 (1936). <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Sloan, </em>20 Cal. 3d 199, 202 (1977).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In cases where a firefighter or police officer was injured due to alleged negligence on the part of a landowner, such rescuers were held to be licensees. See <em>Wynn, supra </em>(police officer who fell into elevator well after responding to a disturbance in defendant\u2019s building held to be licensee); <em>Aldworth, supra </em>(firefighter injured in fall from unsafe fire escape held to be licensee); Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 61, at 429 (5th ed. 1984). The underlying rationale was that landowners would otherwise be forced to carry the unreasonable burden of preparing for the infrequent and unforeseeable visits of such rescuers. Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 61, at 432; Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 345 comment c, at 228 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">However, because such rescuers entered under legal authority, Massachusetts and other jurisdictions found it increasingly difficult to categorize firefighters and police officers as licensees. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard, </em>363 Mass. 693 (1973). <em>Krauth </em>v. <em>Geller, </em>31 N.J. 270 (1960).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard, supra, </em>the plaintiff was a police officer who was injured after falling pn ice on the defendant\u2019s premises while serving a summons. Instead of labeling the officer as a licensee or invitee, the court held that all lawful visitors are owed a common duty of reasonable care. <em>Id. </em>at 707. Juries would continue to be guided by the principles \u201cwhich have always governed personal negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708. \u201c[T]he foreseeability of the visitor\u2019s presence and the time, <em>manner, place </em>and surrounding circumstances of his entry remain relevant factors which will determine \u2018in part the likelihood of injury to him, and the extent of the interest which must be sacrificed to avoid the risk of injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708-09, quoting from <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Arbaugh\u2019s Restaurant, Inc., </em>469 F.2d 97, 101 (D.C. Cir. 1972). <em>Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard </em>thus abolished the original foundation of the firefighter\u2019s rule in Massachusetts. See, e.g., <em>England </em>v. Tasker, 129 N.H. 467, 469 (1987) (\u201cThis basis for the [firefighter\u2019s] rule is currently without justification given the modern rejection of the licensee-invitee distinction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In the years since the 1973 decision in <em>Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard, </em>the rule and whatever continuing vitality it might have has not been revisited in Massachusetts. See <em>Griffiths </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>425 Mass. 31, 35 n.13 (1997) (negligence suit against owners of apartment building where police officer killed during drug raid; on result reached, court \u201cneed not discuss\u201d firefighter\u2019s rule). In looking to the decisions of other jurisdictions that have recently readopted the firefighter\u2019s rule or have adopted it for the first time, we see that the doctrine of assumption of risk and/or public policy considerations provide the rationale for the rule. See <em>Kreski </em>v. <em>Modern Wholesale Elec. Supply Co., </em>429 Mich. 347, 360-361 (1987).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The rule is generally justified by the notion that police and firefighters assume the risk of injury when they undertake such employment, which from time to time will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>require that they function as rescuers. In these jurisdictions, the rule serves to immunize the citizen whose ordinary negligence occasioned the presence of the firefighter or police officer. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Mailand, </em>284 N.W.2d 343, 350 (Minn. 1979).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Migdal </em>v. <em>Stamp, </em>132 N.H. 171, 175 (1989). Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 61, at 431.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Primary assumption of risk \u201cinvolves a circumstance where the plaintiff agrees in advance to relieve the defendant of a duty of care owed the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Kreski </em>v. <em>Modern Wholesale Elec. Supply Co., </em>429 Mich, at 362.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[a] fireman assumes, in a primary sense, all risks incident to his firefighting activities.\u201d <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Mailand, </em>284 N.W.2d at 349.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nonetheless, firefighters and police officers only assume those risks which are known or can reasonably be anticipated to arise in the dangerous situations that their employment requires them to encounter. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Vierra, </em>619 A.2d 436, 438 (R.I. 1993).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The public policy justification rests on the rationale that firefighters and police officers are compensated for assuming the risk of injury. Numerous jurisdictions have observed that police and firefighters are paid to confront hazards that require their assistance, are trained at public expense and receive workers\u2019 compensation and disability benefits for their injuries. See <em>Neighbarger </em>v. <em>Irwin Indus., Inc., </em>8 Cal. 4th 532, 546-547 (1994) (rule justified by public nature of firefighter services and relationship with public); <em>Kreski </em>v. <em>Modern Wholesale Elec. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>Supply Co., </em>429 Mich. at 372 (safety officers employed, trained, and paid to confront dangerous situations); <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Canada Contr. Co., </em>232 Va. 177, 184 (1986) (injuries compensable through workers\u2019 compensation).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Other jurisdictions, albeit a minority, have rejected the firefighter\u2019s rule. See <em>Banyai </em>v. <em>Arruda, </em>799 P.2d 441, 443 (Colo. Ct. App. 1990) (rule is unwarranted departure from the general duty to exercise due care for the safety of others); <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>296 Or. 610, 619-620 (1984) (public policy does not justify rule); <em>Mull </em>v. <em>Kerstetter, </em>540 A.2d 951, 954 (Pa. Super. 1988) (rejecting rule\u2019s notion that firefighters assume risk of duty as matter of law; principles of negligence to be applied to firefighter\u2019s claim). Other States have rejected the rule by statute. See Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 112.182 (West 1992) (effective 1990, rule changes status of police and firefighters to invitees and only applies to suits against property owners); Minn. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 604.06 (West Supp. 2000) (effective 1991); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A-62A-21 (West Supp. 1999) (effective 1994). Both the Minnesota and New Jersey statutes overturned their jurisdictions\u2019 common-law firefighter\u2019s rule. The Oregon court in <em>Christenson </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra, </em>provided the following justification for its rejection of the rule: \u201c[b]y denying a public safety officer recovery from a negligent tortfeasor, the officer is not directed to recover his damages from the general public; rather the officer is totally precluded from recovering these damages from anyone. Contrast this with other public employees who are injured when confronting dangers on their jobs. The latter can recover workers\u2019 compensation and salary benefits from the public, but are also allowed additional tort damages from the third-party tortfeasors. Under the \u2018fireman\u2019s rule\u2019 the injured public safety officer must bear a loss which other public employees are not required to bear.\u201d 296 Or. at 620 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Primary assumption of risk and public policy considerations, then, provide the modem foundation for the firefighter\u2019s rule in many jurisdictions. In Massachusetts, however, we must also consider that there are two statutes, enacted after Mounsey, that grant police officers the right to file suit against alleged tortfeasors such as Medeiros. The Legislature has thereby expressly chosen not to immunize such individuals from suits in tort. We think this consideration decisive, and it constrains us to conclude that the firefighter\u2019s rule has no continuing vitality in Mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>sachusetts. To conclude otherwise would contravene legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In Massachusetts, police officers are excluded from the workers\u2019 compensation statutes, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 69, but instead receive injury-related benefits under similar statutes. They receive leave with pay under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, and payment for their medical expenses under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 100. See <em>Eyssi </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>416 Mass. 194, 198 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Sections 100 and 111F of c. 41 expressly permit injured police officers and their municipal employers to recover damages from intentional and negligent tortfeasors, with the injured employee first reimbursing the municipality for its expenses.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The relevant provisions of both \u00a7\u00a7 100 and 111F were passed in 1977, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>thereby filling the gap left by <em>Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard\u2019s </em>1973 abolition of the original rationale for the firefighter\u2019s rule. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 100, 111F. \u201cUnder the second paragraph of \u00a7 111F, an injured party or the municipal employer may recover against a negligent third party who was the cause of the injury to the police officer, the first proceeds of recovery to be applied to whatever the municipality has paid the injured officer.\u201d <em>Gonsalves </em>v. Commonwealth, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 609 (1989). \u201cThe statute [c. 41, \u00a7 111F,] only subrogates the town to the employee\u2019s rights against the tortfeasor to the extent of the compensation the officer receives from the tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Wincek </em>v. <em>West Springfield, </em>399 Mass. 700, 702 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We must give due deference to the underlying legislative intent as expressed by the plain language of the statute. <em>Boswell </em>v. <em>Zephyr Lines, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 241, 247 (1993). Absent explicit statutory language, we cannot construe \u00a7\u00a7 100 and 11 IF as abrogating the common law right of police officers such as Hopkins to pursue a negligence action. \u201cA statute is not to be interpreted as effecting a material change in or a repeal of the common law unless the intent to do so is clearly expressed.\u201d <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Davison Constr. Co., </em>381 Mass. 432, 438 (1980), quoting from <em>Pineo </em>v. <em>White, </em>320 Mass. 487, 491 (1946). See <em>Eyssi </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>416 Mass. at 200 (had Legislature intended the provisions of c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 100 or 111F, to abrogate common law rights of police officer\u2019s spouse or child\u2019s loss of consortium actions, it would have done so explicitly). Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is not our place to extend such immunity where the Legislature has chosen not to do so.\u201d <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Kibrick, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 382, 388 (1981) (police officer whose negligence allegedly injured fellow officer not immune from suit; no comparable provision in c. 41 analogous to immunity of coemployees in c. 152 of workers\u2019 compensation act).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Because Hopkins qualifies as a rescuer, and there is no ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>ception to the rescue doctrine, we turn to the matter of whether Hopkins was harmed by the trial judge\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury concerning the duty owed to a rescuer. We review objections to jury instructions to determine if there was any error, and, if so, whether the error affected the substantial rights of the objecting party. <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Cape Cod </em>v. <em>Weston &amp; Sampson Engrs., Inc., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 120, 123-124 (1998), citing Mass.R.Civ.P. 61, 365 Mass. 828 (1974). In other words, we determine whether or not the error was harmless. See <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 903 (1992), citing Mass.R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The trial judge\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury as requested by Hopkins was not harmless error. The rescue doctrine was directly relevant to whether Medeiros owed Hopkins a duty, the threshold issue in this case. \u201cWhile a judge has significant latitude in framing jury instructions, an objection does he if a significant matter is not dealt with at all.\u201d <em>Comeau </em>v. <em>Currier, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 109, 111-112 (1993). \u201cIt is the duty of the judge ... to give full, fair, correct and clear instructions as to the principles of law governing all the essential issues presented, so that the jury may understand their duty and be enabled to perform it intelligently.\u201d <em>Fein </em>v. <em>Kahan, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 967, 968 (1994), quoting from <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Bryan, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 688, 693 (1992). \u201cEvery possible correct statement of law need not ... be included in jury instructions if the instructions as given are correct and touch on the fundamental elements of the claim.\u201d <em>Kobayashi </em>v. <em>Orion Ventures, Inc., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 492, 503 (1997). But here, the judge\u2019s instructions failed even to mention a key principle of the law governing duty. See <em>Petras </em>v. <em>Storm, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 330, 335-336 (1984) (not harmless error to omit instruction on important principle of law governing negligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Because of their answers to the special questions, we know that the jury\u2019s verdict was based on their decision that Medeiros did not owe a duty to Hopkins. Substantial evidence was presented at trial to warrant instructions concerning the rescue doctrine. Given this evidence, the judge should not have left the jury uninformed as to the law concerning the duty owed to a rescuer. See <em>Comeau </em>v. <em>Currier, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 112 (defendants\u2019 testimony provided jury with substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>of provocation to mitigate damages; omission of provocation instruction could not be considered harmless error); <em>Petras </em>v. <em>Storm, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. at 335 (sufficient evidence for jury to find defendant was under the influence before causing accident; not harmless error for trial judge to refuse to give instruction guiding jury as to legal consequences of such a finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\u201cThe primary purpose of instructions to a jury is to assist them in the discharge of their responsibility for finding the facts in issue and then in applying to the facts found the applicable rules of law to enable them to render a proper verdict.\u201d <em>Pfeiffer </em>v. <em>Salas, </em>360 Mass. 93, 100 (1971). Here, the jury did not have the benefit of the applicable law before them. Therefore, the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury on the duty owed to a rescuer was not harmless error, and a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">3. <em>Prior conviction. </em>As a result of Medeiros\u2019s conduct on the night of October 27, 1989, Medeiros was charged with disorderly conduct in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, and he admitted to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty. Hopkins argues that the trial judge erred in failing to allow the conviction in evidence as the functional equivalent of a guilty plea, and that he is entitled to a new trial on this basis. We discuss the issue because it may arise at a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">After Officer Bonaiuto testified that he charged Medeiros with disorderly conduct, Hopkins put in evidence a certified copy of the conviction, which indicated that Medeiros admitted to sufficient facts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The judge then instructed the jury that an admission to sufficient facts is not the same as a guilty plea and suggested reasons why a criminal defendant might admit to sufficient facts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Hopkins objected, arguing that pleading to sufficient facts is the functional equivalent of pleading guilty, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>that the judge\u2019s instructions unfairly minimized the significance of Medeiros\u2019s conviction. Later in the trial, Hopkins cross-examined Medeiros about his actions on the night of October 29. The judge restricted Hopkins\u2019s questioning about Medeiros\u2019s colloquy with the judge when he admitted to sufficient facts, but allowed cross-examination about Medeiros\u2019s deposition testimony that he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct. Hopkins again objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">\u201cAn admission to sufficient facts may be introduced against the defendant in a subsequently litigated civil suit arising out of the same incident on the theory that the proceeding was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea, with the same degree of finality.\u201d Flannery, Saris, Sosman, &amp; Carney, Massachusetts Evidence: A Courtroom Reference \u00a7 3.5.1(b) (MCLE 1999), citing to <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Allard, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 511 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>420 Mass. 739 (1995). The evidence of Medeiros\u2019s admission to sufficient facts was admissible as an admission of a party opponent. As with a guilty plea, because an admission to sufficient facts is evidentiary, and not conclusive as to the facts admitted, the defendant may be questioned about the reasons he entered it. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Niziolek, </em>395 Mass. 737, 747 (1985). <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Southland Corp., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 287, 293-96 (1992), <em>S.C., </em>416 Mass. 62, 70-72 (1993). The trial judge\u2019s handling of the conviction, particularly the contemporaneous limiting instructions which minimized the conviction and the significant restrictions he placed on questioning the defendant about it, was not satisfactory and should not be replicated at any new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">4. <em>Instruction on violation of statute as evidence of negligence. </em>When the evidence of Medeiros\u2019s conviction was admitted, the judge read to the jury the statutory definition of disorderly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>conduct, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, the only statute discussed at trial. Both parties agree that the final jury instructions correctly stated the general rule that a violation of a statute is evidence of negligence on the part of the violator as to all the consequences the statute was intended to prevent. See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Medeiros, 369 </em>Mass. 836, 841 (1976); <em>Resendes </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 344 (1995). However, Hopkins requested that the judge instruct the jury in his final instructions on the content or purpose of statutes at issue, and now argues that the judge erred in failing to do so.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We address this issue because it, too, may arise at retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\u201cA judge is under no obligation to charge the jury in the specific language requested by a party, so long as the charge is complete and correct in its essentials.\u201d <em>Drivas </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 750, 754 (1987), citing <em>Van Dyke </em>v. <em>Bixby, </em>388 Mass. 663, 670 (1983). Considering that the final instructions were not inaccurate, and that the trial judge read the definition of disorderly conduct when the evidence was admitted, the instructions were complete and correct. The jury were thus able to \u201cunderstand their duty . . . and perform it intelligently.\u201d <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), </em>427 Mass. 1, 14 (1998), quoting <em>from Maxwell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Title Ins. Co., </em>206 Mass. 197, 200 (1910). Since there was no evidence on the point at trial, moreover, the judge did not err in declining to give instructions on aiding or assisting a prisoner attempting to escape from the lawful custody of a police officer. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">\n<em>Requested Jury Instructions'.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">\u201c2A. The defendant is liable for an invasion of an interest of another, if the conduct of the actor is negligent with respect to the other, or a class of persons within which he is included.

To this extent the fact that the actor\u2019s conduct is negligent towards the third person makes it negligent also to others who are in that person\u2019s vicinity, although, but for its tendency to imperil the third person and so draw others into reach of its harmful potentialities, it would not be negligent toward them.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Restatement (Second) Torts \u00a7\u00a7 281, 290, comment 1.

The intervention of a force which is a normal consequence of a situation created by wrongdoer\u2019s negligent conduct does not break the chain of causation between the wrongdoer\u2019s misconduct and harm which the wrongdoer\u2019s conduct had been a substantial factor in bringing about.

This rule applies equally to intervening acts done by the person who is harmed. It is <em>not </em>necessary that the act which is done by the person harmed be reasonable.
