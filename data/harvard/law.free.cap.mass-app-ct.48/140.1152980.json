State Trooper O\u2019Neil had stopped the car for a traffic violation and noticed the distinctive package protruding from beneath the seat. The trooper read the defendant the Miranda warnings from a card he carried; then, seeing that the defendant spoke English with difficulty, he had the defendant read the back side of the card, which listed the Miranda warnings in Spanish. Trooper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Pina, who spoke Spanish, read the defendant the same warnings from a card at the barracks. Questioning produced little information of consequence and was terminated when the defendant, in response to repeated questions trying to ascertain where the defendant had come from, refused to answer questions further, claiming to be confused. At trial, the defendant testified that he was a mechanic and was in the process of returning the car to the owner when stopped by Trooper O\u2019Neil. He claimed to have known nothing of the kilo of cocaine under the seat (which he had adjusted forward, being considerably shorter than the owner, leaving the cocaine visible).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The motion judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was properly warned under Miranda was not in error. Trooper Pina\u2019s inability on the witness stand to recall all the warnings was of no consequence where the defendant had been given the card to read the warnings in Spanish and, later, the warnings had been read to the defendant from such a card. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 592, 595-596 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, 47 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 178, 181 (1999). As those decisions advise, better practice called for putting the card in evidence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, 374 </em>Mass. 203, 205 (1978), but the failure to do this was not fatal. At present, there is no rule requiring that the warnings and statements thereafter be recorded electronically. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fryar, </em>414 Mass. 732, 742 n.8 (1993). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>422 Mass. 269, 272-273 (1996). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, 427 </em>Mass. 90, 98 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">It was error, however, for the trial judge, over objection, to allow Trooper Pina to testify that the defendant had refused to go on answering the trooper\u2019s questions, asserting confusion. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617-618 (1976). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>374 Mass. 514, 518-521 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, 422 </em>Mass. 792, 797 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Somers, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 920, 923 (1998). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nawn, </em>394 Mass. 1, 5 (1985). Unlike <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Habarek, </em>402 Mass. 105, 110 (1988), in which such testimony was required to put an abruptly ended conversation in context, or <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. at 798, where such testimony was necessary to rebut a defense attempt to portray the defendant\u2019s silence as indicative of improper interrogation techniques of the police, here the testimony could have been ended smoothly with Trooper Pina\u2019s describing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>last question asked of and answered by the defendant. There was here no justification for entering the forbidden territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">It has been said that \u201c[t]he nature of a <em>Doyle </em>error is so egregious that reversal is the norm, not the exception.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 698 (1983). Despite that norm, we note that, where the defendant asserted a superficially plausible reason for terminating the questioning \u2014 his confusion \u2014 and the testimony did not dwell on the refusal, there would be some justification for treating the error as harmless in the context of the whole trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The prosecutor, however, did not leave well enough alone. Instead of shying from the area she knew was sensitive, she elected in closing argument to highlight the defendant\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the interrogation. \u201c[Trooper Pina] asks where the defendant was coming from, but the defendant won\u2019t answer him .... Now, after several of these routine questions, Where are you coming from? Where are you going? What are your parents\u2019 names? What is your date of birth? [T]he defendant says[,] I\u2019m confused. Let\u2019s stop.\u201d The prosecutor went on to question the validity of the defendant\u2019s asserted confusion, reminding the jurors that the conversation between Trooper Pina and the defendant was in Spanish, the defendant\u2019s native tongue. Unmistakably, the prosecutor was trying in this line of argument to <em>use </em>against the defendant his postarrest, postwaming silence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. at 798. In effect, the prosecutor by this line of argument was emphasizing for the jury the plausible but forbidden thought that, if the defendant\u2019s story at trial were trae, why didn\u2019t he simply tell it to the police? This use of the defendant\u2019s silence \u201c \u2018struck at the heart of\u2019 the defendant\u2019s [story at trial].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egardo, </em>426 Mass. 48, 53 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egardo, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 44 (1997). We cannot properly conclude that the error was harmless. The defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
