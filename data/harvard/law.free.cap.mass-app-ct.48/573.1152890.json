(company), a private collection agency whose business included collecting delinquent excise taxes for cities and towns. The defendant Frederick J. Kelley, Jr. (Kelley), was the president and treasurer of the company. There had been a theft of cash at the company\u2019s premises, and the plaintiff was suspected of being the thief. The defendant Wayne Minichielli, a Hopedale police officer investigating the theft, obtained the plaintiff\u2019s criminal offender record information (CORI)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and gave Kelley that information after the plaintiff told Minichielli that he would not take a polygraph test. Kelley then threatened the plaintiff with the loss of his position unless he took the test, and the plaintiff finally agreed. Kelley learned the test results from Minichielli and discharged the plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No criminal charges were ever brought against the plaintiff for the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The plaintiff brought suit, asserting claims against the company and Kelley for wrongful termination of employment, for violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B(2) (set out in note 11, <em>infra), </em>for wrongfully subjecting him to a lie detector test, and for violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I. He also brought claims under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 177,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> against the company, Kelley, Minichielli, and the town of Hopedale al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>leging the wrongful dissemination of the plaintiff\u2019s CORI in violation of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 172; a claim against Minichielli for tortious interference with the employment relationship; claims against Minichielli and Hopedale for invasion of privacy and civil rights violations (G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I); and a claim against the town under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2. Defendants Hopedale and Minichielli and the defendant company and Kelley filed motions for summary judgment, Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 924 (1974). Both motions were allowed, and the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We state the material facts in more detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">During the weekend of August 1, 1992, Kelley\u2019s office at Evergreen Avenue in Hopedale was broken into, and about $7,000 in cash was stolen. On August 3, 1992, Minichielli, a police detective employed by the town, was dispatched to conduct an investigation. A preliminary check for fingerprints and other evidence of the crime yielded nothing significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Minichielli suspected that it was an inside job because the intruder seemed to know where the money was. He asked Kelley for a list of employees and ran a background check on all of them. He discovered that the plaintiff had a prior criminal record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On September 23, 1992, Minichielli met with Kelley and disclosed this information. Kelley told Minichielli that he was concerned about the plaintiff\u2019s possible involvement in the break-in because he was late for work on the morning after the break-in and appeared to be very nervous.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">On September 28, 1992, Minichielli contacted the plaintiff and asked him to come to the police station. At the interview, Minichielli read the plaintiff his Miranda rights and told him that he was a prime suspect in the investigation. In response, the plaintiff denied any involvement in the break-in and theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Several days later, Minichielli asked the plaintiff to take a lie detector test. He told the plaintiff that if he did not take the test \u201che [Minichielli] was going to tell. . . Kelley that [the plaintiff] had a record and [the plaintiff] would be fired.\u201d The plaintiff refused to take the test. Later, the plaintiff and Kelley talked. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Kelley told the plaintiff (according to the plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony) that because the plaintiff had \u201crefused to take a lie detector test\u201d and since he \u201chad a record,\u201d the plaintiff was \u201cthrough\u201d unless he took the lie detector test. The plaintiff then agreed to take the test \u2014 an agreement he would not have made (we infer favorably to the plaintiff) unless faced with the sanction of loss of his job if he refused. The plaintiff took the test, which was administered at the State police barracks in Southborough. He did poorly when asked key questions concerning his whereabouts on the date of the break-in. The plaintiff was fired shortly after Kelley learned that the results of the test were unfavorable.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The police investigation ended without anyone being charged with the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">1. <em>The CORI Act claim against all defendants. </em>General Laws c. 6, \u00a7 172 (as amended through St. 1990, c. 319, \u00a7\u00a7 7-12), of the CORI Act, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>permits the dissemination of criminal record information \u201conly to (a) criminal justice agencies; (b) such other agencies and individuals required to have access to such information by statute . . . ; and (c) any other agencies and individuals where it has been determined [by the criminal history systems board (board), see c. 6, \u00a7 168,] that the public interest in disseminating such information to these parties clearly outweighs the interest in security and privacy.\u201d Access under clause (a) is limited to \u201cthat necessary for the actual performance of the criminal justice duties of criminal justice agencies . . .\u201d; access under clause (b) is limited to \u201cthat necessary for the actual performance of the statutory duties of agencies and individuals . . .\u201d; and access under clause (c) is limited to \u201cthat necessary for the actual performance of the actions or duties sustaining the public interest.....\u201d Further as to clause (c), the board may act only upon the favorable vote of a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting determining and certifying that \u201cthe public interest in disseminating such information to such party clearly outweighs the interest in security and privacy.\u201d In sum, the focus of clauses (a), (b), and (c) is to limit and tightly control the persons and agencies to whom CORI may be made available. Plainly excluded from these three approved groups is the undifferentiated public.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The underlying legislative purpose is to protect the privacy and security of those whose criminal record may no longer be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>relevant to current decisions regarding such persons. Thus G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 171, first par. (as inserted by St. 1972, c. 805, \u00a7 1), provides, inter aha, that the board shall promulgate regulations \u201c(c) assuring the security of criminal offender record information from unauthorized disclosures at all levels of operation.\u201d The second paragraph of \u00a7 171 provides: \u201cThe board shall cause to be initiated for employees of all agencies that maintain, receive, or are eligible to maintain or receive criminal offender record information a continuing educational program in the proper use and control of such information.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vickey, </em>381 Mass. 762, 765 (1980) (\u00a7 171 reveals \u201cthe legislative purpose to protect individuals from unnecessary and overbroad dissemination of criminal record information\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Minichielli does not attempt to justify his dissemination of the plaintiff\u2019s CORI to Kelley under the provisions of \u00a7 172. Rather, he relies on the provisions of a regulation of the board, 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.04(5) (1995), which is captioned, \u201cAuthorization for <em>Public </em>Dissemination of CORI\u201d (emphasis supplied). Subparagraph (a) provides: \u201cA criminal justice agency with official responsibility for a pending criminal investigation or prosecution may disseminate CORI that is specifically related to and contemporaneous with an investigation or prosecution.\u201d The plaintiff responds that the regulation was in excess of the authority granted by the Legislature.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">General Laws c. 6, \u00a7 168, third par. (as appearing in St. 1979, c. 702, \u00a7 2) \u2014 cited by the board as authority for the promulgation of the regulation \u2014 gives the board the authority to \u201cpromulgate regulations regarding the collection, storage, access, <em>dissemination, </em>content, organization, and use of criminal offender record information\u201d (emphasis supplied). However, the authority granted to the board under \u00a7 168 may not be <em>exercised </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>in a manner that conflicts with the intent of the Legislature as expressed in \u00a7 172. Section 172, as we have seen, provides for carefully restricted groups of persons and agencies to whom CORI may be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In addition to that limitation, \u00a7 172 makes it clear that <em>each </em>disclosure by an agency is important. Thus, the fourth paragraph of \u00a7 172 requires each agency to maintain \u201ca listing of the agencies <em>or individuals </em>to which it has released or communicated such information\u201d\u2019(emphasis supplied). These listings are subject to periodic review by the board to determine whether there has been a violation of law. There is no showing in this case that Kelley\u2019s name was added to the list maintained by the Hopedale police department. Further still, the sixth paragraph of \u00a7 172 provides that \u201cany person\u201d may request conviction data, but each such request must be made to the board for approval. There is no showing in this case that such a request, if made by Minichielli individually, was approved by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Section 2.04(5)(a) of 803 Code Mass. Regs., on the other hand, provides for the dissemination of CORI <em>without limitation </em>except only that the CORI dissemination must be \u201cspecifically related to and contemporaneous with an investigation or prosecution.\u201d The effect is to authorize the distribution of CORI <em>to any member of the public </em>so long as the CORI dissemination is connected to an ongoing investigation. This broad grant of authority to each criminal justice agency simply and completely undoes the carefully drafted limitations imposed by the provisions of \u00a7 172 regarding authorized recipients of CORI. The consequence must be that the regulation exceeds the legislative grant of authority to the board and is invalid. See <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 249 (1985) (\u201cThe duty of this court is to interpret the statute according to the intent of the Legislature and common sense. We are not simply to provide our imprimatur for regulations that the examiners might be able to defend on an excessively broad reading of the statute\u201d). Here the regulation of the board \u201cis not supported by the language of the statute, the context from which it arose, . . . or the legislative policy on which the statute is based.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">We must measure Minichielli\u2019s conduct, then, against the standard of c. 6, \u00a7 172, not 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.04(5)(a). On that basis, Minichielli\u2019s distribution of the plaintiff\u2019s CORI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>to Kelley did not fall within the protection of clauses (a), (b), or (c), of c. 6, \u00a7 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">It does not follow, however, that Minichielli is necessarily liable to the plaintiff under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 177 (see note 4, <em>supra). </em>General Laws c. 258, \u00a7 10(a) (inserted by St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 15), provides that no claim based on an act or omission of a public employee may be maintained when the employee exercised \u201cdue care\u201d in the execution of any regulation of a public employer (i.e., here, the board) whether or not the regulation is valid. That is to say, there can be no \u201cwillful violation\u201d of \u00a7 172 (the prerequisite of an action for damages under \u00a7 177) by Minichielli if he was acting <em>with due care </em>under 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.04(5)(a), which was not an invalid regulation when he acted. Whether Minichielli acted with due care in making CORI available to Kelley is a question of fact that must be resolved at trial, see <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Blandford, </em>402 Mass. 831, 836 (1988), and this claim must be remanded to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Further, as to the plaintiff\u2019s CORI Act claim under \u00a7 177 against Kelley and the company, the plaintiff argues that Kelley had no right to use the plaintiff\u2019s CORI in discharging him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Bynes </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 264, 270-271 (1991), precludes recovery by the plaintiff. In <em>Bynes </em>the court held that to prove a violation of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 172,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the plaintiff must show that the individual or agency receiving CORI was \u201cin violation of the statute and at fault,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 271. There is no evidence in this case (just as there was none in <em>Bynes) </em>that Kelley or the company, in <em>receiving </em>plaintiff\u2019s CORI information, violated the CORI Act and was at fault in doing so. See <em>ibid. </em>Whether Kelley\u2019s use of the plaintiff\u2019s CORI violates other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>legal constraints is discussed <em>infra.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">2. <em>The polygraph test. </em>The plaintiff claims that he was wrongly coerced by Kelley and the company to take a lie detector test which was administered by the Massachusetts State Police. At issue is G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B(2), which we set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge concluded that there was no violation of \u00a7 19B(2), and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>379 Mass. 322 (1979), a case involving an investigation by the head of a police department into a theft from a store alleged to have been committed by police officers in the course of their duties, the court discussed and analyzed \u00a7 19B<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in some detail. We follow that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The first sentence of \u00a7 19B(2) forbids all employers, public and private, to impose polygraph tests on their employees, or to request their employees to undergo such tests. The second sentence creates an exception to the first sentence. \u201cThe situation plainly within the exception is one where a law enforcement agency is conducting an investigation into a crime alleged to have been committed by a person in connection with the duties of his employment, and the agency is permitted, i.e., not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>forbidden, to administer a polygraph test to that employee. If, then, the employee refuses or indicates hesitance to submit to the test at the agency\u2019s request, the employer (relieved of the prohibition of the first sentence of \u00a7 19B [now \u00a7 19B(2), see note 12, <em>supra]) </em>may request that the employee do so, with implied job sanctions if the employee finally declines.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>379 Mass. at 327. See <em>Local 346, Intl. Bhd. of Police Officers </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>391 Mass. 429, 440-442 (1984) (union\u2019s acquiescence to police department\u2019s demand for submission of its employees to lie detector test is not required under \u00a7 19B, citing <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The plaintiff would distinguish <em>Baker: </em>he argues that it applies only to an employee who is under investigation for having committed a crime \u201cwhile on the job.\u201d We see no basis for imposing this limitation on <em>Baker. Baker </em>itself eschewed such a limitation. See <em>id. </em>at 327 n.8: \u201cWe have dealt here with the core meaning of the excepting language of \u00a7 19B [i.e., investigation of criminal acts alleged to have been committed by employees in connection with the duties of employment]. We are not called on to explicate any possible ampler meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Plainly, there must be a sufficient nexus between the crime under investigation and the suspect\u2019s employment so that pressure by the employer on the employee to take the test may be correctly seen, not as an act of a vigilante, but as a reasonable effort by the employer to maintain an honest work force and a working environment secure against criminal incursions. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>379 Mass. at 329 n.11 (the legislative intent was \u201cto balance the privacy interests of employees against the legitimate needs of certain criminal investigations\u201d). In <em>Baker, </em>the crime (theft of property from a store) was allegedly committed in the course of performing the employees\u2019 duties; here, the suspected crime was a robbery, allegedly by an off-duty employee, of company assets on the company\u2019s premises. The victim in <em>Baker </em>was a third party; the victim in this case was the company itself. As we see it, the case for applying the \u00a7 19B(2) exception is at least as compelling as it was in <em>Baker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">We conclude that neither Kelley nor the company violated G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B(2).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s claim against Kelley and the company for an unlawful termination of his at-will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>employment thus also fails, as does his claim for a violation of civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We sum up the results of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. There having been no violation of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 172, or of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B(2), by Kelley or the company, the ord\u00e9r granting summary judgment for those defendants is affirmed. That portion of the order granting summary judgment to Minichielli and the town on the claim for violation of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 172 (count IV), is reversed, and that claim will be remanded for further proceedings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1(c), prohibits the claim against the town for invasion of privacy, the entry of summary judgment for the town on that claim may stand. Because the ruling that there was no violation of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 172, was the sole basis for the grant of summary judgment to Minichielli and the town on the claim for violation of the Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I (count VII), and to Minichielli on the claims for tortious interference with the employment relation (count V) and invasion of privacy (count VI) and because the other issues raised by the defendants have not been ruled on below, the order insofar as it grants summary judgment on those claims is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>reversed, and the claims will be remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Therefore, the judgment insofar as it dismisses the claims against Minichielli and the town of Hopedale in count IV for violation of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 172, dismisses the claim against Minichielli in count VI, and dismisses counts V, VII, and VIII is reversed. The judgment insofar as it dismisses the claims against Kelley and Kelley Consultants, Inc., and the claim against the town of Hopedale in count VI for invasion of privacy is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\">General Laws c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 167-178B (the CORI Act), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, regulate the collection and dissemination of an individual\u2019s criminal record history; that history is commonly referred to as \u201cCORI.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The facts appearing in this opinion are taken from undisputed facts, the deposition testimony of the plaintiff, and those portions of the deposition testimony of Kelley and Minichielli which were put forward by the plaintiff in affidavit form in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.

Here, as we state in the facts, <em>supra, </em>and as the plaintiff acknowledges in his brief, the plaintiff yielded to the threats of Kelley and not to the threats of Minichielli: <em>\u201cSolely to prevent his termination </em>[by Kelley], Beilin agreed to take the test\u201d (emphasis supplied). Thus when Beilin presented himself to the State Police barracks in Southborough, he submitted to the test by consent and not as a result of coercion <em>by the State. </em>See <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Youth Development Program, Inc., </em>390 Mass. 652, 658 (1983) (\u201cart. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights . . . inherently is concerned with governmental action\u201d).

I respectfully dissent from part 2 of the majority opinion. General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 19B(2), as appearing in St. 1985, c. 587, \u00a7 1, provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any employer or his agent, with respect to any of his employees ... to subject such person to, or request such person to take a lie detector test ... or to discharge . . . such person for the assertion of rights arising hereunder.\u201d There follows an exception contained in the second sentence of the statute which permits law enforcement agencies to administer such tests \u201cas may be otherwise permitted in criminal investigations.\u201d I dissent because I conclude that in these circumstances the exception was not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">\u201c[A]n exception from the coverage of a statute is ordinarily to be construed narrowly so as to prevent the purposes of the statute from being rendered ineffective.\u201d <em>Singer Friedlander Corp. </em>v. <em>State Lottery Commn., </em>423 Mass. 562, 565 (1996), quoting from <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 745, 747 (1985). To put it colloquially, an exception not construed narrowly \u201cwould swallow the rule.\u201d <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>428 Mass. 684, 693 (1999). The majority\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B(2), allows just that. Under their interpretation, any time a crime is reported at a place of business, any one of that business\u2019s employees could be fired for refusing to take a lie detector test, without anything more. I do not believe the Legislature intended this statute to protect so little.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">The majority likens the situation here to <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>379 Mass. 322 (1979), a case in which the Supreme Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Court held that an investigation, conducted by the administrative head of a municipal police department into a theft at a store allegedly committed by police officers, could include a demand that the officers take a lie detector test. Justice Kaplan explained in <em>Baker </em>that the exception applies to circumstances \u201cwhere a law enforcement agency is conducting an investigation into a crime alleged to have been committed by a person in connection with the duties of his employment, and the agency is permitted, i.e., not forbidden, to administer a polygraph to that employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Even so, a grant of adequate immunity was necessary for the employer in <em>Baker, </em>a government agency, to lawfully compel its employees to take a lie detector test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the right against self-incrimination is not necessarily raised in circumstances where an employee is compelled by a private employer to testify, all individuals are protected by the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights against self-incrimination in any instance in which testimony is compelled by the government. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrail, </em>419 Mass. 774, 777 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dormady, </em>423 Mass. 190, 193-194 (1996). If the plaintiff was coerced, even by Kelley, to take the lie detector test, then absent an adequate grant of immunity its administration by the police was not \u201cotherwise permitted.\u201d Ruling differently allows a law enforcement officer to use this statute to compel testimony in violation of an individual\u2019s constitutional rights, simply by involving that individual\u2019s employer. This is precisely what appears to have happened here.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The defendants argue that no constitutional rights are implicated because the plaintiff took the test voluntarily, not as a result of police pressure. \u201cIn determining whether a statement was made voluntarily, in compliance with due process of law, we examine ... the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement,\u201d including \u201call of the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>circumstances surrounding the interrogation and the individual characteristics and conduct of the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. 656, 662-663 (1995). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>427 Mass. 312, 315 (1998). The plaintiff furnished testimony at his deposition indicating threats and pressure exerted by Minichielh and Kelley to obtain his consent to the test. The burden is on the defendants, therefore, to demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that as a matter of law the plaintiff freely consented to take the test. For his part, Minichielli points out that the plaintiff testified that Minichielli only suggested that he take the test, that he never told him that he had no choice. Consequently, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiff\u2019s cooperation was compelled. As there is no question that the plaintiff was not offered adequate immunity from criminal prosecution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> viewing the materials in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, see <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 438 (1995), a fact finder could determine that the administration of the test was proscribed by the statute and that the plaintiff had a right to refuse. I would permit both of the plaintiff\u2019s claims to proceed to trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\">In <em>Baker, </em>the court found that \u201cuse immunity\u201d offered adequate protection of the officers\u2019 right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but did address the issue under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See <em>id. </em>at 331 &amp; n.14. However, \u201cthe type of immunity that provides the requisite degree of protection for art. 12 purposes is the so-called transactional immunity, which provides a greater protection than the \u2018use and derivative use immunity\u2019 required by the Fifth Amendment.\" <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>426 Mass. 206, 218 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-5\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Dalrymple, </em>428 Mass. 1014, 1016 (1998) (G.
