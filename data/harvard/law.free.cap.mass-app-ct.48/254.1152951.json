By their complaint, the tenants sought a determination that they were entitled to the protections afforded by the longstanding Manufactured Housing Act (Act), G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 32A-32S.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Superior Court judge determined that the complaint was not timely filed. He also denied the tenants\u2019 then-pending motion to amend the complaint by adding a count under G. L. c. 93A. Because we conclude that the tenants\u2019 complaint was timely filed, that they are entitled to the protections provided by the Act, and that their motion to amend the complaint should have been allowed, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">1. <em>The Manufactured Housing Act. </em>A brief overview of the statutes involved in this case would be helpful to an understanding of the Act. Sections 32A through 32S of the Act provide comprehensive and substantial rights to owners of manufactured homes who place such structures upon land rented by them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These rights and protections have been enacted because \u201c[bjoth the Legislature and the courts of the Commonwealth have recognized that manufactured housing communities provide a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>viable, affordable housing option to many elderly persons and families of low and moderate income, who are often lacking in resources and deserving of legal protection.\u201d <em>Greenfield Country Estates Tenants Assn. </em>v. <em>Deep, </em>423 Mass. 81, 83 (1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCotis, </em>366 Mass. 234, 243 &amp; n.7 (1974); <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Peabody, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 357, 359-360 &amp; n.4 (1998); St. 1986, c. 317, an emergency proclamation amending \u00a7 32L and adding \u00a7 32R to the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Whether the rights and protections afforded by the Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are available to an owner of a manufactured home depends upon whether the home is situated in a \u201cmanufactured housing community\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 32F, as amended by St. 1991, c. 481, \u00a7 19, that is, \u201c[a]ny lot or tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes occupied for dwelling purposes are located . . . .\u201d Because the tenants reside in manufactured homes situated on land owned by Longo, the primary issue on appeal is whether he is using the land to operate a manufactured housing community.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">2. <em>The facts. </em>It is against the backdrop of these pertinent provisions of the Act that we recite the undisputed facts as they appear in the materials submitted by the parties on their motions to dismiss or for summary judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1973, Longo, a real estate developer, purchased approximately thirty-three acres of land in Salisbury. Thereafter, he submitted a subdivision plan of the parcel to the local planning board. Pursuant to his plan, which was approved in October, 1976, the parcel was divided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>into forty-nine single-family house lots.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Access to these lots, as can be seen from the appended sketch, is gained either from Lafayette Road (U.S. Route 1) or Kendall Lane.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Sometime in 1978, Longo began to allow the owners of manufactured homes to place their structures upon certain of the subdivided lots owned by him. Next, in January of 1982, Longo conveyed twenty-four of the forty-nine subdivided lots owned by him to himself as trustee of a realty trust. Longo rents, on a monthly basis, seventeen of those twenty-four lots to owners of manufactured homes, one home per subdivision lot.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Each manufactured home rests upon a foundation and has appropriate utilities as would conventional stick-built housing. Each of the seventeen lots has its own septic system, provided by Longo, who also pays the real estate taxes on each of the separately assessed lots. The tenants pay for their own utilities and water.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">As alleged by the tenants in their complaint and affidavits, they are retired, disabled, of modest means, and are living on fixed incomes. They claim that, throughout the years, Longo has failed to maintain the property in question, has increased rents, has charged excessive rents, has terminated various tenancies, and has threatened to terminate tenancies unless the rental increases are paid. The tenants also allege that when Longo discovered that they intended to claim coverage under the Act, he attempted to persuade certain of them to abandon their affili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ation with the association and represented that their rents would increase were it determined that the seventeen lots fell within the scope of the Act. The tenants, nonetheless, commencing in 1991 and continuing up to the filing of this action in 1997, complained to the board of selectmen and the defendant board of health that they were being denied their rights under the Act and Salisbury\u2019s rent control provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Salisbury officials took no action in response to the tenants\u2019 concerns and complaints for about four years. In the meantime, Longo has never applied for a license to operate or maintain a manufactured housing community under \u00a7 32F of the Act. In June, 1995, the board of selectmen determined, apparently on the basis of advisory opinions from the Attorney General of the Commonwealth and town counsel, that Congo\u2019s property fell within the scope of the Act and ordered the board of health to proceed with the licensing process. Notwithstanding the selectmen\u2019s determination, the board of health took the view that the seventeen lots did not constitute a manufactured housing community within the meaning of \u00a7 32F and refused to proceed further.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">It appears that the board of health reached its conclusion, that Longo was not required to seek a license, after a vote taken at a meeting held on March 19, 1996. That vote was unaccompanied by a written decision or any other memorialized explanation. As further alleged, the tenants did not receive any notice of the board\u2019s decision or of their right of appeal from the board\u2019s determination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They brought this action about twelve months later, on February 24, 1997.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">3. <em>The tenants\u2019 complaint. </em>There is a threshold issue to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>resolved before we consider the substance of the tenants\u2019 complaint, that is, whether they timely brought their action.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">a. <em>Timeliness of the complaint. </em>In his memorandum of decision, the Superior Court judge noted that \u201c[a]lthough not styled in the form of a c. 30A appeal, the complaint . . . appears to challenge the March [19,] 1996 refusal by the Board of Health to require that Longo obtain a license under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32.\u201d Relying upon the limitations period set out in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(1), the Superior Court judge concluded that the tenants\u2019 complaint was untimely because it had not been brought within thirty days of the decision of the board of health.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Finding and concluding that there were no special circumstances warranting the tenants relief from that statutory time requirement, the Superior Court judge dismissed the complaint and entered judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">There is no dispute that the tenants did not file their complaint within thirty days of the vote of the board of health. It does not follow, however, that the complaint was untimely filed. Three provisions of the Act are relevant to the question of the timeliness of the filing. We begin with \u00a7 32B, which reads: \u201cThe <em>board of health of any city or town, </em>in each instance after a hearing, reasonable notice of which shall have been published once in a newspaper published in such city or town, may grant, and may suspend or revoke, licenses for . . . manufactured housing communities located within such city or town\u201d (emphasis supplied). If Longo is using his seventeen lots for a manufactured housing community, he is required under \u00a7 32F, as earlier noted, to obtain a license under \u00a7 32B to do so. Finally, and controlling on the question of timeliness is \u00a7 32K, which states that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by any act, rule, order or decision , of the licensing board may appeal to the superior court.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As established by these provisions of the Act, the board of health is the licensing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>A local board, such as a board of health, is generally not a \u201cstate agency\u201d within the scope of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(2). See <em>Benevolent &amp; Protective Order of Elks, Lodge No. 65 </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Lawrence, </em>403 Mass. 531, 538 (1988); <em>Roslindale Motor Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>405 Mass. 79, 85 n.8 (1989); <em>Fratus </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Yarmouth, 6 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 605, 608 (1978). Nor did the board of health proceed in accordance with the norms of an administrative agency: notice, hearing and so forth. As to the Act, there is nothing within \u00a7 32K or any other provision that subjects any appeal under that section to the thirty-day appeal period set out in c. 30A, \u00a7 14(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Even were we to conclude that the tenants\u2019 complaint was subject to c. 30A, we also would conclude that they were entitled to circumvent the normal course of administrative review because their complaint presents special circumstances which justify an action seeking a declaration of their rights. Those special circumstances are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">As we earlier stated, it was not until June, 1995, after receiving opinions from the Attorney General and town counsel, that the selectmen directed the board of health to proceed with the licensing process. Neither of the defendants (see note 12, supra) disputes the tenants\u2019 assertion that the board of health failed to give notice of any hearing or vote and never issued a written decision regarding its meeting and vote of March 19, 1996, all as required by c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 14(1) and 32B, of the Act. Moreover, the selectmen and the Attorney General have expressed a view on a matter of grave public concern (see <em>Greenfield Country Estates Tenants Assn. </em>v. <em>Deep, </em>423 Mass. at 83; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCotis, </em>366 Mass. at 238; <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Peabody, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 359 n.4) which is in direct conflict with that of the licensing authority, the board of health. See <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport </em>v. <em>DeCarolis, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 353 (1992) (recognizing special circumstances when \u201c[t]wo distinct public bodies claiming a direct interest in the subject matter have issued conflicting orders\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Although the tenants did not bring this action until twelve months after the vote of the board of health, we deem the delay modest, especially in light of their never having received notice of the decision. Cf. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Inspector of Bldgs. of Belmont, </em>341 Mass. 188, 190 (1960); <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Westport, </em>348 Mass. 515, 520 (1965). Any delay by the tenants in seeking judicial relief has not made it difficult for the selectmen or the board of health to take any action deemed necessary to remedy the ongoing situation. Compare <em>Yetman </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 700, 707-709 (1979) (laches applied to complaint seeking interpretation of ordinance made by city seven years earlier and which provided basis for two subsequent collective bargaining agreements). Nor does any delay appear to have disadvantaged Longo.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In view of these circumstances, we conclude that the tenants\u2019 complaint was filed in a reasonably prompt manner and that their rights, if any, under the Act should be determined on the basis of the undisputed facts put before the Superior Court judge. Contrast <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Middleborough Gas &amp; Elec. Dept., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 655, 658 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">b. <em>Substance of the complaint. </em>As provided in \u00a7 32A, \u201c[n]o person shall conduct, control, manage or operate, directly or indirectly, any . . . manufactured housing community unless he is the holder of a license granted under [\u00a7 32B].\u201d The term \u201cmanufactured housing community\u201d is defined in the first paragraph of \u00a7 32F, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201cAny <em>lot or tract of land </em>upon which three or more manufactured homes occupied for dwelling purposes are located, including any buildings, structures, fixtures and equipment used in connection with manufactured homes shall be defined as a manufactured housing community. <em>No lot or tract of land </em>may be used for a manufactured housing community unless the owner or occupant thereof is the holder of a license granted under section thirty-two B\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">There is nothing in the Act that defines either the word \u201clot\u201d or the term \u201ctract of land.\u201d Longo argues that we should give the word \u201clot\u201d the same meaning as that set out in the Subdivision Control Law, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81K through 81GG. As defined in c. 41, \u00a7 81L, a \u201clot\u201d is an \u201carea of land in one ownership, with definite boundaries, used, or available for use, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>as the site of one or more buildings.\u201d As for the words \u201ctract of land,\u201d Longo states that the phrase impliedly means a parcel of land <em>before </em>it is subdivided into lots. Because his tract of land has been subdivided into \u201clots\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 81L and because there is only one manufactured home on each of the subdivided lots, Longo maintains that he does not operate a \u201cmanufactured housing community\u201d within the scope of \u00a7 32F, that is, upon \u201c[a]ny lot or tract of land.\u201d Although Longo\u2019s argument is as clever as his subdivision plan, it fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Zoning and subdivision control law definitions and concepts are seldom helpful in interpreting terms and provisions of the Manufactured Housing Act for the oft-stated reason that the former pertain to land-use issues whereas the latter concern licensing requirements based upon an expressed legislative intent to protect elderly and disabled consumers who live on low incomes and in manufactured houses. See <em>Granby </em>v. <em>Landry, </em>341 Mass. 443, 446 (1960); <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>343 Mass. 591, 593 n.3 (1962); <em>Selectmen of Wrentham </em>v. <em>Monson, </em>355 Mass. 715, 717 (1969); <em>Selectmen of Hatfield </em>v. <em>Garvey, </em>362 Mass. 821, 825-826 (1973); <em>Gamache </em>v. <em>Acushnet, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 220 &amp; n.9 (1982). Consequently, we do not accept the premise of Congo\u2019s argument, that is, that the express and implied meanings given the terms \u201clot\u201d and \u201ctract of land\u201d for zoning and subdivision purposes are also embodied in \u00a7 32F of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We put aside zoning and subdivision concerns and begin our analysis with the general rule that a \u201cstatute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., 361 </em>Mass. 360, 364 (1975), quoting from <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). See <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>397 Mass. 416, 420 (1986); <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 Mass. 283, 286 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">As commonly understood, a \u201ctract\u201d of land is simply an \u201cexpanse of land.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 1896 (3d ed. 1992). See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1492 (6th ed. 1990) (tract of land is a \u201clot, piece or parcel of land, of greater or less size, the term not importing, in itself, any precise dimension\u201d; a term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>\u201csynonymous with parcel of land and does not have reference to size but to contiguous quantity of land\u201d); Cartwright, Glossary of Real Estate Law 942 (1972) (tract defined as \u201c[a] parcel of land. An area of real estate, frequently subdivided into smaller parcels\u201d). Both the ordinary meaning of the term and the previously discussed purposes of the Act lead us to conclude that, as used in \u00a7 32F, the phrase \u201c[a]ny lot or tract of land\u201d is sufficiently broad to comprehend a parcel of land subdivided into lots pursuant to a plan devised by, or for the benefit of, the owner who retains title to, or control of, the lots upon which manufactured homes are placed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">That Longo conveyed title to some of the subdivided lots to himself as trustee of a real estate trust is of no consequence to our conclusion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Notwithstanding that conveyance, according to his own affidavit, Longo controls and manages the seventeen leased lots. He is doing so in violation of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32A (\u201c[n]o person shall conduct, control, manage or operate, directly or indirectly, any . . . manufactured housing community unless he is the holder of a license granted under [\u00a7 32B]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">4. <em>The motion to amend. </em>Less than three months after filing their complaint, the tenants sought to amend it by adding a count under G. L. c. 93A. The Superior Court judge concluded that the amendment to the complaint would be futile and denied the motion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As stated by him in his memorandum of decision, the amendment would be futile because Longo\u2019s failure to apply for a license pursuant to \u00a7 32B could not form the basis of a c. 93A claim; there was no commercial activity between Longo and the tenants; and there was no evidence to support the claims that Longo\u2019s alleged failures constituted an unfair or deceptive act or practice. This determination of futility flows from the Superior Court judge\u2019s view, exjpressed as dictum in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>memorandum of opinion, that Longo\u2019s subdivision plan rendered the Act inapplicable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Based upon our conclusion that Longo controls and manages a manufactured housing community without a license, we think that his acts or failures to act, as described in both the demand letter and the proposed amended complaint, are\u201d actionable under c. 93A by reason of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 32L(7) and 32S. The motion was filed shortly after the tenants brought their action and mailed their demand letter, both of which, in our view, were more than sufficient to put Longo on notice that should the theory of defense raised in his motion for dismissal or summary judgment and pressed on appeal fail (the inapplicability of the Act), he would have to defend against allegations that he did and does engage in acts which violate c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In light of our determination that Longo\u2019s property is within the scope of the Act, we conclude that it was error to deny the tenants\u2019 motion to amend their complaint by adding thereto allegations of violations of c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>It follows from what we have said that the judgment dismissing the tenants\u2019 complaint is vacated and the denial of their motion to amend is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, including a trial upon the tenants\u2019 complaint as amended to allege violations of G. L. c. 93A, and the entry of a judgment declaring that Longo is controlling and managing a manufactured housing community without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b285-10\">For a synopsis of the Act\u2019s history, see <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Peabody, </em>45 Mass.

App. Ct. 713, 714, 717 (1992) (where county takes fee in land by eminent domain to lay out public way, landowner\u2019s ownership interest in underlying property is extinguished and county is vested with complete title).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\">As shown on the sketch appended to the opinion, the seventeen lots in issue are numbered <em>2, </em>3, 4, 5, 6, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, and 37.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Neither the board of health nor Longo disputes this allegation, and there is nothing in the materials before us to show that the board\u2019s vote was taken and its decision reached after proper notice of its meeting and an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The tenants allege in their complaint that Longo operates a manufactured housing community without a license and has increased rents and terminated tenancies, all in violation of the Act. They also claim that the board of health has refused to enforce the Act and that they thereby have been deprived of the rights afforded by the Act. Based upon these allegations, they sought a declaration that the seventeen lots in dispute were subject to the Act and the appointment of a master to oversee the Act\u2019s licensing mandate and to make a determination of the amount of damages to be awarded them. By their motion to amend their complaint, the tenants sought to add a count under G. L. c. 93A. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32L (providing that a failure to comply with any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>provision of the Act shall constitute an unfair and deceptive act or practice under c. 93A, \u00a7 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Section 14(1) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cProceedings for judicial review of an agency decision shall be instituted in the superior court.... The action shall... be commenced in the court within thirty days after receipt of notice of the final decision of the agency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The board of health argues that it had no authority to compel Longo to apply for a license and, therefore, the tenants are not \u201caggrieved\u201d by its decision. The argument is disingenuous. It is not within the discretion of an owner or operator of a manufactured housing community to decide whether to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>for a license pursuant to \u00a7 32B. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32A (\u201cNo person shall conduct, control, manage or operate, directly or indirectly, any . . . manufactured housing community unless he is the holder of a license granted under [\u00a7 32B]\u201d). Moreover, \u00a7 32E and 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.11(3), the enactment and promulgation of which is authorized under \u00a7 32S, allow for the assessment of a fine for each day that a person conducts, controls, manages or operates such a community without a license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Because Kendall Lane was created by Longo as part of his subdivision plan, we need not consider whether Longo did or did not convey his fee in that way to Salisbury. See note 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Because the trust document was not submitted in the trial court, we do not have the benefit of knowledge of its provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The Superior Court judge first denied, without prejudice, the tenants\u2019 motion to amend the complaint on the stated bases that the motion was not accompanied by a copy of the proposed amendment and that thirty days had not elapsed since the date of their demand letter to Longo. The tenants then renewed their motion to amend, attaching thereto a copy of their demand letter and their proposed amended complaint. It is the renewed motion to amend that the Superior Court judge denied on the ground of futility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The Superior Court judge wrote: \u201cAlthough this court need not decide whether G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32[,] applies to the parcel, the court notes for completeness that it is unpersuaded by the plaintiff [s\u2019] argument that this subdivided tract constitutes one lot with 3 or more manufactured homes on it as required for application of the statute. Quite to the contrary, the parcel contains 49 individual lots with but one home on each lot. The statute by its plain language does not apply to the Kendall Lane parcel.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
