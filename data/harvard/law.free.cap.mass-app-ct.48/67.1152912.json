Sarantikis had sued Parish for negligence after Sarantikis had been assaulted while leaving Parish\u2019s property. Parish had defaulted, and, after a jury trial on the issue of damages, judgment had entered for Sarantikis. The latter sought to reach and apply Parish\u2019s interest in a policy issued by United, and United responded by filing this action under G. L. c. 231A, seeking a declaratory judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>that it has no liability. On cross motions for summary judgment, a judgment entered in favor of United. Parish was defaulted in this action as well as in the underlying suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">United\u2019s insurance policy issued to Parish provided coverage for bodily injury or property damage \u201ccaused by an occurrence and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the insured premises and all operations necessary or incidental thereto.\u201d The policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d The policy also provides that United must defend any suit arising out of an occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The basis of United\u2019s claim that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Parish is that the \u201cMultipurpose Exclusion Endorsement\u201d of the policy precludes coverage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That clause in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">\u201cIn consideration of the premium charged, it is understood and agreed that no coverage is provided under the policy to which this endorsement is attached, for either defense or indemnification, for any claim asserting a cause of action within any of the Exclusions listed below . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">\u201c5. <em>Assault and Battery Exclusion</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">\u201cClaims arising out of an assault and/or battery, whether caused by or at the instigation of, or at the direction of, or omission by, the Insured, and/or his employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Sarantikis cites to his complaint and argues that his action was based on negligence, that the exclusion in the policy does not apply to claims of negligence, and that the motion judge erred in not allowing his motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">An insurer has a duty to defend an action against the insured \u201cif any allegations in the [underlying] complaint were reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they stated or adumbrated a claim covered by the . . . policy.\u201d <em>Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Assn. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Hermitage Ins. Co., </em>419 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Mass. 316, 319-320 (1995). <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163 (1983). <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983). <em>New Eng. Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 723 (1996). In determining United\u2019s duty to defend, a court must look \u201conly to the complaint and the policy.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>423 Mass. 366, 369 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We therefore turn to Sarantikis\u2019s complaint. The first six introductory paragraphs state that the plaintiff was lawfully on property in Lynn owned by Hanover Street Realty Trust, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>that the property is located in a dangerous high crime area, that, at the time of the incident, the premises were poorly illuminated, that there were no security measures in evidence for the protection of persons lawfully on the premises, and that, at the time of the incident, the stairs were poorly maintained and in disrepair. Paragraph 7 states, \u201cAt approximately 8:00 p.m., as James Sarantikis was exiting the above-named premise, he was assaulted by two men, one of whom was identified as Leo Lomax a\\k\\a Leo Womax.\u201d Paragraph 8 alleges that Leo Lomax committed the assault, and paragraph 9 states, \u201cAs a result of this assault, and condition of the premises James Sarantikis suffered head injuries, scalp lacerations, and a broken neck.\u201d Paragraph 10 lists the two medical locations where the plaintiff was treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The complaint then sets forth three counts. Each begins: \u201cBased on the above facts,\u201d the plaintiff brings his claim against the defendants \u201cfor their negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The first count is for \u201cnegligence in maintenance and or control of the premises . . . . Said inadequate lighting is directly related and the proximate cause of the injuries suffered\u201d by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The second count alleges \u201cnegligence in maintaining inadequate security,\u201d and the third count alleges \u201cnegligence in failing to warn persons lawfully on the premises ... of the dangerous condition of the surrounding locale.\u201d Counts two and three, as did count one, claim that the particular negligence alleged in each count \u201cis directly related and the proximate cause of the injuries\u201d of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>In examining the exclusionary clause, \u201cwe are required to \u2018construe the words of the policy in their usual and ordinary sense,\u2019 <em>Barnstable County Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>374 Mass. 602, 605 (1978).\u201d <em>Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Assn. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Hermitage Ins. Co., </em>419 Mass. at 320. As pointed out in <em>New Eng. Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 726, \u201cThe usual meaning ascribed to the phrase \u2018arising out of\u2019 is much broader than \u2018caused by\u2019; the former phrase is considered synonymous with \u2018originate\u2019 or \u2018come into being.\u2019 Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary 117 (1981).\u201d See <em>Rischitelli </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>423 Mass. 703, 704 (1996) (\u201c \u2018arising out of\u2019 indicates a wider range of causation than the concept of proximate causation in tort law\u201d). In <em>New Eng. Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>the exclusion was as follows: \u201c[C]overage does not apply to personal injury <em>arising out of. . . </em>discrimination which is unlawful or which is committed by or at the direction of the insured.\u201d 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 723 (emphasis supplied). In response to the insured\u2019s argument that its claims for misrepresentation, negligence, and loss of consortium were not precluded by the policy\u2019s exclusion, we held that the insurer had no duty to defend, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">\u201cWithout the underlying discriminatory acts against [the plaintiff in the underlying action], there would have been no personal injuries and, therefore, no basis for a suit against the insureds for misrepresentation, negligence, and loss of consortium. <em>... It is the source from which the plaintiff\u2019s personal injury originates rather than the specific theories of liability alleged in the complaint which determines the insurer\u2019s duty to defend.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 727 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Similarly, in this case, without the underlying <em>assault </em>and battery, there would have been no personal injuries and, therefore, no basis for a suit against the insured for negligence. All of the claims derive from the assault and battery that is the source of the plaintiff\u2019s personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Not only do the cases construe \u201carising out of\u201d expansively, but support for a broad construction of the specific assault and/or battery exclusion of the policy at hand is found in <em>Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Assn. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Hermitage Ins. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>419 Mass. at 320. Although in that case the policy language excluding \u201cassault and/or battery\u201d from coverage was not sufficient to relieve the insurer from its duty to defend a claim alleging a negligent failure to provide security, the court contrasted the language there with language where the exclusion was held to preclude claims for negligence. The cases which exclude claims based on an allegation of negligent failure to provide security, the Supreme Judicial Court noted, \u201cconstrue assault and battery provisions which are far more comprehensive than the Hermitage endorsement and which typically use language stating that <em>any claim arising out of, or based on, an assault and battery </em>is excluded from coverage whether committed by or at the direction of the insured or third parties.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This, it will be remembered, is the language used by United in its policy \u2014 \u201cany claim .... arising out of an assault and/or battery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Among the cases cited by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Hermitage, supra </em>at 321 n.4, as \u201cexamples of broadly worded exclusions which were considered encompassing enough to exclude any claim arising out of an assault and battery\u201d was <em>United Natl. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Entertainment Group, Inc., </em>945 F.2d 210, 213 (7th Cir. 1991), where the exact assault and/or battery exclusionary clause as appears in the policy in this case was construed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In that case, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint in the underlying action stated that she was taken by an assailant to the men\u2019s washroom on the insured\u2019s property and \u201cthreatened . . . with violence if she did not submit to him. When she attempted to get away he forced her against a wall[,] . . . pushed her on the ground and forced her to have sexual intercourse with him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211. The complaint was drafted in the form of negligence claims as set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The insured argued that \u201cthe assault and battery exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>applies only when a suit explicitly states a cause of action for assault and battery .... because [the underlying action] alleges only negligence, the exclusion cannot apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213. The insured also claimed the motion judge was in error in concluding that the assault and battery exclusion precludes coverage when the insured\u2019s negligence causes the assault. The court, applying Illinois law (which had no case directly on point), rejected both contentions, holding that the \u201cexclusion in United\u2019s policy . . . clearly states that there will be no coverage for claims arising from assault and battery, regardless of whether the injury results from the intentional acts or omissions (negligence) of the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214. Since the plaintiff\u2019s injuries \u201coriginated in, or arose from, an assault and rape,\u201d and the \u201cexclusion in the insurance policy precludes coverage for suits \u2018arising out of assault and/or battery,\u2019 . . . the policy excludes coverage even when the injured party alleges that the assault was the result of the insured\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We agree with the foregoing analysis, which is in accord with the Massachusetts cases cited above. See <em>Winnacunnet Coop. Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>84 F.3d 32 (1st Cir. 1996); <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Huber, </em>597 So. 2d 1247 (La. Ct. App. 1992); <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Minneapolis, </em>408 N.W.2d 910, 913 (Minn. Ct. App. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Sarantikis\u2019s argument that the default against Parish is res judicata binding on United on the issue of negligent maintenance is without merit. Apart from the question whether United is bound by the judgment, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>the default entered on the pleadings. Since we have held that those allegations did not create a duty to defend \u2014 a broader duty than the duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>indemnify, <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>423 Mass. at 368 \u2014 our holding includes a determination that there is no allegation in the complaint which could establish liability within the coverage of the policy. Accordingly, the default judgment on which Sarantikis relies is based on allegations of liability which are outside the coverage of the policy. See <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>319 A.2d 111, 114 (Me. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-12\">United also claimed that Parish did not, as required by the policy, inform it of, or call upon it to defend against, Sarantikis\u2019s suit. In view of our construction of the exclusionary clause, we do not reach the questions whether Parish complied with the conditions of the policy, or whether, in view of any such failure, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 112, requires indemnification of Parish by United.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In contrast to the present complaint, the plaintiff in the underlying action in <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. at 165-166, alleged only intentional conduct and not negligence. We held that, under the disclaimer of liability in its policy, the insurer had no duty to defend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\">There is no allegation that the plaintiff fell because of the inadequate lighting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The policy also contained a sexual molestation exclusion but the court relied only on' the assault and/or battery exclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\u201c13.
