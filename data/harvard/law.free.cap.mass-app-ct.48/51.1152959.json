David Drinon, an insurance agent undisputedly acting as agent of the defendant insurer, Middlesex Insurance Company, represented to the plaintiff, who frequently drove Egan\u2019s automobile, that \u201cin order to be properly insured\u201d she was required to be listed as an additional operator on Egan\u2019s motor vehicle liability policy issued by the insurer and that she would then receive the same coverage as Egan. The policy promised to pay damages caused by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>uninsured or underinsured auto to or for \u201cyou, or any household member\u201d and defined \u201cyou\u201d as \u201cthe person named on the Coverage Selections Page.\u201d Although Egan was listed as owner of the policy, the plaintiff\u2019s name appeared on the coverage selections page as an operator along with Egan\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In October, 1987, the plaintiff was seriously injured when the automobile she was driving was struck by a vehicle driven by a third party. She obtained $25,000 under the third party\u2019s insurance coverage and $10,000 under her own policy\u2019s underinsured motorist provisions; she then sought underinsurance benefits under Egan\u2019s policy (which carried $100,000 in such benefits). The insurer denied coverage on the ground that the plaintiff was not in fact a \u201chousehold member\u201d as defined in Egan\u2019s policy because she was not \u201crelated ... by blood, marriage or adoption.\u201d The plaintiff then brought the instant complaint against Drinon and the insurer seeking (as amended) (1) a declaration that she was entitled to underinsurance benefits under Egan\u2019s policy by virtue of being specifically identified and named on the coverage selections page, and (2) damages from Drinon and the insurer on the bases of (a) Drinon\u2019s negligent misrepresentations of coverage, which bound his insurer principal, and (b) Drinon\u2019s relied-upon promise of coverage, which created an enforceable contract between the plaintiff and the insurer that the latter breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Several months before the scheduled trial, the plaintiff moved, with Drinon\u2019s assent, for voluntary dismissal of \u201cher claims against [Drinon] . . . with prejudice and without costs or attorneys [\u2019] fees to either party, all rights of appeal waived,\u201d which motion was subsequently allowed by the court. See Mass. R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2), 365 Mass. 803 (1974). Although the motion additionally stated that \u201cthe Plaintiff is pursuing her claims against the Defendant Middlesex Insurance Company, which will remain a party to this suit,\u201d the insurer was not a party nor did it assent to the motion. Just prior to the commencement of trial, the trial judge, without explanatory discussion, allowed summary judgment for the insurer on the plaintiff\u2019s count for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The trial in Superior Court produced a hung jury and ended in a mistrial in November, 1996. A second trial proceeded a few days later, on the theories of negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract. In response to special questions, the second jury found that agent Drinon had promised the plaintiff that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>would receive the same coverage as Egan, that Drinon owed the plaintiff a duty to use reasonable care in providing information about the policy, that Drinon\u2019s statement was made negligently, was material, and was made with the intent that the plaintiff rely on it, and that the plaintiff reasonably did rely as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The insurer moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (n.o.v.) or for a new trial, on the strength of <em>Elias </em>v. <em>Unisys Corp., </em>410 Mass. 479, 481-484 (1991), which held that, where a defendant principal is liable to an injured plaintiff only derivatively, i.e., by reason of the negligent actions of its agent and pursuant to the doctrine of respondeat superior, a general release given in separate settlement by the plaintiff to the agent precludes any further action against the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The trial judge ruled that, while the question was close, there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to have found that Drinon\u2019s statement was a false representation of fact rather than opinion and that the plaintiff relied on his statement to her detriment, and so deni\u00e9d the insurer\u2019s motion for a new trial. The judge allowed judgment n.o.v. in part, however, agreeing with the insurer\u2019s <em>Elias </em>argument as to the negligence claim and concluding that the dismissal with prejudice as to Drinon barred any claim against the insurer arising out of Drinon\u2019s negligent misrepresentation. The judge denied judgment n.o.v. as to the plaintiff\u2019s contract claim based on Drinon\u2019s promise of coverage, holding that the <em>Elias </em>principle was limited to tort actions. An amended judgment was entered declaring that the Egan policy did not entitle the plaintiff to underinsurance benefits either as a household member or on the ground that she was named in the coverage selections page, but also that the plaintiff was entitled to underinsured motorist benefits under the Egan policy on the basis of her contract claim. The parties cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">1. <em>Declaratory relief. </em>The plaintiff asserts that the trial judge erred in allowing the insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on her declaratory relief count. We agree,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but it is unnecessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>to remand the matter in light of our affirmance of the judge\u2019s rulings with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s contract claim. See <em>infra </em>at <em>56-57.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">2. <em>Judgment n.o.v. as to plaintiff\u2019s tort claim. </em>The plaintiff also challenges the judge\u2019s rulings based on <em>Elias </em>v. <em>Unisys Corp., supra, </em>that the voluntary dismissal of Drinon, with prejudice, was conclusive as to the derivative tort liability of the insurer as Drinon\u2019s principal and that the dismissal was \u201cin a practical sense in all material respects\u201d equivalent to a release. She first contends, without recourse to case authority or relevant policy considerations, that <em>Elias </em>should be confined to its facts, i.e., situations involving releases, because of its alleged \u201cdraconian impact.\u201d Substantively, but somewhat inconsistently, she asserts that the language in her dismissal motion, noting that she was continuing to pursue her claims against the insurer as a party defendant, should operate in the same way as an explicit exception contained in a general release or covenant not to sue. Compare <em>Karcher </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>303 Mass. 303, 308 (1939); <em>Naukeag Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rideout, </em>351 Mass. 353, 356-357 (1966). We see no merit in these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The only claim that the plaintiff asserted against Drinon individually was for his negligent misrepresentations, and the only legal basis she had to sue the insurer on account of that negligence was its vicarious liability based on respondeat superior (no separate wrongdoing on its part ever having been alleged, much less proven). The judge correctly observed that the dismissal with prejudice of the only claim and actionable issue against Drinon and the only basis for a finding of tort li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ability on the part of the insurer constituted \u201can adjudication on the merits\u201d \u2014 in Drinon\u2019s and therefore in the insurer\u2019s favor under the rationale of <em>Elias </em>v. <em>Unisys, supra </em>\u2014 \u201cas fully and completely as if the order had been entered after [a] trial,\u201d <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Jamaica Plain Co-op. Bank, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 153, 157 n.8 (1979), and definitively resolved the only tort liability issue in the case against the plaintiff. Such a result triggers the operation of res judicata principles \u201cand bars further litigation of all matters that were . . . [thus] adjudicated in the action.\u201d <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Moxley, </em>407 Mass. 633, 637 (1990), quoting from <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass. 21, 23 (1988). See <em>Quest Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Zepp, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 497 n.12 (1990); <em>Gangl </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 561, 563 (1994) (a judgment holding an agent or servant not negligent \u201ccompels a similar finding, as matter of law, for the principal or master\u201d). A bar arising from a voluntary dismissal with prejudice of a claim (or an outcome-determinative issue) is as conceptually acceptable as one flowing from a general release or covenant not to sue, since in all three scenarios the \u201cterms and conditions are within the discretion of the parties\u201d thereto. <em>Tuite &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shawmut Bank, N.A., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 751, 755 (1997). Indeed, the preclusive effect of the dismissal should, if anything, be entitled to presumptively greater force, since it was presented to a judge for approval and enshrined in the equivalent of a judgment, <em>ibid., </em>rendered in favor of the only party at fault, in the absence of whose wrongdoing the blameless (as to the tort claim and the issue of negligence) insurer would have no liability. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7\u00a7 19, 24, 29, 49, 51 (1982). This appears particularly appropriate in light of the plaintiff\u2019s forgone opportunity to have moved, under Mass. R.Civ.P. 60(b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), to set aside the dismissal and judgment thereon, if she did not intend that dismissal to have preclusive effect against the insurer, once the latter had asserted such a consequence in its motions for a directed verdict and judgment n.o.v. See <em>Tuite &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shawmut Bank, N.A., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. at 755-757, and authorities there cited.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Accordingly, we uphold the judge\u2019s partial allowance of the insurer\u2019s judgment n.o.v. motion as to the plaintiff\u2019s tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">3. <em>Denial of judgment n.o.v. as to the plaintiff\u2019s contract claim. </em>The thrust of the insurer\u2019s appeal is that the principle of <em>Elias </em>v. <em>Unisys, supra, </em>should apply equally to actions based upon contract. Its brief, however, makes only conclusory assertions on that issue and offers no coherent or reasoned argument, nor citations to pertinent authority, to support the point. Its argument is, therefore, unavailing to effect a reversal of the judge\u2019s ruling'declining to extend that principle from the derivative tort liability context in which it was grounded. Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). See and compare <em>Zora </em>v. <em>State Ethics Commn., </em>415 Mass. 640, 642 n.3 (1993); <em>Forbush </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 696, 698 n.4 (1994); <em>New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 725 n.2 (1996); <em>Keville </em>v. <em>McKeever, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 140, 155 (1997); <em>Tuite &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shawmut Bank, N.A., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. at 754, 756 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In any event, the insurer\u2019s argument misapprehends the fundamental conceptual distinction between a principal\u2019s liability for tortious acts of its agent and the principal\u2019s contractual liability for enforceable promises made by its agent in the conduct of authorized transactions. The former liability is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>exclusively vicarious, having been imposed by operation of law notwithstanding the principal\u2019s lack of fault or involvement in the actionable transaction. The latter liability, by contrast, is effectively consensual and based upon the ancient principle (albeit a fiction) of the law that \u201cqui facit per alium, facit per se,\u201d i.e., the contractual act of the agent has the same legal effect as if done by the principal and makes the principal the actual party to and obligor of the undertaking. See <em>Fore River Shipbuilding Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Mass. 137, 140-141 (1924); 1 Blackstone, Commentaries *429. Compare Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 901 (1979), with Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 344 (1981). The judge rightly recognized that distinction in ruling that <em>Elias </em>v. <em>Unisys, supra, </em>has no bearing on a breach of contract claim and does not preclude the plaintiff\u2019s recovery on her contract theory.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order granting summary judgment for the insurer on the plaintiff\u2019s count I for declaratory relief is reversed, and the amended judgment as to count I is vacated. In all other respects, the amended judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The record, including the plaintiffs uncontroverted affidavit, clearly reveals policy ambiguity and genuine issues of material fact regarding the respective intentions attributable to the parties at the time the policy was written and the insureds\u2019 reasonable expectations of coverage attendant upon the policy provisions and Drinon\u2019s representations \u2014 ambiguity and issues created, not by statute or language mandated by the Commissioner of Insurance, contrast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>392 Mass. 537, 541 (1984), but rather by the specific inclusion of the plaintiff in the coverage selections page (thereby arguably identifying her as either a \u201chousehold member\u201d or the named insured under the policy definitions), as well as by the representations regarding coverage made by the insurer\u2019s authorized agent and the plaintiff\u2019s expectations of coverage as communicated to that agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The existence of substantial factual questions relating directly to the central issue of the parties\u2019 intentions rendered impossible a definitive interpretation of the scope of coverage under the Egan policy without further evidentiary development, and thus precluded summary judgment with respect to the requested declaratory relief on the state of this record. See <em>Robert Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>362 Mass. 751, 753-755 (1973); <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>393 Mass. 81, 86 (1984), and cases cited; <em>Flesner </em>v. <em>Technical Communications Corp., </em>410 Mass. 805, 809 (1991), and cases cited; <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Estin, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 392, 395 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The plaintiff cannot, of course, enjoy duplicative recovery under the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We do not view the discussion in <em>Atlas Tack Corp. </em>v. <em>DiMasi, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 66, 70-72 (1994) (which the parties did not cite), as subversive of our conclusion. There, we noted that \u201cthe very specific language\u201d in a release given by the plaintiff to a defendant lawyer charged with malpractice (which stated that the plaintiff \u201cspecifically does not release\u201d claims against the two other lawyer defendants who were being sued solely on the ground that they were partners by estoppel of the negligent lawyer and therefore vicariously li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>able for his malpractice) was sufficient to prevent barring the plaintiff\u2019s action against the innocent lawyers on a theory of vicarious liability. We do not now have to abandon the conclusion there reached \u2022\u2014 that it \u201cappears to be . . . the law of this Commonwealth that a covenant not to sue or release will not discharge a vicariously liable party if the covenant contains an express reservation of rights against that party,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 71-72 \u2014 to deem it inapplicable to the instant situation, which involved an effective judgment upon a dismissal with prejudice of the actual tortfeasor, for the reasons discussed in this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Moreover, the supposed reservation of rights here was not, unlike that in <em>Atlas Tack, </em>\u201cvery specific.\u201d There, the only claim reserved was the vicarious tort liability count against the supposed partners of the responsible party. Here, the plaintiff also asserted a nonderivative claim against the insurer (in her declaratory judgment count) for coverage as an insured under the policy, as well as a nojnderivative contract claim against the insurer (see section 3, <em>infra). </em>It cannot, therefore, fairly be said that the plaintiff here, in contrast to <em>Atlas Tack, </em>was \u201cspecifically\u201d reserving her derivative claims against the insurer based upon its agent\u2019s misrepresentations merely by announcing, ex parte, that she \u201cis pursuing her [unspecified] claims against\u201d the insurer. To take advantage of the principle stated in <em>Atlas Tack, </em>the document must \u201ccontain[] an express reservation of the covenantor\u2019s rights,\u201d <em>Karcher </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>303 Mass. at 308, in \u201cvery specific language.\u201d <em>Atlas Tack, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Although the insurer characterizes the contractual obligation alleged here as based upon \u201cpromissory estoppel\u201d theory, it is clear that such situations are now treated by our law as ordinary contracts and enforceable pursuant to traditional contract theory. See <em>Loranger Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>E.F. Hauserman Co., </em>376 Mass. 757, 760-761 (1978); <em>McAndrew </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Cambridge, </em>20 Mass.
