Lewis, is material to this appeal. Lewis was doing business as Eastern Waterproofing Company (Eastern) and was waterproofing a building owned by the other defendant in the prior action when Doyon fell to his death from Eastern\u2019s scaffolding. The suit alleged negligent maintenance by Eastern of its equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The present action is between Eastern\u2019s two liability insurers as to which one had the duty to defend Eastern and to indemnify in the event of an adverse judgment. Hartford Insurance Company (Hartford), Eastern\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability insurer, declined to defend the claim, alleging that Doyon was not an employee of Eastern and that it would not be responsible for defending against the claim even if Doyon had been an employee. Peerless Insurance Company (Peerless), Eastern\u2019s general liability insurer, undertook defense of the claim and eventually settled it for $125,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Peerless brought the present action for indemnification, alleging that it was Hartford that had the duty to defend against the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Peerless\u2019s action came to this court once before, on a report that we discharged as improvidently made, see <em>Peerless Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins. Co., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 534, 537 (1993). In discharging the report we implied by way of dictum that as between the workers\u2019 compensation insurer and the general liability insurer, it was the former that had the broad, general duty of defending claims that arose from a worker\u2019s injury or death, regardless whether the claim was asserted before the Department of Industrial Accidents or a court, and that if the exclusivity of the administrative forum precluded the availability of an action in court, that was a matter that should be raised in the normal course of defending the claim in court, not as a reason for refusing to defend. <em>Id. </em>at 536-537. We followed our <em>Peerless </em>holding in a subsequent case, <em>HDH Corp. </em>v. <em>Atlantic Charter Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 131, 134-135 (1996). On further appellate review, however, that decision was reversed, see 425 Mass. 433 (1997). The latter decision, starting from the proposition that an insurer has a duty to defend only if the allegations, of the complainant are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they state a claim covered by the terms of the insurance policy, reasoned that the Atlantic Charter Insurance Company (Atlantic Charter) policy, a standard workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability policy, under coverage A<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> insured only for claims brought under the workers\u2019 compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>tion act \u2014 i.e., claims for compensation brought before the department, not claims for damages brought in a civil action before a court <em>(id. </em>at 436-438) \u2014 and that coverage B, \u201cthe employers\u2019 liability portion of the insurance policy, is intended to provide coverage in the rare circumstance in which an employee who has affirmatively opted out [of the compensation scheme under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24,] brings a tort action for personal injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Following the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in the <em>HDH </em>case and in reliance thereon, a Superior Court judge allowed Hartford\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the still pending <em>Peerless </em>case, and Peerless claimed the appeal that is before us now.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Peerless concedes, as it must, that, under the <em>HDH </em>decision, Hartford had no potential liability under coverage A of its policy because the claim was not one for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. It argues, however, that Hartford had potential liability under coverage B, which by its terms covers the potential liability of an employer not only where the employee has affirmatively elected under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24, to forgo compensation benefits in favor of common law remedies but also in any other situation in which the employer may be sued for an injury or death arising from the injured person\u2019s or decedent\u2019s employment. Such situations, Peerless argues, include suits brought by anyone not subject to the tort bar of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 68, for such employment-related injuries or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Peerless argues that this wrongful death action brought by Doyon\u2019s administrator on behalf of Doyon\u2019s parents is not subject to the tort bar. The argument has two parts. The first is that Doyon\u2019s accident occurred in 1982, during the period between the decision in <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>381 Mass. 507, 519-530 (1980), and the passage of St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 35, which rewrote G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24. During that period, Peerless argues, an employee\u2019s waiver under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24, of his right to bring common law civil actions against his employer for on-the-job injuries did not extend to his family or dependents who might have common law claims for loss of consortium. (Peerless concedes that the wrongful death action would have been barred had the accident occurred after the effective date of the 1985 legislation.) The second part of Peerless\u2019s argument is that the \u00a7 68 tort bar did not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Doyon\u2019s parents because Doyon\u2019s parents were not entitled to benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The latter argument is based on a misreading of \u00a7 68. The words \u201cwho are entitled to the benefits provided by said sections\u201d refer to the public employees (\u201claborers, workmen, or mechanics\u201d) of the Commonwealth or subdivisions of the Commonwealth which have accepted the public employee workers\u2019 compensation scheme set out in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 69-75, inclusive. The words do not modify \u201cemployees of an insured person,\u201d a phrase which, because of a provision of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(4) (last par., as appearing in St. 1945, c. 369), includes, \u201cwhen the employee is dead, ... his legal representatives, dependents and other persons to whom compensation may be payable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The principal obstacle to Peerless\u2019s argument lies in the wrongful death statute itself, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, which, as Peerless concedes, is the exclusive procedural remedy for recovery of wrongful death damages in a civil action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 2 provides (as appearing in St. 1973, c. 699, \u00a7 1) that \u201cthe liability of an employer to a person in his employment shall not be governed by this section.\u201d In conjunction with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 68, that section has been read consistently to preclude any civil action for wrongful death of an employee who is subject to the provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation laws. See <em>McDonnell </em>v. <em>Berkshire St. Ry. Co., </em>243 Mass. 94, 95 (1922) (\u201cThe employer who is insured under the workmen\u2019s compensation act is relieved of all statutory liability, including that for death of an employee under the employers\u2019 liability act\u201d); <em>Cozzo </em>v. <em>Atlantic Refining Co., 299 </em>Mass. 260, 262 (1938) (\u201cNor can an action at law be maintained against such employer [i.e., one who is insured under the workers\u2019 compensation law] to recover for the death of an employee resulting from such injury [i.e., one arising out of and in the course of his employment],\u201d citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 68); <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>381 Mass. at 528 (\u201cWe acknowledge that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 1[4] and 68, bar a deceased employee\u2019s dependents from recovering under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 2B, for loss of consortium, as against an employer covered by G. L. c. 152\u201d); <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Wrentham, </em>398 Mass. 550, 555 (1986) (\u201cNeither do[es] . . . <em>Ferriter </em>create an independent right of recovery for lost consortium when the victim suffers death rather than injury\u201d); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Westover Finishing Co., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 58, 60 n.3 (1987) (\u201cThe plaintiffs could and did recover for loss of the decedent\u2019s consortium and parental society prior to her death, under <em>Ferriter . . . </em>[b]ut they could not recover for loss of consortium and parental society after the decedent\u2019s death\u201d). Our earlier decision in this case indicated the same. See 34 Mass. App. Ct. at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The statutory scheme, read as a whole, precludes maintaining a wrongful death action against the employer for the death of an employee arising from his or her employment when the employer is insured under the workers\u2019 compensation act. Eastern was so insured. Consequently, if Doyon was Eastern\u2019s employee at the time of his death, Doyon\u2019s family could not maintain a wrongful death action against Eastern. The fact that the compensation law also deprived them of a remedy because they were not dependent on Doyon for their support does not change this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Because the Hartford policy only covered liabilities Eastern might incur on account of injuries to or deaths of employees, the complaint in the wrongful death action on behalf of Doyon\u2019s parents could not result in a liability for which coverage was provided under the Hartford policy. It follows that Hartford had no obligation to defend or indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The record indicates that $125,000 was Peerless\u2019s share of a $350,000 settlement agreement with both defendants, the owner of the building undertaking to pay the difference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The <em>HDH </em>decision indicates that the Atlantic Charter policy referred to coverage A as Part One and coverage B as Part Two.

L. c. 229, \u00a7 2B, the provision for punitive damages when death is caused by the employer\u2019s negligence, is expressly barred by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 68.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
