In addition the judge set forth his reasons for the sentence, \u201ccertainly the longest that [he had] imposed on similar crimes.\u201d He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">\u201cAt the time this sentence was fashioned, the Court considered three factors: first, the defendant\u2019s rather extensive criminal record; second, that these offenses present a particularly serious threat in Barnstable County where demographics indicate that elderly people living alone in relative isolation are easy targets for home invasions; and, third, the effect upon these elderly victims when this husky young male came upon them in their homes in the night. Although the defendant is technically correct that there was no physical touching, the psychological effects of these home invasions had to be devastating. For all of these reasons, the Court believes that the sentences, although in excess of the guidelines, were appropriate for the conduct of this defendant at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201cThe Court finds no evidence that justice was not done at the time of sentencing. There was a clear message that this type of conduct would not be tolerated in this county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The defendant appeals, claiming that the judge abused his discretion by relying on \u201cinvalid factors\u201d in originally imposing the sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">We face the unusual circumstance of an appeal, based not on the grounds relied on in support of the motion, all of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>properly were rejected,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but upon information supplied by the judge as to the rationale for his sentence. Consequently, the claim of illegal sentencing might more correctly be raised by a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(a), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). However, because the issue has constitutional dimension, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>390 Mass. 254, 259 (1983), and, in the interest of judicial economy, compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preziosi, </em>399 Mass. 748, 750 (1987), we consider the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s reference to \u201cdemographics\u201d runs afoul of the rule that judicial reliance in sentencing on information which has no basis in the evidence or in materials produced at the sentencing hearing requires remand for resentencing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>370 Mass. 217, 221 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lebron, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 970, 972 (1987). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, ante </em>658, 663-664 (2000). At the defendant\u2019s trial, evidence was introduced of his breaking and entering several homes after ripping out exterior telephone wires, and then terrorizing and robbing the elderly occupants. At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor spoke of the \u201cfrailty\u201d of the victims and the seriousness of their being subjected to home invasions at their ages. The point essentially was repeated at the revocation hearing by prosecution references to the crimes being \u201cagainst the elderly, a very vulnerable sector,\u201d and \u201ca very vulnerable portion of society.\u201d Given the trial evidence, the prosecutor\u2019s statements, and the judge\u2019s prefatory reference to \u201cthese offenses,\u201d his allusion to \u201celderly people\u201d clearly appears to be a description of the victims of the defendant\u2019s crimes. Even if we assume that the judge viewed certain \u201cdemographics\u201d with which he was familiar as somehow \u201cindicating] that elderly people living alone in relative isolation are easy targets for home invasions,\u201d he was merely stating the obvious. Reliance on such a truism in sentencing is not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">As is more likely, the judge\u2019s reference to \u201cdemographics\u201d may have reflected his belief that compared with other places, Barnstable County had a greater proportion of \u201celderly people living alone in relative isolation.\u201d This view coincides with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>judge\u2019s characterization of the sentences as constituting \u201ca clear message that this type of conduct would not be tolerated in this county,\u201d and leads the defendant to argue, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 322 (1997), that the judge improperly targeted his deterrent message toward Barn-stable County. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 329, this court ordered resentencing of a defendant convicted of forcible rape of a child where the sentencing judge indicated in a memorandum that one of the reasons for a \u201csentence above the guidelines\u201d was for the purpose of \u201cdeterrence in the Athol area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326. He stated further that \u201c[t]he Athol area seems to have more than its share of child abuse cases and a large number of young shiftless men who have little or no regard for . . . others.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Stating that it was the judge\u2019s purpose \u201cto target a message to residents of a particular town for the object of deterrence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 327, this court noted that \u201ctarget deterrence\u201d is not supported by the case law and that in any event there was no support for the judge\u2019s assertion that Athol had \u201cmore than its share of child abuse cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328. Those circumstances are far removed from this case in which no view of the judge\u2019s statement supports the conclusion that he believed that Barnstable County experienced a disproportionate number of home invasion crimes or that he was tailoring his message to any indigenous population. Instead, he recognized the vulnerability to home invasion of a segment of the county\u2019s population and delivered a deterrent message, not to an identifiable or targeted group, but to an undifferentiated general audience.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">In broad terms, general deterrence, as distinguished from special deterrence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> has been described as \u201cjustif[ying] sentences in the name of discouraging the general public from recourse to crime.\u201d Campbell, Law of Sentencing 25 (2d ed. 1991). Although some jurisdictions reject general deterrence as a sentencing objective, especially when used to enhance sentences beyond guidelines, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 328 n.3, it is recognized as a sentencing goal in our case law, as conceded by the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>414 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Mass. 88, 92 (1993).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the inclusion by the judge of a message of general deterrence as one of the factors in his sentencing rationale does not invalidate the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\n<em>Order denying motion to revoke and revise sentence affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-14\">The defendant received a base sentence of thirty to forty years on an indictment of unarmed robbery of a person over sixty-five years of age and several similar and lesser sentences concurrent with that base sentence on various breaking and entering indictments. Certain other related convictions were filed with the defendant\u2019s consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b696-15\">The record does not reveal whether the motion was pressed earlier. Although there are time limitations for filing a motion to \u201crevise or revoke\u201d under Mass.R.Crim.P. 29, 378 Mass. 899 (1979), there is no defined limitation with regard to the time within which the motion must be heard and decided. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>421 Mass. 472, 473 n.2 (1995). Compare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>386 Mass. 291, 296 (1982) (\u201cconstru[ing] rule 29(a) to preclude consideration of a motion to revise and revoke th\u00e1t has been filed within sixty days after the disposition of an appeal that has lain dormant . . . for the unreasonable period of more than nine years\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barclay, </em>424 Mass. 377, 380 (1997) (six years an unreasonable time for consideration of motion to revise or revoke). Here, the hearing was preceded by a dismissal of an appeal of the sentences by the Appellate Division of the Superior Court in 1993 and a decision of this court in an unpublished memorandum entered in 1996 affirming all of the convictions except for two of the breaking and entering convictions which were reversed and remanded for resentencing as daytime crimes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bland, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 1110 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The original grounds were to the effect that the defendant\u2019s criminal activity was caused by his cocaine addiction, that no victim was physically harmed, that the sentences were outside certain guidelines, and that the defendant\u2019s postconviction activities should be considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The difference between general and special deterrence has been dramatically described by the observation that \u201cthe former operates through remembering the lash on another\u2019s back, and the latter through remembering it on one\u2019s own.\u201d Fitzmaurice &amp; Pease, The Psychology of Judicial Sentencing 48-49 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\">As noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 327 n.2, the Massachusetts Sentencing Commission in its Report to the General Court (April 10, 1996), pursuant to G. L. c. 211E, does not include deterrence in its list of <em>nonexclusive </em>mitigating and aggravating factors in just punishment analysis. See Massachusetts Sentencing Commission, Sentencing Guidelines at 17 and attachment D (February, 1998). The Report at 4, however, also states that \u201c[b]y emphasizing punishment as the primary purpose of sentencing, the commission does not minimize the importance of other purposes such as deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
