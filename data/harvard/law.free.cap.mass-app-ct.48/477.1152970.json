Each plaintiff brought a separate action in the Superior Court for negligence against the defendant (MBTA), the Millar Elevator Service Company (Millar), and the Fairview Cleaning Company, Inc. (Fairview). The actions were consolidated for trial. At the trial before a jury in the Superior Court, the only defendant remaining was the MBTA because a dismissal had been entered in favor of Millar and a default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>judgment had been entered against Fairview in both actions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury returned verdicts against the MBTA. From the judgments<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against it and from the order denying the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, for a new trial, the MBTA filed this appeal claiming only that the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that the defendant Fairview had been determined to be liable as matter of law. We affirm the judgments and the order denying the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">At trial, the plaintiffs\u2019 case against the MBTA was based on evidence that the MBTA was negligent in allowing a Fairview employee to have access to the key controlling the escalator. The MBTA presented the judge with a request for instructions and special questions. The requested instructions did not contain the instruction the MBTA now argues that the judge should have given. In its request for special questions to be submitted to the jury, the MBTA did ask that the jury determine whether Fairview was negligent and whether its negligence caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. After inquiring whether the MBTA was alleging comparative negligence and after having been told by the MBTA\u2019s counsel that it was not, the judge declined to put the questions to the jury and told counsel he would \u201csave [his] rights.\u201d The MBTA now claims that its counsel\u2019s conversation with the judge was sufficient to preserve its right to argue on appeal that the judge should have instructed the jury that Fair-view had been determined to be liable by virtue of the default judgments and, alternatively, even if it was not, that the judge had the duty to do so to fulfill his obligation to instruct the jury on the legal principles governing all the essential issues presented. The MBTA argues that the failure to give the instruction resulted in irreparable harm to it because the jury were left to speculate about Fairview\u2019s status and responsibility and, instead of being asked to decide whether the MBTA was also responsible for the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, they were only being asked to decide if the MBTA was solely responsible for their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Even if we were to give the most generous reading to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>MBTA\u2019s counsel\u2019s conversation with the judge relating to the status of Fairview in this case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the MBTA never requested the particular instruction it now argues should have been given. The thrust of counsel\u2019s conversation with the judge focused on the MBTA\u2019s request that the jury be asked to determine Fairview\u2019s negligence which, of course, would have been pointless if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>particular instruction had been given. The MBTA is correct, however, that, even if it did not request the instruction, it was entitled to an adequate charge on the controlling issues. <em>De-Sanctis </em>v. <em>Lynn Water &amp; Sewer Commn., </em>423 Mass. 112, 118-119 n.11 (1996). <em>Carvalho </em>v. <em>State Band Club, Inc., </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 755 (1975). However, the fact that Fairview had been defaulted was not relevant to a determination of the MBTA\u2019s liability. Here, the plaintiffs\u2019 case was based on the theory that the MBTA was negligent in entrusting keys to the escalator to Fairview\u2019s employee without proper instruction or supervision as to its use. The judge properly instructed the jury that the MBTA could not be held liable for the actions of a person who was not its employee but could be held liable if the jury determined that the MBTA was itself negligent in allowing that person to have a key that controlled the operation of the escalator and its negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Those instructions were not only adequate to provide the jury with the necessary guidance to decide the issues relating to the MBTA\u2019s liability, but also did not create a risk that the jury\u2019s fact-finding process was distorted in any manner. Cf. <em>Morea </em>v. <em>Cosco, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 601, 603-604 (1996) (evidence of settlement inadmissible on issue of liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Further, in order to raise on appeal the issue of the trial judge\u2019s failure to give a particular instruction, the appealing party must have lodged an objection to the omission of the instruction with the trial judge before the jury retired to consider its verdict. Mass.R.Civ.P. 51(b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). The MBTA asserts that it made a timely objection to the judge\u2019s failure to give the particular instruction. The MBTA apparently relies upon its belief that its counsel\u2019s conversation with the judge relating to Fairview\u2019s default status and the special questions amounted not only to a request for the particular instruction but also constituted an objection to its omission. In making an objection counsel must state \u201cdistinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d Mass.R.Civ.P. 51(b). <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Corp., </em>8 Mass. App. 770, 773 (1979). In this case, counsel failed to do so. He cannot assume that the matter to which he objects or the grounds therefor are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>apparent from his conversation with the judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Laveck </em>v. <em>Pascoe Pizza, Inc., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 935, 936-937 (1990) (\u201c[cjonversation, however, does not an objection make\u201d where counsel fails to state distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection). The judge\u2019s comment that the MBTA\u2019s rights were saved could only be construed as directed to the judge\u2019s refusal to ask the special questions submitted by the MBTA where counsel never asked the judge to give the particular instruction at issue. Consequently, the MBTA has failed properly to preserve the issue for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Default judgments had been entered against Fairview for failure to defend, but no assessment of damages hearing had been held to complete the proceedings against it.

You\u2019re not responsible per se for the actions of the employee that\u2019s the Fairview Cleaner. The negligence of the M.B.T.A., if any, is in allowing the key to come into the hands of these \u2014 of this employee under whatever circumstances the jury finds he had the key.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Mr. Condon: \u201cI understand that, but \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The Court: \u201cThat\u2019s the negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Mr. Condon: \u201cI mean is the Fairview employee and their position as defendant defaulted?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">The Court: \u201cOh, they\u2019re defaulted. They\u2019re defaulted. If they\u2019re the only negligent party, then, you know, so be it. The M.B.T.A. is not negligent. But they\u2019re not before the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">Mr. Condon: \u201cRight. But as far as the special questions to the jury, will there be a question concerning the negligence \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">The Court: \u201cWhy? Why would you ask the jury about the negligence of someone who\u2019s not before the Court? That would just confuse the issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">Mr. Condon: \u201cWell, I think it \u2014 in not doing so, it\u2019s sort of was it the M.B.T.A.\u2019s fault or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">The Court: \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">Mr. Condon: \u201cBut you\u2019ve got another defendant who isn\u2019t even here to defend themselves who hasn\u2019t even made the effort to defend themselves. So, the fact that the jury doesn\u2019t have that \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-17\">The Court: \u201cYou will certainly argue, and perhaps rightfully \u2014 perhaps rightfully, well, this is \u2014 we did what we were supposed to do. This is clearly Fairview\u2019s baby. They\u2019re the one\u2019s that are responsible. Therefore, my client is not responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-18\">Mr. Condon: \u201cBut I guess what I\u2019m suggesting \u2014\u25a0 and I had prepared some special questions to the jury also. And basically \u2014 but I\u2019ve got Millar in there as part of the mix. Was the M.B.T.A. negligent? Was Fairview Cleaning negligent?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-19\">The Court: \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask about parties who are not before the court. I think that takes the eye of the jury off the ball, what they should determine. Whether the M.B.T.A. was negligent and whether that negligence was a proximate cause. Was it foreseeable that that negligence would cause the injury which actually happened. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to ask them. And I\u2019ll save your rights.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u201cCautious counsel, however, wisely will renew any earlier objection with specificity after the charge unless the judge then instructs otherwise.\u201d <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Southland Corp., </em>416 Mass. 62, 67 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
