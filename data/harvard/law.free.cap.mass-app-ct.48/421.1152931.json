Judgment entered for the plaintiff on January 13, 1995. By motion under Mass.R.Civ.R 60(b)(4), or, in the alternative, under 60(b)(6),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 365 Mass. 829 (1974), filed on December 17, 1997, almost three years after the entry of judgment for the plaintiff, the defendants attacked the judgment as void because \u201cthe court from which it issue[d] lacked jurisdiction over the parties, lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter, [and] failed to provide due process of law.\u201d <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Sannella, </em>400 Mass. 392, 395 (1987). We affirm the denial of the motion as none of these claims has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The circumstances of the January, 1995 judgment were as follows. The defendants failed to comply with discovery orders, and subsequent to an order of the Superior Court informing them that a default would enter if they failed to obey the order within thirty days, a default entered pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 55(a), 365 Mass. 822 (1974). After hearings on damages at which the individual defendant twice personally appeared, judgment entered for the plaintiff. Although the defendants originally appealed the judgment, they did not pursue their appeal, and it was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">When the plaintiff learned that the individual defendant who previously had been considered judgment proof had recently acquired assets, he brought an action in New York on July 25, 1997, to enforce the 1995 judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter the defendants filed the rule 60(b) motion to vacate that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">1. <em>Personal jurisdiction. </em>The 1995 judgment is not void for want of personal jurisdiction. The defendants\u2019 active participa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>tion in the proceedings, albeit they alleged the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction in their answer, amounted to a waiver of that defense. See <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 78 (1998). Not only did the individual defendant appear for two hearings on damages, but the defendants filed motions seeking to disqualify counsel, to stay discovery, and to remove the default. The defense of lack of personal jurisdiction was not asserted in any of their motions or brought to the court\u2019s attention prior to the entry of the 1995 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"ACK\">2. <em>Subject matter jurisdiction. </em>The judgment is also not void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \u201cIn the interest of finality, the concept of void judgments is narrowly construed.\u201d <em>O\u2019Dea </em>v. <em>J.A.L., Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 449, 455 (1991). \u201cOnly in the rare instance of a clear usurpation of power will a judgment be rendered void.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Sannella, </em>400 Mass. at 395, in turn quoting from <em>Lubben </em>v. <em>Selective Serv. Sys., </em>453 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir. 1972). See <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>419 Mass. 377, 382 (1995); <em>Eastern Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 140, 143 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The defendants claim that the action should have been a derivative one and that the plaintiff did not have standing to bring an individual action. As indicated in <em>Litman </em>v. <em>PrudentialBache Properties, Inc., </em>611 A.2d 12, 15 (Del. 1992), cited by the defendants, \u201ca shareholder may bring a direct action for injuries done to him in his individual capacity if he has an injury which is separate and distinct from that suffered by other shareholders.\u201d See <em>Reeve </em>v. <em>Folly Hill Ltd. Partnership, 36 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 90, 97 (1994). Here there were questions of the extent of Sarin\u2019s payment for his interest in the limited partnership which, the defendants alleged, bore on his right to discovery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus there were at least some issues in which the plaintiff had a direct individual interest<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and hence had standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">More important, even if the plaintiff had no such direct interest, the defendants may not raise the issue of standing in a rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>60(b) motion. Whether the facts of a given case meet the standard for exercising jurisdiction \u2014 here whether the plaintiff has standing \u2014 has been termed a \u201c quasi-j urisdictional \u2019 \u2019 determination. <em>Lubben </em>v. <em>Selective Serv. Sys., </em>453 F.2d at 649. \u201cThese facts do not go to the subject matter of jurisdiction, \u2018but to a preliminary fact necessary to be proven to authorize the court to act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649 n.14, quoting from <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Union River Logging R.R., </em>147 U.S. 165, 174 (1893). While such a quasi-jurisdictional determination can be challenged on <em>appeal, </em>unless it is \u201ca clear usurpation of power,\u201d it is immune from attack under rule 60(b). <em>Id. </em>at 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Similarly, <em>Coalition of Black Leadership </em>v. <em>Cianci, </em>570 F.2d 12, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1978), held that the consent decree entered in that case could not be challenged for lack of jurisdiction by a motion to vacate. If there was error in determining that there was a case or controversy on the ground that the plaintiff lacked standing, the error should have been corrected by appeal. <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>276 U.S. 311, 326 (1928). See <em>Walling </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>138 F.2d 629, 632-633 (8th Cir. 1943), cert. denied, 321 U.S. 784 (1944), which, relying on <em>General Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>New York Cent. R.R., </em>271 U.S. 228, 230 (1926), reached the same result saying that when a question of standing is determined \u201ctacitly or expressly,\u201d the judgment is one on the merits, is not void even if erroneous, and \u201cis not subject to attack for such an error by motion to vacate.\u201d See generally Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 12 &amp; introductory note to \u00a7 65 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The defendants\u2019 argument that the plaintiff lacks standing under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, may not be raised in this action for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">3. <em>Due process. </em>The defendants\u2019 due process argument based on a claim of incapacity due to Ochsner\u2019s depression, see <em>Gos </em>v. <em>Brownstein, </em>403 Mass. 252, 256 (1988), likewise is without merit. Prior to 1997 no claim was made that Ochsner was suffering from such severe depression that he was unable to comply with the court\u2019s orders. He appeared at the hearings of December 21 and December 27, 1994, and made no claim of incapacity. Indeed, in his affidavit dated December 21, 1994, accompanying his motion to remove the default entered under Mass.R.Civ.P. 55(a), he asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">\u201c6. These financial problems placed me under severe emotional and physical stress and compelled me to consult a physician who prescribed medication for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u201c7. I have recovered to some extent from the shock of these reverses and <em>am now in a position to respond to the </em>Court\u2019s orders.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Rather than showing incapacity, the record supports the judge\u2019s express finding in 1995 that the \u201cdefendants have purposefully and fraudulently tried to conceal their activities from the plaintiff by failing to comply with the discovery order of this court and by failing to provide him with an annual audit\u201d of the limited partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Nothing in Ochsner\u2019s 1997 affidavit warrants the granting of his rule 60(b) motion. In alleging that he had been \u201cunable to . . . comply with court orders\u201d Ochsner also states that \u201c[o]ver time, my depression subsided, and my wife and I returned to investment banking, forming Ochsner Consulting Group. Inc. (\u2018OCG\u2019) in about October 1995.\u201d Thus, on his own account, Ochsner waited for two years prior to the filing of his rule 60(b) motion. The filing was clearly too late. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 72 comment c (1982). It was only after the plaintiff sought to reach his assets that Ochsner filed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Quite apart from the late filing, Ochsner does not meet the criteria set forth in \u00a7 72 of the Restatement, reproduced in the margin,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which, in certain circumstances, permits the setting aside of a judgment where a party was incapacitated and the op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>posing party was on notice of that condition. No such claim can be made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">4. <em>Denial under Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). </em>There was no abuse of discretion in the denial of the defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the default judgment pursuant to rule 60(b)(6). The motion, brought almost three years after the entry of judgment, was not brought within a reasonable time, see <em>Bromfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 254, 258 (1987), and presented no \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d which would warrant relief. See <em>id. </em>at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion to vacate judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Royal Capital Corporation was an original general partner with Neal Ochsner until Royal Capital Financial Corporation was substituted by the partnership as the sole general partner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Unlike rule 60(b)(6), where the decision to vacate is within the judge\u2019s discretion, relief under rule 60(b)(4) is required if the judgment <em>is void.

Hosp., </em>393 Mass 117, 118 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Prior thereto, on July 24, 1997, the plaintiff obtained a judgment bifurcating the earlier judgment so that he had an individual judgment against the individual defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">The parties have not argued, and we do not consider, the effect of the prior pending New York action in which Ochsner claimed in his answer that the 1995 Massachusetts judgment was not entitled to full faith and credit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The general partners defended their admitted failure to provide the plaintiff, a limited partner, with any distributions or information concerning the financial status of the partnership on the basis that the plaintiff was in default under his investor\u2019s promissory note.
