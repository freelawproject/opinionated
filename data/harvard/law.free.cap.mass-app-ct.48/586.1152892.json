An independent medical examiner appointed by a DIA administrative judge subsequently found that she suffered, from \u201cdiffuse [or multiple] chemical sensitivity\u201d syndrome (MCS). Following the proceedings described below, the DIA administrative judge awarded Patterson benefits for her medical expenses (plus costs and attorney\u2019s fees) apportioned between the two organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">After unsuccessful appeals to the reviewing board of the DIA (which summarily affirmed the judge\u2019s decision),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the hospital (which is a self-insurer for workers\u2019 compensation purposes) and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (the workers\u2019 compensation insurer for the foundation) here seek to reverse the judge\u2019s determinations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They contend that the judge committed two major reversible errors:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Liberty faults the judge for concluding that Patterson was an employee of the foundation as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>defined in the workers\u2019 compensation statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Both Liberty and the hospital (which conceded Patterson\u2019s claimed status as its employee) challenge the judge\u2019s adoption of an impartial medical examiner\u2019s opinion as to a causal relationship between Patterson\u2019s claimed medical problems and workplace conditions at the hospital.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that the judge did err as asserted with respect to the causation issue and reverse the DIA decision on that ground.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"><em>Factual summary.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Patterson applied for appointment to the professional staff of the hospital in May, 1981. In June, 1981, she was offered a staff appointment as anesthesiologist, at a fixed salary, in the hospital\u2019s department of anesthesia. The offer came on hospital letterhead from the then-chairman of the hospital\u2019s department of anesthesia, who was also the ex officio president of the foundation (by virtue of a pro forma appointment by the hospital\u2019s board of trustees), but made no reference to the foundation. Each anesthesiologist appointed to the hospital staff by its board of trustees and to the Harvard Medical School faculty (as Patterson had already been while at the Massachusetts General Hospital) automatically became associated with the foundation. Patterson\u2019s duties involved three days a week of clinical service in the operating room anesthetizing hospital patients undergoing operations.and instructing interns and residents in training there; two nonclinical days per week for research and \u201cacademic medicine\u201d; and teaching duties at the Harvard Medical School. She neither admitted patients of her own to the hospital nor maintained a private office. Throughout the entire relevant period, Patterson received paychecks and benefits from both the hospital (approximately 16-20 per cent of her total remuneration) and the foundation (the remaining 80-84 per cent). The foundation was the contractually exclusive provider of anesthesia services for the hospital\u2019s patients, whom it directly billed for such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Until late 1992 Patterson experienced no significant health problems. At that time, she began to develop sensitivity to the latex gloves she wore in the operating room. Switching to non-latex gloves and using skin ointment eliminated the problem. In March, 1993, however, she developed a cough in the operating room and later other respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing, and asthma attacks) that abated when she ceased working at the hospital but intensified when she returned to work. Treatment from various specialists and efforts to create allergy-free environments lessened but did not extinguish her symptoms. By August, 1993, she could no longer work and over the remainder of 1993 began to have respiratory distress symptoms when exposed to an increasing number of extra-hospital agents and situations (e.g., books, fragrances, vehicle exhausts, dry cleaning, cosmetics, newspapers). Ultimately, she had to remake much of her home and restrict many activities in order to minimize such exposures.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">After the hospital and the foundation rejected Patterson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims, a conference before a DIA administrative judge ensued, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A. At that conference, Patterson submitted her treating physicians\u2019 medical records, plus several engineering reports concerning environmental conditions at the hospital. The judge initially denied Patterson\u2019s claims for temporary total disability (under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34), partial disability (\u00a7 35), and medical expenses (\u00a7\u00a7 13 &amp; 30). Patterson appealed for a de novo hearing pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10A(3) and 11 only as to her claims for medical expenses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">A \u00a7 11A impartial medical examination was thereafter ordered by the judge and performed by Dr. Christiani (IME), an internist specializing in occupational environmental medicine (which is not recognized as a certifiable specialty by the American Board of Medical Specialists). The IME had no personal knowledge of or experience in the hospital\u2019s operating rooms during the relevant period, nor any demonstrated expertise in the areas of toxicology, environmental engineering, or heating, ventilation, or air conditioning. The environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>reports submitted at the conference were transmitted by the judge to the IME, along with the medical records from Patterson\u2019s treating physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">After examining Patterson, the IME filed his report in July, 1994. He opined that (1) Patterson suffered from latex hypersensitivity; asthma \u201ctriggered by exposure to agents, including latex and, in particular, by re-entry into the operating room areas at the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital where latex antigen has been shown to be elevated (as expected) . . . [although] other agents may also be responsible for triggering her asthma\u201d; perennial sinusitis and rhinitis; and \u201cDiffuse Chemical Sensitivity, some of which is consistent with irritant and allergen induced asthma attacks\u201d; and (2) \u201c[Patterson\u2019s] exposures at the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital did causally contribute to the development and progression of her condition . . . [and s]he is unable to return to that hospital\u2019s operating room and to any other operating room, utilizing similar materials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The judge then conducted three days of evidentiary hearings between August and early November, 1994, during which the IME\u2019s report (but no other medical evidence) was admitted in evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> An additional day of medical testimony was subsequently introduced in the form of the deposition of the IME, conducted on November 15, 1994. Motions by the hospital and Liberty to strike the IME\u2019s report and deposition testimony and the environmental/engineering reports which the IME had consulted were later denied by the judge,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> who, in February, 1995, adopted the medical opinions of the IME regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>diagnosis and causation and determined that Patterson was concurrently employed by both the hospital and the foundation. As to the foundation\u2019s denial of Patterson\u2019s employee status, the judge found to the contrary, based upon the foundation\u2019s payment of salary and fringe benefits to Patterson, the identification of Patterson as an employee on W-2 forms and other tax documents, and a 1993 workers\u2019 compensation audit that identified the foundation as the policyholder and its affiliated anesthesiologists, including Patterson, as the insureds.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>It is axiomatic that an employee has the burden of estabhshing, by a preponderance of the evidence, all the elements of her claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, including the fact of the requisite causal connection between her injury and workplace events or conditions; and that she cannot prevail if any critical element is left to surmise, conjecture or speculation or otherwise lacks evidential support. <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526, 527-528 (1915). <em>Ruschetti\u2019s Case, 299 </em>Mass. 426, 431-432 (1938). See <em>Phillips\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 618 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In particular, the expert medical opinion as to that causal relation which the employee must obtain in order to prevail (when the matter is, as here, beyond the common knowledge of the ordinary layperson) has to be expressed in terms of probability, not mere possibility. <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 747, 749-750 (1958). That opinion must further be based solely on the expert\u2019s \u201cdirect personal knowledge\u201d or admissible evidence in the record and not on assumptions that are not established by such evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>414 Mass. 235, 238 (1993). See <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 681-682 (1970); 452 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.11(5) &amp; (6) (1993). Cf. <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531 (1986) (\u201can expert [may] base an opinion on facts or data not in evidence if the facts or data are independently admissible\u201d). If the DIA factfinder rests his ultimate conclusion as to causality on an expert\u2019s opinion which does not satisfy these standards, that conclusion is lacking in the required evidential support and cannot be affirmed. <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, 331 </em>Mass. at 749-754; <em>Hachadourian\u2019s Case, </em>340 Mass. 81, 85-86 (1959). Such is the instant situation, in which a deficient IME\u2019s report was the sole evidence of causation relied on by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We note initially a structural defect in the IME\u2019s report that (while not in and of itself fatal) was a portent of the underlying inadequacy of his causation opinion. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 30, requires the IME\u2019s report to \u201ccontain a determination [inter alia] . . . whether or not within a reasonable degree of medical certainty any . . . disability [of the claimant determined by the IME to exist] has as its major or predominant contributing cause a personal injury arising out of and in the course of the employee\u2019s employment.\u201d Here, however, the report failed to state any aspect of the IME\u2019s opinion as being within a reasonable degree of medical certainty or that any particular workplace event or condition was the major or predominant cause of Patterson\u2019s disabling respiratory problems or claimed MCS. His assertion that Patterson\u2019s exposures to latex and unspecified operating room agents at the hospital \u201cdid causally contribute\u201d to those problems fell far short of that requirement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Nor did the IME\u2019s deposition testimony eliminate or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>compensate for his report\u2019s inadequacies. He several times admitted that he could not identify and did not know what asthma-inducing allergen or toxin Patterson might have come in contact with at the hospital, other than latex. Even as to latex \u2014 which he did think \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of medical certainty . . . was . . . more likely than not a problem\u201d \u2014 he acknowledged that Patterson herself had testified that exposure to latex had produced a skin rash but not respiratory problems; that he had no actual evidence Patterson in fact had an allergy to latex which could produce a respiratory response (the establishment of which required special tests never administered to Patterson); and that he had no information regarding the levels of latex in the hospital operating rooms but rather relied on \u201creasonable assumption[s]\u201d about hospital operations generally and on certain of the environmental reports he had received from the judge which \u201csuggested] that latex allergy had been a problem\u201d in the hospital operating rooms. His deposition opinions as to latex came down to his \u201cthinking]\u201d that a latex allergen \u201cmay develop, precipitate asthma attack in her\u201d and \u201cmore likely than not latex was a problem with her.\u201d Notwithstanding his deposition elaboration, the IME came nowhere close to opining that either latex or any other substances (none of which he could identify) was the, or even a, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>major or predominant contributing cause of Patterson\u2019s disabling injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The facial shortcomings in the IME\u2019s report and supporting testimony reflect the more fundamental defect that there was no competent evidentiary basis for his causation opinion. Most fatally, his conclusions regarding Patterson\u2019s exposure to latex impermissibly rested on assumptions and information not established (as was required) by his own direct personal knowledge or by admissible evidence in the record. Patterson, on whom the burden lay, proffered no testimony, expert or lay, and no admissible exhibits regarding air quality or the presence of any potentially asthma-inducing agents in any part of the hospital. Instead, she relied entirely on a few nonmedical engineering reports \u2014 not made part of the administrative record \u2014 which apparently described certain environmental conditions at the hospital, including the operating room where she worked. Those reports were the only sources of information regarding latex problems aside from the IME\u2019s claimed knowledge of hospital conditions generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Patterson submitted those reports at the informal \u00a7 10A conference (which is not subject to the rules of evidence) but never authenticated them or formally introduced them in evidence. They were entirely hearsay documents for which no recognized hearsay exception was ever claimed or proffered, or, so far as we can tell, exists.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nonetheless, at the \u00a7 11 stage of the process \u2014 which must be conducted as a de novo hearing solely on the basis of evidence therein introduced and admissible under the rules of evidence applied in the courts \u2014 the judge permitted those unadmitted and inadmissible documents to be sent to the IME. Despite the fact that DIA regulations specify that the IME should receive and rely on as documentary evidence only <em>medical </em>records and reports, see 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.10(2)(b), 1.11(6), 1.14(2) (1993) (which <em>are </em>documents within established hearsay exceptions, see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 20; c. 233, \u00a7 79; <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s </em>Case, 424 Mass. 16, 23 [1996]), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the IME proceeded to review and, at least in part, rely upon those same hearsay reports.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The result was a medical opinion, even were it not facially wanting, contrary to the governing regulations and to this Commonwealth\u2019s rules of evidence as to the permissible bases for expert opinions. See discussion <em>supra </em>at 592-593.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> To the extent the IME claimed at deposition that his opinion would not have \u201csubstantially\u201d changed had he lacked those reports \u2014 which claim the judge found credible \u2014 he effectively acknowledged that the opinion was based entirely on Patterson\u2019s dermal latex sensitivity, on the post-March, 1993, reports of her treating physicians who diagnosed her asthmatic condition, and on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>own claimed knowledge of typical conditions in hospital operating rooms and other medical areas (though not specifically at the hospital itself). None of those sources, however, provided an iota of expert or admissible evidence regarding the actual, as opposed to the hypothesized, presence of latex or any other asthma-causing substances in the hospital operating room or other hospital areas in which Patterson had worked. As such, it was merely an unsubstantiated opinion based on assumed facts not established by the admissible evidence and thus the product of surmise and conjecture as to the existence of <em>any </em>causal connection, much less the \u201cmajor or predominant contributing cause.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The judge thus rested his causation decision on an IME\u2019s report that was not only expressed in terms of mere possibility but was also unsupported by admissible evidence in the record or on any other proper basis. As such, the IME\u2019s report was not entitled to any evidential weight, much less the status of prima facie evidence, see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), which the judge incorrectly accorded it. See 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.11(5) &amp; (6) (1993) (medical report, or any part thereof, to be struck on motion when not based solely on the expert\u2019s direct personal knowledge or admissible evidence in the record); <em>Ruschetti\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. at 431 (mere conjecture by expert as to causation based on equivocal facts \u201chas ... no evidential value\u201d); <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. at 749 (medical expert opinion as to causation expressed in terms of \u201cpossible causal relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>. . . would have to be disregarded\u201d); <em>Buck\u2019s Case, </em>342 Mass. 766, 770-771 (1961) (expert causality opinion based upon misstatements or omissions of material facts is entitled to no weight); <em>Bagge\u2019s Case, </em>369 Mass. 129, 134 (1975) (same); <em>Lettich\u2019s Case, </em>403 Mass. 389, 393 (1988) (DIA reviewing board found that expert opinion based on facts not in evidence \u201cmust be rejected\u201d and could not support a decision favorable to the employee); <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 257-259, 260 n.5 (1994) (prima facie effect is to be accorded only to medical opinion as to medical issues based on accurate and complete facts and a competent evidentiary foundation in the record); <em>Collins\u2019s Case, </em>21 Mass.

App. Ct. 584, 588-589 (1997) (EME report is not to be admitted as prima facie evidence when based on inaccurate assumptions).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The ultimate causality conclusion of the judge \u2014 who had no power to admit evidence at the hearing in a manner contrary to the DIA regulations or the rules of evidence (at least when such evidence is properly objected to) \u2014 consequently was itself not grounded, as it must be, on a competent evidentiary record. It thereby contravened the fundamental principles that the appellants were \u201centitled to a decision based [solely] on the evidence presented at the hearing . . . [, that n]othing can be considered or treated as evidence which is not introduced [and admitted] as such . . . [and that] the [judge\u2019s] decision on a workers\u2019] compensation claim may not be based on facts not introduced in evidence . . . .\u201d <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. at 681-682. See 452 Code Mass.

It follows that the reviewing board\u2019s decision in her favor must be reversed.

The basis for the judge\u2019s denial of the appellants\u2019 motions with respect to the reports was that their objections to the reports, not having been made at either the conference or the three days of hearings, were untimely. That ruling was clearly erroneous and arbitrary. Only \u201cdocuments included in the medical records\u201d require objections at the conference level, 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10(2)(c) (1993), and those reports were not such documents. At the hearing, the judge explicitly allowed the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>lants to reserve their objections until after the deposition of the IME. At the deposition, they persistently and vehemently objected to the reports upon learning of the extent of the IME\u2019s reliance thereon, which had not been clear from the IME report itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Although we need not address the issue to dispose of this appeal, we note our doubt as to the correctness of the judge\u2019s determination that Patterson was an employee of the foundation, both as matter of law and on the record. The judge failed to utilize, or even mention, the standard of analysis for determining employee status under the workers\u2019 compensation act, which is the same as that of the common law of agency. Under that test, the finder of fact must identify \u201cwho has direction and control of the employee and to whom does he owe obedience in respect of\u201d the performance of his work; or, at least, identify who \u201cretains the right to direct the manner in which the business shall be done, as well as the result to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Chisholm\u2019s </em>Case, 238 Mass. 412, 419-420 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In particular, the judge ignored the \u201cessence of the distinction\u201d between an employee eligible to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits and an ineligible independent contractor, namely \u201cthe right of control. . . . Other considerations and tests are important only as they hear upon the right of control.\u201d <em>McDermott\u2019s Case, </em>283 Mass. 74, 76 (1933). See <em>Donnelly\u2019s Case, </em>304 Mass. 514, 519-520 (1939); <em>Hartman\u2019s Case, </em>336 Mass. 508, 510 (1957); <em>Brigham\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 140, 141-142 (1964); <em>O\u2019Malley\u2019s Case, </em>361 Mass. 504, 505 (1972); Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 220(1) (1958); Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 141 (2d ed. 1981). The judge did not examine, as he was obliged to do, \u201call the circumstances\u201d of the workplace situation in his analysis of employee status, the most important factor being the right and extent of control of the purported employee\u2019s work. <em>Strong\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 243, 246 (1931). See <em>Khoury </em>v. <em>Edison Elec.

See <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass. 186, 195 (1980); <em>Harnish </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Center, </em>387 Mass. 152, 159 (1982); <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>395 Mass. 659, 661-663 (1985); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>413 Mass. 398, 400-401 (1992); <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Independent Practice Assn., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 661, 665 (1991); <em>Reida </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Hosp., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 553, 554 (1994). Compare <em>McMurdo </em>v. <em>Getter, </em>298 Mass. 363, 364 (1937) (physician-optometrist employee of eyeglass retailer).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The administrative judge failed to acknowledge these established legal principles, much less to apply them, by assessing the record in order to determine whether any evidence tended to show that Patterson was subject to the direction and control of the foundation in the performance of her professional duties. Indeed, as Liberty asserts, there appears to be little, if any, evidence of such control. The record is, rather, replete with evidence that it was the hospital that supervised and controlled the details of Patterson\u2019s work. Patterson was in fact unable to identify any foundation officer or employee acting as such who was responsible for supervising or controlling her performance as a physician in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">In short, although the issue whether a claimant is an employee for workers\u2019 compensation purposes was an ultimate question of fact for the judge\u2019s determination, that conclusion should be set aside if not justified by the evidence or by the subsidiary findings, as it appears not to have been here. See <em>Donnelly's Case, </em>304 Mass. at 516; <em>Ballard\u2019s Case, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. at 1069; <em>Madariaga\u2019s Case, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 477, 481 (1985). In view of our reversal on the causation issue, we do not in any event have to treat Liberty\u2019s complaint about the allocation of a substantial portion of Patterson\u2019s award to the foundation as a supposed coemployer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The parties have argued the causation issue exclusively in terms of the compliance vel non of the IME\u2019s report and testimony with the quoted standard set forth in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2) (whether the employee\u2019s disability has as \u201cits major or predominant contributing cause\u201d a work-related personal injury). Had Patterson based her claim on having suffered a compensable, work-related personal injury that had combined with a preexisting condition to cause her disability or her need for medical treatment, she could have prevailed to the extent she could prove that the work-related injury was \u201ca major but not necessarily predominant cause of\u201d such disability or need for treatment. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A), as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 14. She did not, however, so characterize her claim or her evidence. Moreover, the judge twice expressly found that, notwithstanding some evidence of isolated but unspecific past allergic reactions, Patterson had no history of asthmatic or respiratory sensitivity or problems, i.e., no preexisting conditions, at the time she first became ill in the operating room in March, 1993 (a finding made in response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>to Liberty\u2019s apparent initial contention, not advanced on appeal, that Patterson did not suffer a compensable \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1[7A]). The judge did go on, in what amounted to somewhat confusing administrative dictum couched in the language of \u00a7 1(7A), to state that \u201c[i]n any event I find that a fair reading of [the IME\u2019s] report and deposition indicate that Dr. Patterson\u2019s employment related respiratory condition is a major cause of her disability and needed treatment.\u201d This statement, reflecting the judge\u2019s apparent belief that Patterson had satisfied the standard of proof under \u00a7 1(7A) \u2014 which is clearly lower than that imposed upon the IME\u2019s causation opinion pursuant to \u00a7 11A(2)(iii) \u2014 does nothing to save the judge\u2019s.award, for several reasons. First, the IME\u2019s report and deposition nowhere identify, or provide logical support for identifying, <em>any </em>\u201cmajor\u201d cause of Patterson\u2019s condition or need for treatment, but rather speak only in terms of \u201cproblem[s]\u201d and \u201ccontributing]\u2019\u2019 causes of unspecified magnitude. Se.cond, the judge\u2019s reiterated findings as to the absence of preexisting conditions make the \u00a7 1(7A) standard irrelevant to the issue of compensability, as the parties themselves acknowledged in focusing their arguments on the sufficiency of the IME\u2019s report under \u00a7 11A(2) as to the issue of causation, and by never mentioning the lower standard of \u00a7 1(7A). Finally, and most significantly, since the IME\u2019s opinion was founded upon inadmissible evidence (as is explained below), the award cannot be sustained, whatever causation standard applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Patterson makes no effort to demonstrate that the unintroduced reports would have qualified under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78, nor does anything in the administrative record suggest that the reports were made by employees whose business duty it was to create them in the regular course of business operations. Rather, it seems clear that the reports were the nonregular, ad hoc products of independent consultants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\">No decision has explicitly recognized the proposition stated in the text as to the limitation on the information provided to an IME for use in formulating his opinion, but that conclusion seems logically inescapable based upon the cited regulations, as well as the statute (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A[2], which expressly limits an IME to consideration of \u201cmedical issues\u201d and the expression of opinion in terms of \u201cmedical certainty\u201d and \u201cmedical end result[s]\u201d), and controlling case law (see <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. at 256-258, emphasizing the statutory restriction and concluding therefrom that only the medical issues in an IME report are entitled to be treated as \"prima facie evidence). Cf. 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.12(5)(b) (1993), restricting the use of the IMS\u2019s deposition as \u201cmedical evidence only.\u201d It may be that even under these authorities an IME can permissibly be provided nonmedical records and reports for use in framing his expert medical opinion when such evidence is shown to be both independently admissible and of a type reasonably relied upon by physicians as a permissible basis for formulating an opinion. See <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. at 528-532; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 741-742 (1992); Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 7.10.2, at 419-420 (6th ed. 1994); Young, Pollets, &amp; Poreda, Massachusetts Evidentiary Standards, Evidentiary Standard 703(c) (2000 Supp. to Hughes, Evidence). Patterson would not be aided by such an expansion of the IME\u2019s evidentiary universe, however, because she made no such showings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The IME\u2019s report stated that he had reviewed the hearsay reports and suggested his partial reliance on them by mentioning that \u201clatex antigen has been shown to be elevated (as expected)\u201d in the hospital\u2019s operating room areas (the reports being the only direct source for such information). During his deposition, the appellants explored the IME\u2019s reliance on those reports, with somewhat conflicting responses from the IME. At one point, the IME said that the studies were significant in \u201csuggesting] that latex allergy has been a problem and that there are some other things used in the operating room area that had caused some difficulties with staff\u201d; but later he asserted that he had not relied on the reports \u201cexclusively\u201d even though such \u201cbackground information\u201d was reviewed and used to formulate his causality opinion. He finally claimed that even without the reports his opinion would not have \u201csubstantially\u201d changed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The parties advance extensive arguments addressed to the MCS portion of the IME\u2019s causality opinion, with the appellants vigorously arguing that MCS is not a recognized medical diagnosis and fails to meet the standard of evidentiary reliability established by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 26 (1994) (adopting the test set forth in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579 [1993]); while Patterson contends that the appellants did not raise the issue below, that the IME\u2019s opinion has not been shown to violate the <em>Lanigan-Daubert </em>tests, but, more importantly, that MCS was not the real basis for the IME\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe essence of\u201d which was the diagnosis of \u201cenvironmentally induced asthma\u201d in response to workplace substances (the only identified such substance being latex). We need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute regarding this interesting issue, see generally <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 297, 299-301 &amp; n.1 (1999), because the IME\u2019s causality opinion as to MCS (and the judge\u2019s decision founded thereon) suffer from exactly the same flaws as have been discussed above. Indeed, the IME\u2019s opinion had even less substance, based upon his essentially conjectural statement that Patterson\u2019s MCS was merely \u201cconsistent with\u201d asthma induced by exposure to unnamed and unknown irritants and allergens.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Contrast <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, ante </em>at 298-302, where the expert causality opinion (which in that case was provided by the employee\u2019s doctor rather than an IME), that the employee (a nurse) suffered from MCS caused by conditions at the same hospital as here involved, was based not merely on his claimed knowledge of MCS generally, but also on the identification of specific chemicals present in the employee\u2019s workplace (ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, diesel fuel) and on the facts that the expert was the employee\u2019s treating physician, had performed a number of highly relevant diagnostic tests on the employee, and had personal knowledge of other similarly situated patients he had treated. None of those factors is here present.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
