The issue concerns an article of the collective bargaining agreement between the department and the union. The town claims that the article violates certain provisions of G. L. c. 32B, the statute governing municipal health care plans. The town therefore refused to process payments under the article, which provides for reimbursement for eye examinations and eyeglasses. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>arbitrator ordered the department to abide by the agreement. A Superior Court judge vacated the arbitrator\u2019s order, ruling that under G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 7A, the department could not offer these benefits to department employees because the benefits were not available to other town employees. The union appeals from the Superior Court judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\"><em>Factual and procedural background. </em>The department is a municipal utility company organized and operated pursuant to G. L. c. 164. Its revenues are deposited in a special account in the town treasury. The town pays the department\u2019s bills from this account by the warrant process. See <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Middleborough Gas &amp; Elec. Dept., </em>422 Mass. 583, 587 (1996). \u201c[The department\u2019s] employees are town employees paid through the town treasurer\u2019s office by town-issued checks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The collective bargaining agreement, however, refers to the department as the employer, and apparently the department\u2019s manager conducts the collective bargaining with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">At issue here is art. 36 of the most recent collective bargaining agreement between the department and the union representing department employees. Captioned \u201ceyeglasses,\u201d the article provides reimbursement for eye examinations and prescription eyeglasses \u201cbased upon the net amount left after payments made under any applicable insurance.\u201d Article 36 also provides reimbursement for safety eyeglasses for employees unable to wear department safety glasses and for prescription eyeglasses that are broken or damaged due to a work-related incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Article 30 of the same agreement, captioned \u201chealth insurance,\u201d provides department employees with health insurance through the town\u2019s health insurance program. The town\u2019s health plan includes eye examination benefits. Discounts for the purchase of \u201ceyewear\u201d are available to employees participating in the town\u2019s health insurance plan, but these discounts \u201care not a covered benefit\u201d under the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">It appears that the town had been paying the vision benefits set out in art. 36 from the department\u2019s account for three or more years. However, shortly after the collective bargaining agreement at issue here became effective in January, 1994, the town accountant, on advice of the associate general counsel of the State Group Insurance Commission, see G. L. c. 32A, \u00a7 3, refused to approve a warrant requesting reimbursement on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ground that such payments were in violation of G. L. c. 32B. See G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7\u00a7 7A, 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The union filed a grievance against the department claiming violation of the collective bargaining agreement. After a hearing, an arbitrator concluded that the failure to make the reimbursement violated the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. He noted that \u201cwhereas the expression \u2018hospital, surgical, medical, dental and other health care coverage\u2019 is mentioned specifically in various parts of [G. L. c. 32B], \u2018vision\u2019 is nowhere to be found.\u201d From that observation he concluded that \u201cvision is not included under this statute[,] . . . [and] the parties [were] free to negotiate a separate vision provision.\u201d He therefore ordered the department to abide by art. 36 of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The department, caught between the town (which was not a party to the arbitration) and the union, filed a complaint in Superior Court against the town and the union seeking a declaration of the department\u2019s authority to offer the benefits and review of the arbitration award. The town answered and filed a counterclaim against the department and a cross claim against the union. Upon cross motions for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge allowed the town\u2019s motion and denied the motions of the union and the department. He declared that the vision benefits in art. 36 of the collective bargaining agreement are within the scope of the medical coverage included in the various provisions of G. L. c. 32B and that the department did not have authority under either its enabling statute, G. L. c. 164, or the collective bargaining statute, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>7(d), </em>to provide the benefits to department employees in violation of c. 32B. He therefore vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award as being in excess of the arbitrator\u2019s powers. The union appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\"><em>General Laws c. 32B. </em>\u201cGeneral Laws c. 32B is \u2018a comprehensive statute empowering municipalities to provide group insurance (medical and certain other coverages) to their employees and their employees\u2019 dependents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. 31, 37 (1999), quoting from <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>376 Mass. 706, 710 (1978). It is \u201ca \u2018local option\u2019 statute: it does not take effect until a governmental unit accepts it. . . . Once accepted, however, it provides the exclusive mechanisms by which and to whom the city may provide group health insurance.\u201d <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. at 37. The \u201cpurpose of [c. 32B] is to provide local governments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>with a volume of purchasing power sufficient to assure that their employees will receive the highest possible level of benefits at the lowest possible net cost.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39. \u201cUniformity of coverage (persons and risks) was one mechanism selected by the Legislature to control escalating cost disparities among governmental units.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. Consistent with this purpose, the last sentence of the first paragraph of c. 32B, \u00a7 7A, as inserted by St. 1973, c. 789, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cNo governmental unit [which accepts this section] shall provide different subsidiary or additional rates to any group or class within that unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\"><em>Scope of review of arbitrator\u2019s decision. </em>\u201cA matter submitted to arbitration is subject to a very narrow scope of review. . . . Courts inquire into an arbitration award only to determine if the arbitrator has exceeded the scope of his authority, or decided the matter based on \u2018fraud, arbitrary conduct, or procedural irregularity in the hearings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Everett </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Police Officers, Locals 633 &amp; 634, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 671, 676 (1998), quoting from <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990). However, \u201c[arbitration . . . may not \u2018award relief of a nature which offends public policy or which directs or requires a result contrary to express statutory provision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Everett </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Police Officers, Locals 633 &amp; 634, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. at 676 (considering whether an arbitrator\u2019s award was contrary to the provisions of G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16). Under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>7(d), </em>if there is a conflict between a collective bargaining agreement and c. 32B, the statute prevails. See <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>375 Mass. 98, 103 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\"><em>Issues on appeal. </em>On appeal the union argues that the department has authority to bargain with the union on behalf of its employees and that the department was free to negotiate its own terms for vision examinations and eyeglasses because those services were not included in c. 32B, \u00a7\u00a7 3 or 15, at the time art. 36 was negotiated. The union also claims that because the payments are reimbursements rather than for insurance premiums they are outside c. 32B, \u00a7\u00a7 7A and 15, and therefore permissible. The union also makes a cursory argument that the benefits in question are safety benefits, not health care benefits. The town argues that eye examinations and eyeglasses constitute \u201cmedical . . . benefits\u201d included in c. 32B, \u00a7 3, and therefore c. 32B, \u00a7 7A, prohibits the department from offering department employees additional vision benefits not provided to other town employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>As the Superior Court judge succinctly recognized, \u201c[t]he dispute between the parties boils down to a question of statutory interpretation: does the term \u2018medical coverage\u2019 in G. L. c. 32B encompass vision-related insurance?\u201d There is no disagreement that this issue is appropriate for summary judgment. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). See also <em>Cassesso </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 419, 422 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The Superior Court\u2019s order does not undermine the union\u2019s authority to bargain on behalf of its members. However, if the union agrees that members who are department employees will participate in the town\u2019s health insurance plan established under c. 32B, then \u00a7 7A requires that department employees participate on the same terms as other town employees, see <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. at 41, unless the parties establish special terms through a health and welfare trust fund agreement. See G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 15. There is nothing in the record to suggest that there is such an agreement here. (Nor does either party consider whether the department could have established its own separate health plan.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u201cThe reasons for [\u00a7 7A] can be readily discerned. A single rate of deduction for all employees of a municipality, joined with a single rate of contribution by the municipality, presents a simpler and hence a less expensive picture for practical management than the fragmented structure that would result from rates varying among the several employee-groups. The more significant consideration, however, is the inexpedience (as a Legislature could view it) of encouraging a competitive scramble in collective bargaining among employee-groups to procure increased municipal contributions to the insurance premiums.\u201d <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>376 Mass. at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The union attempts to overcome these statutory limits by arguing that the vision benefits were not within c. 32B at the time of the collective bargaining contract. Their argument focuses on a 1996 amendment to G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 15 \u2014 St. 1996, c. 288, \u00a7 1. This amendment added subsection (a) to \u00a7 15 and provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">\u201cUpon acceptance of this subsection by its appropriate public authority and subject to any necessary appropriation, a governmental unit, acting by and through its ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>propriate public authority, <em>may offer its employees a policy or policies of group long-term disability insurance, group dental insurance or group vision care insurance. </em>A governmental unit may contract for such insurance coverage individually or through its membership in a trust or joint purchase group as provided in section twelve of this chapter. A governmental unit may elect to pay any part or none of the premium cost for such insurance coverage for its employees, and may bargain for such insurance coverage collectively.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The union argues that the 1996 amendment \u201cadd[ed] three types of group insurance to 32B\u2019s coverage\u201d and contends that the appearance of the words \u201cvision care\u201d in \u00a7 15(a), when those words had not previously appeared in either \u00a7 15 or any other provision of c. 32B, means that vision care benefits were not available under c. 32B at the time of the collective bargaining contract. We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">First, the amendment did not add either dental insurance or disability insurance. Dental insurance coverage was added in 1975. See St. 1975, c. 806. Disability insurance has been included in c. 32B as \u00a7 11F since 1971. See St. 1971, c. 203, \u00a7 2. Instead, the effect of the new subsection was to authorize governmental units to provide three kinds of insurance without making the fifty percent contribution toward the premium that \u00a7 7 otherwise requires. See G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 7, first sentence, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 841, \u00a7 4 (\u201c[T]here shall be withheld from each payment of . . . [each employee\u2019s] compensation . . . fifty per cent of the premium for insurance of the employee . . . and the governmental unit shall contribute the remaining fifty percent\u201d); <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>376 Mass. at 710 (\u201cWatertown undertook ... to contribute to the premiums at the required level of 50%\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">If vision care had been a new benefit not previously available, the 1996 amendment would have added vision care to other sections of c. 32B listing the kinds of group insurance coverage available under the statute. See, e.g., \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 615, \u00a7 3 (\u201cThe purpose of this chapter is to provide a plan of group life insurance, group accidental death and dismemberment insurance and group general or blanket hospital, surgical, medical, dental and other health insurance\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>That is precisely the approach the Legislature adopted in adding dental care to the plans available under c. 32B. See St. 1975, c. 806, amending \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2(i), 3, 4, 5, 9, 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D, 9E, 9G, 10, 11, and 11B of c. 32B, and inserting \u00a7 10A. Not only did the Legislature not include such amendments in the 1996 bill, it did not even add vision care to the original \u00a7 15, essentially retained as \u00a7 <em>15(b), </em>which sets out the scope of c. 32B as including \u201cgroup life insurance, group accidental death and dismemberment insurance and group general or blanket hospital, surgical, medical, dental, and other health insurance.\u201d See G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 15, as appearing in St. 1988, c. 82; G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 15(b), as appearing in St. 1996, c. 288, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The union\u2019s argument, which the arbitrator apparently accepted, is essentially a resort to the maxim of statutory interpretation traditionally known as \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alter\u00e1is,\u201d defined in the latest edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary as \u201c[a] canon of construction holding that to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of the other, or of the alternative.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 602 (7th ed. 1999) (also addressing the limitations inherent in the maxim). See 2A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.23 (5th ed. 1992). However, there is nothing in c. 32B suggesting a legislative intent to exclude vision benefits. Compare the abortion restrictions in \u00a7 3, as amended through St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 100, prior to the 1996 amendment, St. 1996, c. 366, \u00a7 7, that eliminated them. Indeed, the town was already offering eye examination coverage in its health plan established pursuant to c. 32B. Moreover, including vision care is consistent with the purpose of c. 32B to \u201cassure that . . . employees will receive the highest possible level of benefits at the lowest possible cost.\u201d <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. at 39. The 1996 amendment to \u00a7 15 furthered this purpose by increasing the types of insurance options available for negotiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Nor are we persuaded by the union\u2019s argument that because art. 36 calls for reimbursement, rather than payment toward insurance premiums, the benefits are not covered by c. 32B, \u00a7\u00a7 7A and 15, and are therefore permissible. This argument ignores the essential concerns behind c. 32B: to assure that participants receive equal benefits and, by volume membership, to achieve cost control. See <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. at 41. Allowing the union to evade the requirements of c. 32B <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>by providing for direct reimbursement rather than premium contributions would violate the principles at issue here. See <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>376 Mass. at 713-714 &amp; n.15, citing <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>361 Mass. 24, 31 n.3 (1972), on the use of arbitration or collective bargaining to evade \u201ca well defined statutory policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Finally, the union makes a passing reference to safety, asserting that \u201cthe record unequivocally establishes that the eyeglasses benefits contained in Article 36 . . . were negotiated as a safety item.\u201d The citation to the record in support of the \u201cunequivocal\u201d point is to a single sentence in the arbitrator\u2019s opinion and award: \u201cAt the hearing there was testimony that when the eyeglasses provision was negotiated, it was not considered a health insurance benefit, was not paid through insurance but through individual invoices, and the logic behind including eyeglasses in the agreement was for safety and job performance reasons.\u201d This single sentence with its reference merely to the arbitrator\u2019s summary of the evidence, and no further analysis or citation to authority, does not \u201crise to the level of acceptable appellate argument within the meaning of Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).\u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>H.B. Smith Co., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 664-665 (1997). Moreover, nowhere in its brief does the union argue that we should consider the eyeglasses benefit separately from the eye examinations, which we have already determined are within c. 32B. We therefore do not consider this issue. \u201c[Tjhe right of a party to have [an appellate] court consider a point entails a duty; that duty is to assist the court with argument and appropriate citation of authority.\u201d <em>Lolos </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>338 Mass. 10, 14 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In sum, our analysis of c. 32B, including a \u201ccommon sense interpretation\u201d of the statute, <em>Brockton Educ. Assn. </em>v. <em>Brockton Sch. Comm., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 36, 40 (1999), leads us to conclude that eye examinations and related benefits are medical benefits under c. 32B. The 1996 amendment of \u00a7 15 did not signal a change in services covered. Because c. 32B, \u00a7 7A, forbids unequal treatment of employees in the provision of health care benefits, the Superior Court judge correctly vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award as in excess of the arbitrator\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
