During those years Honer periodically provided Wisniewski with funds. The money, determined at trial to be $31,500, was used by Wisniewski to make improvements to the home and for personal expenses. Honer had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>use of a small apartment on the property; she paid only for her utilities. The arrangement came to an end in July of 1990, when Wisniewski contracted to sell the property and told Honer that she would have to vacate the apartment. Apparently no other suitable living arrangement was suggested for Honer as she filed suit against Wisniewski the following month, claiming that the amounts she had paid were loans and not gifts. Wisniewski counterclaimed, seeking the rental value of the apartment, which the judge, at trial, determined also to be $31,500. In connection with the suit, Honer placed an attachment on Wisniewski\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In order that conveyance of Wisniewski\u2019s house might take place, Honer agreed to release the attachment if $10,000 were placed in escrow, securing any judgment that Honer might obtain. The money was placed with Honer\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No written conditions of the escrow appear on record. Honor\u2019s attorney had sole control of the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In February of 1994, after trial, the judge entered two judgments, each in the amount of $31,500, with neither bearing prejudgment interest or costs. One judgment favored. Honer on her claim and one judgment favored Wisniewski on her counterclaim; according to comments he made in later proceedings, the judge intended that \u201cthe judgments be a wash,\u201d and that executions obtained, thereon \u201cwould not be worth ten cents.\u201d Various appeals, proceedings, and maneuvers by Honer\u2019s counsel followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">After entry of the judgments, Honer claimed a timely report to the Appellate Division of the District Court (first appeal), of Wisniewski\u2019s judgment against her, seeking redress of certain claimed errors at trial not relevant here. Wisniewski did not appeal Honer\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">While Honer\u2019s first appeal was pending in the Appellate Division, each party filed a motion for entry, of separate and final judgment; Wisniewski further moved for release of the escrow funds. After hearing, before the decision of the Appellate Division was filed, the judge denied Wisniewski\u2019s motions, as the judgment in her favor was under appeal, but allowed Honer\u2019s motion, ordering the entry of a separate and final judgment for Honer against Wisniewski. The judge provided in his order that no execution was to be issued thereon \u201cuntil counterclaims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>[are] heard,\u201d ostensibly delaying execution until Honer\u2019s appeal of the Wisniewski judgment was resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The Appellate Division affirmed Wisniewski\u2019s judgment; the decision and order were entered in the District Court on February 2, 1995. At that point, Wisniewski\u2019s attorney called Honer\u2019s attorney to inquire what the next step might be. Honer\u2019s attorney indicated that he planned a further appeal of the Wisniewski judgment. Instead, shortly after this conversation, he sought and obtained an execution on Honor\u2019s judgment against Wisniewski. Within the week he returned the execution to court marked, \u201csatisfied in part in the amount of $11,201,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>having levied on the escrow that he alone held. Part of the funds were paid to Honer; a larger part he paid to himself in satisfaction of his charges to Honer for legal services in the case. Approximately two weeks later, upon learning of the levy, Wisniewski filed a motion for release of the escrow funds; the judge denied the motion. Wisniewski\u2019s attorney never sought an execution on the judgment against Honer and never appealed the judgment or any of the orders entered against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The motion for relief from judgment and for equitable relief, filed twenty-nine months after the original entry of judgments and some eighteen months after entry of the Appellate Division\u2019s affirmance of Wisniewski\u2019s judgment against Honer, made the following \u201cDemands: A. That the Court order Defense [ric] Counsel . . . pay to Plaintiff\u2019s [sic] Counsel the sum of $11,120 plus interest within 30 days[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]; and B. That the Court mark both executions \u2018Satisfied in Full\u2019 or, in the alternative; C. That the Court amend the Judgment to reflect zero damages to either party by right of set-off.\u201d The judge, who was the trial judge, endorsed the motion, \u201cMotion Allowed as to Demands A &amp; B \u2014 $11,120 to be returned to Defendant and both Executions to be marked \u2018Satisfied in Full.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Wisniewski\u2019s motion claims redress solely because Honer\u2019s attorney (1) misrepresented to her attorney the next course that he would pursue in the litigation, and (2) then wrongfully obtained a writ of execution and wrongfully levied on Wisniewski\u2019s funds which he held in escrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The motion was, by its preamble, filed \u201cpursuant to [Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>R.Civ.P.] 60 and 69, [365 Mass. 828, 836 (1974)].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As no subsection of rule 60 was specified, we examine the motion and the underlying claims made therein to determine if there is any section of the rule which might provide relief. No claim appears pursuant to rule 60(a) (clerical mistake), and we confine our analysis to the possibility of relief afforded by rule 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Failure to classify the appropriate section of rule 60(b) in a motion for relief of judgment is not fatal. Courts may determine whether and under what section relief might be granted; the label attached to the motion is not dispositive. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Allen, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 821 (1980) (motion brought under Mass.R.Civ.P. 59[e], 365 Mass. 828 [1974], susceptible of treatment as a motion for relief from judgment under rule 60[b][6]); <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Marshfield, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 29, 33 (1983) (moving party\u2019s failure to classify motion as rule 60[b][6] motion not dispositive; relief appropriate under that section); <em>Freitas </em>v. <em>Freitas, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 196, 199 (1988) (motion filed under Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 60(b) inappropriate, but relief granted deemed appropriate on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Statements concerning Honer\u2019s intent to appeal and then obtaining an execution and levying thereon (Wisniewski\u2019s sole claim in her motion for relief from judgment, and not denied by Honer\u2019s attorney at any of the hearings) might be found to constitute the \u201cfraud . . . , misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party\u201d contemplated by rule 60(b)(3). Relief is avail\u00e1ble for a party suffering this type of behavior, but the relief must be sought within one year of the entry of judgment. <em>Tibbitts </em>v. <em>Wisniewski, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 729, 731 (1989).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That time period had long elapsed, especially as the action might be seen as seeking relief from Honor\u2019s judgment against Wisniewski, entered some twenty-nine months prior to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Addressing the second part of Wisniewski\u2019s claim for relief, that execution had issued and levy made, there was nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>procedurally wrong in Honor\u2019s obtaining execution and levying on the escrow. All legal conditions, even that established by the judge, requiring that \u201cno execution [be issued] until counterclaims heard,\u201d had been met (the Appellate Division had decided Honor\u2019s appeal), and there were no other controls on the escrow itself. Wisniewski\u2019s claim of error here can only relate to the statement by Honor\u2019s attorney that he would further appeal the judgment for Wisniewski, lulling Wisniewski\u2019s attorney into inaction and inattention. That claim as well fails, based as it is on the same claim of misconduct and governed by the same one-year limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Although not argued, a review of the record suggests a possible case for relief because of \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect\u201d under rule 60(b)(1), as Wisniewski\u2019s attorney failed to pursue both execution and appeal. That avenue of relief is also closed, as relief under rule 60(b)(1) also must be sought within one year. <em>Tibbitts </em>v. <em>Wisniewski, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Wisniewski argues that we should affirm the judge\u2019s order as granting relief under rule 60(b)(6) (\u201cany other reason justifying relief\u201d) in order to accomplish justice. See <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. 809, 815 (1983). Relief under this section must be justified for reasons other than those set forth in rule 60(b)(1) through (5). <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admn., 377 </em>Mass. 217, 228 (1979). <em>Chavoor </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>383 Mass. 801, 805-806 (1981). <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>393 Mass. 789, 791 (1985). <em>Bromfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 254, 256 (1987). <em>Tibbitts </em>v. <em>Wisniewski, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 731, and cases cited therein. Rule 60(b)(6) cannot be used to extend the one-year limitation applicable to rule 60(b)(1) or (b)(3). <em>Tibbitts </em>v. <em>Wisniewski, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">As the case stands, Honer remains with a judgment that has been partially satisfied and with an execution that was returned reflecting that fact. Her remaining judgment amount we calculate to be $20,299. Wisniewski has a judgment for $31,500 on which execution has never issued.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Exercising our powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>under G.
