L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The DALA ruled in this case that under any definition of \u201cjust cause\u201d the Boston police department (department) had failed to establish \u201cjust cause\u201d for the transfer of John Fedorchuk from the rank of lieutenant detective to lieutenant under \u00a7 4H. On appeal to the Superior Court, a Superior Court judge determined that the \u201cjust cause\u201d standard of review set forth in \u00a7 4H was the equivalent of the \u201cjust cause\u201d standard of review employed under the civil service law embodied in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, and that whether this definition applied in this case was immaterial, because the department had failed to show reasonable grounds to support Fedorchuk\u2019s transfer. From the judgment in the Superior Court affirming the decision of the DALA, the department appeals on the grounds that \u00a7 4H does not apply to the city of Boston and that even if it does, the meaning to be ascribed to the \u201cjust cause\u201d standard of review is the equivalent of the \u201cgood faith\u201d judgment rule used in terminating employees in the private sector, or in reviewing the abolition of positions under the civil service statutes, rather than the \u201cjust cause\u201d standard used in reviewing the transfer or lowering in rank of civil service employees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We set forth the undisputed facts of the case. John Fedorchuk began working for the department in 1970. He was promoted to the rank of sergeant and then lieutenant. In 1992, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant detective. From March, 1994, until August, 1995, when he was injured in the line of duty, he served as the night commander of the Area B-3 police station. Shortly before October 22, 1996, when Fedorchuk was scheduled to return to work as a lieutenant detective, the captain of the Area B-3 police station informed the police commissioner that the sergeant detective who had replaced Fedorchuk was doing a fine job and stated that, in his opinion, the status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>quo should be maintained. He further informed the commissioner that the department needed a lieutenant to serve as day duty supervisor of the Area B-3 police station. On October 22, 1996, Fedorchuk received a note from the commissioner stating that he had been transferred to his former position as lieutenant and assigned to work as the day duty supervisor for the Area B-3 police station. This reassignment was made, according to the commissioner, solely \u201cfor the benefit of the Department.\u201d As a result of this transfer, Fedorchuk lost his rank as lieutenant detective, was required to wear a uniform, and received a reduction in salary. Fedorchuk appealed his transfer under G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H, to the DALA, which concluded that the department did not have \u201cjust cause\u201d to make the transfer and that Fedorchuk should be restored to his lieutenant detective rank without loss of compensation. The department then sought review of the DALA\u2019s decision under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, in the Superior Court. On the department\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, a Superior Court judge affirmed the DALA decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">We now address the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">1. <em>Applicability of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H, to the department. </em>The department argues that \u00a7 4H does not apply to the Boston police department because there is no indication that the Legislature intended to repeal, supersede, or amend the special acts of the Legislature which bestow upon the police commissioner the authority to make personnel and managerial decisions, St. 1962, c. 322, \u00a7 1(10), (11),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and which govern the detective bureau of the department, St. 1950, c. 735.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the outset, based on the record before us, it appears that this argument is being raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a general rule, a party may not raise on appeal a matter which he could have raised before the administrative agency or in the court below. <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct. of the City of Boston, </em>388 Mass. 491, 493-494 (1983). However, this general rule will not be invoked where justice will be served by a consideration of the claim and the other party is not prejudiced by consideration of the issue. <em>M. H. Gordon &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>386 Mass. 64, 67-68 (1982). <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct. of the City of Boston, </em>388 Mass. at 494. <em>McLeod\u2019s Case, </em>389 Mass. 431, 434 (1983). Because both parties have briefed and argued the issue and a just result is dependent on a determination of the applicability \u00f3f the statute to the circumstances of this case, we shall address the applicability of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H, to the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The department argues that the provisions of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H, at issue, conflict with the unfettered authority of the commissioner to make personnel and managerial decisions set forth in special acts of the Legislature, St. 1962, c. 322, \u00a7 1(10), (11), and that if the Legislature intended to curtail that authority it would have used language to clearly accomplish that result, i.e., \u201cnotwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary.\u201d See, e.g., G. L. c. 74, \u00a7 2B (\u201cNotwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, a city or town may provide for the construction of one and two family dwellings for persons of low income . . .\u201d); G. L. c. 19D, \u00a7 17 (\u201cNotwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, there shall be established an assisted living advisory council . . .\u201d); G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 108N (\u201cNotwithstanding the provision of any general or special law to the contrary, any city or town ... may establish an employment contract . . .\u201d). Absent such language, the department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>argues, the Legislature did not indicate any intent to restrict the commissioner\u2019s powers under the special acts and, thus, the special acts must prevail over the subsequently enacted general law. <em>Emerson College </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>393 Mass. 303, 306 (1984). This is so, however, only if the general statute, G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H, and the special statutes, St. 1962, c. 322, \u00a7 1(10), (11); St. 1950, c. 735, \u00a7 2, cannot be reconciled.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Here, we conclude that the general and special statutes are not in conflict and can be reconciled. While the department is correct that the special acts grant to the commissioner broad power to make personnel decisions and to manage the department, that power is not untrammeled. Even prior to the amendment to G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H, adding the paragraph at issue here, the commissioner\u2019s transfer of a detective was subject to review by a trial board whose decision was final. St. 1950, c. 735, \u00a7 2. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>369 Mass. 469, 470-471 (1976). This special statute, however, did not specify the standard of review to be employed by the trial board. Section 4H fills that gap by specifying that, in cities which employ more than 350 police officers, the transfer of a detective by the commissioner to another position shall be subject to review under a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard and that such review shall be conducted by the DALA in place of the trial board. There is, thus, nothing so inconsistent or repugnant in \u00a7 4H and the special acts governing the department, St. 1962, c. 322, \u00a7 1(10), (11), and St. 1950, c. 735, \u00a7 2, to preclude their separate existence as part of an harmonious statutory scheme. See <em>Lukes </em>v. <em>Election Commrs. of Worcester, </em>423 Mass. 826, 829 (1996) (\u201c[o]ur goal in interpreting two or more statutes relating to the same subject matter is to construe them so as to constitute an harmonious whole, consistent with the legislative purpose\u201d); <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>West Springfield, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 902, 904 (1986) (a special statute stands as an exception to a general law unless \u201cthe prior statute . . . is so repugnant to and inconsistent with a later enactment covering the same subject that both cannot stand\u201d). There is no irreconcilable conflict here and, thus, \u00a7 4H applies to the city of Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">2. <em>The meaning of \u201cjust cause.\u201d </em>The department argues that the \u201cjust cause\u201d standard applied under the civil service statute, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, is inapplicable to the DALA\u2019s review of the commissioner\u2019s decision to transfer a detective to another position under G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H, because St. 1950, c. 735, \u00a7 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>specifically provides that \u201cthe provisions of said chapter thirty-one shall in no way be applicable to said hearing and determination [of the review of the transfer from detective to another position by the commissioner] made thereunder.\u201d However, the department\u2019s argument overlooks the fact that the Legislature did not include this language in G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H, when it amended the statute to replace the trial board with the DALA. Neither did the Legislature define the words \u201cjust cause\u201d in specifying the DALA\u2019s standard of review. We, thus, resort to the principles of statutory construction to define what is meant by \u201cjust cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\u201cWhen a statute does not define its words we give them their usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). \u201cWe derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The department argues that the most appropriate source for a definition of \u201cjust cause\u201d should be the meaning ascribed to those words in private employment cases involving managerial personnel, i.e., \u201cgrounds . . . reasonably related, in the employer\u2019s honest judgment, to the needs of his business.\u201d <em>Goldhor </em>v. <em>Hampshire College, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 723 (1988). However, this is not a private employment case but a public employment case. In addition, the interpretation to be given \u201cjust cause\u201d should be consistent with the statutory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">On its face, the purpose of \u00a7 4H is to provide detectives who are not entitled to a hearing under G. L. c. 31, the civil service law, and who are employed in cities which employ more than 350 police officers, with the protection of a hearing to determine if their transfer by the commissioner was for \u201cjust cause.\u201d The most obvious sources for an accepted meaning of these words are other legal contexts where similar rights are afforded to other public employees, namely the civil service law. Under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, \u201c[ejxcept for just cause . . . , a tenured employee shall not be . . . transferred from his position . . . , [or] lowered in rank . . . .\u201d While the words \u201cjust cause\u201d have not been defined in G. L. c. 31, their meaning has been judicially crafted based on the circumstances presented. In disciplinary matters, we have held that \u201cjust cause\u201d under \u00a7 41 means \u201csubstantial misconduct which adversely affects the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>public interest by impairing the efficiency of the public service.\u201d <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Second Dist. Ct. of E. Middlesex, </em>389 Mass. 508, 514 (1983). <em>Police Commr. of Boston </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 594, 599 (1996). In cases involving the abolition of positions, layoffs, and even a demotion, we have equated \u201cjust cause\u201d under \u00a7 41 with lack of funds, lack of work, or any other reason based on economic necessity advanced in good faith. <em>Debnam </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>388 Mass. 632, 634 (1983). <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Boston </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 413 (1987). <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Bisbee, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 721, 722-723 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We see no reason why those definitions of \u201cjust cause\u201d under \u00a7 41 should not apply as well under G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H. Not only are both statutes designed to protect public employees from transfers to a lower rank, but the use of identical language in these statutes dictates that this language should be given a uniform interpretation. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Reading, </em>349 Mass. 17, 19 (1965). See <em>Steege </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Stow, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 970, 971-972 (1988) (term \u201cagriculture\u201d appearing in different statutes must be given the same use and definition). We also conclude that the definition of \u201cjust cause\u201d in \u00a7 4H embraces both judicially crafted definitions of \u201cjust cause,\u201d based on either performance or economic necessity. There may well be circumstances in which the transfer from the rank of detective may be warranted based on economic necessity such as lack of funding or lack of work rather than job performance. Thus, we do not believe its meaning should be restricted to one definition to the exclusion of the other. Cf. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Bisbee, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 722-723 (lowering in rank under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, might be justified by lack of funds for the position).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In this case, regardless of whether one employs a \u201cjust cause\u201d definition under the civil service statute based on performance or economic necessity, on the evidence presented, the DALA was correct in concluding that the department failed to demonstrate that it had \u201cjust cause\u201d to transfer Fedorchuk from lieutenant detective to lieutenant, thus lowering him in rank and pay. There was no evidence presented of malfeasance or misfeasance by Fedorchuk and the only evidence of alleged economic necessity presented was the commissioner\u2019s testimony that the captain of the Area B-3 police station desired to maintain the status quo and that there was an opening in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Area B-3 police station for a lieutenant to work as day duty supervisor. Contrary to the department\u2019s.assertion, this evidence does not rise to the judicially crafted level of economic necessity of \u201cjust cause\u201d under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41. Contrast <em>Debnam </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>388 Mass. at 634; <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Boston </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>23 Mass.
