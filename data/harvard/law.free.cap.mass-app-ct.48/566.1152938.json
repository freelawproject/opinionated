The hand-lettered notes contained graphic sexual questions and offered the boy money to engage in various sexual acts. Four quarters were attached to one of the notes, and a dollar bill to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">A complaint filed in the District Court charged the defendant with offering to engage in sexual conduct for a fee, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53A, and disseminating matter harmful to a minor, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28. Prior to trial, the District Court judge reported the following question to us pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979): \u201cWhether nonprinted and nonmass produced letters constitute \u2018material\u2019 as defined by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">The reported question concerns the charge under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 603, \u00a7 2, which prohibits the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>dissemination of \u201cmatter\u201d harmful to minors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 31 of c. 272, as appearing in St. 1974, 430, \u00a7 12, defines \u201cmatter\u201d for purposes of the obscenity statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 28-30D,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as \u201cany printed material, visual representation, live performance or sound recording including but not limited to, books, magazines, motion picture films, pamphlets, phonographic records, pictures, photographs, figures, statues, plays, dances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The defendant contends that the word \u201cprinted\u201d in the phrase \u201cprinted material\u201d refers only to machine-produced documents, and that the handwritten notes at issue are not covered under the statute. The Commonwealth contends that the Legislature was more concerned with content than with the medium of expression in the obscenity statutes. Pointing to the extensive list of items defined as \u201cmatter\u201d in \u00a7 31, it argues that \u201cprinted material\u201d should be more broadly construed to include handwritten documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We begin mindful of the well-established proposition that criminal statutes \u201cmust \u2018define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Triplett, [426 Mass.] 26, 29 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Twitchell, </em>416 Mass. 114, 123 (1993). Therefore, criminal statutes are strictly construed against the government.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>426 Mass. 689, 690 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\u201cPrinted material\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 31.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIn the absence of a statutory definition of [\u2018printed material,\u2019] we first look to [its] usual and accepted meaning. . . . We derive such meaning \u2018from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as [the term\u2019s] use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davie, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 28 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977), and citing 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.04 (5th ed. 1992 &amp; Supp. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary 1803 (1993) provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>two definitions of the verb \u201cprint\u201d relevant to \u00a7 31: (1) \u201c[T]o make a copy of by impressing paper against an inked printing surface or by an analogous method\u201d; and (2) \u201c[T]o form manually in unjoined characters resembling those of ordinary type.\u201d The first definition refers to mechanically produced material. The second refers to handwritten material, but is limited to writing that resembles mechanically printed type.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">We conclude that the first definition of \u201cprint\u201d is the correct one for purposes of \u00a7 31. We reject the second definition because it could potentially lead to a senseless result. If \u201cprint\u201d were so construed, the statute would apply to documents hand lettered in unjoined characters, but not to documents written in a cursive hand. We do not adopt a statutory construction leading to an \u201cabsurd and unreasonable conclusion\u201d where the statutory \u201clanguage is fairly susceptible to a construction that would lead to a logical and sensible result.\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Woburn Hous. Authy., </em>341 Mass. 539, 542 (1960), quoting from <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Cambridge, </em>310 Mass. 484, 489 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cprint\u201d in other sections of c. 272, as well as in other Massachusetts statutes, adheres to the lexical meaning we have adopted. Forms of the word \u201cprint\u201d appear in several sections of c. 272. There they are distinguished from forms of the word \u201cwrite\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by the term \u201cor.\u201d See \u00a7 21 (\u201cwrites, prints, or causes to be written or printed\u201d); \u00a7 92A (\u201cwritten or painted or printed notice or sign\u201d); \u00a7 98C (\u201cwritten or printed material\u201d). \u201cThe word \u2018or\u2019 is given a disjunctive meaning unless the context and the main purpose of all the words demand otherwise.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davie, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. at 27, quoting from <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgmt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 212 (1995), and <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>350 Mass. 340, 343 (1966), and citing 1A Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 21.14 (5th ed. 1992 &amp; Supp. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Other Massachusetts statutes similarly distinguish hand-lettered \u201cwritten\u201d material from mechanically produced \u201cprinted\u201d material. See, e.g., <em>G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79E </em>(\u201cmemorandum, writing entry, print, representation or combination thereof\u201d); c. 64H, \u00a7 1 (\u201cwritten or printed matter\u201d); c. 265, \u00a7 25 (\u201cwritten or printed communication\u201d); c. 271, \u00a7 39(b) (\u201cwritten or printed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>communication\u201d); c. 264, \u00a7 11 (\u201cwritten or printed document\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cSound principles of statutory construction dictate that interpretation of provisions having identical language be uniform.\u201d <em>Building Inspector of Mansfield </em>v. <em>Curvin, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 401, 403 (1986), quoting from <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Reading, </em>349 Mass. 17, 19 (1965), and authorities cited.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The dictionary definition of \u201cprint,\u201d the distinction between printed and written material appearing in other legal contexts, and the admonition that we must interpret criminal statutes narrowly against the Commonwealth, all compel us to reject the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that we should construe \u201cprinted material\u201d as encompassing handwritten documents for purposes of \u00a7 31.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The Legislature has carefully considered the language used in the obscenity statutes. In 1974 it revised the statutory scheme extensively,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rewriting \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 31 and inserting in the latter definitions of operative terms. Prior to 1974, the items covered by \u00a7 28 were listed serially. The fist consisted of specific items, followed by a general term: \u201cbook, pamphlet, ballad, printed paper, phonographic record or other thing.\u201d When elements are listed in such a series, rules of statutory construction require the general phrase to be construed as restricted to elements similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>to the specific elements listed. See <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 90, 92 (1996), and authorities cited; <em>Dickson </em>v. <em>Riverside Iron Works, Inc., 6 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 53, 55-56 (1978), quoting from 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47. 17 (4th ed. 1973). This land of listing can lead to difficulty in ascertaining the precise meaning of the general term. See <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, supra </em>at 92 (the court refrains from defining precisely the general term in such a series).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">When the Legislature rewrote \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 31 in 1974<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it redefined the covered items. They comprised four general categories of \u201cmatter.\u201d The category for documentary matter in \u00a7 31 \u2014 \u201cprinted material\u201d \u2014 employed terms, e.g., \u201cbooks, magazines, . . . pamphlets,\u201d whose meaning could be ascertained clearly. This definition remains current. The Legislature has frequently revised the language of the obscenity statutes both before and after 1974.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Its concern with the language of the statutory scheme indicates that when it defined the documentary category of \u201cmatter\u201d as \u201cprinted material\u201d it was aware of the meaning of the word \u201cprint\u201d and of its use in other legal contexts. As the Supreme Judicial Court has noted, \u201cThe Legislature has shown that it knows how to specify a form of communication when it wishes to do so.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>426 Mass. at 691 (holding that G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 14A, which prohibits the making of telephone calls for the sole purpose of harassing or annoying the recipient, does not extend to facsimile transmissions). The Legislature has, in fact, defined documentary material very broadly in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, twenty-sixth (1998 ed.) (defining \u201cpublic records\u201d as \u201call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>books, papers, maps, photographs, recorded tapes, financial statements, statistical tabulations, or other documentary materials or data, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by any officer or employee of any agency . . . \u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Limiting documents covered by the obscenity statutes to machine-printed material would be consistent with a legislative intent to focus on commercial disseminators. In 1977, the Supreme Judicial Court, discussing \u00a7 29,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which prohibits the dissemination or possession with intent to disseminate obscene matter, suggested that the Legislature may have had such an intent at that time. Referring to the statute\u2019s exemption of educational organizations from criminal penalties, the court noted that this leaves \u201ccriminal sanctions available for punishment of commercial disseminators of obscene materials.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Ferro, 372 Mass. 379, 383 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Recent additions to the obscenity statutes have, however, criminalized behavior that is not necessarily commercial in nature. In 1997, the Legislature criminalized the possession of obscene visual depictions of children. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, inserted by St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 2. It explained that it was necessary to focus on possession in order to \u201cstop the sexual abuse and exploitation of children\u201d because prohibitions against producing and distributing the material had not been sufficiently effective. St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 1. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Provost, </em>418 Mass. 416, 417-419 (1994) (upholding the conviction, under \u00a7 29A, as amended by St. 1988, c. 226, \u00a7 1, of a man who photographed a nude boy for private sexual gratification).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">It would be entirely consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse to proscribe the activity alleged to have occurred in this case. However, the Legislature has not done so in \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the Legislature wishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>to include handwritten material in the definition of \u201cmatter\u201d under \u00a7 31, it is for the Legislature, not this court, to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Our answer to the reported question is that handwritten letters do not constitute \u201cprinted material\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31. The case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The statute provides, in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever disseminates to a minor any matter harmful to minors . . . shall be punished. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-10\">The definitions appearing in \u00a7 31 govern \u00a7\u00a7 28, 28C, 28D, 28E, 29, 29A, 29B, 30, and 30D of c. 272.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b597-11\">We are aware of no appellate decision interpreting the meaning of \u201cprinted material\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 31.
