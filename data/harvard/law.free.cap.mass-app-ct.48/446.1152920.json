Page, an intervener in this appeal, and the Personnel Administrator for the Commonwealth. The Department of Personnel Administration is now known as the Division of Human Resources within the executive office for administration and finance (see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1998, c. 161, \u00a7\u00a7 234-235).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b476-14\">Perretta, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_d\">Section 1 of c. 534 of the Acts of 1976, as amended by St. 1993, c. 310 (Act), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-15\">\u201cIf the rights of any person acquired under the provisions of chapter thirty-one of the General Laws or under any rule made thereunder have been prejudiced through no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>fault of his own, the civil service commission may take such action as will restore or protect such rights, notwithstanding the failure of any person to comply with any requirement of said chapter thirty-one or any such rule as a condition precedent to the restoration or protection of such rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In proceedings before the Civil Service Commission (commission) pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(b), </em>and in the Superior Court on a complaint for judicial review, see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44, and G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, David M. Thomas (Thomas) claimed that the commission abused its discretion and committed an error of law in relying upon the Act to revive what he claims to be an expired eligibility list in order to allow the defendant board of selectmen (board), the town\u2019s appointing authority, to make civil service appointments from a list that did not include his name. The Superior Court judge agreed with Thomas and ordered that one of the two appointments made by the board from the challenged list be vacated and that the vacancy thereby created be filled from the list that included Thomas\u2019s name. We conclude that the commission\u2019s revival of the list in issue pursuant to the Act was valid and reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">1. <em>The facts. A </em>detailed recitation of the undisputed but somewhat complicated facts is helpful to a full understanding of the issue before us. On or about February 8, 1993, the administrator of the Department of Personnel Administration (administrator), as then known (see note 1, <em>supra), </em>issued a certification of names of candidates found eligible to fill the position of deputy fire chief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The certification was made from an eligibility list established in 1991 as the result of a competitive promotional examination. According to that list of three names, Louis Lamothe (Lamothe) and Robert Page (Page) placed first and second, respectively. The board voted to appoint Page to fill the position, and the administrator approved the \u201cby-pass\u201d of Lamothe who then appealed to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>While Lamothe\u2019s appeal to the commission was pending, the administrator announced, on February 9, 1994, a statewide revocation schedule for certain eligibility lists, including all deputy fire chief eligibility fists which \u201cresulted from examinations held in the spring of 1991.\u201d The scheduled revocation date was July 1, 1994. The administrator\u2019s directive also provided that its provisions would not apply to eligibility lists affected by restraining orders or pending litigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For whatever reason, this directive prompted the town\u2019s fire chief to give notice, on February 14, 1994, that a promotional examination for the position of deputy fire chief would be given in March of 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Two days after the fire chief\u2019s notice, the commission reversed the administrator\u2019s approval of the board\u2019s selection of Page over Lamothe, directed the administrator \u201cto recertify the names of the three candidates who were on the eligible list,\u201d and ordered the board to redo the selection process in a manner consistent with the commission\u2019s findings and conclusions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board timely filed a complaint for judicial review of the commission\u2019s decision, and a Superior Court judge, on March 17, 1994, enjoined enforcement of the commission\u2019s order. Under the terms of the preliminary injunction in that matter, which we shall refer to as the Lamothe action,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the existing 1991 eligibility fist was not to be revoked until entry of a final judgment on the board\u2019s complaint. Notwithstanding the terms of the preliminary injunction, the 1991 eligibility list was revoked, presumably pursuant to the administrator\u2019s directive but indisputably in violation of the terms of that directive, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>and the existing injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>About nine months later, on March 3, 1995, the Superior Court judge\u2019s decision in the Lamothe action entered. Her memorandum of decision, which has been included in the record before us, shows that she found and concluded that the commission\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence. However, for reasons not apparent on the record, final judgment in that action, from which neither the board nor Page appealed, did not enter until May 31, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">To complicate the issue further, a number of relevant events occurred during the time span between the date of entry of the decision (March 3, 1995) and the date of entry of the final judgment (May 31, 1995) in the Lamothe action. First, sometime in March, 1995, a deputy fire chief announced his retirement, effective July 8, 1995. No matter the exact date of that announcement, Thomas took the previously scheduled promotional examination on March 25, 1995. Next, on or about April 19, 1995, the administrator sought and obtained the commission\u2019s approval for the revival of the 1991 eligibility list pursuant to the Act for purposes of complying with the decision which had entered in the Lamothe action on March 3, 1995. When it was thereafter brought to the commission\u2019s attention that final judgment had yet to be entered in that action as of the time of its revival of the 1991 eligibility list, the commission, on May 18, 1995, revoked its authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">There the matter stood until June 5, 1995, when the administrator again requested revival of the 1991 list under the Act. However, the purpose of this request was somewhat different from that identified in the April request. The administrator now sought revival of the 1991 list for purposes of \u201callowing appointments to present vacancies,\u2019\u2019 that is, the vacancy involved in the Lamothe action <em>and </em>the vacancy created by the retirement which was to become effective the following month.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Concluding that the \u201cright of persons on the aforementioned [1991] list to be considered for current vacancies was violated through no fault of their own when it was prematurely terminated,\u201d the commission directed, on June 15, 1995, that the list be revived for purposes of implementing its decision in Lamothe\u2019s by-pass appeal, as affirmed, and of allowing those on the 1991 list to be considered for \u201call pending vacancies until a new list is established.\u201d Thereafter, sometime in July, Lamothe and Page were appointed to the two available positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">On August 17, 1995, the administrator established an eligibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ity list based upon the results of the promotional examination given on March 25, 1995. Of the four names on the new list, Thomas scored the highest. After unsuccessfully challenging the commission\u2019s decision allowing revival of the 1991 list for purposes of making appointments to \u201call pending vacancies,\u201d Thomas brought the present complaint for judicial review, arguing that the commission erred in reviving the 1991 list for purposes of allowing appointments to <em>\u201call </em>pending vacancies\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In concluding that Page\u2019s appointment to the position of deputy fire chief was invalid, the Superior Court judge began his analysis with the third paragraph of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 25, as amended by St. 1985, c. 527, \u00a7 13. As relevant, that paragraph provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201cPersons on an eligible fist shall be eligible for certification from such list for such period as the administrator shall determine, but in any event not to exceed two years, unless one of the following exceptions applies: ... (2) the administrator is temporarily enjoined by a court order from certifying names from an eligible list, in which case eligibility of persons on such list shall be extended for a period equal to the duration of such order; or (3) no new list is established, in which case eligibility of all persons on such list shall be extended until a new list is established for the same position for which the original list was established; provided, however, that the administrator may revoke the eligibility of the entire list or of any persons on such list subsequent to said two-year period if he shall determine that the effective maintenance of the merit system so requires such revocation . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Because Page was appointed more than two years after the 1991 eligibility list had been established and some two months after the expiration of the preliminary injunction in the Lamothe action, the Superior Court judge focused on \u00a7 25, third par. (3). Although he acknowledged that no new eligibility list had been established prior to Page\u2019s appointment, he concluded that the 1991 list had not been automatically extended because \u201cit had been specifically revoked by the [administrator], as of July 1, 1994.\u201d He also concluded that because \u201cPage had no rights which were \u2018prejudiced through no fault of his own,\u2019 \u201d the commission could not revive the 1991 list under the Act for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>purpose of making <em>two </em>appointments, and that in so doing, the commission \u201cprejudiced\u201d Thomas\u2019s \u201crights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We assume without deciding that, at the time of Page\u2019s appointment, the 1991 list did not exist under the terms of the third paragraph of \u00a7 25, and proceed directly to the Superior Court\u2019s determination that the commission could not revive the 1991 list under the Act for purposes of allowing the persons on that list to be considered for all pending vacancies. In challenging the commission\u2019s action, Thomas never disputed the facts, as recited in detail, or the commission\u2019s authority under the Act to revive the list for the purpose of allowing an appointment to <em>one </em>of the two then existing vacancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">There is nothing in the express language of the Act that limited the commission\u2019s authority to revival of the 1991 list for a single appointment only. To the contrary, the Act authorizes the commission to \u201ctake such action as will restore or protect\u201d the rights \u201cof any person\u201d which have been prejudiced \u201cthrough no fault of his own.\u201d That language narrowed the issue before the Superior Court judge to whether the commission had acted arbitrarily and capriciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In reviewing that action under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), it was not open to the Superior Court judge to substitute his judgment for that of the commission. Rather, he was required to \u201caccord due deference and weight not only to the commission\u2019s \u2018experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge\u2019 but also \u2018to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u2019 \u201d <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 486, 490 (1997), quoting from G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3. See <em>Seagram Distil. Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 713, 721 (1988); <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>412 Mass. 416, 420 (1992). We also note that because the Act empowers the commission to take action for \u201cremedial reasons,\u201d see <em>Dedham </em>v. <em>Dedham Police Assn., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 418, 421 n.3 (1999), its discretion is \u201cparticularly broad.\u201d <em>Boston Preservation Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>396 Mass. 489, 498 (1986), quoting from <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commn., </em>444 F.2d 841, 857 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 923 (1971). \u201cA decision is arbitrary and capricious when it lacks any rational explanation that reasonable persons might support.\u201d <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 303 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The commission\u2019s decision was based upon the administrator\u2019s assertion that the 1991 list had been inadvertently revoked despite the administrator\u2019s \u201c \u2018policy . . . not to terminate a list while there is litigation concerning the list,\u2019 and that were it not for this error \u2018the list would still be in existence.\u2019 \u201d The list was originally revived to implement the decision in the Lamothe action. Although Thomas assumes that the final judgment in that action mandated or otherwise guaranteed Lamothe\u2019s appointment, we do not agree. The final judgment in that action affirmed the commission\u2019s decision, which directed the administrator \u201cto recertify the names of the three candidates who were on the [1991] list, whereupon the selection process shall be redone by the Appointing Authority in a manner consistent with the findings and conclusions contained in this decision [of February 16, 1994].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">But for its inadvertent revocation, the 1991 list would have been automatically extended to August 17, 1995, the date the administrator established the new eligibility list. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 25; <em>Callanan </em>v. <em>Personnel Administrator, </em>400 Mass. 597, 602 (1987). In reviving the <em>1991 list two </em>months before the administrator established the 1995 eligibility list, the commission did no more than restore that which \u00a7 25, third par. (3), allowed. The subsequent establishment of the list upon which Thomas\u2019s name appeared gave him no interests or rights which, as the Superior Court judge erroneously concluded, \u201cwere prejudiced\u201d by the commission\u2019s earlier action. See <em>id. </em>at 601; <em>Kelleher </em>v. <em>Personnel Administrator of the Dept. of Personnel Admn., </em>421 Mass. 382, 389 (1995); <em>Bielawski </em>v. <em>Personnel Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admn., </em>422 Mass. 459, 466 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In these circumstances, we conclude that the commission did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in authorizing revival of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>1991 list under the Act for purposes of allowing appointments to all vacancies pending at the time of its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The judgment entered in the Superior Court is reversed and a new judgment shall be entered affirming the decision of the commission upholding the board\u2019s appointments of Lamothe and Page.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\"Certification,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1985, c. 527, \u00a7 1, is the \u201cdesignation to an appointing authority by the administrator of sufficient names from an eligible list or register for consideration of the applicants\u2019 qualifications for appointment pursuant to the personnel administration rules.\u201d As also defined in pertinent part in \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1986, c. 557, \u00a7 41, an \u201c[eligible list\u201d is a \u201clist established by the administrator, pursuant to the civil service law and rules, of persons who have passed an examination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Specifically, the directive provided: \u201cIn extremely rare instances, there may be a situation whereby, due to restraining orders or pending litigation, an eligible list is not established for an extended period of time. When such eligible list would normally be scheduled to be revoked according to DPA\u2019s [Department of Personnel Administration] policy, it may not have been in existence for the statutory minimum of two years. DPA will not revoke such list according to the schedule and will guarantee a minimum of two years of eligibility for these candidates.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\">One commissioner, while concurring with the findings and conclusions reached by the majority, dissented as to the form of relief granted. The dissenter was of the view that the \u201cappropriate remedy would be to direct that [Lamothe] be appointed to the next vacancy in the position of Deputy [Fire] Chief, with his time in grade adjusted retroactively to reflect an appointment date of March 1993.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Robert J. Page was a nominal defendant in that action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">In its decision in the Lamothe by-pass appeal, the commission stated: \u201cThere are no negative factors associated with either [Lamothe] or Page. Neither one has had any disciplinary action taken against him. Both have excellent attendance records. Both men had service as Acting Deputy Chiefs, and both had experience as Incident Commanders at fire scenes. Both men are Vietnam era veterans. Both candidates had Associate\u2019s Degrees (Page in Fire Science, [Lamothe] in Electronic Technology), and both had experience in training other firefighters.\u201d The fact upon which the commission concluded that Lamothe\u2019s by-pass was \u201cespecially troublesome in the circumstances of the case\u201d was that the board, in making its selection, \u201cafforded virtually no weight at all to the results of the examination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
