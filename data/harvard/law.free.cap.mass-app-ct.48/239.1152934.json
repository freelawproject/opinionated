They have brought a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that a certificate of compliance issued by the Secretary of Environmental Affairs (Secretary) to the town of Plymouth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>regarding the proposed construction of a sewage treatment plant is invalid. The Secretary\u2019s certificate was in response to the final supplemental environmental impact report filed by the town of Plymouth (town) to permit the implementation of the town\u2019s \u201cWaste Water Facilities Plan\u201d (project). See G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 2 (declaratory judgment procedure available \u201cto secure determinations of right, duty, status or other legal relations under . . . a . . . statute ... or administrative regulation, including determination of any question of construction or validity thereof which may be involved in such determination\u201d). See also <em>Westland Hous. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>352 Mass. 374, 383 (1967); <em>Villages Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Exec. Office of Envtl. Affairs, </em>410 Mass. 100, 106 (1991) (\u201cIt is settled that . . . relief [under c. 231A] is available to challenge the legality of administrative action even though the action concerns neither adjudication nor rule mating\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The complaint alleged that the town disposes of treated sewage effluent using an outfall pipe which carries the effluent into Plymouth Harbor. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) brought suit against the town in 1987, alleging violations of water quality standards. The suit was settled in 1992 by the entry of a consent decree which required the town to achieve compliance with the Massachusetts Clean Waters Act, see G. L. c. 21, \u00a7\u00a7 26-53, by the design and construction of a wastewater treatment plant, an effluent disposal facility, and other related facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Efforts to comply with the 1992 consent decree were unsuccessful, and the consent decree was modified in 1994 and called for new studies of the town\u2019s problems. The town proposed a new sewage treatment plant which would dispose of treated sewage through the existing outfall pipe with the remainder to be disposed into the groundwater of the Eel River watershed. On November 1, 1996, the Secretary issued her certificate to the effect that the town\u2019s \u201cWastewater Treatment Facilities Plan/ Environmental Impact Report Phase IIIA,\u201d as supplemented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the town\u2019s \u201cPhase IIIB Draft Supplemental Report \u2018adequately and properly complies with MEPA.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Thereupon the town appropriated funds for the design and construction of the proposed facilities, but on January 11, 1997, a referendum vote overturned the appropriation of funds to build a sewage treatment plant which would dispose of the treated sewage into the Eel River watershed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The town responded by filing a Notice of Project Change with the Secretary to allow for the re-evaluation of eight alternative sites for the plant. On April 2, 1997, the Secretary issued a certificate requiring the town to prepare a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (FEIR). On April 30, 1997, the town\u2019s FEIR was submitted to the Secretary for review under the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA), and on June 16, 1997, the Secretary issued a certificate stating that the town\u2019s FEIR was in compliance with MEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The town now proposes to construct a sewage treatment plant which disposes of permitted amounts of treated sewage through the existing outfall pipe, with the remainder channeled into the groundwater of the Eel River watershed. The proposed location of the plant is also alleged to be in the immediate vicinity of the properties owned by each of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The plaintiffs claim that the Secretary\u2019s certificate, issued under the Secretary\u2019s regulations, was invalid because the town\u2019s FEIR did not comply with MEPA, G. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62H, and its implementing regulations, 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 11.01 et seq.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Secretary\u2019s certificate was invalid and without legal effect, and that a further FEIR was required for further review under MEPA. The Secretary filed a motion to dismiss under Mass.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(1), 365 Mass. 755 (1974).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The judge allowed the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to maintain their action since the \u201charm alleged by the plaintiffs cannot be attributed to [the] defendant\u2019s determination of the adequacy of Plymouth\u2019s FEIR under MEPA. The defendant does not have authority to approve or disapprove the decision to build/site the treatment plant. Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, if any, would be caused by the proponent (Town of Plymouth), not the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">For the purpose of reviewing the allowance of a motion to dismiss, we accept as true the allegations of the complaint, and we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the opponent of the motion. <em>Fairneny </em>v. <em>Savogran Co., </em>422 Mass. 469, 470 (1996). On that basis we inquire whether it appears <em>certain </em>that the plaintiffs were not entitled to relief under any facts which could be proved in support of their claim. See <em>Spinner </em>v. <em>Nutt, </em>417 Mass. 549, 550 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The complaint alleges that the FEIR submitted to the Secretary for review under MEPA did not respond to the Secretary\u2019s demand, in response to the town\u2019s previous draft FEIR, for additional analysis and disclosure of environmental impacts; failed to contain a plain statement of the major environmental effects of the project and its alternatives; did not address the baseline \u201cno-build\u201d alternative; did not consider the cumulative environmental effects of the projects on other projects in the area; did not adequately quantify the direct and indirect environmental effects of the project; did not identify the means by which negative effects of the project are to be limited; and did not discuss the alternatives to the proposed mitigation measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">As for the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries, the complaint alleges that each plaintiff named in the complaint owns real property which is within 2,000-5,000 feet from the proposed sewage treatment plant, and uses the Eel River for numerous recreational purposes such as fishing, boating, and swimming. As to each plaintiff, the complaint alleges that the use and enjoyment of his or her property will be harmed by the offensive odors produced by the sewage treatment and discharge. The complaint further alleges that the proximity of the proposed sewage treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>plant (which in some instances may adversely affect the owner\u2019s septic system), and the pollution of the Eel River, will significantly reduce the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As to two of the plaintiffs, the proximity of the proposed sewage treatment plant would adversely affect the business of their trout hatchery and cranberry bogs. In sum, the complaint alleges reasonably foreseeable injuries to the use, enjoyment, and value of the real property of the plaintiffs, as well as the deprivation of their recreational use of the Eel River, all arising out of the degradation of the environment if the town\u2019s sewage treatment plant goes forward. Such is the case that <em>could </em>be made on the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The town\u2019s FEIR is not before us, and we accept as true each of the foregoing allegations, as well as all reasonable inferences that may be drawn in support of the probative value of the allegations. So understood, the complaint, on its face, has sufficiently described an inadequate FEIR as measured by the statutory requirements of an environmental impact report, see G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62B, which we set out in the margin,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and as measured by the Secretary\u2019s exceedingly detailed requirements for an environmental impact report as set forth in her regulations. See 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.07 (1993) (stating the necessity to discuss in \u201cclear, nontechnical language\u201d the project description, \u201ca summary of the major environmental effects of the project and its alternatives,\u201d and \u201ca list of all mitigation measures proposed for the project\u201d). The Secretary makes no suggestion to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Given the assumed failure of the town\u2019s FEIR to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 62B and the Secretary\u2019s regulations, the Secretary\u2019s certificate of full compliance with MEPA was also presumptively invalid,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and we arrive, thus, at the only defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>to this action which is asserted by the Secretary: that the plaintiffs \u201chave no standing to bring a declaratory judgment action against the Secretary.\u201d This is so, the argument continues, because the plaintiffs have not shown legally cognizable injury arising out of action taken by the Secretary. \u201cThe fatal flaw in the plaintiffs\u2019 argument,\u201d the Secretary argues, \u201cis that they have not shown a causal connection between their alleged injuries and the Secretary\u2019s certification that the [FEIR] complied with MEPA.\u201d In short, the Secretary adopts the judge\u2019s ruling: if the project goes forward without legal justification, and the plaintiffs then suffer cognizable injuries, the blame must be assigned to the town as the proponent of the project, not the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The Secretary\u2019s argument misconceives the principle of standing in a case such as the one before us. Of course, the plaintiffs must show legally cognizable injury. See, e.g., <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 427, 430 (1949) (\u201cCommonly a person aggrieved is one whose legal rights have been infringed\u201d). The critical question is, when does an alleged injury become \u201clegally cognizable.\u201d See <em>Villages Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Exec. Office of Envtl. Affairs, </em>410 Mass. at 106. In zoning cases, for example, what is legally cognizable may turn on the identification of the \u201clegal rights [which] were intended to be given to the plaintiff by the statute permitting the appeal [from a variance].\u201d <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. at 431. Thus, in <em>Circle Lounge, </em>the plaintiff, whose land was in a business district, had no standing to complain of the grant of a variance to the defendant whose land was in a residential district. Chief Justice Qua wrote, \u201c[Although a proprietor\u2019s rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the statute are not necessarily confined to his own zone, and may extend into another restricted zone, he is not entitled to protection greater than that afforded him in his own zone. That marks the outer limits of the <em>rights intended to be conferred upon </em>him\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 432. Since the rights granted the plaintiff under the town\u2019s zoning code were not violated, the plaintiff\u2019s claim of injury from business competition as the basis for his standing to sue was rejected as damnum absque injuria.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">This analysis, which turns on identifying the rights intended to be protected by the applicable statute or regulation, was more recently discussed in <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 294 (1977). There, insurance agents and brokers claimed standing to challenge a regulation of the insurance commissioner on the ground that \u201cthe plaintiffs might be subject to unfair competition\u201d as a result of the regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 296. The case was brought under c. 231A; no statutory right of appeal was involved. The court held that the plaintiffs had standing<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> since \u201c[a]n examination of the entire regulatory scheme governing the insurance industry shows a clear public interest in the maintenance of a <em>reasonable </em>competitive level within the industry\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 295. Since the plaintiffs made a showing of unfair competition, they were entitled to maintain their action against the commissioner. The court summarized its holding in cases where private relief from agency action is sought: \u201cA party has standing when it can allege an injury within the area of concern of the statute or regulatory scheme under which the injurious action has occurred. ... If the injury alleged is within the scope of those concerns we believe that a challenger has shown sufficient injury to establish standing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293-294.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Villages Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Exec. Office of Envtl. Affairs, </em>410 Mass. at 106, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., supra, </em>is cited with approval. See also <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport </em>v. <em>DeCarolis, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 353 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">We arrive, then, at the central issue in this case: what is the area of concern of MEPA and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and do the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries fall within that area of concern? We turn to the MEPA statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The primary purpose of MEPA is the avoidance of damage to the environment by requiring all State and local agencies to determine the environmental impact \u201cof all works, projects or activities conducted by them\u201d and to \u201cuse all practicable means and measures to minimize damage to the environment.\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 61.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These purposes are intended to be given widespread attention by all agencies of governmental authority; \u00a7 61 continues: \u201cUnless a clear contrary intent is manifested, <em>all </em>statutes shall be interpreted arid administered so as to minimize and prevent damage to the environment\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy., </em>366 Mass. 755, 760 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">MEPA\u2019s area of concern clearly is the protection of the environment from damage caused by projects having an environmental impact. The administrative vehicle for achieving MEPA\u2019s goals of minimizing and preventing damage to the environment is the environmental impact report. See 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.07 which, as discussed above, prescribes the detailed discussion of environmental impacts in nontechnical language. See also 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.08 (1993), which provides for the opportunity for public hearings, informal workshops, public meetings, written comments from the public, and publication in the Environmental Monitor of notice of the availability of the draft report.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The administrative process of MEPA, then, and the public\u2019s involvement in that process, are critical to achieving MEPA\u2019s goal of protecting the environment, and claims of the foreseeable degradation both of the environment and of the administrative review process are equally areas of concern of MEPA. Without close adherence to the review process of environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>impact reports, there can be no assurance that a project will not significantly and adversely affect the environment. In <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>402 Mass. 611, 614 (1988),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the court wrote that \u201c[t]he purpose of MEPA was to protect the environment, and that, therefore, an allegation of a violation of MEPA or a regulation pursuant to MEPA qualified under [\u00a7 7A] as a claim that \u2018damage to the environment is occurring or is about to occur.\u2019 . . . Therefore, if the plaintiffs in this case were alleging . . . that a developer or agency proposing a project failed to comply with the procedural requirements of a statute or regulation designed to protect the environment, the Superior Court would have subject matter jurisdiction under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See note 13, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries and complaints fall squarely within the concerns of MEPA: the foreseeable negative environmental impact of the town\u2019s project, and the failure to comply with material requirements of MEPA\u2019s administrative process. In particular, the complaint alleges that the foreseeable consequences of the town\u2019s allegedly defective FEIR will, if the project goes forward without completing the review process as required by the regulations, cause environmental damage because of noxious odors from the nearby sewage treatment plant and the pollution of the watershed of the Eel River, all of which will result in the deterioration of the value and the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>and enjoyment of the plaintiffs\u2019 property. The complaint on its face, then, sufficiently alleges that the plaintiffs will incur injuries and damages that fall within the zone of concern that MEPA, and the supporting administrative process, were designed to protect. See <em>Villages Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Exec. Office of Envtl. Affairs, </em>410 Mass. at 106 (future expenses of property owners are cognizable injuries). It follows that the plaintiffs have standing to bring this action to enforce the full range of the requirements of MEPA.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In cases seeking declaratory relief regarding administrative action, the plaintiff must show (1) an actual controversy, (2) that he or she has standing, (3) that necessary parties have been joined, and (4) that available administrative remedies have been exhausted. See <em>Villages Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Exec. Office of Envtl. Affairs, </em>410 Mass. 100, 106 (1991). Of these four factors, the Secretary only puts in dispute factor two \u2014 the absence of standing of the plaintiffs. We confine this opinion, therefore, to a discussion of that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The Secretary required additional disclosures regarding environmental impacts without, apparently, affecting the Secretary\u2019s certificate of full compliance with MEPA. See note 9, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\">During the relevant time period of this case, the 1993 version of the regulations was in effect. The regulations were amended in 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b271-11\">The motion did not state the grounds on which it was brought. Instead, reference was made to an accompanying memorandum of law. That memorandum is not in the record before us. The plaintiffs do not claim that any of the Secretary\u2019s arguments are made for the first time on appeal, and we accept the Secretary\u2019s brief to this court as essentially the argument she made below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b271-12\">The Secretary makes no argument that the plaintiffs have not complied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>with G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62H, requiring prior notice to the Secretary of any intention to commence an action alleging failure to comply with MEPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The record appendix includes an affidavit of a realtor regarding the diminution in the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties that has already occurred. The judge did not convert the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, and therefore did not consider the affidavit. We follow that path.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\">General Laws c. 30, \u00a7 62B, provides that an \u201cenvironmental impact report shall contain statements describing the nature and extent of the proposed project and its environmental impact; all measures being utilized to minimize environmental damage; any adverse short-term and long-term environmental consequences which cannot be avoided should the project be undertaken; and reasonable alternatives to the proposed project and their environmental consequences.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The complaint alleges that notwithstanding the Secretary\u2019s compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>certificate, the Secretary \u201cnonetheless required additional analysis and disclosure of environmental impacts.\u201d The Secretary\u2019s certificate is not part of the record, and the actions contemplated by this addendum to her certificate are not clear. Nevertheless, the Secretary makes no claim that her certificate of compliance with MEPA is not in effect, or that the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative remedies have not been exhausted. We proceed, then, on the undisputed assumption that the issuance by the Secretary of a final certificate of full compliance with MEPA constitutes final agency action by the Secretary. See <em>Walpole </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Exec. Office of Envtl. Affairs, </em>405 Mass. 67, 72 (1989) (Secretary\u2019s certificate of compliance with MEPA marks the conclusion of the administrative process).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The court noted that the \u201c \u2018actual controversy\u2019 and standing requirements should be liberally construed in accord with the provisions of G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 9.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. at 293.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. at 295, the court refers to the fact that the case involves a regulated industry, but it did so in the context of a regulatory scheme that \u201cshows a clear public interest in the maintenance of a reasonable competitive level,\u201d thereby justifying the recognition of unfair competition as a cognizable injury. Contrast <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. at 432.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\">General Laws c. 30, \u00a7 61, provides in part, \u201cAll agencies, departments, boards, commissions and authorities of the commonwealth- shall review, evaluate, and determine the impact on the natural environment of all works, projects or activities conducted by them and shall use all practicable means and measures to minimize damage to the environment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\"><em>Cummings </em>arose under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A, not c. 231A. Section 7A offers a statutory remedy to ten persons domiciled in Massachusetts for claims of \u201cdamage to the environment\u201d without the necessity of establishing further the standing of the plaintiffs. The section permits a civil action brought by such persons upon allegations that damage to the environment is occurring or is about to occur. The Superior Court may restrain the person causing or about to cause such damage provided that the offending conduct is a violation of a statute, ordinance, by-law, or regulation. The complaint in this case does not allege an entitlement to the remedies provided by \u00a7 7A. Such an attempt would, in any event, be futile. It is settled that \u00a7 7A is not available in a suit against the Secretary in connection with her administration of MEPA. See <em>Walpole </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Exec. Office of Envtl. Affairs, </em>405 Mass. 67, 71 (1989). <em>Walpole </em>also holds that the acts of the Secretary in merely administering MEPA are not subject to review by certiorari under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. <em>Id. </em>at 72-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">What emerges is that \u00a7 7A may be seen as offering parallel relief to c. 231A, although the parties will be different.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\">See note 13, <em>supra, </em>describing the action authorized by G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A, which is designed to permit judicial intervention in cases where the environmental damage is imminent. There is no claim of imminent damage in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">No doubt the plaintiffs could await the imminent construction of the town\u2019s project, and then bring suit against the town under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A. If, as we must assume, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are meritorious, it would make no sense to permit the town to go forward with a complex project that is doomed at the outset. More important is that here, the administrative process has been exhausted, see note 2, supra, and to require the plaintiffs to await the imminent construction of the project would have a serious adverse effect upon the credibility and importance of the administrative review process \u2014 a process which, as we have stated, is critical to the desired outcome of protecting the environment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\">It is important to emphasize at this point that we have only the bare bones of the record of the controversy before us. We have neither the environmental impact statement nor the Secretary\u2019s certificate, and we have not considered the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding those documents. It may be that a motion for summary judgment on an amplified record, or a trial on the merits, would yield a different understanding of the case. As matters stand, however, we are confined to the narrow issues presented by an appeal from the allowance of a motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
