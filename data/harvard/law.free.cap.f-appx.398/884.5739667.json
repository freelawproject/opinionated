The district court determined, <em>sua sponte, </em>that Lawrence\u2019s claims were time-barred and dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-18\">Lawrence subsequently filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, in which he disputed the statute of limitations applied by the district court. On November 24, 2009, the district court denied the motion to amend, reiterating its ruling that the claims were time-barred, and adding that Count IV of Lawrence\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal, Lawrence contends the district court erred (1) in dismissing his complaint <em>sua sponte </em>on limitations and (2) in dismissing Count IV of his complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. We reject Lawrence\u2019s contentions and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">In 1997, Lawrence was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death in a trial presided over by Defendant-Appellee Wiley F. Bowen in the Superior Court of Harnett County, North Carolina. Lawrence exhausted his direct appeal of the conviction and sentence on January 8, 2001. <em>See Lav/rence v. North Carolina, </em>531 U.S. 1083, 121 S.Ct. 789, 148 L.Ed.2d 684 (2001) (denying petition for writ of certiorari).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Lawrence initiated state post-conviction proceedings by filing a Motion for Appropriate Relief (\u201cMAR\u201d) on August 1, 2001. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1420(c)(7). In February 2002, the MAR court, also presided over by Judge Bowen, denied relief on all claims after denying Lawrence\u2019s motion to reassign the MAR to a different judge. Lawrence then appealed the MAR court\u2019s rulings. The Supreme Court of North Carolina denied discretionary review on November 21, 2002, <em>see State v. Lawrence, </em>356 N.C. 441, 573 S.E.2d 159 (2002), and the Supreme Court of the United States denied <em>certiorari, see Lav/rence v. North Carolina, </em>538 U.S. 987, 123 S.Ct. 1800,155 L.Ed.2d 682 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">On May 2, 2003, Lawrence timely filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 seeking a writ of habeas corpus in the Eastern District of North Carolina. The district court granted the writ, finding ineffective assistance of counsel because Lawrence\u2019s attorney failed, in the direct appeal, to challenge the use of burglary as an aggravating factor for his death sentence. <em>Lawrence v. Polk, </em>No. 5:03-HC-0327-BO, at 12-13 (E.D.N.C. filed Mar. 19, 2007). However, the district court rejected as non-eognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 Lawrence\u2019s two due process claims related to the handling of his MAR. Specifically, the district court rejected Lawrence\u2019s challenge to Judge Bowen\u2019s involvement in the MAR proceedings and his entry of the order denying the MAR without specifying grounds for the denial. <em>Id. </em>This court reversed, in part, the judgment of the district court on February 22, 2008, finding that the writ was improperly granted because the state court had reasonably applied <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), in rejecting the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Lawrence v. Branker, </em>517 F.3d 700, <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 162, 172 L.Ed.2d 117 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">On March 24, 2009, Lawrence filed the complaint underlying this appeal, alleging that (1) the defendants violated his procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; (2) the MAR judge denied his state-conferred right to have a thorough and complete review of his conviction and death sentence in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (3) the North Carolina Attorney General denied his state-conferred right to have a thorough and complete review of his conviction and death sentence in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (4) the North Carolina Attorney General deliberately deprived him of meaningful access to the courts in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>entered an order dismissing the action as time-barred. Lawrence timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">The district court concluded that all of Lawrence\u2019s purported claims accrued in 2002, when the Superior Court issued the order denying his MAR.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> J.A. 143-45, 172-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>83. Applying the North Carolina statute of limitations for personal injury actions to Lawrence\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, the district court found that Lawrence\u2019s actions were time-barred as outside the applicable three-year period and dismissed the action as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Eriline Co. S.A. v. Johnson, </em>440 F.3d 648, 655-56 (4th Cir.2006) (noting that a court may raise the issue of whether an action is time-barred <em>sua sponte </em>in cases filed under \u00a7 1915); <em>Nasim v. Warden, Md. House of Corree., </em>64 F.3d 951, 956 (4th Cir.1995) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Further, the district court rejected Lawrence\u2019s contention that the statute of limitations for his \u00a7 1983 action was tolled while his federal habeas petition was pending. Noting that the two claims involved different causes of action and different parties, the district court found that the habeas petition had no bearing on Lawrence\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims. J.A. 175-76. <em>See also Bd. of Regents v. Tomanio, </em>446 U.S. 478, 486, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980) (recognizing that the statute of limitations is not tolled while \u201ca litigant pursues a related, but independent cause of action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">With regard to Count IV of Lawrence\u2019s complaint, the district court discerned no allegation to support Lawrence\u2019s claim that he was denied access to the courts. Instead, the court noted that Lawrence had filed a habeas petition that had been adjudicated by a federal court in a process that was \u201cinvolved\u201d and in which he \u201chad counsel at every step.\u201d J.A. 180. Thus, the district court found that Lawrence had failed to state a claim for denial of access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a claim on statute of limitations grounds <em>de novo. Robinson v. Clipse, </em>602 F.3d 605, 608 (4th Cir.2010); <em>Smith v. Pennington, </em>352 F.3d 884, 892 (4th Cir.2003). Similarly, we review a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), <em>de novo. De\u2019Lonta v. Angelone, </em>330 F.3d 630, 633 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Having had the benefit of the parties\u2019 briefs and their oral arguments, and having thoroughly reviewed the record, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s well-reasoned orders in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-7\">. Lawrence appealed the MAR court's ruling, a process that ended when the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Supreme Court denied <em>certiorari </em>in 2003. <em>Lawrence v. North Carolina, </em>538 U.S. 987, 123 S.Ct. 1800, 155 L.Ed.2d 682 (2003). The district court found that, even using this later date, Lawrence\u2019s action falls outside the three-year statute of limitations. J.A. 145.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b913-8\">. Lawrence's contention on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his claims under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201-02, also fails. The statute of limitations bars Lawrence\u2019s claims for both declaratory and injunctive relief, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to address Lawrence's claims for declaratory relief after finding his action time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations. <em>See City Nat'l Bank v. Edmisten, </em>681 F.2d 942, 945 n. 6 (4th Cir.1982) (stating that the Declaratory Judgment Act is \"not itself a basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction\u201d) (citing <em>Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>339 U.S. 667, 671-72, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194(1950)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
