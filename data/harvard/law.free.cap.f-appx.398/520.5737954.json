Thomas argues that the district court erred by (1) failing to reduce his sentence below the applicable statutory minimum penalty, (2) failing to reduce his sentence below the amended guideline range, and (3) failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors when calculating a reasonable sentence. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">In 2004, Thomas pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine. The presentence investigation report set Thomas\u2019s base offense level at 38, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), because Thomas\u2019s offense involved 4 kilograms of crack cocaine. Thomas was subject to a total offense level of 37, a criminal history category of III, and a guideline imprisonment range of 262 to 327 months. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), Thomas was subject to a mandatory minimum of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">Prior to sentencing, the government filed a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a two-level reduction in Thomas\u2019s base offense level, based on Thomas\u2019s substantial assistance. At Thomas\u2019s sentencing hearing, the government orally amended its \u00a7 5K1.1 motion to recommend a four-level, rather than a two-level, departure. The court granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a 4-level departure and also departed an additional 2 levels, reducing Thomas\u2019s offense level to 31 and his guideline imprisonment range to 135 to 168 months. The court sentenced Thomas to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by 5 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-19\">In January 2009, the district court, <em>sua sponte, </em>ordered the probation office to complete a supplemental report addressing whether Thomas was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-20\">The government acknowledged that Thomas was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction, because Amendment 706 reduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>his original offense level of 37 to 35, and his original guideline imprisonment range of 262 to 327 months to 210 to 262 months. It asserted that the court should recalculate Thomas\u2019s total offense level, then apply a departure comparable to the departure Thomas originally received as a result of the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The government noted that, although such a departure would result in an amended guideline range of 108 to 135 months, Thomas was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum of 10 years\u2019 (120 months) imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Thomas responded that, under <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and Kimbrough,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court had discretion to impose a sentence below the low end of the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The district court reduced Thomas\u2019s sentence to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment. It noted that Thomas was subject to an amended total offense level of 35 and an amended guideline imprisonment range of 210-262 months. The court explained that Thomas\u2019s original sentence resulted from a downward departure, and that the 100-month sentence resulted from a comparable departure from the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The government appealed Thomas\u2019s 100-month sentence, arguing that the district court lacked discretion to depart below the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). We vacated Thomas\u2019s 100-month sentence and remanded for re-sentencing, holding that, pursuant to <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008), \u201cthe district court was not authorized to reduce Thomas\u2019s sentence below the applicable [120-month] statutory minimum, even though the government filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion at the original sentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>360 Fed.Appx. 4, 7 (11th Cir.2010). Following the remand, the district court sentenced Thomas to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">\n<em>A. Failure to Impose Sentence Below Mandatory Minimum Term of Imprisonment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Under the law of the case doctrine, we are bound by findings of fact and conclusions of law made on a prior appeal of the same case unless (1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made contrary decisions of law applicable to an issue, or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and could work manifest injustice. <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">Thomas has failed to show that the law of the case doctrine does not apply, because he has not established that one of the three exceptions set forth in <em>Stinson </em>applies. First, no trial was held after we issued our first <em>Thomas </em>decision. Second, Thomas has failed to cite subsequent controlling authority that contradicts <em>Thomas. </em>Instead, he simply argues that <em>Williams, </em>a case decided before <em>Thomas, </em>does not apply to his case. Finally, as explained be-' low, Thomas has failed to show that our decision in <em>Thomas </em>was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">In <em>Thomas, </em>we relied on <em>Williams </em>and held that \u201cthe district court was not authorized to reduce Thomas\u2019s sentence below the applicable [120-month] statutory minimum, even though the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion at the original sentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>See Thomas, </em>860 Fed.Appx. at 7. In <em>Williams, </em>we held, in the context of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, that \u201ca downward departure from [a] mandatory minimum does not constitute a waiver or dispensing\u201d of the mandatory minimum. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1341. Although the defendant in <em>Williams </em>was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because, unlike Thomas, he was originally sentenced below the applicable statutory minimum, Williams\u2019s holding that a district court is bound by a statutory minimum penalty, even if a downward departure was originally granted, applies with equal force to Thomas\u2019s case. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1340-41. Thus, our holding in <em>Thomas </em>is not clearly erroneous in light of <em>Williams, </em>and the law of the case doctrine applies. <em>See Stinson, </em>97 F.3d at 469. Accordingly, Thomas is bound by our prior determination that the district court lacked authority to sentence him below the 120-month statutory minimum term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\n<em>B. Failure to Impose Sentence Below Amended Guideline Range</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Our precedent, as well as recent Supreme Court precedent, forecloses Thomas\u2019s argument that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and permit courts to sentence a defendant below the amended guideline range. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>apply to original sentencing proceedings and do not address motions to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)); <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, because such proceedings \u201cdo not implicate the interests identified in <em>Booker\u201d). </em>Moreover, as noted above, the district court lacked discretion to sentence Thomas below the 120-month statutory minimum. Accordingly, the district court did not err by failing to sentence Thomas below the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">\n<em>C. Failure to Consider 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) Sentencing Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Any error in failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors is harmless because, as noted above, Thomas received the lowest sentence the district court could impose. <em>See United States v. Arevalo-Juarez, </em>464 F.3d 1246, 1252 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that we will \u201caffirm for harmless error in the sentencing context if ... the sentencing court would have likely sentenced the defendant in the same way absent the error\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm Thomas\u2019s 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\">. <em>United States v.
