R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion (No. 09-8246), and the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to reopen the time for\u2019 appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6) (No. 10-6395). We dismiss Appeal No. 09-8246 for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed, and affirm the court\u2019s order in Appeal No. 10-6395.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-16\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-19\">The district court\u2019s order denying Slezak\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion was entered on the docket on September 29, 2009. The notice of appeal was filed, at the earliest, on December 14, 2009.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to Rule 4(a)(6), Slezak filed a motion to reopen the time for appeal on January 6, 2010. By his own admission, Slezak received notice on November 20, 2009, that his Rule 59 motion had been denied. Because he failed to timely file the motion to reopen within fourteen days thereafter, as required by Rule 4(a)(6), the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen the appeal period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>cordingly, in Appeal No. 10-6395, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Slezak\u2019s Rule 4(a)(6) motion. Because Slezak failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period in Appeal No. 09-8246, we dismiss that appeal as untimely. Slezak\u2019s motion for certificates of appealability is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">No. 10-6395 <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">No. 09-8246 <em>DISMISSED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-12\">. This is the date appearing on the notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1); <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b948-13\">. When notice of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed is not received within twenty-one days of entry, a party may move to reopen the time to Ble an appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). Prior to December 1, 2009, the rule required a motion to reopen to be filed within 180 days after the judgment or order was entered or within sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>en days after the moving party received notice of the entry, whichever was earlier. Effective December 1, 2009, Rule 4(a)(6) was amended to permit the motion to reopen to be filed within 180 days of entry of the judgment or order or within fourteen days after the moving party receives notice, whichever is earlier. Because the relevant dates in this appeal overlap the applicable dates for both versions of the rule, we have given Slezak the benefit of the doubt and applied the more liberal fourteen day period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
