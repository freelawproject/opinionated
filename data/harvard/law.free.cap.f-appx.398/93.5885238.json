Allen contends that the district court plainly erred when it increased his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(a) and (b). Because Allen did not object to the application of \u00a7 3A1.2(a) and (b) in the district court, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Alvarado-Santilano, </em>434 F.3d 794, 795 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">Section 3A1.2 instructs the district court to apply the greatest offense level adjustment found in subsection (a), (b), or (c). The language of \u00a7 3A1.2 is plain and unambiguous and does not appear to be subject to interpretation. Therefore, the district court committed error that was clear or obvious when it enhanced Allen\u2019s base offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3A1.2(a) and (b). <em>See United States v. Leonard, </em>157 F.3d 343, 345-46 (5th Cir.1998) (finding plain error, even in the absence of controlling authority, where the pertinent guidelines were clear and unambiguous).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Had the district court properly applied \u00a7 3A1.2, Allen\u2019s guideline imprisonment range would have been 27-33 months instead of 37-46 months. The district court, however, did not base its sentencing decision on the guideline range. Instead, it imposed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment, a sentence above even the top end of the erroneous range, while commenting on the need to punish and deter Allen\u2019s continued criminal activity. Allen cites to no evidence in the record indicating that the court relied on the erroneous range or would not have imposed the same sentence absent the error. Further, there is substantial evidence supporting the upward variance. Because Allen has not shown that the court could not impose the same sentence on remand or that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the error, the sentence would have been lower, Allen cannot show plain error. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 648-52 (5th Cir .2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Allen also contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is twice the correct guideline range and is based on a lengthy and extensive mental health condition suffered as a result of his being repeatedly molested as a child. Because Allen did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence after it was imposed, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Contrary to his contention, Allen\u2019s disturbing personal history and mental health problems were not the basis for the decision to vary upwardly to the statutory maximum. The court\u2019s explanation at sentencing and its statement of reasons reflect that it based its decision on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense of conviction, Allen\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need to provide just punishment and to deter Allen from further criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Given the significant deference that is owed to a court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the court\u2019s reasons for the sentence, Allen has not shown that the sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). This court has affirmed, as reasonable, variances similar to and greater than the increase in Allen\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 348-50; <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 530-32 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b120-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
