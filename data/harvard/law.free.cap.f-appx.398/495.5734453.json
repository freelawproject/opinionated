Smith argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because it erroneously concluded that he previously was convicted of a felony in Alabama state court under Alabama Code \u00a7 13A-11-72(a). Smith argues that he was convicted of a misdemeanor under subsection (b) of that statute. In support, Smith points to the certified copy of the judgment (\u201cConviction Report\u201d), which states that he was convicted under \u00a7 13A-ll-72(b), and to the fact that he was sentenced to only six months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">We review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal <em>de novo. United States v. DuBose, </em>598 F.3d 726, 729 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cIn reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a conviction, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">Under \u00a7 922(g)(1), it is unlawful for a person \u201cwho has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\u201d to ship, transport, or receive ammunition affecting interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Relevant to this case, subsection (a) of the Alabama statute entitled \u201cCertain persons forbidden to possess pistol,\u201d prohibits a person who has been convicted \u201cof committing or attempting to commit a crime of violence\u201d from owning a pistol or having one in his possession or under his control. Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-11-72(a). Subsection (b) provides that \u201cNo person who is a drug addict or an habitual drunkard shall own a pistol or have one in his or her control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 13A-ll-72(b). A violation of subsection (a) of \u00a7 13A-11-72 is considered to be a Class C felony and is punishable for not \u201cless than 1 year and 1 day,\u201d and \u201cnot more than five years.\u201d <em>See Matehum v. State, </em>880 So.2d 1202, 1208 (Ala.Crim.App.2003); Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-4, 13A-5-6(a)(3), 13A-ll-84(a). In contrast, a conviction under subsection (b) of \u00a7 13A-11-72 is considered to be a misdemeanor, \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for any term less than one year.\u201d <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-ll-72(b), 13A-11-84, 13A-l-2(9) (defining \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u201c[a]n offense for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment not in excess of one year may be imposed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The parties do not disputed that a conviction under \u00a7 13A-ll-72(b) is a misdemeanor conviction and a conviction under \u00a7 13A-ll-72(a) is a felony conviction. The only dispute is whether the district court was correct in its determination that Smith was convicted under \u00a7 13A-ll-72(a) and not \u00a7 13A~ll-72(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that Smith was indicted for and pleaded guilty to a felony offense. The indictment specifically references \u00a7 13A-ll-72(a) and does not made any allegations supporting a conviction under \u00a7 13A-ll-72(b). During the plea colloquy, the state court judge informed Smith that the offense to which he pleaded guilty carries a maximum five-year prison term. The paperwork completed following the plea includes a reference to the offense being a felony and Smith paid the docketing fee applicable to a felony conviction. Further, the district court sentenced Smith to a term longer than one year in prison based on the more than six months of credited time served combined with the additional six-month term imposed at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>154 F.3d 1291, 1295-96 (11th Cir.1998) (in determining the sentence imposed, aggregate the credit awarded by the sentencing court for time served and the additional sentence term imposed).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Therefore, we conclude that Smith\u2019s criminal history included a felony conviction under Alabama Code \u00a7 13A-ll-72(a), for which he served a sentence in excess of one year. Thus, the district court correctly determined that this predicate offense constituted a felony and, therefore, supported Smith\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Smith\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
