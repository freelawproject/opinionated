Kelly, federal prisoner # 11952-035, appeals the district court\u2019s order granting his motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the amendments to the Guideline governing cocaine base. Although the district court reduced Kelly\u2019s sentence from 151 months to 121 months, the bottom of the newly applicable guidelines range, Kelly argues that, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court had the discretion to grant a greater reduction. He also avers in that regard that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(u) does not grant the Sentencing Commission authority to bind the district court\u2019s discretion in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(e)(2), and a district court may not reduce a sentence below the minimum provided in the amended guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 238; <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings). To the extent that Kelly complains that the district court did not provide reasons for its decision, the district court need not do so. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
