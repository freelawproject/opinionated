He contends: the district court committed plain error in misadvising him of the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>cable penalties, resulting in a guilty plea that was <em>not </em>knowing, voluntary, and intelligent; his sentence was procedurally unreasonable; and the court committed clear error by including methamphetamine and cocaine stolen in July 2006 as part of its drug-quantity calculations for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">We review only for plain error two issues that Martinez did <em>not </em>raise in district court: his guilty plea was involuntary, and his sentence was procedurally unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). Under plain-error review, we may reverse if, <em>inter alia: </em>there is error; it is clear or obvious; and it affects defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>E.g., United States v. Molina, </em>469 F.3d 408, 411 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">For showing reversible plain error for his plea, Martinez must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would <em>not </em>have entered the plea. <em>Id. </em>at 411-12. In contending his convictions must be vacated, Martinez claims an incorrect possible-penalties admonition rendered his guilty plea involuntary. Even assuming the district court committed plain error in misadvising him of the applicable penalties, Martinez points to <em>no </em>record evidence showing the error affected his decision to plead guilty. <em>See id. </em>at 412; <em>see also United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). Accordingly, Martinez fails to meet his burden under plain-error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">For the two sentencing issues, we engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence imposed by the district court. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Although the substantive reasonableness of the sentence is ultimately reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard, we must first ensure that the district court committed <em>no </em>\u201csignificant procedural error\u201d, such as imposing a sentence based on clearly erroneous findings of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">We likewise reject Martinez\u2019 assertion that the district court committed procedural error by attributing drug quantities to Martinez that were <em>not </em>proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Because Martinez\u2019 drug-offense sentence was within the advisory Guidelines sentencing range, the district court was required to find evidence of the drug quantity only by a preponderance of the evidence, and it was <em>not </em>plain error to do so. <em>United States v. Doggett, </em>230 F.3d 160, 164-65 (5th Cir.2000). Moreover, Martinez\u2019 within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness which Martinez has not rebutted. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Finally, Martinez fails to show the district court committed clear error by including, as part of its drug-quantity calculations, methamphetamine and cocaine stolen in July 2006. <em>See United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 878 (5th Cir. 1998). In determining the amount of drugs attributable to defendant, the sentencing court may consider any relevant information, without regard to its admissibility, as long as the court concludes that it has sufficient indicia of reliability. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the district court did not commit clear error in relying on the presentence investigation report and testimony from the trial of Martinez\u2019 codefendants to make its drug-quantity finding. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>963 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>693, 708 (5th Cir.1992). Although Martinez asserts the district court did <em>not </em>provide him adequate notice of its intent to rely upon that trial evidence, he did <em>not </em>object on this basis at sentencing and has <em>not </em>shown that the lack of notice affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b44-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
