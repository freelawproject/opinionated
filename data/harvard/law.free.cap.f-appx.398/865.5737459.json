Appellant Anthony Jerome Brown challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress a handgun found on his person and its decision to classify Brown as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">Brown\u2019s indictment resulted from an investigatory stop in Durham, North Carolina. On May 17, 2008, a police officer observed Brown and two other men standing in the street in an area well known to Durham police for illegal drug sales and violent crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each male was standing within two feet of each other. While the officer watched, the two other men exchanged something hand-to-hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-17\">Suspecting that a drug transaction had just occurred, the officer decided to investigate and called for back up. When the officers approached the group, Brown walked away from them across a yard despite the prominent display of \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs. Brown walked up to a nearby porch and began a hushed conversation with the woman standing on the stoop. One of the officers followed Brown and asked to speak with him. Brown became belligerent and nonresponsive, refusing to state where he lived. After three unsuccessful attempts to frisk Brown, the officer grabbed Brown\u2019s belt and arm and escorted him to the patrol vehicle. Brown attempted to flee, but the officers finally subdued him. They handcuffed Brown, resumed the frisk, and discovered a loaded semi-automatic handgun on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-18\">The district court denied Brown\u2019s motion to suppress the weapon, finding that the officer had \u201cmore than adequate reason ... to suspect not only that criminal activity was afoot, but that Brown was armed or possessed illegal drugs.\u201d J.A. 239. Brown entered a conditional guilty plea to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, preserving his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion. At sentencing, the district court found that three of Brown\u2019s prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>offenses qualified him as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e): two convictions for breaking and entering a commercial establishment in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-54(a) and another conviction for felony eluding arrest in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-141.5. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">On appeal, Brown argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the seized handgun because the police officers lacked reasonable suspicion to detain and search him. Brown further contends that the district court erred by classifying him as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), because his prior convictions for burglary of a commercial building \u2014 in light of recent Supreme Court precedent \u2014 no longer qualify as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under \u00a7 924(e). We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">We begin by considering Brown\u2019s argument that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress the handgun found on his person. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying the denial of a motion to suppress for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Neely, </em>564 F.3d 346, 349 (4th Cir.2009). When a suppression motion has been denied, this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Brown contends that the officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights because they lacked a reasonable, articulable suspicion to detain and search him. Specifically, Brown argues that he was an innocent bystander, and that because he was not involved in the hand-to-hand transaction witnessed by police, the officers lacked reasonable suspicion to believe he was engaged in any illegal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">A police officer may conduct a brief investigatory stop \u201cwhen the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). Whether there is reasonable suspicion to justify the stop depends on the totality of the circumstances, including the information known to the officer and any inferences to be drawn therefrom. <em>See United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 8, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). The reasonable suspicion determination is a \u201ccommonsensical proposition,\u201d and deference should be accorded to police officers\u2019 determinations based on their experience of \u201cwhat transpires on the street.\u201d <em>See United States v. Foreman, </em>369 F.3d 776, 782 (4th Cir.2004) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">In light of what the officers knew or could reasonably infer from the circumstances in this case, the district court did not err in finding reasonable suspicion to detain Brown. The officers testified that the area in which they observed Brown was well known for illegal drugs and violent crime. <em>See Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (holding that a suspect\u2019s presence in a high-crime area is a factor police may take into consideration in making the reasonable suspicion determination); <em>United States v. Lender, </em>985 F.2d 151, 154 (4th Cir.1993) (explaining that, while a defendant\u2019s mere presence in a high-crime area does not, by itself, raise reasonable suspicion, an area\u2019s propensity for criminal activity may be considered). Brown was standing in close proximity to the individuals engaged in behavior suspected to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>drug transaction. Because individuals engaged in such a transaction would be unlikely to allow an uninvolved bystander to observe them, the officers reasonably believed Brown to be a lookout or armed security. <em>See United States v. Perkins, </em>363 F.3d 317, 321 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that due weight must be given \u201cto common sense judgments reached by officers in light of their experience and training\u201d). Brown\u2019s subsequent evasive behavior buttressed their suspicions. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>396 F.3d 579, 584 (4th Cir.2005) (recognizing evasive behavior as a factor relevant to the reasonable suspicion analysis); <em>United States v. Mayo, </em>361 F.3d 802, 807-08 (4th Cir.2004) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Once an officer has a legally sufficient basis to make an investigatory stop, the officer may conduct a search for weapons for his own protection where he has \u201creason to believe that the suspect is armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972); <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868. The officers here testified that, based on their extensive experience with drug investigations and arrests, most drug transactions involve the presence of a firearm. This court has recognized that the presence of drugs permits the inference of the presence of firearms. <em>See United States v. Sullivan, </em>455 F.3d 248, 260 (4th Cir.2006) (recognizing the \u201cunfortunate reality that drugs and guns all too often go hand in hand\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>United States v. Stanfield, </em>109 F.3d 976, 984 (4th Cir.1997) (\u201cAs we have often noted, where there are drugs, there are almost always guns.\u201d); <em>United States v. Perrin, </em>45 F.3d 869, 873 (4th Cir.1995) (finding reasonable an officer\u2019s belief that a person selling drugs may be carrying a weapon for protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Brown\u2019s motion to suppress. Based on the totality of the circumstances, the officers had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to justify the <em>Terry </em>stop and the protective frisk. Brown\u2019s presence in a high crime area, his immediate proximity to a suspected drug transaction, and his evasive and belligerent conduct when confronted by police officers, gave police ample reason to suspect that Brown was engaged in criminal activity and that he was armed and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"AbD\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"A-i\">We next consider Brown\u2019s argument that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal because his two prior convictions for breaking and entering a commercial establishment were not proper predicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the ACCA, a defendant is an armed career criminal if he violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and has three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e); U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.4(a). We review de novo the district court\u2019s legal determination that a prior crime constitutes a predicate \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>594 F.3d 259, 262-63 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">\u201cBurglary\u201d is one of the violent felonies specifically enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). For purposes of the ACCA, a person has been convicted of burglary \u201cif <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>he is convicted of any crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The North Carolina burglary statute under which Brown was twice convicted provides that \u201c[a]ny person who breaks or enters any <em>building </em>with intent to commit any felony or larceny therein shall be punished as a Class H felon.\u201d N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 14-54(a) (emphasis added). The statute defines a building as \u201cany dwelling, dwelling house, uninhabited house, building under construction, building within the curtilage of a dwelling house, and any other structure designed to house or secure within it any activity or property.\u201d N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 14-54(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Brown argues that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>his convictions for burglary of a commercial building, as opposed to burglary of a residential building, should no longer qualify as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>See Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 144-48, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (concluding that New Mexico\u2019s crime of \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d fell outside the scope of the ACCA\u2019s \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition because it differed from the example crimes listed in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(b)(ii) \u2014 burglary, arson, and extortion \u2014 which \u201ctypically involve purposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct\u201d). Brown concedes, however, that we are presently bound by <em>Taylor, </em>which decided this issue adversely to Brown\u2019s position by holding that \u00a7 924(e) \u201cburglary\u201d refers to \u201cgeneric burglary.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. <em>Taylor </em>defined generic burglary as \u201can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Therefore, the crime of breaking and entering a commercial building qualifies as \u00a7 924(e) \u201cburglary\u201d and must be a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for ACCA purposes. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 284 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Bow-den, </em>975 F.2d 1080, 1085 (4th Cir.1992). Because burglary is an enumerated offense in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), and Brown\u2019s prior convictions qualify as \u00a7 924(e) burglaries under <em>Taylor, </em>Brown\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court and uphold Brown\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-12\">. Over 100 calls were made from this area to 911 for emergency assistance in the first five months of 2008, and the officer had received a complaint specifically about front-yard drag dealing from the owner of the duplex closest to where the three men were standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b893-10\">. Such stops are often referred to as <em>\"Terry </em>stops.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b894-5\">. Brown does not challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s decision to count his conviction for eluding arrest as a predicate offense under the ACCA. Therefore, if Brown\u2019s two breaking and entering convictions may be counted, the ACCA requirement of three predicate convictions is satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
