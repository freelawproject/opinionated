He contends that his Texas conviction for delivery of cocaine and his second Texas conviction for simple possession were not aggravated felonies. Therefore, he argues, he was incorrectly sentenced pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which carries a 20-year maximum sentence of imprisonment, instead of under \u00a7 1326(b)(1), which carries a 10-year maximum sentence. He argues that his case should be remanded for resentencing because the 20-year maximum may have influenced the district court\u2019s choice of his 37-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Garcia did not raise this argument in the district court and our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. MondragonSantiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">The Government concedes that it did not establish that Garcia\u2019s conviction for delivery of cocaine was an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) and that under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 2580, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010), his second conviction for simple possession was likewise not an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Therefore, it was error to sentence Garcia pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-16\">The record does not indicate that the district court\u2019s error affected Garcia\u2019s substantial rights. He has failed to demonstrate reversible plain error. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 369. However, we modify the judgment to reflect a conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) instead of \u00a7 1326(b)(2), and we remand to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the written judgment to reflect this modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-17\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED; LIMITED REMAND FOR CORRECTION OF JUDGMENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b91-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
