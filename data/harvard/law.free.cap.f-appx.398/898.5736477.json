This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2006), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2006); Fed.R.CivJP. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545-46, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The portion of the district court\u2019s order dismissing some, but not all, of Melvin\u2019s claims is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, we dismiss that portion of Melvin\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-23\">As for the denial Melvin\u2019s motion for preliminary injunctive relief, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Melvin v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>No. 5:09-cv-00235-FL, 2010 WL 1979880 (E.D.N.C. May 13, 2010). We deny Melvin\u2019s motion for stay pending appeal and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>tions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
