On appeal, Aguilar argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because, in ordering his sentence to run consecutively to an undischarged term of imprisonment in New York state court, the district court did not consider the relevant factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) or U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. Aguilar also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is longer than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing, as outlined in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-18\">Having reviewed the record, we find that the district court stated that it considered the statutory factors, the presentence investigation report, and the statements by the parties, all of which provided the court with the relevant information outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. It is apparent that the district court considered the relevant factors and parties\u2019 arguments and no procedural error occurred. We cannot say that the district court\u2019s rationale for the sentence imposed is legally insufficient or that there is clear error in judgment in the court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to arrive at a low-end guidelines sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
