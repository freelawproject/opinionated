Because we conclude that the magistrate judge did not have authority to enter a final, appealable order in this matter, we deny a certificate of appealability, dismiss the appeal without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction, and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 636(c) (West Supp.2010), a magistrate judge may enter a final order directly appealable to a court of appeals upon the consent of all parties. Otherwise, under \u00a7 636(b), a district court must initially review the magistrate judge\u2019s order or proposed findings under either a de novo or clearly erroneous standard of review, depending upon the nature of the ruling appealed. Absent an express adoption, modification, or rejection of the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling by the district court, the ruling is generally not reviewable by the court of appeals. <em>See Reynaga v. Cammisa, </em>971 F.2d 414, 416-18 (9th Cir.1992). In this case, we find nothing in the record showing that the parties consented to have the motions decided by the magistrate judge. As a result, the magistrate judge lacked the authority to enter a final dispositive order. <em>See Gleason v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., 777 </em>F.2d 1324, 1324 (8th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, dismiss this appeal, and remand to the district court for further proceedings. <em>See Massey v. City of Ferndale, 1 </em>F.3d 506, 510-11 (6th Cir.1993) (dismissing appeal from unauthorized order issued by magistrate judge, but remanding to district court for corrective action). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
