In calculating Miller\u2019s guideline range of imprisonment, the district court applied an eight-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) based on Miller\u2019s prior Nebraska conviction for theft by receiving stolen property. Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) provides that the offense level for unlawfully entering the United States should be increased by eight levels if the defendant was previously removed subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction. The definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes \u201ca theft offense\u201d (including receipt of stolen property). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G); \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-16\">Miller argues (1) that the district court erred in assessing the eight-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) because it did not have sufficient information before it from which to ascertain the elements of the Nebraska offense and (2) that the Nebraska statute of conviction criminalizes different methods of committing theft, including methods that cannot form the basis for a sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). \u25a0 He argues that his prior Nebraska conviction warranted only a four-level increase in his offense level because it qualifies as a felony but not as an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-17\">As Miller concedes, any error resulting from the enhancement is subject to plain error review because he did not object to the enhancement in the district court. Fed.R.CrimP. 52(b); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir.2005). Plain error review involves the following four prongs: First, there must be an error or defect that has not been affirmatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>waived by the defendant. Second, the error must be clear or obvious, i.e., not subject to reasonable dispute. Third, the error must have affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. Fourth, if the above three prongs are satisfied, this court has the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">Miller\u2019s first argument is factually incorrect. As Miller acknowledges, the district court had before it a copy of the Nebraska judgment of conviction. It was appropriate for the district court to consider and rely upon this state court document in determining the applicability of the enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">Miller acknowledges in his appeal brief that the Nebraska statute of conviction was Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 28-517 (2008). Nebraska\u2019s definition of theft by receiving stolen property is almost identical to the definition in the Model Penal Code \u00a7 223.6(1). <em>See United States v. FierroReyna, </em>466 F.3d 324, 327 (5th Cir.2006). Nebraska\u2019s definition also falls within the generic, contemporary definition of \u201ca theft offense.\u201d \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G); <em>see Burke v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 695, 697 (5th Cir. 2007). Thus, the district court correctly determined that Miller\u2019s prior Nebraska conviction was for an \u201caggravated felony\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) and that the enhancement was proper. Miller has not shown that the district court erred in applying the eight level enhancement. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1024-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
