He argues that the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his within-guidelines sentence because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not supported by empirical data. Cantu also argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that a sentence below the guidelines is sufficient because the 16-level enhancement was based on a 25-year old conviction; his personal belongings were stolen from his apartment after his arrest; and he was rehabilitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">As Cantu concedes, his argument that the presumption of reasonableness does not apply because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically-based is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009), and <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Cantu\u2019s substantive reasonableness argument is likewise unavailing. Cantu\u2019s arguments fail to overcome the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his \u2022within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. Furthermore, Cantu\u2019s belief that the mitigating factors presented for the district court\u2019s consideration at sentencing should have been balanced differently is insufficient to disturb the presumption. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b39-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
