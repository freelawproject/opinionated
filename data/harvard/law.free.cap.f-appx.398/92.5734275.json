California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Gunnels has filed a response in which he raises claims that counsel rendered ineffective assistance and that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 3582 motion because Amendment 709 may be retroactively applied. Additionally, he contends that his original sentence was improper and that the district court should have granted his \u00a7 3582 motion to correct it. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Gunnels\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b118-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
