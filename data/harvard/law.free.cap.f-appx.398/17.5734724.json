He applied for withholding of removal under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), based on past persecution. Cruz petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA) <em>de novo </em>dismissal of his appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) order denying his application (he was, however, granted voluntary departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-21\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), this court lacks jurisdiction to review Cruz\u2019 claim for withholding of removal. That section states: \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)____\u201d Section 1182(a)(2) provides: \u201cany alien convicted of, or who admits having committed ... (II) a violation of any law or regulation of a State ... [or] the United States ... relating to a controlled substance (as de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>fined in [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802]) is inadmissible\u201d. An exception, however, mandates this court retain jurisdiction for review of \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law\u201d raised in a petition for review filed in an appropriate court of appeals. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see Arce-Vences v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 167, 170 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">That an alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal are findings of fact reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cWe do, of course, also have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Marquez-Marquez v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 548, 554 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions relating to our jurisdiction to consider challenges to a final order of the BIA.\u201d <em>Solorzano-Moreno v. Mulcasey, </em>296 Fed.Appx. 391, 393 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 277 (5th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Cruz contends he has shown entitlement to withholding of removal because he suffered past persecution by gangs in Honduras and he is in danger of future persecution by gangs if removed there. In short, his contentions constitute a disagreement with the factual determinations of the IJ and BIA. In other words, his petition does not raise any constitutional claims or questions of law. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the final order of removal. <em>See Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344; <em>Alwan v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 507, 515 (5th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
