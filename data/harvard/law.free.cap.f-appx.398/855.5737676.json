Williams now appeals. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising two issues but stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Williams was advised of his right to file a pro se brief, but did not file such a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">At the revocation hearing, Williams admitted violating a condition of release by using controlled substances on several occasions. There were no objections to the probation officer\u2019s determination that Williams, who was in criminal history category VI, had committed a Grade B release violation and that his advisory Guidelines range was twenty-one to twenty-seven months in prison. The court heard from counsel and from Williams, who explained his reasons for relapsing into drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to revoke supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Pregent, </em>190 F.3d 279, 282 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>187 F.3d 392, 394 (4th Cir.1999). In light of Williams\u2019 admission at the hearing, we conclude that revocation of release was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel argues that the sentence is excessive and that the district court did not properly consider Williams\u2019 explanation of his relapse into substance abuse. We will affirm a sentence imposed following revocation of supervised release if it is within the applicable statutory maximum and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006). Here, our review of the record reveals that the sentence falls within the statutory maximum of five years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2010). Further, the sentence is procedurally reasonable: in sentencing Williams, the district court considered both the Chapter 7 policy statements and the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2010) factors that it is permitted to consider. <em>See Crud-up, </em>461 F.3d at 438-40. Finally, the sentence is substantively reasonable, for the court adequately explained its reasons for imposing the sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 440. In this regard, and contrary to Williams\u2019 contention, the court clearly took Williams\u2019 statement at sentencing into consideration. The court expressed its appreciation for Williams\u2019 candor and stated that such candor and Williams\u2019 support system were the reasons it was not imposing a longer sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>motion must state that a copy of the motion was served on his client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
