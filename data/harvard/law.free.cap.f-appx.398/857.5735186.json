On appeal, Williams contends the district court erred in denying him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 3E1.1 (2008), in denying him a downward departure under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(b), and in denying him a downward variance based on his criminal history arguments. We dismiss the appeal in part and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-22\">We review a sentence imposed by the district court under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The first step in this review requires us to ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as improperly calculating the guideline range, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, or failing to adequately explain the sentence. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009). We then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, taking into account the totality of the circumstances and giving \u201cdue deference to the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. On appeal, we presume that a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Williams first contends the district court erred in denying him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. We review the district court\u2019s decision for clear error. <em>See United States v. Dugger, </em>485 F.3d 236, 239 (4th Cir.2007). We \u201cmust give \u2018great deference\u2019 to the district court\u2019s decision because \u2018[t]he sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.5)). \u201cTo earn the reduction, a defendant must prove to the court by a preponderance of the evidence \u2018that he has clearly recognized and affirmatively accepted personal responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1005 (4th Cir.1996)). \u201cA guilty plea may be evidence of acceptance, but \u2018it does not, standing alone, entitle a defendant to a reduction as a matter of right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Harris, </em>882 F.2d 902, 905 (4th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">After pleading guilty, Williams tested positive for oxycodone. Because he did not have a prescription and was unlawfully in possession of the drug, the probation officer concluded his conduct was inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.l). At sentencing, Williams proffered that he had a lengthy addiction to pain medication, but had quit using the drugs. However, after suffering an attack of kidney stones, he took some oxycodone to relieve the pain. He acknowledged he could have gone to a doctor for a prescription but did not do so. The district court accepted Williams\u2019s proffer that he used the drug for kidney stones, but noted the fact that he had not gone to a doctor where it was presumed he would have been given some medicine or other treatment. The district court found Williams had not presented sufficient evidence to show that a reduction for acceptance of responsibility was warranted, and we conclude the court did not clearly err in this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Williams next contends the district court erred in denying his request for a reduction in criminal history category under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l), and his alternative request for a variance based on the same arguments. While he conceded his criminal history category of V was properly determined under the guidelines, he argued it over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history because his prior convictions were for minor offenses; his sentences for two of the convictions were ordered to be run concurrently; and while many of his convictions were outside the applicable period and not assessed points, his first convictions receiving points were just inside the applicable period. After hearing his arguments, the district court found there was insufficient reliable information indicating his criminal history category substantially over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history or the likelihood that he would commit other crimes to warrant a downward departure. The court likewise concluded his arguments were not sufficient to warrant a variance, and that a guideline sentence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>sufficient but not greater than necessary to address the sentencing factors under \u00a7 3553(a). The district court sentenced Williams at the low end of his 110 to 137-month guideline range. The court\u2019s decision not to grant a downward departure is not reviewable on appeal, and we dismiss this portion of Williams\u2019s appeal. <em>See Allen, </em>491 F.3d at 193. We further conclude he has shown no abuse of discretion by the district court in denying a variance and sentencing him at the low end of his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">We therefore dismiss the appeal in part, and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
