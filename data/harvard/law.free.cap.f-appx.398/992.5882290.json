He moves for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) in this appeal from an order granting his <em>pro se </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for sentence reduction based on the retroactive amendment to the crack cocaine guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-18\">By moving for IFP, Crosby is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Crosby, however, asserts only that he is entitled to proceed IFP on appeal because he is a pauper; he makes no argument that his appeal involves any non-frivolous issue. Because of his failure to brief them, he has abandoned his district-court claims and any challenge to the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-23\">The appeal lacks any issue of arguable merit. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. It is therefore DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The motion to proceed IFP is DENIED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Crosby\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is likewise DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1018-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
