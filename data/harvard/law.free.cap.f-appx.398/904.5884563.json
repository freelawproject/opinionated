Roseby seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) complaint and has moved to place his appeal in abeyance. The order he seeks to challenge was entered by the district court on March 9, 2010. Roseby filed his notice of appeal, which was dated June 28, 2010, on July 2, 2010. Even giving Roseby the benefit of <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), his notice of appeal was untimely filed. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). In his notice, however, Roseby indicated that he was unaware of the district court\u2019s dismissal order until June 21, 2010. Under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6), the district court may reopen the time to file an appeal if: (1) the moving party did not receive notice of entry of judgment within twenty-one days after entry; (2) a motion to reopen the appeal period is filed within 180 days of entry of judgment or within fourteen days of receiving notice from the district court, whichever is earlier; and (3) no party would be prejudiced. We remand to the district court so it may determine whether Roseby is entitled to have his time to file an appeal reopened under Rule 4(a)(6). The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration. We also deny as moot Roseby\u2019s motion to place his appeal in abeyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
