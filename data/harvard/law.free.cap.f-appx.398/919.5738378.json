We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-24\">In his petition, Hill challenged the validity of his conviction in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009). We conclude that the petition was tantamount to a successive, unauthorized motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2010), over which the district court lacked jurisdiction. The fact that Hill cannot proceed under \u00a7 2255 unless he obtains authorization from this court to file a successive motion does not alter our conclusion. <em>See Carrington v. United States, </em>503 F.3d 888, 890 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he statutory limits on second or successive habeas petitions do not create a \u2018gap\u2019 in the post-conviction landscape that can be filled with the common law writs.\u201d); <em>United States v. Torres, </em>282 F.3d 1241, 1245 (10th Cir.2002) (\u201c[A] writ of audita querela is not available to a petitioner when other remedies exist, such as a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C.[AJ \u00a7 2255.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-26\">Accordingly, we affirm the denial of relief. Further, we deny Hill\u2019s requests for an en banc hearing and for a certificate of appealability. We dispense with oral argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>ment because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
