Sims challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions and the refusal of the district court to give his proposed jury instructions on robbery and aiding and abetting. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-21\">The district court did not err by denying Sims\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. Sims argues he could not be convicted of robbery or the related firearm offense because the government failed to prove that he stole property \u201cfrom the person or in the presence of another ... by means of actual or threatened force ... or of anyone in his company at the time of the taWng or obtaining,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(1), but we disagree. Aided by the actual force used by Maurice JenWns, his cohort, Sims was able to steal a package both in the presence of a delivery driver and when the driver was in the company of a private security guard. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2, 1951(b)(1); <em>United States v. Hamblin, </em>911 F.2d 551, 557-59 (11th Cir.1990). The driver of a delivery truck confronted Sims and Jenkins after seeing them place packages stolen from the truck into their vehicle. The driver tried to wrestle a package away from JenWns while Sims struggled to squeeze a large package in the back seat of the vehicle. When a security guard came to assist the delivery driver, Jenkins used one of the two guns that he and Sims had concealed in the pockets behind their seats in their vehicle to shoot the security guard. The driver of the delivery truck, the security guard, and Jenkins all testified for the government, as did local officers involved in the investigation of the crime. Ample evidence supports Sims\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The district court also did not abuse its discretion by refusing to give Sims\u2019s proposed jury instructions. A defendant is entitled to have his proposed jury instruction read to the jury only if the instruction provides an accurate statement of the law, the instruction is not otherwise included in the jury charge, and the failure to give the instruction \u201c \u2018substantially impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Culver, </em>598 F.3d 740, 751 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Klopf, </em>423 F.3d 1228, 1241 (11th Cir.2005)). Sims\u2019s proposed instruction on robbery, which stated that \u201c[floree or violence that occurs during the escape from a theft does not transform the original theft crime into a robbery,\u201d is not supported by our caselaw, was inconsistent with evidence that the shooting occurred during the robbery, and suggests incorrectly that Jenkins\u2019s skirmish with the delivery driver could not constitute actual force. The instruction given by the district court tracked the language of the statute, conveyed accurately the law, and distinguished between the offenses of theft and robbery. Sims\u2019s proposed instructions on aiding and abetting, which would have added language that Sims had to share the same intent as Jenkins, was repetitive of information in the oral charge. The district court could phrase the jury instruction in a manner to convey accurately the law about aiding and abetting. <em>See United States v. Lively, </em>803 F.2d 1124, 1128 (11th Cir.1986). The omission of Sims\u2019s proposed language did not impair his ability to convey to the jury his defense that he aided and abetted Sims solely in a scheme to steal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">We AFFIRM Sims\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
