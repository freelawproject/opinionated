Section 3582 allows a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment that was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by\u201d an amendment to the Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">Due to the amount of crack cocaine involved, Jackson\u2019s offense level was not reduced by the crack cocaine amendment. Therefore, he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Section 3582.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">Jackson argues that the sentencing court should have exercised its discretion under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and imposed a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence below the guidelines range based on the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He asserts that his sentence was not reasonable because the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory. <em>Booker </em>does not apply to a Section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Accordingly, a movant under Section 3582 is entitled at most to the reduction allowed by the amended guidelines range, and a sentencing court lacks discretion to reduce the sentence any further than that allowed by the amendment. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Because Jackson was not entitled to a sentence reduction based on the crack cocaine amendment, no relief is available under Section 3582. <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1020-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
