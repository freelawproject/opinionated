Lawson, filed this divorce action in Florida state court against Kathy Ann Garcia-Lawson. Garcia-Lawson, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>removed the action to the Southern District of Florida under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. The district court remanded the proceeding to state court concluding that removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1443 did not exist. Garcia-Lawson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-22\">\u201cAs a general rule, we cannot review a district court\u2019s decision remanding a case to state court.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. Seminole Cnty., Fla., </em>334 F.3d 1233, 1235 (11th Cir. 2003); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) (providing that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise\u201d). However, \u201c[sjection 1447(d) expressly excepts from its coverage certain equal civil rights cases removed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>334 F.3d at 1236 n. 1 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Cogdell v. Wyeth, </em>366 F.3d 1245, 1247 n. 3 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Russell Corp. v. Am. Home Assur. Co., </em>264 F.3d 1040, 1044 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) (stating that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-23\">Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1) \u201cpermits a defendant in a civil state court action to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>remove the action to federal district court if the action is against a person who is denied or cannot enforce in the state courts a right under any law providing for equal civil rights of citizens of the United States.\u201d <em>Alabama v. Conley, </em>245 F.3d 1292, 1295 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted). A removal petition filed under \u00a7 1443(1) must satisfy the two-part test set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Georgia v. Rachel, </em>384 U.S. 780, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966). \u201cFirst, the petitioner must show that the right upon which the petitioner relies arises under a federal law \u2018providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1295 (quoting <em>Rachel, </em>384 U.S. at 792, 86 S.Ct. at 1790). \u201cSecond the petitioner must show that he has been denied or cannot enforce that right in the state courts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Garcia-Lawson contends that the district court had removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1443(1) over this divorce action because Florida\u2019s marriage laws violate her federal civil rights under the First, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court has explained that rights of \u201cgeneral application available to all persons or citizens\u201d fall outside the scope of \u00a7 1443(1). <em>Rachel, </em>384 U.S. at 792, 86 S.Ct. at 1790; <em>see also Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>421 U.S. 213, 219, 95 S.Ct. 1591, 1595, 44 L.Ed.2d 121 (1975) (\u201cClaims that prosecution and conviction will violate rights under constitutional or statutory provisions of general applicability or under statutes not protecting against racial discrimination, will not suffice.\u201d); <em>Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1295-96. Removal is only authorized under \u00a7 1443(1) when the defendant is asserting rights \u201cstated in terms of racial equality.\u201d <em>Rachel, </em>384 U.S. at 792, 86 S.Ct. at 1790. None of the rights relied upon by Garcia-Lawson satisfy that criteria. <em>See City of Greenwood v. Peacock, </em>384 U.S. 808, 825, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 1811, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966) (explaining that \u201cthe broad constitutional guarantees of the First Amendment\u201d are not included within \u00a7 1443(1)); <em>Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1295-96 (concluding that defendant\u2019s reliance \u201cupon broad assertions under the Equal Protection Clause\u201d was insufficient to support a valid claim for removal under \u00a7 1443(1)); <em>Sunflower Cnty.

Dist., </em>369 F.2d 795, 796 (5th Cir.1966)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (stating that the \u201cright to a fair trial and equal protection of the laws\u201d does not support a valid claim for removal under \u00a7 1443(1)). For these reasons, the district court did not err by remanding Garcia-Lawson\u2019s case for lack of removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1443(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\">. <em>Bonner v.
