In his petition, Becerra challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to establish a nexus between the harm he suffered in Colombia and his actual or imputed political opinion for purposes of his eligibility for withholding of removal. Becerra also argues that the IJ erred in its adverse-credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-19\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, passing references to issues are insufficient to raise a claim for appeal. <em>Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-20\">As a threshold matter, Becerra has abandoned his asylum and CAT claims by not raising those issues in his brief. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2. Likewise, Becerra\u2019s contention that the IJ erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>finding him not credible is misplaced because the BIA did not rely on that ground in making its ruling. Furthermore, Becerra\u2019s assertion that the IJ failed to factor the 2006 U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Colombia into its decision was not raised before the BIA, and, therefore, is not properly exhausted. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider claims not raised before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">We review legal determinations of the BIA <em>de novo, </em>and review \u201cadministrative fact findings under the highly deferential substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 820 (11th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). We must affirm the decision of the BIA if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we do not engage in a <em>de novo </em>review of the facts as found by the IJ, and we may not \u201creweigh the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Under the substantial-evidence test, we view the record \u201cin the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>To reverse a factual finding by the BIA, we must find that \u201cthe record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must satisfy more stringent standards than those for asylum eligibility, so \u201can alien unable to prove a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 of persecution based on a protected</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">ground, as required for asylum relief, necessarily fails to demonstrate a \u2018clear probability of persecution,\u2019 the \u2018standard applicable to a claim for withholding of removal.\u2019\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir. 2007). To be granted withholding of removal under the INA, an alien \u201cmust show that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The applicant must establish a sufficient nexus between his political opinion or other protected ground and his alleged persecution. <em>Rodriguez Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 890. \u201cIt is not enough to show that [the alien] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [the alien\u2019s] refusal to cooperate with the guerrillas.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Persecution \u201con account of\u2019 a political opinion means persecution because of the <em>\u201cvictim\u2019s </em>political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The fact that the persecutor is motivated by the persecutor\u2019s political belief is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the issue of whether the victim was persecuted because of the victim\u2019s own belief. <em>Rodriguez Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 890. \u201cAn asylum applicant may prevail on a theory of \u2018imputed political opinion\u2019 if he shows that the persecutor falsely attributed an opinion to him, and then persecuted him, because of that mistaken belief about his views.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). When seeking withholding of removal, an \u201calien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 437 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>The record here does not compel a finding that Becerra established a nexus between his experiences in Colombia and his actual or imputed political opinion. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Becerra was not persecuted on account of his political opinion, but rather because of criminal activity or his work as a clerk. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
