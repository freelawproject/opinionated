We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue: \u201cWhether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 938 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc), by failing to address Pugh\u2019s claim that, following <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), his prior conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm should no longer be considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1 and 4B1.2.\u201d The Government concedes on appeal that the district court failed to address this claim. After careful review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we vacate the judgment and remand this case to the district court to enter findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-17\">When a district court fails to address all of the claims in a habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938. We have recognized the legal principles applicable to \u00a7 2254 proceedings generally apply to \u00a7 2255 motions to vacate, and thus <em>Clisby </em>applies to \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-18\">We conclude the district court violated <em>Clisby </em>by failing to address Pugh\u2019s claim that under <em>Begay </em>and <em>Archer, </em>his sentence should not have been enhanced based on his prior conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment without prejudice and remand for consideration of the remaining claim by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-19\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-15\">. In a Section 2255 proceeding, we review legal issues <em>de novo, </em>and factual findings under a clear error standard. <em>U.S. v.
