He received a within-Guidelines sentence of 84 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, his attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether Norman\u2019s sentence is reasonable. Norman filed a pro se supplemental brief. Pursuant to our review of the case under <em>Anders, </em>we directed counsel for Norman to file a merits brief, advising counsel that specific attention should be paid to the issue of whether the district court\u2019s brief reasoning for choosing the imposed sentence rendered Norman\u2019s sentence proeedurally unreasonable. Norman\u2019s attorney subsequently filed a merits brief arguing that the sentencing court failed to make an individualized assessment and to sufficiently explain its reasoning for the chosen sentence in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors. The Government filed a response, arguing that the error, if any, was harmless. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">We review a sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The first step in this review requires the court to ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as improperly calculating the Guidelines range, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009). We then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. On appeal, we presume that a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">Norman argues that his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable because the district court did not mention any of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or explain the sentence it imposed with an individualized assessment of how the factors applied in his case. Norman preserved the issue by arguing in the district court for a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 577-78 (4th Cir.2010). \u201c[I]f a party repeats on appeal a claim of procedural sentencing error ... which has made before the district court, we review for abuse of discretion\u201d and will reverse unless we can conclude \u201cthat the error was harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">The district court is not required to \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). However, the district court must \u201cplace on the record an individualized assessment based on the particular facts of the case before it. This individualized assessment need not be elaborate or lengthy, but it must provide a rationale tailored to the particular case at hand and adequate to permit meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 330 (internal quotation marks, footnote, and citation omitted). This is true even when the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>trict court sentences a defendant within the applicable Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>An extensive explanation is not required as long as the appellate court is satisfied \u201c \u2018that [the district court] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Engle, </em>592 F.Bd 495, 500 (4th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 165, 178 L.Ed.2d 41 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">The Government contends that, even if the district court failed to adequately explain the sentence it imposed in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, any error was harmless because the record establishes that the district court considered Norman\u2019s request for a lenient sentence based on his allegedly minor role in the offense. The Government further argues it is unrealistic to conclude that any further explicit analysis by the district court would have resulted in a shorter sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">Norman asked for a below-Guidelines sentence based on his claim he was a minor participant. The Government responded; the court invited the probation officer\u2019s input; and the court participated in the exchange and debate. The court then explicitly stated that it rejected Norman\u2019s minor player argument, thereby not warranting a below-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">Our review of the record convinces us the Government is correct, and that any error in this case was harmless. <em>See Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 582; <em>see also Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 359, 127 S.Ct. 2456 (\u201cmere ... the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments, we do not believe the law requires the judge to write more extensively.\u201d); <em>United States v. Boulware, </em>604 F.3d 832, 838 (4th Cir.2010) (procedural error is harmless if it did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the result and this court can say with fair assurance that the district court\u2019s explicit consideration of the defendant\u2019s arguments would not have affected the sentence imposed). Furthermore, Norman\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence is presumptively reasonable on appeal, and Norman has not rebutted that presumption. <em>See United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (stating presumption may be rebutted by showing sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have thoroughly reviewed the record for any other meritorious issues and have found none. We reject Norman\u2019s claims in his pro se supplemental briefs as non-meritorious. We accordingly affirm Norman\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Norman, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Norman requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy of the motion was served on Norman. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
