He argues that the district court incorrectly determined that it was precluded from departing downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12 based on an incomplete duress defense because the jury had rejected his duress defense at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Perry has not shown that the district court incorrectly determined that it lacked the authority to depart downward under \u00a7 5K2.12. The record reflects that the district court considered defense counsel\u2019s arguments at sentencing for a downward departure, the Presentence Report (PSR), the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and Perry\u2019s allocution. Although the district court noted that the jury had rejected the duress defense and Perry\u2019s version of the facts at trial, the district court\u2019s comments do not indicate that it was under the mistaken belief that it lacked the authority to depart downward under \u00a7 5K2.12 due to the jury\u2019s rejection of the duress defense. The district court found that, even assuming that the facts were as Perry presented them, a downward departure based on duress under \u00a7 5K2.12 was not warranted because Perry had other options on the night of the offense. After considering Perry\u2019s arguments, the PSR, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court implicitly denied Perry\u2019s request for a downward departure and expressly determined that a forty-one month sentence within the advisory guidelines range was appropriate. Thus, the record does not indicate that the district court held the erroneous belief that it lacked the authority to depart downward. <em>See United States v. Valencia-Gonzales, </em>172 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.1999). Therefore, this court lacks the jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Perrjfs request for a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Lucas, </em>516 F.3d 316, 350 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b106-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
