The district court imposed a within-guidelines sentence that included concurrent terms of 80 months of imprisonment for illegal reentry and 36 months for making a false claim. Gonzalez-Villegas contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable, because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-22\">Gonzalez-Villegas concedes that the plain error standard of review is applicable under circuit precedent, because he did not object to his sentence in the district court, <em>see United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), but he wishes to preserve for further review the issue \u201cwhether a failure to object to the reasonableness of a sentence upon its imposition requires plain error review.\u201d \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-23\">Gonzalez-Villegas argues that his guideline range was too severe, because the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 effectively resulted in the double-counting of his criminal history; his prior conviction for illegal reentry weighed too heavily in the calculation of his guideline range; the range overstated the seriousness of his illegal reentry offense; and the range faded properly to account for his personal history and characteristics and benign motiva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>tion in attempting to reenter. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Gonzalez-Villegas has not established that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b96-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
