The district court sentenced Cruz to 46 months imprisonment and three years supervised release, a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-24\">Cruz contends that the sentence was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He maintains that the Guideline on which his sentence was based, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, was not grounded in empirical data, resulting in excessive guidelines ranges, even in a normal case. He claims that the guidelines sentence range was excessive because his prior federal drug conviction both increased his offense level by 16 and produced five criminal history points. Cruz also asserts that the sentence was too severe because his offense was minor, amounting to nothing more than a trespass, and his personal history and characteristics mitigate the seriousness of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-25\">The district court considered and rejected Cruz\u2019s arguments for a sentence below guidelines range. With explicit reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the arguments made during allocution, the court determined that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate. Even if we assume arguendo that \u00a7 2L1.2 is not based on empirical data, the presumption of reasonableness still applies to sentences within a guidelines range properly calculated under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the international trespass and the double counting of prior convictions contentions that Cruz raises have been advanced previously in this court without success. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). As Cruz was sentenced within the guidelines range, the sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, and Cruz has not shown sufficient reason to overcome that presumption. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b101-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
