He appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). According to Magallanez, the denial was improper because he was sentenced based on both crack and powder cocaine. Additionally, he argues that his sentence is flawed because neither the information nor the plea agreement specified the amount of drugs involved with his offense. Magallanez moves this court for authorization to file a supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-24\">None of the arguments raised in this appeal suffices to show that the district court abused its discretion in connection with its denial of Magallanez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>United, States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). Insofar as Magallanez contends that he was sentenced based on both powder and crack cocaine, our review of the record refutes this assertion and supports the district court\u2019s determination that Magallanez was not entitled to the relief sought because his sentence was based on powder cocaine. The instant \u00a7 3582 motion is not a proper vehicle for Magallanez\u2019s additional challenge to his sentence. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and Magallanez\u2019s motion is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1017-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
