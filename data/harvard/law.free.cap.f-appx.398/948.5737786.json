By moving for IFP, Collins is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">Section 3583(b)(2) does not authorize a motion to reduce supervised release, and we discern no other valid jurisdictional basis for the motion. Collins is thus appealing \u201cfrom the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Collins has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Collins\u2019 motion to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b975-14\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
