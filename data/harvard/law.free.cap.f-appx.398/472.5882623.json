Abdelgalel appeals the district court\u2019s order denying (1) his motion to confirm his naturalization and oath of citizenship administered by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) and (2) his motion for attorneys fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d). After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to confirm, but reverse the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for attorneys fees and remand for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">A.Application for Naturalization</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">In 2000, Abdelgalel, who was born in Egypt, became a lawful permanent resident of the United States. In April 2005, Abdelgalel filed an application for naturalization with the USCIS. Abdelgalel passed the English language and history tests. On January 23, 2006, an immigration officer interviewed Abdelgalel. Over two years later, the USCIS had not acted on Abdelgalel\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">B. Abdelgalel\u2019s \u00a7 1447(b) Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b499-19\">Section 1447(b) of Title 8 permits an applicant for naturalization to request a hearing in the district court if the government fails to make a determination within 120 days of the examination conducted on the application. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(b). Under \u00a7 1447(b), the district court \u201chas jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the matter, with appropriate instructions, to the Service to determine the matter.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-20\">In June 2008, Abdelgalel filed this action in the district court pursuant to \u00a7 1447(b). Abdelgalel asked the district court either to naturalize him as permitted by \u00a7 1447(b) or, in the alternative, to enter an order requiring the USCIS to adjudicate his application. Abdelgalel also requested attorneys fees and costs under the EAJA. Abdelgalel\u2019s action named as defendants: Michael B. Mukasey, the Attorney General of the United States; Michael Chertoff, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security; Jonathan Scharfen, the Acting Director of the USCIS; and Rosemary Melville, the Director of the Atlanta Office of the USCIS (\u201cthe government defendants\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-21\">C. Defendants\u2019 Motion to Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b499-22\">In response, the government defendants filed a motion to remand the case to the USCIS, stating that they needed additional time to complete a background investigation. The government defendants asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>for 120 days to finish the investigation and adjudicate Abdelgalel\u2019s application. According to an affidavit attached to the motion to remand, USCIS had re-interviewed Abdelgalel on April 2, 2009 and additional investigation was needed based on unspecified information Abdelgalel provided at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Abdelgalel opposed remand, arguing that all necessary background checks already had been completed and the government defendants had not identified any public safety or national security reason for further investigation. Abdelgalel contended that the government had acted in bad faith and asked the district court to adjudicate his application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Alternatively, if the district court was inclined to remand, Abdelgalel asked the court to \u201c[ejnter an order, specifically a writ of mandamus, requiring Defendants to adjudicate Plaintiffs Form N-400, Application for Naturalization within a specific time period.... \u201d Abdelgalel also renewed his request for attorneys fees and costs under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">D. Remand Order and Writ of Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On June 19, 2009, the district court entered an \u201cOrder and Writ of Mandamus\u201d granting the government defendants\u2019 motion for remand. The district court noted that it was \u201cnot wholly convinced that US-CIS has been as diligent as it maintains\u201d in addressing Abdelgalel\u2019s application and that it was \u201cconcerned by the \u2018bad faith\u2019 arguments\u201d raised by Abdelgalel. Nonetheless, for reasons of economy, the district court concluded that remand was the appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">However, the district court granted Abdelgalel\u2019s request for a definitive deadline for adjudication. Specifically, the district court directed the government defendants to adjudicate Abdelgalel\u2019s application \u201cwithin NINETY (90) days of the issuance of this Writ. If Plaintiffs application is not adjudicated by this date, this Court, upon proper motion, will schedule a status conference and, at that time, may choose to exercise jurisdiction over this matter.\u201d The court-imposed ninety-day deadline was September 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The district court stayed Abdelgalel\u2019s motion for attorneys fees under the EAJA. The district court concluded that Abdelgalel had not yet satisfied the \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement of the statute, but noted that, if USCIS failed to comply with the court\u2019s order, Abdelgalel\u2019s motion for attorneys fees might be revisited.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">On July 30, 2009, within the court\u2019s ninety-day time frame, the USCIS approved Abdelgalel\u2019s application for naturalization. However, as of September 17, 2009, Abdelgalel still had not been administered the oath of citizenship. On that date, Abdelgalel filed a status report with the district court, advising the court of this fact and asking the court to administer the oath of citizenship. Abdelgalel again requested attorneys fees under the EAJA. On September 23, 2009, Abdelgalel attended the USCIS\u2019s naturalization ceremony, was administered the oath of citizenship and became a United States citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">E. Motion for Attorneys Fees and Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Shortly thereafter, Abdelgalel filed a motion for attorneys fees under the EAJA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Abdelgalel argued that he was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the EAJA because the district court (1) had granted his request to issue a writ of mandamus directing the USCIS to adjudicate his application within a specified time and (2) had remained ready to assert jurisdiction over the matter if the USCIS had failed to do so. Because Abdelgalel had obtained the relief he sought (the prompt adjudication of his application on remand), he asked the district court to lift the stay and award him attorneys fees and costs. The government defendants opposed the motion for attorneys fees and also moved to dismiss Abdelgalel\u2019s action as moot, arguing that USCIS had \u201cvoluntarily adjudicated\u201d Abdelgalel\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">F. Motion to Confirm Naturalization</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Abdelgalel also filed a \u201cMotion to Confirm Naturalization Process.\u201d Abdelgalel argued the USCIS no longer had jurisdiction when it administered his oath of citizenship because jurisdiction had automatically reverted to the district court after the ninety-day deadline expired. Abdelgalel contended that his citizenship was in question and asked the district court to confirm his naturalization and administration of the oath of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The government defendants argued that Abdelgalel\u2019s concerns about his citizenship were baseless because, under the terms of the district court\u2019s prior order, the USCIS had jurisdiction when the oath was administered. The government defendants emphasized that there was no provision under immigration law for a district court to \u201cconfirm\u201d citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">G. Dismissal Order</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The district court denied Abdelgalel\u2019s motion for attorneys fees under the EAJA, concluding that he was not a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d The district court also denied Abdelgalel\u2019s motion for confirmation, finding that, because Abdelgalel was now a naturalized citizen, there was \u201cno reason to re-exercise jurisdiction over this matter.\u201d Noting that all matters had been resolved, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the action as moot. Abdelgalel filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">A. Motion to Confirm Naturalization</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">The district court denied Abdelgalel\u2019s motion for confirmation of naturalization. The district court explained that, because Abdelgalel was a naturalized citizen, it had no reason to \u201cre-exercise\u201d jurisdiction. We find no reversible error in this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">The district court obtains jurisdiction over a naturalization application when an applicant files an action under \u00a7 1447(b) and shows that the USCIS has not made a determination within 120 days of the examination. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(b). At this point, the district court has two options; it can either determine the matter itself or remand the matter to the USCIS for a determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">Here, the district court remanded to the USCIS. By the terms of the district court\u2019s remand order, the USCIS had jurisdiction to make a determination as to Abdelgalel\u2019s application. Although the district court ordered the USCIS to adjudicate the application within ninety days, the district court did not condition the agency\u2019s continued jurisdiction on compliance with that deadline. Instead, the district court stated that, upon subsequent motion from Abdelgalel, it \u201cmay choose to exercise jurisdiction over this matter\u201d if the application was not adjudicated by September 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-16\">Thus, under the terms of the remand order, jurisdiction did not revert back to the district court automatically on Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ber 17, 2009, even if the USCIS had failed to adjudicate Abdelgalel\u2019s application by that date. Abdelgalel first would have had to move the court for a status conference, at which time he would have had to ask the court to reassert jurisdiction, and the district court would have had to grant that request. None of these events took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Furthermore, the USCIS <em>did </em>adjudicate Abdelgalel\u2019s application before the September 17, 2009 deadline. It is undisputed that Abdelgalel\u2019s application was approved on July 30, 2009. Since the US-CIS complied with the court\u2019s remand order, the USCIS retained jurisdiction over Abdelgalel\u2019s naturalization process when it administered the oath of citizenship to Abdelgalel. Because Abdelgalel\u2019s jurisdictional argument lacks merit, the district court properly denied Abdelgalel\u2019s motion for confirmation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">B. Attorneys Fees under the EAJA</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Under the EAJA, the district court \u201cshall award to a prevailing party\u201d fees and other expenses \u201cincurred by that party in any civil action ... unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). In <em>Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, </em>532 U.S. 598, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001), the Supreme Court explained that the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d is a term of art that refers to one who has received \u201cat least some relief on the merits of his claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603, 121 S.Ct. at 1840 (quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court explained that \u201cenforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create \u2018the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\u2019 necessary to permit an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Morillo-Cedron v. District Director for the U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Seros., </em>452 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir.2006). In <em>Buckhannon, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d for awarding attorneys fees, under which a plaintiff is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d if he \u201cachieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Buckhannon, </em>532 U.S. at 601, 605, 121 S.Ct. at 1838, 1840. The Supreme Court explained that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s voluntary change in conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary judicial <em>imprimatur </em>on the change.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 121 S.Ct. at 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">In sum, under <em>Buckhannon, </em>to be a prevailing party eligible for an award of attorneys fees, the plaintiff must show both a \u201cmaterial alteration of the legal relationship\u201d of the parties and that the change is \u201cjudicially sanctioned.\u201d <em>Buckhannon, </em>532 U.S. at 604-05, 121 S.Ct. at 1840; <em>Morillo-Cedron, </em>452 F.3d at 1258; <em>Am. Disability Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Chmielarz, </em>289 F.3d 1315, 1319 (11th Cir.2002). Although \u201ceither a judgment on the merits or a consent decree clearly are sufficient to make the plaintiff a \u2018prevailing party,\u2019 the essential test established by the Court [in <em>Buckhannon </em>] requires the plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>achieve a \u2018judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Disability Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Chmielarz, </em>289 F.3d 1315, 1319-20 (11th Cir.2002) (quoting in part <em>Buckhannon, </em>532 U.S. at 605, 121 S.Ct. at 1840, and concluding that a district court\u2019s dismissal order approving a settlement and retaining jurisdiction to enforce its terms establishes a \u201cjudicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties\u201d because the plaintiff \u201cmay return to court to have the settlement enforced\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">C. Eleventh Circuit\u2019s <em>Morillo-Cedron</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In <em>Morillo-Cedron, </em>this Court concluded that <em>Buckhannon </em>applies to the fee-shifting provisions of the EAJA. <em>Morillo-Cedron, </em>452 F.3d at 1258. Additionally, <em>Morillo-Cedron </em>provides guidance here because it also arose in the context of the USCIS\u2019s delay in processing an immigration application.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In <em>Morillo-Cedron, </em>the Administrative Office of Appeals ordered the District Director of the USCIS to act on the plaintiffs\u2019 applications for lawful permanent residency. <em>Id. </em>at 1255. When the USCIS timely failed to do so, the plaintiffs filed an action under the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, and the Administrative Procedures Act. The plaintiffs also sought attorneys fees and costs under the EAJA. <em>Id. </em>The district court issued a show cause order \u201cwhy the mandamus relief requested should not be granted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The USCIS then \u201cvoluntarily granted lawful permanent resident status\u201d to some of the plaintiffs, referred to as the \u201cadjusted plaintiffs,\u201d and scheduled interviews with the remaining plaintiffs, referred to as the \u201cnon-adjusted plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id. &amp; </em>nn.l, 2. The district court issued an interim order requiring the USCIS to \u201cproceed on the plaintiffs\u2019 voluntary adjustment status\u201d and later denied the request for mandamus relief and dismissed the complaint. <em>Id. </em>However, the district court awarded the plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs under the EAJA. <em>Id. </em>The district court relied on the catalyst theory, concluding that the adjusted plaintiffs were prevailing parties because plaintiffs\u2019 action caused the government to process their applications. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">This Court reversed the award under the EAJA. Applying <em>Buckhannon, </em>we concluded that the plaintiffs were not \u201cprevailing parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1258. We explained that, under <em>Buckhannon, </em>\u201ca \u2018prevailing-party\u2019 is one who has been awarded some relief by the court; i.e., some court-ordered change in the legal relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant,\u201d and that a defendant\u2019s voluntary change in conduct \u201c \u2018lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1257 (quoting <em>Buckhannon, </em>532 U.S. at 604-05, 121 S.Ct. at 1840). This Court concluded that the plaintiffs did not satisfy the prevailing party requirement because they did not litigate the case to final judgment, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1v\">[W]e hold the plaintiffs here are not \u201cprevailing parties.\u201d The record demonstrates that they did not litigate to judgment the District Director\u2019s failure to abide by the AAO rules and process their applications. In other words, the plaintiffs did not obtain a court-ordered change in the legal relationship between them and the Government; they did not obtain relief on the merits of their claim. The Government voluntarily processed their applications and conducted interviews before the district court entered any final judgment. Moreover, the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss because the case was moot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">D. Other Circuits</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">No Circuit has addressed the precise circumstances presented here, that is, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>remand order with specific instructions to adjudicate a naturalization application within a specific period of time. The closest case we could find is <em>Al-Maleki v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1200 (10th Cir.2009), but there the district court actually adjudicated the application itself and the Tenth Circuit then concluded that the plaintiff was a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">More specifically, in <em>Al-Maleki, </em>the district court denied the government\u2019s motion for an unrestricted remand, held a hearing and then ordered the government to answer the complaint. 558 F.3d at 1203. In its answer, the government represented that the background check had been completed and approval of Al-Maleki\u2019s application was likely. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the parties filed a joint motion for remand so the oath of citizenship could be administered by July 18, 2007. <em>Id. </em>The district court granted the motion and instructed the USCIS to administer the oath of citizenship by July 18,2007. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The Tenth Circuit concluded that AlMaleki was a prevailing party because the district court\u2019s remand order \u201cgranted AlMaleki substantive relief on the merits of the claims raised in his \u00a7 1447(b) action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1206. The Tenth Circuit explained that the district court\u2019s order resolved AlMaleki\u2019s claims by \u201cconcluding he was entitled to be naturalized and ordering US-CIS to administer the oath on a date certain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a consequence, \u201c[t]he order ... also provided the judicial imprimatur which is indispensable to the prevailing party determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Tenth Circuit rejected the argument that the USCIS voluntarily naturalized Al-Maleki, explaining that \u201c[e]ntry of the order, not USCIS\u2019s stipulation, was the action which indelibly altered the legal landscape between US-CIS and Al-Maleki.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">On yet another set of circumstances, the First Circuit has concluded that a \u00a7 1447(b) plaintiff was not a prevailing party under the EAJA. In <em>Aronov v. Napolitano, </em>the parties voluntarily settled the dispute before the government responded to Aronov\u2019s complaint. 562 F.3d 84, 87 (1st Cir.2009) (en banc). The parties then filed a joint motion to remand stating that the USCIS would grant Aronov\u2019s application, and the oath would be given no later than November 8, 2006. <em>Id. </em>The parties asked the district court to remand so that these actions could be taken. <em>Id. </em>The district court entered a single-line electronic order on the docket granting the motion to remand, but gave no instructions to the government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The First Circuit concluded that this electronic order was not a judgment on the merits or the \u201cfunctional equivalent of a consent decree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90. Rather, the First Circuit explained that the remand order \u201cdid not meet the judicial imprimatur standards\u201d because it \u201clacked all of the core indicia of a consent decree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92. The order (1) \u201cdid not order USCIS to do anything\u201d; (2) \u201cmade no evaluation at all of the merits of the controversy\u201d given that the government had not even answered the complaint and the parties had merely asked the court to dismiss the action; (3) \u201cdid not contain provisions for future enforcement typical of consent decrees\u201d; and (4) \u201cmerely returned jurisdiction to the agency to allow the parties to carry out their [private] agreement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">E. District Court\u2019s Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">This case falls in between the Tenth Circuit\u2019s <em>Al-Maleki </em>decision and the First Circuit\u2019s <em>Aronov </em>decision. Here, the district court\u2019s remand order actually granted Abdelgalel\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus and directed the USCIS to adjudicate the application within a specific, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>narrow period of time, i.e., within ninety days. This is one of the two forms of relief authorized under \u00a7 1447(b). Thus, the remand order requiring the USCIS to adjudicate Abdelgalel\u2019s application afforded Abdelgalel \u201csome relief\u2019 on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Furthermore, the district court\u2019s remand order changed the legal relationship between the parties, as required by <em>Buckhannon. </em>At the time he filed his action, Abdelgalel had waited for over two years for the USCIS to make a determination on his application. The district court\u2019s order required the USCIS to make that determination within ninety days and reserved the right to reassert jurisdiction if the USCIS failed to comply. The USCIS would have violated the remand order had it failed to adjudicate Abdelgalel\u2019s application within the court-ordered time frame. By giving Abdelgalel a legally-enforeeable right to adjudication within ninety days, the remand order changed the legal relationship between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The government characterizes the US-CIS\u2019s adjudication of Abdelgalel\u2019s application as \u201cvoluntary.\u201d However, the US-CIS\u2019s adjudication was not voluntary in the <em>Buckhannon </em>sense. Rather, at the time the application was approved, the USCIS was under a court order pursuant to \u00a7 1447(b) to do so by September 17, 2009, and had no choice in the matter. This fact materially distinguishes this case from <em>Morillo-Cedron, </em>in which the district court had issued a show cause order, but had not yet acted on the merits of the request for mandamus relief. In other words, unlike here, the government in <em>Morillo-Cedron </em>acted on the plaintiffs\u2019 applications before being ordered to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The government defendants argue that Abdelgalel did not prevail because he opposed their motion to remand. This is not a complete characterization of Abdelgalel\u2019s position in the district court. Given what Abdelgalel believed was bad faith on the government\u2019s part, Abdelgalel\u2019s first preference was for the district court itself to address his application. However, Abdelgalel\u2019s response to the motion to remand alternatively requested that, if the district court chose to remand, it give the USCIS a finite period of time in which to act. This position was consistent with Abdelgalel\u2019s complaint, which prayed in the alternative for an order requiring the USCIS to act on his application. And, the district court granted Abdelgalel this requested relief. Thus, Abdelgalel satisfied the EAJA\u2019s prevailing party requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Abdelgalel\u2019s motion to confirm his naturalization. However, we reverse the district court\u2019s finding that Abdelgalel had not satisfied the EAJA\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement. On remand, the district court must address whether Abdelgalel has satisfied the other requirements of the EAJA, namely whether the government\u2019s position in the \u00a7 1447(b) proceedings was substantially justified or if special circumstances make an award of attorneys fees and costs unjust, issues upon which we express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSE AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-13\">. During the course of the litigation, Eric Holder was substituted for Michael Mukasey as the Attorney General for the United States and Janet Napolitano was substituted for Michael Chertoff as the Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\">. Abdelgalel stated that, after he filed this action, the USCIS sent him (but not his counsel of record) notification to appear for English language and history tests, despite the fact that he had already taken and passed these tests. According to Abdelgalel, when he appeared as directed, he was not given the tests, but instead interrogated by federal agents without his attorney present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\">. Abdelgalel stresses that courts disagree as to whether a district court\u2019s remand under \u00a7 1447(b) vests exclusive jurisdiction in the agency or concurrent jurisdiction with the district court. We need not address this issue. Regardless of whether there was concurrent or exclusive jurisdiction in the agency, it is clear, under the district court\u2019s particular remand order here and the undisputed facts of this case, that the USCIS still had jurisdiction to proceed with the naturalization process after September 17, 2009. We also need not and do not address the government's alternative argument that immigration law does not authorize a district court to confirm naturalization.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
