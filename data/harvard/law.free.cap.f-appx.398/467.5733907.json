They argue, that the district court: (1) failed to address their claim that GMAC lacked \u201cstanding\u201d to foreclose on their property because they transferred interest to Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d), and erred by not allowing them to amend their complaint to add Fannie Mae as an indispensable party; (2) erred by failing to appoint a guardian ad litem for Ms. McLean <em>sua sponte; </em>and (3) erred by granting summary judgment to GMAC on their RESPA claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The McLeans brought this action in federal court on November 14, 2006 after nearly ten years of legal disputes with GMAC concerning the mortgage on their house. There were numerous foreclosure actions and three separate bankruptcies.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">During the third bankruptcy GMAC sent a letter dated December 8, 2004 to the McLeans\u2019 bankruptcy trustee advising that the McLeans had not been current with their escrow payments as directed by the bankruptcy plan. As a result, the GMAC letter indicated that the McLeans\u2019 mortgage payments were going to be increased from $1,674.84 to $3,923.60, effective February 1, 2005. The McLeans responded with a letter to GMAC\u2019s Horsham, Pennsylvania address on December 15, 2004 explaining that they believed the escrow account to be current and requesting an explanation of GMAC\u2019s accounting of the escrow account. Upon failing to receive a response from GMAC, the McLeans sent a second letter on February 14, 2005 to GMAC\u2019s attorney which requested: (1) a detailed explanation for the increase in the mortgage payment; (2) the date when the delinquency in the escrow account began to accrue; (3) specific amounts of fines and penalties included in the delinquency; and (4) why GMAC failed to give the McLeans timely notice of their escrow delinquency.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">GMAC responded on February 25, 2005 with a letter that briefly explained that the December 8 letter was a mistake, that the escrow account was never delinquent, and that the McLeans should disregard any increase in their mortgage payments. GMAC\u2019s letter did not address the McLeans\u2019 requests for information from their February 14 letter. The McLeans subsequently filed this complaint which alleged several types of impropriety on the part of GMAC. The district court granted summary judgment in GMAC\u2019s favor on all the claims, except the RESPA claim. The McLeans then filed a pretrial contempt motion claiming that GMAC lacked standing because they had sold the McLeans\u2019 mortgage to Fannie Mae. The district court denied this motion and then granted summary judgment in GMAC\u2019s favor on the remaining RESPA claim because the McLeans failed to show how the alleged RES-PA violations caused their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">\n<em>A. The McLeans\u2019 Arguments With Regard to Standing are Immaterial and Were Raised in an Untimely Manner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Although the McLeans are permitted to do so, this case illustrates the perils of self-representation in complex commercial litigation. The McLeans essentially brought suit against GMAC and then alleged that GMAC should not be a party to the lawsuit. Apparently, the McLeans were attempting to argue that GMAC lacked standing to bring the previous foreclosure actions. However, these arguments were made in an untimely manner in the wrong court. If the McLeans feel that GMAC did not have standing to foreclose on their home they should have sought to set aside the bankruptcy and foreclosure judgments in bankruptcy court. A contempt motion filed prior to a trial on RESPA violations was neither the time nor the place to address GMAC\u2019s standing to enforce the terms of their mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">Contrary to the McLeans\u2019 assertion, the court did address their \u201cstanding\u201d argument below, rightly concluding that it lacked any merit. The district court appropriately instructed the McLeans at the pretrial conference in saying: \u201cIf you think you have the wrong party, if you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>would rather sue Fannie Mae, you are welcome to do that.\u201d Doc. 219 at 12. Because GMAC, as the defendant, did not file a counterclaim and did not complain of an injury, the standing requirements are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\n<em>B. The District Court Did Not Err in Failing to Appoint a Guardian ad Litem For Ms. McLean</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The McLeans argue on appeal, for the first time, that the district court should have appointed a guardian ad litem for Ms. McLean. The McLeans did not request a guardian ad litem previously, but now assert that the district court was under an obligation to <em>sua sponte </em>appoint one.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u201cIt is well established that the appointment of a guardian ad litem is a procedural question controlled by Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1264 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). \u201cRule 17(c) does not make the appointment of a guardian ad litem mandatory. If the court feels that the [person\u2019s] interests are otherwise adequately represented and protected, a guardian ad litem need not be appointed.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>256 F.2d 35, 39 (5th Cir.1958) (per curiam).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s decision as to whether to appoint a guardian ad litem is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ferrelli v. River Manor Health Care Center, </em>323 F.3d 196, 200 (2d Cir.2003)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The McLeans never asserted before the district court that Ms. McLean was not competent to proceed to trial and never requested a guardian ad litem to represent her. \u201cNeither the language of Rule 17(c) nor the precedent of [the Second Circuit] or other circuits imposes upon district judges an obligation to inquire <em>sua sponte </em>into a pro se plaintiffs mental competence, even when the judge observes behavior that may suggest mental incapacity.\u201d <em>Ferrelli, </em>323 F.3d at 201. In any case, there is insufficient evidence in the record that would alert the district court to any issue regarding Ms. McLean\u2019s competence. The McLeans did request several continuances to allow Ms. McLean to recover from psychological stress. However, psychological and mental stress is not the equivalent of incompetence to proceed in court. The court transcripts show that Ms. McLean understood the proceedings and was capable of protecting her interests. Furthermore, Mr. McLean was a party to the suit. Therefore, the district court did not err by not appointing a guardian ad litem <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">\n<em>C. The District Court Did Not Err in Granting Summary Judgment to GMAC for the McLeans\u2019 RESPA Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Galvez v. Bruce, </em>552 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate where the record presents no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Swisher Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Schafer, </em>550 F.3d 1046, 1050 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 71, 175 L.Ed.2d 233 (2009). \u201cMere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient\u201d to defeat a summary judgment motion. <em>Bald Mountain Park, Ltd. v. Oliver, </em>863 F.2d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"Akh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>RESPA prescribes certain actions to be followed by entities or persons responsible for servicing federally related mortgage loans, including responding to borrower inquires. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605. Pursuant to \u00a7 2605(e), a loan servicer, upon receipt of a qualified written request, must provide \u201ca written response acknowledging receipt of the correspondence\u201d within 20 business days. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(1)(A). RES-PA further requires that, within 60 business days of receipt of a qualified written request, the servicer must: (1) make appropriate corrections in the account of the borrower and transmit a written notification of such correction; (2) after conducting an investigation, provide the borrower with a written explanation that includes a statement of the reasons for which the servicer believes the account is correct, and the name and telephone number of an employee or department that can provide further assistance; or (8) after conducting an investigation, provide the borrower with a written explanation that includes the information requested by the borrower or an explanation of why the information requested is unavailable, along with the name and telephone number of an employee or department that can provide further assistance. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"ASP\">If a loan servicer fails to comply with any of these provisions, an individual borrower may recover any actual damages caused by the failure, and up to $1,000 in statutory damages if there is a pattern or practice of noncompliance with RESPA. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(f). Although we have not specifically defined \u201cactual damages\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2605(f)(1)(A), we have held that RESPA is a consumer protection statute. <em>See Hardy v. Regions Mortg., Inc., </em>449 F.3d 1357, 1359 (11th Cir.2006). Consequently, RESPA is to be \u201cconstrued liberally in order to best serve Congress\u2019 intent.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Carp., </em>160 F.3d 703, 707 (11th Cir.1998) (addressing the remedial nature of the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"A9D\">Construing the term \u201cactual damages\u201d broadly, and based on the interpretations of \u201cactual damages\u201d in other consumer-protection statutes that are remedial in nature, plaintiffs arguably may recover for non-pecuniary damages, such as emotional distress and pain and suffering, under RESPA. <em>See, e.g., Banai v. Sec\u2019y U.S. Dep\u2019t of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev. ex rel. Times, </em>102 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir.1997) (the Fair Housing Act allowance for \u201cactual damages\u201d includes anger, embarrassment, and emotional distress). Nevertheless, the McLeans must present specific evidence to establish a causal link between the financing institution\u2019s violation and their injuries. <em>See Turner v. Beneficial Carp., </em>242 F.3d 1023, 1027-28 (11th Cir.2001) (en banc) (requiring a causal link for TILA claims). In some circumstances, we have held that a plaintiffs testimony alone could support an award of compensatory damages for emotional distress. <em>Akouri v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>408 F.3d 1338, 1345 (11th Cir.2005) (concerning constitutional violations). However, \u201cthe testimony must establish that the plaintiff suffered demonstrable emotional distress, which must be sufficiently articulated; neither conclusory statements that the plaintiff suffered emotional distress nor the mere fact that a ... violation occurred supports an award for compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A9b\">Here, even if we assume <em>arguendo, </em>as the district court did, that GMAC committed two RESPA violations, we still find that the McLeans offered no competent evidence demonstrating that any of their alleged injuries were caused by the said violations. In sum, the McLeans\u2019 conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>sory allegations were insufficient to support a claim of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The McLeans are free to address any possible issues concerning GMAC\u2019s standing to foreclose on their home in the proper venue. However, for the purposes of the RESPA claim we find that GMAC was the appropriate party, but that the McLeans were unable to articulate any specific injury that was caused by GMAC\u2019s failure to respond to their request for information. Further, Ms. McLean was capable of handling her affairs without the aid of a guardian ad litem, especially in light of the fact that Mr. McLean was a party to the suit. Therefore, we affirm the summary judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-10\">. Although the McLeans asserted other claims below, which the court denied, they do not raise these claims on appeal, and, therefore, have abandoned them. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citation omitted) (holding that issues not briefed on appeal, even by a <em>pro se </em>litigant, are deemed abandoned). In addition, we are cognizant of the fact that the McLeans' brief was prepared <em>pro se </em>and we have construed the McLeans\u2019 arguments liberally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\">.
