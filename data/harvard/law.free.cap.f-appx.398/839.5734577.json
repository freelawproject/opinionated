Rogers, a prisoner at the State Correctional Institution at Albion, appeals from an order of the District Court dismissing this pro se civil rights action for failure to prosecute. For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-20\">On February 3, 2010, Rogers filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and a motion for permission to proceed in forma pauperis. He failed to include a certified copy of his trust fund account statement. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(2). On April 9, 2010, he was ordered to submit the document within twelve days. Rogers failed to submit the paperwork or to ask for an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-24\">The Magistrate Judge recommended that the complaint be dismissed for failure to prosecute after applying the factors set forth in <em>Poulis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>747 F.2d 863, 868 (3d Cir.1984). Rogers filed an objection, claiming that he had sent a request for his financial information to the prison records department, but that he had never received a response. He did not submit any documentation showing that he had made such a request. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation by order entered July 10, 2010. Rogers timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-25\">We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Rogers\u2019 complaint. When Rogers was ordered to submit the paperwork required to proceed in forma pauperis, he simply did nothing. His explanation about the prison\u2019s records department is unconvincing. He offers no evidence to support his assertion that he ever even made the request. Moreover, he does not explain why he was able to submit the necessary paperwork when he applied for in forma pauperis status for this appeal, or for the an unrelated action that is currently pending in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-26\">Accordingly, we conclude that this appeal presents no substantial question, and we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-21\">. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review denials of motions to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Harris v. Martin, </em>834 F.2d 361, 364 (3d Cir.1987). We may summarily affirm a decision of the District Court if the appeal does not raise a substantial issue. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
