Brown argues that the district court erred in considering the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and his post-sentencing disciplinary convictions to deny his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Section 3582 directs the court to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). If the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and at least implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, then there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 296 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">The district court had the benefit of Brown\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his attachment to that motion, and the government\u2019s response. In issuing its ruling, the district court specifically referred to several of the factors listed under \u00a7 3553(a). Thus, the record reflects that the district court considered Brown\u2019s motion and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673; <em>Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010. To the extent Brown is arguing that the district court erred by basing the denial of his motion on his prison disciplinary record, the 2008 amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines allow a court to consider a defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). In addition, we have \u201cdecline[d] to hold that a district court cannot consider post-conviction conduct in determining whether to grant a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3374, 176 L.Ed.2d 1260 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">Brown argues that the district court erred in denying his request for the appointment of counsel in the district court. He also argues that he should be appointed counsel to represent him on appeal. We have not recognized the right to counsel in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. Hereford, </em>385 Fed.Appx. 366, 367-69 (5th Cir.2010) (unpub\u2019d). Moreover, Brown has not shown that the interests of justice required the appointment of counsel in the district court or that such an appointment is required in this court. <em>Cf. United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008) (finding that the interests of justice required the appointment of counsel where appeal raised issues not previously resolved by this court\u2019s precedent).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Brown\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1022-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
