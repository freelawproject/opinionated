The district court found that Amendment 709 did not apply retroactively and concluded that it lacked authority to modify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Alvarez\u2019s sentence on this basis. It also denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, certifying that Alvarez\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving this court for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Alvarez is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). However, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) applies only to retroactive guidelines amendments, as set forth in the guidelines policy statement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a), (c); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). Amendment 709 is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(c). Alvarez also argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court erred in finding that \u00a7 1B1.10 is mandatory and that Amendment 709 cannot be applied retroactively. His argument is without merit. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Because Amendment 709 does not apply retroactively, the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c) dictates that the district court is not authorized to reduce a sentence based on Amendment 709. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1. Therefore, Alvarez has not shown that his appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. Accordingly, his request for IFP is DENIED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b105-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
