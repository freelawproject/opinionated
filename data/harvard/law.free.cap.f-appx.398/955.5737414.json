Portillo now appeals his sentence, which was at the top of the range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-23\">The district court sentenced Portillo within a properly calculated guideline range, considered the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and adequately explained the reasons for its chosen sentence, so Portillo\u2019s sentence enjoys a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See, e.g., Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006). Portillo can rebut that presumption only by making \u201ca showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, [] gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or [] represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). Making such a showing is no easy feat: \u201cIt will be the rare sentence indeed that was <em>required </em>under the Guidelines before <em>Booker </em>but [is] <em>forbidden </em>afterward, when discretion has gone up rather than down.\u201d <em>United States v. Gamcir-Gonzalez, </em>469 F.3d 1109, 1110 (7th Cir.2006) (Easter-brook, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Portillo first argues that the district court imposed his sentence in a manner that \u201ccontradicts <em>Gall\u2019s </em>directive to treat each defendant as a unique individual, rather than a mathematical construct.\u201d Nothing in the record supports Portillo\u2019s contention that the district court treated him as a mathematical construct. <em>Gall </em>forbids a court of appeals from using a \u201crigid mathematical formula\u201d to evaluate a non-Guidelines sentence, <em>see </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. 586 or requiring such a sentence to be \u201csupported by a justification that is proportional to the extent of the difference between the advisory range and the sentence imposed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 45, 128 S.Ct. 586 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The district court did not calculate Portillo\u2019s sentence in a manner that ran afoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s teachings in <em>Gall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Portillo next contends that the district court erred in considering his close ties to the United States as an aggravating factor. However, it is not apparent that the district court regarded Portillo\u2019s close ties to this country as an aggravating sentencing factor. The district court concluded that \u201ca sentence at the higher of the Guidelines is appropriate essentially for the reasons stated by the government.\u201d The government\u2019s stated reasons were Portillo\u2019s criminal history, demonstrated lack of respect for the law, and membership in a gang. The district court only discussed Portillo\u2019s close ties to the United States in response to a suggestion from defense counsel that those ties weighed in favor of a lesser sentence. \u201cWhile cultural assimilation <em>may </em>be considered as a mitigating factor, there is no requirement that a sentencing court <em>must </em>accord it dispositive weight.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.) (per curiam) (internal citation omitted), <em>cert, </em>denied,-U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 625, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Because Portillo has failed to make a showing that the district court gave <em>\u201csignificant </em>weight to an irrelevant or improper factor,\u201d <em>see Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186 (emphasis added), his sentence is:</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b981-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
