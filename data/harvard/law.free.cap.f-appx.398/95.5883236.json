Ortuno-Garcia argued that he should receive a four-level reduction to his offense level because he was a minimal participant in the conspiracy, serving merely as a lookout on one occasion. The district court denied Ortuno-Garcia\u2019s request for a minimal role reduction but granted him a two-level reduction for his minor role in the offense. Ortuno-Garcia argues that the district court clearly erred and that he was entitled to a minimal role reduction because he was plainly among the least culpable involved in the conspiracy and had no knowledge of the scope of the conspiracy or the actions of other participants therein. The district court\u2019s denial of a reduction for a mitigating role is a factual determination that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 provides for a four-level reduction in a defendant\u2019s offense level if the defendant was a \u201cminimal\u201d participant in a concerted criminal activity and a two-level reduction in his offense level if he was a \u201cminor\u201d participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. A minimal participant adjustment is appropriate for a defendant who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group,\u201d and a minor participant adjustment is appropriate for a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. nn. 4-5. The Sentencing Commission intends for district courts to award the minimal participant adjustment infrequently. <em>Id. </em>at n. 4; <em>Rosier v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>109 F.3d 212, 214 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-19\">Although Ortuno-Garcia acted as a lookout for the alien smuggling operation, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>cannot say that the district court clearly erred when it found that his role was minor rather than minimal. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203-04. It is plausible in light of the record as a whole that Ortuno-Garcia\u2019s actions as a paid lookout were less culpable than most other participants in the conspiracy but were not so peripheral to the advancement of the goals of the conspiracy to qualify him for the minimal role adjustment. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b122-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
