The district court imposed a sentence of 24 months in prison, to be followed by a three-year term of nonreporting supervised release. On appeal, Gonzalez argues that the sentence was greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Because Gonzalez did not object to the imposed sentence as unreasonable, we review this claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Gonzalez\u2019s disagreement with the within-guidelines sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Gonzalez raises two additional arguments, which he acknowledges are foreclosed by our precedent, to preserve for further review. He argues that, in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his within-guidelines sentence because the illegal reentry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, lacks an empirical basis. We have consistently rejected Gonzalez\u2019s argument, concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not question the presumption of reasonableness and does not require district or appellate courts to independently analyze the empirical grounding behind each individual Guideline. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">Gonzalez also argues that the Guidelines produce unwarranted sentencing disparities between defendants who can participate in a fast-track program and defendants who cannot. We have held that \u201cany sentencing disparity result from fast track disposition is not unwarranted.\u201d <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 563. Because Gonzalez has not shown that his 24-month prison sentence is substantively unreasonable, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1009-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
