Lee argues that the district court erred in considering the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and his post-sentencing disciplinary convictions to deny his motion. He also contends that he failed to get notice of the Government\u2019s response to his motion prior to the ruling by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Section 3582 directs the court to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). If the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and at least implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, then there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 296 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Whitebird, 55 </em>F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">The district court had the benefit of Lee\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his attachments to that motion, and the Government\u2019s response. In issuing its ruling, the district court specifically referred to several of the factors listed under \u00a7 3553(a). Thus, the record reflects that the district court considered Lee\u2019s motion and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673; <em>Whitebird, 55 </em>F.3d at 1010. To the extent Lee is arguing that the district court erred by basing the denial of his motion on his prison disciplinary record, the 2008 amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines allow a court to consider a defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). In addition, we have \u201cdecline[d] to hold that a district court cannot consider post-conviction conduct in determining whether to grant a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3374, 176 L.Ed.2d 1260 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Lee also contends that he was entitled to notice of the Government\u2019s response to his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the district court relied on the \u201cnew evidence\u201d included in it to deny relief. <em>See United States v. Townsend, 55 </em>F.3d 168, 172 (5th Cir. 1995). Even if we assume that the amendments to \u00a7 1B1.10 were insufficient to provide notice that his prison disciplinary record could be considered, and even if we assume that Lee\u2019s own record constitutes \u201cnew evidence\u201d under <em>Townsend, </em>Lee has not shown that any error by the district court rose to the level of harmful error because his arguments against the new evidence would not entitle him to relief. <em>See United States v. Mueller, </em>168 F.3d 186, 189-90 (5th Cir.1999). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
