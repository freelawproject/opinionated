This court is now presented with Landrio\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He argues that the denial was improper because he was not sentenced as a career offender and because the district court gave no reasons for the denial. Alternatively, he contends that he did not qualify for sentencing as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">None of Landrio\u2019s arguments suffice to show that the district court abused its discretion in connection with its denial of his \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). Insofar as Landrio contends that he was not sentenced as a career offender, our review of the record and his arguments refutes this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The district court was under no obligation to give reasons to support its denial of the motion. <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 298 (5th Cir.2009). Consequently, Landrio is not entitled to relief because the district court gave no reasons for denying his motion. Finally, the instant \u00a7 3582 motion is not a proper vehicle for Landrio\u2019s argument that he does not qualify for sentencing as a career offender. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and its alternate request for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b39-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
