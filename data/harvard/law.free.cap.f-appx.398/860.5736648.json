For the reasons that follow, we deny the petition for review in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (2010), the immigration judge may grant a continuance for good cause shown. The immigration judge\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance is thus subject to review for abuse of discretion. <em>Lendo v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 439, 441 (4th Cir.2007). When deciding a motion to continue for the purpose of allowing for a visa petition to be adjudicated by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the immigration judge\u2019s discretion should be favorably exercised if the alien establishes a prima facie approvable visa petition. <em>See In re Hashmi, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 785, 790 (B.I.A. 2009). However, the immigration judge is not obligated \u201cto grant a continuance in every case where there is a pending visa petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether to grant a continuance, the immigration judge should consider various factors including, among others, whether other visa petitions have been previously denied, the reasons for the continuance, and any other relevant procedural factors. <em>Id. </em>at 790-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">We conclude the immigration judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Takyi\u2019s request for a third continuance of his removal proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 794 (\u201c[A] history of continuances being granted by the Immigration Judge for the adjudication of a pending 1-130, coupled with other relevant factors, may support a decision to move forward with the case.\u201d). Accordingly, we deny in part the petition for review. To the extent that Takyi raises issues that were not presented in his administrative appeal to the Board, we lack jurisdiction to consider those unexhausted claims and dismiss in part the petition for review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2006); <em>Massis v. Mukasey, </em>549 F.3d 631, 638, 640 (4th Cir.2008), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u25a0 \u2014 \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 736, 175 L.Ed.2d 513 (2009). Finally, in light of the Board\u2019s order sua sponte reopening proceedings and remanding this case to the immigration court, which was issued after the instant petition for review was filed, we deny as moot Takyi\u2019s request for a remand to the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
