As explained below, the denial of the motion to quash the subpoena is a nonappealable order. However, were the order appealable, we would find that Supreme Court correctly determined that the District Attorney had standing to participate in the retention proceeding and was entitled to the subpoenaed psychiatric records in the interests of justice pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 33.13 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-16\">On February 19, 2009, defendant was arrested and charged with setting fire to a bookcase in the lobby of an occupied apartment building and to four cars. At the time of his arrest, defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ant possessed several weapons, including a loaded .22 caliber firearm, and a bottle of gasoline. A search of his home recovered a sawed-off shotgun with ammunition, as well as more than 200 rounds of .22 caliber ammunition and another bottle of gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">On February 20, 2009, defendant was arraigned at Bellevue Hospital and remanded for a competency examination pursuant to CPL 730.30. On March 11, 2009, defendant was indicted on arson and weapons possession charges. On March 26, 2009, he was arraigned on the indictment and the People moved to confirm the results of the CPL 730.30 examination, which found that defendant lacked the capacity to understand the proceedings and assist in his defense. Defendant was committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and confined to Kirby <em>(see </em>CPL 730.50 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On March 24, 2010, Kirby notified the court and the District Attorney that defendant had been restored to fitness. The report in support of competency restoration noted possible malingering. After defendant was transferred to Hiker\u2019s Island to await trial, his attorney once again requested a CPL 730.30 examination, and the examiners found that defendant was not fit to stand trial. By order dated July 1, 2010, defendant was committed to the custody of the Commissioner and returned to Kirby as an incapacitated person.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In June 2011, two members of Kirby\u2019s forensic committee concluded that defendant was fit to stand trial; one of them implied that defendant had feigned delusional thinking during his previous admission, i.e., had been malingering. The third member found that defendant was still incapacitated. Defendant\u2019s treating psychiatrist also found that defendant was fit, and recommended that he be returned to court. Nevertheless, Kirby\u2019s clinical director disapproved the recommended action, and on June 27, 2011, Kirby filed an application for an order of retention pursuant to CPL 730.50 (2). Notice of the application was served on Mental Hygiene Legal Services (MHLS) and the District Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Defendant requested a CPL 730.50 (2) hearing on the retention application. At a July 21, 2011 hearing date, the People, expressing concern over defendant\u2019s history of violence and the possibility that he was malingering, presented a subpoena duces tecum, which the court signed, directing Kirby to produce defendant\u2019s psychiatric records \u201cfrom April 1, 2009 to the present.\u201d On August 16, 2011, defendant, represented by MHLS, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>moved to quash the subpoena. Supreme Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">\u2018 \u2018It is well established that \u2018[n]o appeal lies from a determination made in a criminal proceeding unless specifically provided for by statute\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Pagan, </em>19 NY3d 368, 370 [2012], quoting <em>People v Dunn, </em>4 NY3d 495, 497 [2005]). The order appealed from, which denied defendant\u2019s motion to quash a court-ordered subpoena, is not a disposition listed in CPL 450.10 or 450.15 <em>(see People v Hurley, </em>47 AD3d 488, 488 [1st Dept 2008] [\u201cNothing in CPL article 450 authorizes an appeal from an order denying a motion for a subpoena duces tecum\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Nor was Supreme Court \u201cacting solely in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction\u201d (CPL 10.10 [7]; <em>see also People v Santos, </em>64 NY2d 702 [1984] [orders determining motions to quash subpoenas are appealable civil orders only when issued in the investigation stage of a criminal case]). CPL article 730 \u201cprovides a procedure for assessing the mental capacity of criminal defendants to stand trial and for the commitment of those found incapacitated, until such time as they regain competency to understand the criminal proceedings against them and to assist in their defense\u201d <em>(People v Lewis, </em>95 NY2d 539, 543 [2000], <em>cert denied </em>534 US 833 [2001]). In this case, Kirby sought an order of retention pursuant to CPL 730.50 (2), which is issued by a superior court exercising criminal jurisdiction <em>(see id. </em>at 547). Defendant then requested a retention hearing, and the so-ordered subpoena duces tecum addressed to Kirby\u2019s director of medical records was issued in connection therewith to aid the People in their examination of Kirby\u2019s witnesses <em>(see </em>CPL 610.10 [2], [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Defendant\u2019s invocation of the subpoena provision of CPLR 2304 and his characterization of this appeal as civil do not alter the conclusion that the motion court was not acting solely in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction when it denied his motion to quash the subpoena. CPL 1.20 (18) (b) defines a criminal proceeding as any proceeding that, among other things, \u201coccurs in a criminal court and is related to a prospective, pending or completed criminal action.\u201d It cannot be argued that the proceedings herein \u201cin no way affect the criminal proceeding . . . and are entirely collateral to and discrete from the criminal proceeding\u201d <em>(see Matter of Director of Assigned Counsel Plan of City of N.Y. [Bodek], </em>87 NY2d 191, 196 [1995, Bellacosa, J., concurring]). \u201cDefendant remains under criminal indictment, and the order clearly arose out of the criminal proceeding against him\u201d <em>(People v Anonymous, </em>284 AD2d 207, 208 [1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Dept 2001] [citation omitted]). To describe this appeal as \u201ccivil\u201d because the court alternatively based its determination on Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 33.13 (c) would be to \u201cresort to interpretative contrivances to broaden the scope\u201d of CPL article 450 <em>(see People v Hernandez, </em>98 NY2d 8, 10 [2002]).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">We note that trial courts that have addressed the issue of whether the District Attorney has standing to participate in a retention proceeding have rendered conflicting decisions <em>(compare e.g. People v Lesly T., </em>33 Misc 3d 881 [Sup Ct, Kings County 2011], <em>with People v Popa, </em>Sup Ct, NY County, 2009, index No. 1938/07). Were we to reach this substantive issue, we would reject defendant\u2019s argument that, under <em>People v Lebron </em>(88 NY2d 891, 894-895 [1996]), the District Attorney does not have standing to participate <em>(see People v Elizabeth P., </em>34 Misc 3d 647, 658 [Sup Ct, NY County 2011]). The issue in <em>Lebr\u00f3n </em>was whether the People, in the context of a speedy trial motion, are chargeable with the time that elapses between an order of commitment and a judicial finding that the defendant is no longer incapacitated. Finding that the District Attorney had no duty of inquiry until the defendant was declared competent, the Court of Appeals held that the People had no obligation to independently monitor the defendant\u2019s commitment status in order to exclude the period of commitment for CPL 30.30 (4) (a) trial readiness purposes, even though the defendant\u2019s absence during that time was attributable in part to his being in the custody of the Department of Correctional Services in an unrelated case, rather than the Department of Mental Hygiene. The Court of Appeals did not address the question of whether or not the District Attorney had the right to participate in a CPL 730.50 (2) retention hearing if it desired to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Although a defendant\u2019s incapacity suspends the criminal proceeding, it does not end the felony prosecution. While the District Attorney does not have any duty of inquiry until the defendant is declared competent, CPL 730.50 (2) does not mandate that the District Attorney be precluded from contesting a defendant\u2019s continued unfitness at a retention hearing when the District Attorney deems such participation necessary to protect the public and the public\u2019s interest in the future of the criminal prosecution against a defendant who may be malingering for the purpose of avoiding prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u201cA finding of . . . competency [to stand trial] is within the sound discretion of the trial court and involves a legal and not a medical determination\u201d <em>(People v Phillips, </em>16 NY3d 510, 517 [2011] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Each retention or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>der has an impact on the indictment because the delay in prosecution will affect the viability of the People\u2019s case. Witnesses\u2019 memories may dim, or the witnesses may become inaccessible. Evidence may be lost. Moreover, if the delay continues long enough, it will eventually result in the automatic dismissal of the charges against defendant by operation of law <em>(see </em>CPL 730.50 [3], [4]). In cases such as this, where the hospital and the Commissioner agree to retention notwithstanding medical opinions to the contrary and indications in the medical records that the defendant may be malingering, the input of the District Attorney is needed to present competing evidence on the issue of a defendant\u2019s fitness so that the court may informatively weigh the defendant\u2019s welfare against the safety of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Significantly, there is no other party who will perform that function in this case. Quite often, the Attorney General\u2019s Office represents the broad public interest. However, here the Attorney General\u2019s Office represents the interest of the Commissioner and the hospital, and Kirby is of the view that defendant is not fit to proceed, a position which, according to the District Attorney, is at odds with the public interest in seeing that defendant is timely prosecuted. MHLS represents the defendant\u2019s interests. Consequently, under the circumstances before us, there is no one to protect the public interest absent the participation of the District Attorney.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201cInterpreting the notice provisions of CPL 730.50 (2) as limiting the district attorney to the role of observer in retention . . . proceedings is too narrow and does not comport with the legislative directive that no incompetent defendant\u2019s custodial status be changed, except on notice to the district attorney (CPL 730.60 [6] [a] [1])\u201d <em>(Lesly T., </em>33 Misc 3d at 883).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The provisions of article 730 relating to notice to the District Attorney should be seen as a \u201cfloor,\u201d or a level of entitlement, with regard to prosecutorial participation, not a \u201cceiling\u201d that limits a court\u2019s reasonable execution of its duty to effectively conduct the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Indeed, CPL 730.50 (2) provides that an application for retention \u201cmust be made within sixty days prior to the expiration of [the] period [prescribed in the temporary order of commitment] on forms that have been jointly adopted by the judicial conference and the commissioner.\u201d The official forms for retention hearings formulated under CPL 730.50 (2) provide for notice to the county\u2019s district attorney (22 NYCRR subtit D, ch VI, form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>16-h). 22 NYCRR 111.5 (a) provides that notice of the retention application shall be served \u201con the defendant, on the defendant\u2019s attorney if known to the director, <em>on the district attorney of the county where the criminal proceeding is pending, </em>and on the Mental Health Information Service\u201d (emphasis added). 22 NYCRR 111.5 (b) provides that if defendant requests a hearing, \u201c[t]he clerk of the court shall notify the defendant, the defendant\u2019s attorney if any, <em>the district attorney, </em>the director of the institution where defendant is confined, and the Mental Health Information Service of the time and place of the hearing\u201d (emphasis added). In conformity with these rules and accepted practice, the District Attorney was served with Kirby\u2019s application for the order of retention, which included a Certificate of the District Attorney stating that 25 years was the maximum term of imprisonment defendant faced if he was convicted on the highest felony charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Defendant is correct that a person does not, as Supreme Court found, \u201cplace[ ] his mental competency at issue,\u201d and thus waive confidentiality, by being an \u201cincapacitated person\u201d under CPL article 730. \u201c[Ijncompetency to stand trial, lack of criminal responsibility because of mental disease or defect, and mental illness for purposes of civil commitment are independent concepts\u201d <em>(see Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v Leggett, </em>48 NY2d 430, 441 [1979]). The purpose of a retention hearing is to determine whether the defendant remains unfit to stand trial, and the inquiry focuses narrowly on the defendant\u2019s present mental capacity to understand the proceedings against him or her and to assist in his or her own defense. By requesting a retention hearing, defendant merely invoked a statutory due process right to defend against the State\u2019s allegation that he was unfit to proceed to trial <em>(see Matter of Barbara W., </em>142 Misc 2d 542 [Sup Ct, Albany County 1988]). However, Supreme Court correctly determined that the People were entitled to defendant\u2019s psychiatric records pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 33.13 (c) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 33.13 (c) states that information about mental health patients, and clinical records and information tending to identify patients, are not public records, and that such information and records may be released only under the limited exceptions and restrictions set forth therein. Pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 33.13 (c) (1), a court may order the release of the documents \u201cupon a finding by the court that the interests of justice significantly outweigh the need for confidentiality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The welfare of the allegedly mentally incapacitated defendant needs to be weighed against the safety of the public <em>(see People v Schaffer, </em>86 NY2d 460, 468-469 [1995]). The District Attorney demonstrated that the requested psychiatric records, limited to the period after defendant was first committed to Kirby, are needed to enable it to present relevant evidence on the issue of defendant\u2019s fitness, including, among other things, whether defendant has been feigning mental illness. This is essential to preserving the integrity of the fact-finding process and our adversarial system, as it will allow the court to make proper legal determinations affecting the future of the criminal action, after considering all the evidence. While Kirby sought an order of retention, there was a split among members of the hospital forensic committee as to defendant\u2019s fitness to proceed, and defendant\u2019s treating psychiatrist believed he should be returned to court. The privacy concerns expressed by MHLS \u201care adequately protected by compliance with the controlling state and federal privacy laws, which do not prohibit disclosure where the applicable conditions of those laws are satisfied\u201d <em>(People v Madrid, </em>88 AD3d 674, 675 [2d Dept 2011]; <em>see also </em>Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 33.13 [f] [\u201cAny disclosure made pursuant to this section shall be limited to that information necessary in light of the reason for disclosure. Information so disclosed shall be kept confidential by the party receiving such information and the limitations on disclosure in this section shall apply to such party\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Accordingly, the appeal from the order of the Supreme Court, New York County (Larry R.C. Stephen, J.), entered on or about October 4, 2011, which denied defendant\u2019s motion to quash a court-ordered subpoena duces tecum served on behalf of the New York County District Attorney\u2019s Office seeking defendant\u2019s psychiatric records in connection with a pending CPL 730.50 retention hearing, should be dismissed, without costs, as taken from a nonappealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Saxe, Catterson, Renwick and Rom\u00e1n, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Appeal from order, Supreme Court, New York County, entered on or about October 4, 2011, dismissed, without costs, as taken from a nonappealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Motion to amend the caption granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
