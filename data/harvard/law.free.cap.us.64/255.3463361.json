Bennitz acquired an interest in the land claimed by. virtue of tbs license granted by Mieheltorena on the 26th of July, 1844.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-7\">Bennitz petitioned for the land in the ordinary manner. It was referred to the secretary, and by him sent to Sutter for report. The latter reported favorably. On returning- the papers to the Governor, the secretary suggested that the formal grant of the legal title should be delayed until the Governor should visit that part of the country, and dispose of the previous applications. Thereupon the Governor authorized Bennitz to take possession and hold it until he should go up and conclude the matter of the grants. He endorsed: \u201c Let him occupy it provisionally until I go up and conclude the matter.\u201d But he never went up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-8\">This conferred a right of possession and occupancy which has never been revoked. . The petitioner took possession by his agent, and occupied for fifteen or eighteen months, until the agent was killed by the Indians, as in Reading\u2019s case, and he continued to claim the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-9\">On the 22d of December, 1844, Mieheltorena gave what is denominated the \u201cgeneral title,\u201d which was intended as a confirmatory grant of this and other lands. . This satisfied Bennitz that he had acquired a legal title, and he continued to occupy down to 1846, (when his agent was killed,) and he also continued to claim the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-10\">This case is clearly distinguishable-from those of Sutter and Nye, decided at the last term, (21 How., 170, 408.) In each of those eases there was a petition, a reference, and a report by the local officer, but no further action by the Governor in either. All rested upon the subsequent general title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-11\">In Sutter\u2019s claim for the sobrante there was a petition and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>favorable report, but no further action. Mr. Justice Campbell, in the opinion of the court, says \u201cthat the Governor reserved the subject for consideration until he could visit the Sacramento valley, and that the papers were returned, to the claimant.\u201d (21 How., 179.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4u\">In Nye\u2019s case he said: \u201cThe secretary referred the petition to Se\u00f1or Sutter, commissioner of the frontier of Sacramento. Sutter certifies, on this reference, that the land is now unoccupied. His certificate is dated the 29th of January, 1844. There is no evidence to show that these papers were returned 'to Mieheltorena, or that he ever saw the certificate. They are produced by the claimant. The remainder of the evidence consists of what is termed \u201d Sutter\u2019s general title. (21 How., pp. 409, 410.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-6\">In Bassett\u2019s case, there was no evidence that possession had been taken of the land or improvements made by the grantee, nor that he performed any act in confidence that he had acquired any interest therein. The case does not show that he believed he had acquired any rights, or that he sought to exercise any. There is. no eyidence of the Governor\u2019s understanding in relation to that particular case. There is nothing to show that Bassett expended time or money, oh the strength of his belief that .he had received any right to. the land, or that he expected a legal title would be conferred upon him as a necessary and proper conclusion of what had previously been done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-7\">\u25a0 The case at bar presents quite a different aspect from either of those decided at the last term. Bennitz made application for a grant in the usual manner, and received a license to occupy until the Governor should act after a personal-examination. Bennitz treated this as conferring a substantial right. He caused a settlement and improvements to-be made, and cattle to be placed on the l\u00e1nd. The person whom he placed on the land- lived on it near a year and a half, until' he was killed by the Indians. . He hi in self served the Government in the army, and was assured by the Governor that his grant had been confirmed. He believed it, and acted accordingly. Both lie and the representative of the Government (the Governor) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>apparently entertained the same opinion upon this subject. Both believed that Bennitz had rights to the land. No one interfered to denounce the land, or meddle with or question Bennitz\u2019s rights. Things remained unchanged until the Government changed hands. No steps have ever been taken to deprive him of his claim. The representative of Mexico did what he thought would confirm Bennitz in his title. Bennitz, like many others, thought the general title, granted the same year, rendered his rights perfect. He continued his possession, and took steps towards further settlement, either by way of tenancy or sale, and submitted his papers to a proposed purchaser, by way of showing that he had fights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-4\">True, all'this did not create legal title. But it did create* an equitable title, of a distinct and unquestionable kind. The steps taken, and acts perform\u00e9d, created an interest in Bennitz, which was of value to him, and which really cost him something. He took the incipient steps to acquire title, and the representative of Mexico concurred in them, and conferred a right which he was to look after at a. future day, and, if all was right and proper, he would convert what he then did into a legal title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-5\">Bennitz had done all on his part, and there was nothing in the way of the Governor conferring perfect legal title. It was no fault of Bennitz that it was not actually done. Mexico assented to his rights, by leaving him in the quiet and full possession of the land down to the treaty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-6\">Would Mexico ever have questioned Bennitz\u2019s rights? Certainly she did not; and by taking possession and making improvements, Bennitz paid the usual consideration required to secure a perfect grant. By not giving him . notice. that his rights would not be. recognised,' Mexico led him into expenses that he would not otherwise have incurred. She, by the acts of her lawful representative, induced Bennitz to go on and expend money in improvements. She told him he might go into possession until she should determine that he could not have the land. She sent him word that his land was confirmed to him.- She sent out a broad paper, inducing him to believe that perfect title had been made to him. He confided in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>acts, which were of a character calculated to secure his confidence. There is no evidence that Mexico did not really mean what she said. While she remained the sovereign there, she never questioned the act of her representative, even after he was driven from the country by local enemies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-5\">These- acts of Mexico created clear equitable rights in Bennitz, and they have never been forfeited or taken from .him. They existed when, by the treaty, the United States succeeded to the rights of Mexico. Bennitz\u2019s rights were good, and bound the conscience of Mexico until they were divested ac^ cording to law, which has not yet occurred. Since the puw chase by the United States, they have not been changed. No branch of our Government, could change them against Bennitz. They are now just what they were under Mexico, when he was occupying and improving the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-6\">This court cannot take away any right, however small, which' he th.en had; but it must confirm it, if it. was a right at all, which, in the ordinary course of events, if there had been no change of Government,'would have ripened into a legal right. If the Government of. Mexico had done any act which .conferred such a right, whether it had ripened into a perfect right or not, then, in equity and good conscience, our Government is bound to recognise that right, and 'to confirm it to the claimant, freed from all claim on its part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-7\">The court can, under the law of 1851, declaring the rights of parties, declare an inchoate right to be a legal and perfect one. It can do what Mexico would have done under the circumstances. But it cannot deprive the party of any right, however trifling, which had become his, either in law or equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\">. The cases heretofore passed upon in this court have involved only legal titles. No ease, has presented a simple equitable title. The statute recognises equitable titles as proper for the court to pass upon and confirm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-9\">In the Louisiana and Florida cas.es, the party desiring land petitioned for it, and obtained an order to survey; and' when the survey was made, occupancy conferred an equitable title, which this court would confirm. The petition imCalifoniia is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the same, except it is usually accompanied with a map, which rendered the survey, unnecessary. The reference tc ascertain whether the land was vacant, and the report thereon in California, were equal to a survey in Florida and Louisiana. Occupancy in the latter places '.completed the equitable rights of the party. In California, when occupancy follows the petition, reference and report, and permission to occupy, the effect must 'be the same. The party has everything that he could have, except the formal grant, which would confer perfect legal title. When the ease falls shprt of legal title, but there is something of-it, then it must be an equitable claim; and if that exists, then the court must confirm it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-5\">Ther\u00e9 was something in this case which was treated by Mexico and the claimant as \u00bfn interest. . There was an application for a definite spot which, was not occupied, and it was so reported, and permission given to occupy until further action by the Governor, and then there was possession and continued occupancy. Mexico could not have recovered against him as a' trespasser, after the license and occupancy under it; and no one denouncing the land, the Governor could not eject him. Here, were tangible facts. The claimant thought he had some rights, and no one questioned them. He was told his title was confirmed, and a formal document followed. Here was something of substance. Not being a legal title, but still being something which would affect the conscience of Mexico, it was clearly an equity. If it was an equity, this court is bound to recognise and confirm it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b273-6\">Mr. Justice CAMPBELL</author>\n<p id=\"AWi2\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The claimant applied to Micheltorena, in 1844, for a concession of five square leagues of land, lying in the valley of the Sacramento river, and bounded on the west by that stream. \u201e The petition was referred to Captain Sutter, who reported that the land was vacant.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The secretary reported, that the Governor having deferred any action upon petitions like the present, until he could make a visit to the region of the Sacramento and San Joaquin, it would be proper to dispose of this in the same manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The Governor so ordered, authorizing the applicant to take provisional possession, until he could make his visit. \u25a0 The suit of the claimant was submitted to the board of commissioners on this testimony, and it was rejected, as invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Upon appeal to the District Court, the claimant proved that he was a soldier in the war of Micheltorena, and an officer in one of the companies of Sutter. That the Governor acknowledged his services in that wax', and vex'bally recognised the validity of his claim for the land specified, and that it would be pex\u2019fected by means of the \u201cgeneral title\u201d of Sutter. The claimant also proved, that in March, 1845, two persons went upon the land, to make improvements under his claim. \u2022 That one of them shortly after retreated, from fear of the Indians; that the other (Julien) made some improvement and cultivation, and occupied the land twelve or fifteen months, when he was killed by-them. In the case of the United States <em>v. </em>Reading, 18 How., 1, it was px\u2019oved that Julien occupied the land of that claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u2022 The merits of the claims arising under the general title of Sutter have been discussed in the cases of Nye and Bassett, reported in 21 How. R., 408, 412. This claim is in all respects similar; and, for the x-easons assigned in those cases, is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Decree reversed. Cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
