A mortgage is a sale upon condition ; and, as before stated, by the rule of the common law there can be no sale of a thing not in existence, and which is not at. the time the property of the seller.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-8\">The rule of the civil law is the very reverse of that of the common law in this particular, and is thus stated by Domat:</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-9\">\u201c Those who bind themselves by any engagement whatsoever may, for the security of their performance of the engagement, on their part, appropriate and mortgage, not only the estate they are masters of at the time of contracting, but likewise all the estate which they shall be afterwards seized or possessed of. And this mortgage extends to all the things which they shall afterwards acquire, that are capable of being mortgaged, by what title soever it be'that they acquire them, and even to those which are not in being when the obligation is contracted; so that the fruits which, shall grow upon the lands will be comprehended in the mortgage of an estate to come.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-10\">1 Domat, (Cushing\u2019s ed.,) 649, art. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-11\">\u201c Although the mortgage be restrained to certain things, yet it will nevertheless extend to all that shall arise or proceed from that thing which is mortgaged, or that shall augment it and make part of it. Thus; the fruits which grow on the lands that are mortgaged are subject to the mortgage while they continue unseparated from the ground. Thus, when a stud of horses, a herd of cattle, or a flock of sheep, is put in pawn into the creditor\u2019s hands, the foals, the lambs, and other beasts which they bring forth, and which augment their number, are likewise engaged for the creditor\u2019s security. And if the whole herd or flock be entirely changed, the heads which have renewed it are engaged in the same manner as the old stock. Thus, when the bounds of a piece of ground that is mortgaged happen to be enlarged by that which the course of a river may add to it, the mortgage extends to that which has augmented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the ground. Thus, a house that is built on a ground which is mortgaged, is subject likewise to the mortgage. And if, on the contrary, a house be mortgaged, and it perishes by fire, or falls through decay, the mortgage will subsist on the ground where the house stood. Thus, when a debtor mortgages a piece of ground of which he had only the bare property, another enjoying the usufruct of it, when the said right to the usufruct comes to be extinct, the mortgage will comprehend the ground with the fruits.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-5\">Ib., 650, art. 7.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-6\">There is, therefore, no inherent difficulty in making a mortgage which shall extend to after-acquired property, or property not <em>in esse. </em>And courts of equity which are not trammelled by the technical rules of the common law in the administration of justice, both in England and in this country, uphold such mortgages, in pursuance of the rule of the civil law, when necessary to carry into effect the honest and just contracts of parties according to their real intentions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-7\">Eonblanque, B. 1, ch. 4, sec. 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-8\">Ib., ch. 5, sec. 8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-9\">1 Powell on Mort., 190.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-10\">Coote on Mort.

At the time of the issuing of these bonds, and the execution of the mortgage, tbe railroad was in the course of construction, but only a small portion of it finished. It was constructed and equipped almost entirely by means of the funds raised from these bonds, together with a second issue to the amount of $700,000. The road cost upwards of $1,500,000. The stock subscribed and paid in, amounted only to some $869,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The mortgage securing the payment of the second issue bears date the first of November, 1854, and was made to one George Mygatt, in trust for the bondholders, and the property described in and covered by it is the same as that described in the first mortgage. The road was fiiiished to Millersburg, its present terminus south, in May, 1854, and the whole of the rolling stock was placed on it previous to the date of the second mortgage. This stock ivas purchased and placed bn the road from time to time, as the locomotives and cars were needed in the progress of its construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The mortgage to the complainant contained a covenant ox* the part of the company, that the money borrowed for the construction and equipment of the road should be faithfully applied to that object, and that the work should be carried on with due diligence until the same should be finished.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In case of default in the payment of the principal or interest of 'the bonds, the trustee was empowered to enter upon and take possession of the road, or, at the election of a moiety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>of the bondholders, to sell the same at' public auction, and apply the proceeds to the payment of the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The defendants, Pennock and Hart, being the holders of sixteen of the bonds issued under the second mortgage, recovered a judgment on the same, May, 1856, against the railroad company issued execution, and levied on a portion of the rolling stock of the road, and caused the same to be. advertised for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">This bill was filed to enjoin the sale, and a decree was rendered perpetually enjoining it in the court below, which is now before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The first two grounds of objection taken to this decree may be considered together. They are: 1, that the mortgage to the trustee of the 1st April, 1852, is void or inoperative, as respects the locomotives and cars which were levied on under the execution of the defendants, inasmuch as they were not in existence at the date of it, but were .constructed and placed on the road afterwards, being subsequently-acquired property of the company. And, 2, that the mortgage is void, dn the ground of uncertainty as to the property described or attempted to be described therein and conveyed to the mortgagee. The description begins by conveying \u201c all the following present and future acquired property of the said parties of the first part; \u201d and after specifying the road and the several parts of it, together with the rolling stock, there is added, \u201cand all other personal property, right thereto, and interest therein.\u201d This clause, probably, from the connection in which it js found, was intended to refer to property appurtenant to the road, and employed in its operation, and which had not been enumerated; and if so, the better opinion, perhaps, is, that it would be bound by the mortgage even as against judgment creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">But if is unimportant to express any opinion upon the question, as the property, in this case (the locomotives and cars) levied on are articles specifically enumerated; and the only uncertainty existing in respect to them arises out of their nonexistence at'the date of the mortgage. An uncertainty of this character need not be separately examined,, as it will.be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>resolved by a consideration of the first question, which is, whether or not the after-acquired rolling stock'of the company placed upon the road attaches, in equity, to the mortgage, if within the description, from the time it is placed there, so as to protect it against the judgment creditors of the railroad company ?</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">If we are at liberty to determine this question by the terms and clear intent of the agreement of the parties, it will be found a very plain one. The company have agreed with the bondholders, (for the mortgagee represents them,) that if they will advance their money to build the road, and equip it, the road and equipments thus constructed, and as fast as constructed, shall be pledged as a security for the loan. This is the simple contract, when stripped of form and verbiage; and, in order to carry out this intent mopt1 effectually, and with as little hazard as possible to the lender, the company specially stipulate that the \u2022 money thus borrowed shall .be faithfully applied in the construction and equipment of the road. And in further fulfilment of the intent, the company agree, that in case of default in the payment of principal or interest, the bondholders may enter upon and take possession of the road, and run it themselves, by their agents, applying the net proceeds to the payment of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The bondholders have fulfilled their part of the agreement\u2014 they have advanced the money on the faith of the. security; the company have also fulfilled theirs \u2014 they have made the road and equipped it; it has been partially in operation since January, 1852, and in operation upon the whole line since May, 1854. The road, therefore, as described in the mortgage, from Hudson to Millersburg, and which was in the course of construction at the date of the instrument, has been finished, and the rolling stock, locomotives, tenders, aud cars, also described in it, and which were to be afterwards acquired, have been brought into existence, and placed upon it \u2014 all in conformity with the agreement of the parties; and the question is, whether there is any rule of law or principle of equity that denies effect to such an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The main argument urged against it is founded upon th6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>maxim, that \u201ca person cannot grant a thing which he has not: \u201d <em>ille non habei, non dat; </em>and many authorities are referred to at law to prove the proposition, and many more might have been added from cases in equity, for equity no more than law can deny it. The thing itself is an impossibility. It may, at once, therefore, be admitted, whenever a party undertakes, by deed or mortgage, to grant property, real or personal, in present\u00ed, which does not belong to him or has no existence, the deed or mortgage, as the case may be, is inoperative and void, and this either in a court of law or equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">But the principle has no application to the case before us. The mortgage here does not undertake to grant, in present\u00ed, property of the company not belonging to them or not in existence at the date of it, but carefully distinguishes between present property and that to be afterwards acquired. Portions of the road had been acquired and finished, and were, in operation, when the mortgage, was given, upon which it is conceded it took effect; other portions were acquired afterwards, and especially the iron and other fixtures, besides the greater part of the rolling stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The terms of the grant or conveyance are: \u201c all present and future to be acquired property of the parties of the first part; \u201d that is to say, \u201ctheir road, made or to be made, and all rails and other materials, <em>kc-., </em>including iron rails and equipments, procured or to be procured,\u201d <em>kc. </em>We have no occasion, therefore, of calling in question, much less denying, the soundness of tlie maxim, so strongly urged against the effect of the mortgage upon the property in question, as its force' and operation depend upon a different state of facts, and to which different principles are applicable. The inquiry here is, not whether a person can grant iu present\u00ed property not belonging to him, and not in existence, but whether the law will permit the grant or conveyance to take effect upon the property when it is brought info existence, and belongs to the grantor,' iu fulfilment of an express agreement, founded on a good and valuable consideration; and this, when no rule of law is infringed or rights of a third party prejudiced? The locomotives and cars were, all placed upon, the road as early as Eebruaiy, 1854, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>when, at the furthest, the mortgage attached to those in question, according to its-terms, if at all, and the judgment of the defendants was not recovered till May, 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We think it very clear, if the company, after having received the money upon the bonds and given the mortgage secui\u2019ity, had undertaken to divert the fund from the purpose to which it was devoted, namely, the construction of the road and its equipment, and upon which the security mainly depended, a court of equity would have interposed, and enforced a specific performance. One of the covenants was, that the money should be faithfully applied to the building and equip-meat.of the road; or if, after the road was put in operation, the company had undertaken to divert the rolling stock from the use of the road, a like interposition might have been invoked, and this in order to protect the security of the .bondholders. And if a- court of equity would thus have compelled a specific performance of the contract, we may certainly with confidence conclude that it would sanction the voluntary performance of it by the parties themselves, and give effect to the security as soon as the property is brought into existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The case of Langton <em>v. </em>Hasten (1 Hare\u2019s Ch. R., 549) supports this view. The mortgage security in that ease was the assignment of the ship Foxhound, then on her voyage to the South seas,'together with all and .singular her masts, &amp;c.,, <em>\u201cand all oil and head </em>matter, <em>and other </em>cargo, <em>which might be caught or brought home on the said ship, on and from her then present voyage.\u201d </em>The cargo was levied on by a judgment creditor on the arrival of the ship at home. A bill was filed to have the mortgage declared a good and valid security for the moneys advance'd, and that the complainants be entitled to the benefit of the security, in preference to the judgment creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The vice chancellor, in giving his opinion, observed: \u201c Is it true that a subject to be acquired after the date of a cob-tract cannot, in equity, be claimed by a purchaser for value under that contract ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">And, in answer to the question, he said : \u201cIt is impossible to doubt, for some purposes at- least, that by contract an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>terest in a thing not in existence at the time of the contract may, in equity, become the property of the purchaser for value.\u201d And, after reviewing the cases in the books, he concludes: \u201cI cannot, without-going in opposition to many authorities which have been cited, throw any doubt upon the point that Bixnie, the contracting party, would be bound by the assignment to the plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">There are many cases in this country confirming this doctriue, and which have led to the practice extensively of giving this sort of security, especially in railroad and other similar great and important enterprises of the day. (2 Selden R., 179; 3 Green Ch. R., 377; 32 N. H. Rep., 484; 25 Barb., 286; ib., 284; 18 B. Munro, 431; Redfield on Railways, 590, and note; 2 Story R., 630; 7 Jurist, 771; Tapfield <em>v. </em>Hillman.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In the case of Tapfield <em>v. </em>Hillman, Tindall, Ch. J., seems inclined to the opinion that, even at law, a moi\u2019tgage security of future acquisitions might have effect given to it, if the terms indicated an intent to comprehend them.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The counsel for the appellee referred.to the ease of Chapman <em>v. </em>Weimer &amp; Steinbacker, (4 Ohio R., 481,) as denying effect to a mortgage upon after-acquired property. But that was a case at law; and even there the court held that the mortgage attached- after the property was acquired, from the time the right was asserted by the. mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">In conclusion upon this point, wTe are satisfied that the mortgage attached to the future acquisitions, as described in it, from the time they came into existence. As to the claim of the judgment, creditors, there are several answers to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">In the first place, the mortgage being a valid and effective security for the bondholders of prior, date, they pi\u2019esent the superior equity to have the property in question applied to the discharge of'the bonds. It is true, if the property covered by the mortgage constituted a fund more than sufficient' to pay their demands, the court might compel the prior encumbrancer to satisfy the execution, or, on a refusal, the mortgage having become forfeited, compel a foreclosure and satisfaction of the bond debt, so as to enable the judgment creditor to reach the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>surplus. Or the court might, upon any unreasonable resistance of the claim of'the execution creditor, or inequitable interposition for delay, and to hinder and defeat.the execution, permit a sale of the rolling stock sufficient to satisfy it. But no such ground has been presented, or\u2019 could be sustained upon the facts before us. On the contrary, it cannot be denied but that the whole of the property mortgaged is insufficient to satisfy the bondholders under the first mortgage, much less when those under the second are included. To permit any :i\u00fcterference, therefore, on the part of the judgment creditors, With a view to the satisfaction of their debt, consistent with the superior equity of-the bondholders, would work only inT convenience and harm to the latter, .without any benefit to the former. (3 Hare\u2019s Ch. R., 416; 9 Georgia R., 377 ; Redfield on Railw., 506; 5 Ohio R., 92.)</p>\n<p id=\"Acs6\">In the second place, the judgment sought to be enforced by the defendants was recovered upon bonds of the second issue, and secured, in common with all the bonds of that issue, upon this property, by virtue of the second mortgage. These bondholders have a common interest' in this security, and are all equally entitled to the benefit of it; and in case of a deficiency of the fund to satisfy the whole of the debt, In e\u2019quity, a dis-' tribution is made among the holders pro rata. The payment of the bonds of the second issue are also postponed until satisfaction of the issue comprehended within the first mortgage, as the second was taken with a full knowledge of the first. To permit, therefore, one of the bondholders under the second mortgage to .proceed at law in the collection of his debt upon execution would not only disturb the pro .rata distribution in case of a deficiency, and give him an inequitable preference over his associates, but also have the effect to prejudice the superior equity of the bondholders under the first mortgage, \u2022which possesses the prior lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">As the judgment creditors can have no interest in the management or' disposition of the property, except as bondholders,on account of the deficiency of the fund, it is uuimportant to inquire whether or not the court was right in refusing a receiver, or to direct a sale of the road with a view to a distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>bution of the proceeds. For aught that appears, the road has been managed, under its present directors, with prudence and fidelity, and to the satisfaction of the bondholders, the parties exclusively interested. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Another objection taken to the validity of the mortgage is, the want of power under the charter to construct the road from Hudson to Millersburg, and consequently to borrow money and pledge the road for this purpose. There is certainly some obscurity in the statutes creating this corporatidtas to the extent of .the line of its road; but we agree with tlif: court below, that, upon a reasonable interpretation of them* the power is to be found in their charter. They were authorized to construct the road from some convenient point on the Cleveland and Pittsburgh road, in Hudson, Summit county, through Cuyahoga Falls, and Akron, to Wooster, or some point on the Ohio and Pennsylvania railroad,.between Massillon and Wooster, and to connect with said Ohio and Pennsylvania road, and <em>any other railroad running in the direction of Columbus. </em>It was clearly not limited, in its southern terminus, to its connection with the Ohio and Pennsylvania road, for there is added, \u201c and any other railroad running in the direm tion of Columbus.\u201d \u2022 The extension of the road to the Ohio Central road at Zanesville, or at some other point on this road, comes fairly within the description.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">We have not referred particularly to the authority of the company, under the statute laws of Ohio, to borrow money and pledge the road for the security of the payment, as no such question is presented .in the brief or was made on the argu- . ment. Indeed, the'authority seems to be full and explicit.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab6\">\u00a1Decree below affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
