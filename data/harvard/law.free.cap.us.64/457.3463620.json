The language of the reservation was: \u201c The United States agree to grant to- each of the following persons the quantity of land annexed to their names, which lands shall be conveyed to them by patent.\u201d ' To Pet-chi-co two sections, &amp;c., &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-11\">Then followed this Sentence: \u201c The foregoing reservations shall be selected under the direction of the President of the United States, -after the lands shall have been surveyed, and the boundaries to correspond with the-public surveys.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-12\">TStat. atL., 394, 3951</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-13\">In. February, 1833, Pet-chi-co made a deed to Coquillard and Colerick, with a general warranty, conveying \u201c all of those . two sections of land lying and being in the State aforesaid,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-14\">Before the lands were selected or located by the President, and before any patent issued, Pet-chi-co died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-15\">In January, 1831, patents were issued to Pet-chi-co and his heirs for the friyo sections mentioned in the treaty.

The leading question in the case was, therefore, whether Pet-chi-co had a right to make the deed when it was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\">In the course of the trial below, many exceptions were taken respecting matters. of evidence, and many prayers to the court made; in so much that the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, after many other points, enumerated twenty-six distinct causes of error. It is not necessary to mention these. The rulings of the Circuit Court upon the two following points are sufficient for the purpose of the present report :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-7\">\u25a0 4. If Pet-chi-co, between the ratification of the treaty and the issuing of the patents, sold and conveyed the land in controversy by a sufficient deed of conveyance, with covenants of warranty, to Coquillard and Colerick, and their assigns, then the patents when issued, as to the assignees, related back to and took effect from the ratification of the treaty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AgC\">5. If, before the issuing of the patents to Pet-chi-co, he had, by a legal and valid instrument,, assigned to Coquillard and Colerick his interest in the lands which were to be granted to him under the treaty of October, 1832; and if Colerick had, in like manner, assigned his interest to Coquillard; and if Coquillard had, in like manner, assigned to Wilson, then, by .virtue of the act of Congress of- May 20, 1836, the patents when issued inured to the benefit of Wilson, and vested the legal title to the land in him, although Pet-chi-co may have died before its date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-9\">The verdict being for the defendant, the plaintiffs brought the case up to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-10\">\u25a0 It was argued by <em>Mr. Baxter </em>for the plaintiffs in error, arid by <em>Mr. John </em>B. <em>Niles </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\"Without following the counsel through the branches of the case or the effect of the act of 1886; we can only state the positions assumed upon the point decided by this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-5\"><em>Mr. Baxter </em>said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-6\">I.

The reservations are by sections, amounting probably to a hundred, lying in various parts of the ceded country: As to\" these, the Indian. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>title remained a\u00bb it stood before the treaty was made; and to complete the title to the reserved lands, the' United States agreed that they would issue patents to the respective owners. One of these reservees was the chief, Pet-chi-co, to whom was reserved two sections. The treaty also provides, that \u201cthe foregoing reservations shall be selected under the direction of the President of the United States, after the land shall have been surveyed, and the boundaries shall correspond with the public surveys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In February, 1838, by a deed in fee simple, Pet-chi-co conveyed to Alexis Coquillard and David H. Colerick, of the State of Indiana, \u201c all those two sections of land lying in the State aforesaid, in the region of country or territory ceded by the treaty of 27th October, 1832.\u201d The grantor covenants that he is lawful owner of the lands; hath good right and lawful authority to sell and convey the same. And he furthermore warrants the title against himself and his heirs. Under this deed, the defendant holds possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The lessors of the plaintiff took a deed from Pet-chi-co\u2019s heirs, dated in 1855, on the assumption that their ancestor\u2019s deed was void; he having died in 1833, before the lands were surveyed, or the reserved sections selected. And on the trial below, the court was asked to instruct the jury, \u201c that Pet-chi-co held no interest under the treaty in the lands in question, up to the time of his death, that was assignable; he having died before the location of the land, and before the patents issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">. This instruction the court refused to <em>give; </em>but, on the contrary, charged the jury, that \u201cThe description of the land in the deeds from Pet-chi-co to Coquillard and Colerick, from Colerick to Coquillard, and from Coquillard to Wilson, are sufficient to identify the land thereby intended to be conveyed as the same two sections of land which are in controversy in this suit, and which are described in the patents, which have been read in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">It is assumed that the lands embraced by the patents to Pet-chi-co, made in 1887, do not lie within the section of country ceded by the treaty of 27th October, 1832; and therefore the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>court was asked to instruct the jury that the defendants cannot claim nor. hold the land as assignees of Pet-chi-co, by virtue of the treaty. The demand for such instruction' was also refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">There is no evidence in the record showing where the land granted .by the patents lies, except that which is furnished by the patents themselves. They.recite the stipulation in the treaty in Pet-chi-co\u2019s behalf; that the selections for him, of sections nine and ten, had been made, \u201c as being the sections to which the said Pet-chi-co is entitled,\u201d under the treaty. The-recitals in the patents conclude all controversy on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The only question presented by the record that we feel ourselves called on to decide is, whether Pet-chi-co\u2019s deed of February, 1833, vested his title in Coquillard and Colerick. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The Pottawatomie nation was the owner of the possessory right of the country ceded, and all the subjects of the nation were joint owners of it. The r\u00e9servees took by the treaty, directly from the nation, the Indian title; and this was the right to occupy, use, and enjoy the lands, in common with the United States, until partition was made, iu the manner prescribed. The treaty itself converted the reserved sections into individual property. The Indians as a nation reserved no interest in the territory ceded; but as a part of the consideration for the cession, certain individuals of the nation had conferred on them portions of the land, to which the United States title was either added or promised to be added; and it matters not which, for the purposes of this controversy for possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The United States held the ultimate title, charged with the right of undisturbed occupancy and perpetual possession, in the Indian nation, with the exclusive power in the Government of acquiring the right. Johnson <em>v. </em>McIntosh, 8 Whea., 603; Comet <em>v. </em>Winton, 2 Yerger\u2019s R., 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Although the Government alone can purchase lands from an Indian nation, it does ,not follow^ that when the fights of \u2022the nation are extinguished, an individual of the nation who takes as private owner cannot sell his interest. The Indian title is property, and alienable, unless the treaty had prohib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>ited its sale. Comet <em>v. </em>Winton, 2 Yerger\u2019s R., 148. Blair and Johnson <em>v. </em>Pathkiller\u2019s Lessee, 2 Yerger, 414. So far from this being-the case in the instance before us, it is manifest that sales of the reserved sections were contemplated, as the lands ceded were \"forthwith to be surveyed, sold, and inhabited by a white population, among whom the Indians could not remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We hold that Pet-chi-co was a tenant in common with the United States, and could sell his reserved interest; and that when the United States selected the lands reserved to him, and made partition, (of which the patent is conclusive evidence,) his grantees took the interest he would have taken if living.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">We order the judgment to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
