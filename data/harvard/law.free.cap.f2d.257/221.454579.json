The question is whether one Friedman, who was retained in the plaintiff\u2019s former grade, was entitled to veterans\u2019 preference. If he was not, he should have been demoted instead of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">Friedman was drafted and sent to camp July 17, 1918. On July 21, 1918 he was discharged from the draft as physically unfit. Since 1942 he has worked continuously for the government. In Hurley v. Crawley, 1931, 60 App.D.C. 245, 50 F.2d 1010, we held that a man discharged from draft was an honorably discharged soldier entitled to preference under the Acts then in effect. Accordingly a Civil Service Commission Minute of June 10, 1931 provides: \u201cPersons presenting discharges from draft are entitled to preference regardless of the length of their military service. * * \u201d The Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944, chap. 287, \u00a7 18, 58 Stat. 391, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 867, provides that it \u201cshall not be construed to take away from any preference eligible any rights heretofore granted to, or possessed by, him under any existing law, Executive order, civil-service rule or regulation, of any department of the Government or officer thereof.\u201d We think it follows that the District Court erred in holding that Friedman was not entitled to preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-16\">In McDougall v. United States Civil Service Commission, 1953, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 69, 202 F.2d 361, certiorari denied 345 U.S. 969, 73 S.Ct. 1111, 97 L.Ed. 1386, we held that a man in substantially Friedman\u2019s position was not one of the \u201cex-servicemen\u201d on whom a preference was conferred by \u00a7 2 of the 1944 Act, 58 Stat. 387-388, as amended, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 851, because the man never became a \u201cfull-fledged\u201d soldier. But that case seems to have been submitted and decided without adverting to the saving clause of the 1944 Act, quoted above, and the preference rights that the man had previously acquired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AxC\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-12\">. A Civil Service Commission Minute of May 20, 1954 recognizes that \u201cpersons discharged from the draft in World War I * * \u2022 are entitled to preference under the prior law; and that under section 18 of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act preference cannot he withdrawn if the employee was in the service on the date of the Act and has been continuously employed since that date without a break in service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"aod-dedup-0\">Doubtless Friedman could not require the Secretary of War to give him a certificate of honorable discharge from the army in place of the \u201cdischarge from draft\u201d. Patterson v. Lamb, 329 U.S. 539, 67 S.Ct. 448, 91 L.Ed. 485. But that is not the issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
