The findings and conclusions are awkwardly drawn, but they appear to contain enough substance to prevent this court from holding the findings clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-21\">A rejection of certain evidence is assigned as error. The point is close, but it appears that an insufficient bottom was put under the point in the trial court to justify the assignment of error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-22\">The judgment is affirmed except as to the portion thereof which alternatively provides for the payment of money by the government to the claimant if the government should fail to return the car \u2014 apparently for any reason whatsoever. This provision seems to stand on no firmer basis than: \u201cWell, it is a good idea.\u201d As to such portion, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
