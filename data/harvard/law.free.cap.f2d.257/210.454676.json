Airborne Freight Corporation asks us to review and set aside this decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-17\">Airborne assembles and ships air freight. Such shippers are called \u201cair freight forwarders\u201d and sometimes described as \u201cindirect air carriers\u201d. Airborne contends it is an \u201cair carrier\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 404(a) of the Act which provides that every \u201cair carrier\u201d shall provide through service \u201cin connection with other air carriers\u201d and shall establish \u201cjoint rates\u201d; and \u00a7 412 which provides that any \u201cagreement\u201d of an \u201cair carrier\u201d with \u201cany other air carrier\u201d shall be filed with the Board. Airborne says it may therefore make, and file with the Board, agreements with airlines by which it will pay lower rates for air transportation than the rates specified in the currently effective tariffs of the airlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-18\">In the light of United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U.S. 192, 198, 76 S.Ct. 763, 100 L.Ed. 1081, we think Airborne has standing to sue. Accordingly our opinion of May 1, 1958 is withdrawn and our judgment dismissing the petition for review is vacated. We find no error in the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
