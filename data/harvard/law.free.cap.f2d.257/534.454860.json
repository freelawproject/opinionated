Smith on January 12, 1949. Decedent\u2019s estate was valued at $1,027,940.53, and was made up principally of decedent\u2019s common stock holdings in the Addis Co., Inc., consisting of 2,480 shares of common stock valued at $868,000. There were 2,500 shares of said stock outstanding at the time of Smith\u2019s death. Smith\u2019s wife held 10 shares and a nephew who worked in the store held the remaining 10 shares. In 1949 the executors sold 200 shares of said stock to the Addis Co., Inc. for $57,-200. The transaction was arranged by the taxpayers who acted both as directors of the company and as executors of the estate. The corporate resolution recited that the stock acquired from the estate should be held in the corporate treasury and not be cancelled or redeemed. The said 200 shares so purchased by the company are still carried on the corporate books as treasury stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-16\">On its income tax return for 1949 the estate reported a capital gain of $43 as the result of the sale of said stock by the estate to the Addis Co., Inc. The Commissioner ruled that the $57,200 received by the estate was a distribution essentially equivalent to a dividend and was taxable at ordinary income rates, inasmuch as the company had earnings or profits of approximately $657,000. As a consequence, the Commissioner determined a deficiency of $40,103.82, which the estate later paid together with interest. The executors brought this suit to recover the total payment of $47,848.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>The District Court dismissed the complaint without submitting the case to the jury, holding that the distribution of $57,200 to the majority stockholders was essentially equivalent to a dividend under Section 115(g) of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Appellants contend that since the stock was held as treasury stock by the corporation there was no cancellation or redemption within the meaning of Section 115(g), and cite, in support of this proposition, Alpers v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1942, 126 F.2d 58, and Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Snite, 7 Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In Alpers v. Commissioner, supra [126 F.2d 60] the majority of this court, in determining under the factual situation in that case that the stock was not acquired for \u201cpurposes of cancellation,\u201d indicated that they made the following assumption :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-15\">\u201cIn any event the respondent has made no contention that the distinction between retired stock and treasury stock is not justified by the statute, and we shall assume that it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">Thereafter this court, in Kirschenbaum v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1946, 155 F.2d 23, 25, 170 A.L.R. 1389, certiorari denied 329 U.S. 726, 67 S.Ct. 75, 91 L. 628, cast some doubt on the previous ruling, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-18\">\u201cThe status of \u2018treasury shares\u2019 is in general not made perfectly clear in the books. Some courts treat them as though they were, so to say, in suspended animation \u2014 existing, but existing only in a kind of Limbo ; other courts treat them as though they were retired. Whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>they are to be treated as one or the other in the Internal Revenue Code, is not a priori wholly free from debate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">In Commissioner v. Suite, supra, stock was purchased by the corporation under a plan whereby it would be later resold to employees of the corporation. It was held that there was no cancellation or redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In Wall v. United States, 4 Cir., 1947, 164 F.2d 462, 465, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\u201cWe have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion in this case that the shares were redeemed in the statutory sense. * * * If it should be held that taxpayers can avoid the terms of the statute by the simple device of selling their stock to the corporation and having it held as treasury stock, the purpose of the statute to prevent the evasion of taxes upon corporate dividends would be completely frustrated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Succeeding cases have reached the conclusion that there is no distinction under Section 115(g) between stock cancelled and retired and stock purchased but held by the corporation as treasury stock without any plan or intention of reissuance. Boyle v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 1951, 187 F.2d 557, certiorari denied 342 U.S. 817, 72 S.Ct. 31, 96 L.Ed. 618; Keefe v. Cote, 1 Cir., 1954, 213 F.2d 651; Earle v. Woodlaw, 9 Cir., 1957, 245 F.2d 119, certiorari denied 354 U.S. 942, 77 S.Ct. 1400, 1 L.Ed.2d 1537.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In the instant case, when the corporation acquired the certificates of stock it had no definite plans for creating new stock obligations, and the said stock certificates are still in the corporate treasury. Clearly, by the simple expedient of holding the acquired stock in the corporation\u2019s treasury rather than retiring it, a taxpayer cannot obtain immunity from the operation of Section 115(g) of the Internal Revenue Code. Of course, where shares are purchased by a corporation under a plan to resell them, there is no cancellation or redemption within the meaning of Section 115(g). But that state of facts does not exist in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">Appellants next assert that there was a change in the proportionate ownership of the corporation by the various stockholders caused by the sale of the 200 shares of stock, and hence the distribution was not essentially equivalent to a taxable dividend. Prior to decedent\u2019s death he owned 2480 shares of common stock out of 2500 shares outstanding. His wife owned 10 shares and his nephew the remaining 10. Under the decedent\u2019s will 15% of his common stock-holdings were specifically bequeathed to his wife and 15% to his nephew; the remaining 70% passing under the residuary clause of the will to a trust for the benefit of his son. Therefore, after decedent\u2019s death and before the sale to the corporation, the beneficial stockholdings were 382 shares each for the wife and nephew (15.28% each), and 1736 shares for the residuary trust for the benefit of the son (69.44%). After the sale, the beneficial interest changed in that the residuary trust held 200 less shares, so that the proportionate interests in the outstanding stock became 16.61% each for the wife and the nephew, and 66.78% for the residuary trust. Appellants claim that this change in the ratio of ownership is so great as to show that the distribution was not essentially equivalent to a taxable dividend.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">However, even considering the beneficial interests of the legatees, we cannot conclude that the distribution resulted in any substantial change in ownership or control of the corporation. In addition there was no decrease, shrinkage or contraction in the business activities of the corporation. The transactions were carried out so that the executors of the estate would have the required funds to pay the estate tax. Furthermore, there is no dispute that large corporate earnings and profits were available and were in fact used for the distribution. The record shows that for at least six years before the stock purchase the corporation, in spite of large earnings, had paid no dividend on its common stock. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Boyle v. Commissioner, supra; Ferro v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 1957, 242. F.2d 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">From an examination of the transaction as a whole, we reach the conclusion that no \u201cdifferent results were produced by what was in form a partial liquidation from the results that would have been produced, under the circumstances, by a dividend.\u201d Northup v. United States, 2 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 304, 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Finally, appellants contend that the trial court was in error in not submitting this case to the jury. It appears clearly that there was no dispute concerning the operative facts. As this court stated in Northup v. United States, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201cWe think the question whether a partial liquidation is \u2018essentially equivalent\u2019 to a dividend, involving as it does the application of a statutory rule to found facts, is a question of law. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-6\">.
