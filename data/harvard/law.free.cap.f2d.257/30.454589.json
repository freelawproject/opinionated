Imposition of sentence was suspended for three years, and appellant was placed on probation. Early in 1949 he was brought before the Ohio court as a probation violator and was committed to the county jail for sixty days. The State now concedes that the court was not authorized to impose this jail sentence as a penalty for violation of probation. Later the same year the appellant was again brought before the Ohio court as a probation violator, and this time the court imposed a sentence which might have been imposed upon his original plea of guilty. There is no question but that under Ohio law this was an authorized penalty for violation of probation. It is this sentence which the appellant is now serving, and it is his contention that in imposing it the State of Ohio has placed him in double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-24\"> The order of the district court must be affirmed. We agree with the trial judge\u2019s reasoning that even though the sixty day sentence imposed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>charge of probation violation was unauthorized, \u201cnevertheless, petitioner\u2019s probation was not affected or terminated, and the court still had jurisdiction to impose an indeterminate sentence on April 21, 1949, for violation of probation.\u201d The appellant\u2019s present confinement does not, therefore, result from the violation of any Federally protected right.

State of Illinois, 356 U.S. 571, 78 S.Ct. 839, 2 L.Ed.2d 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
