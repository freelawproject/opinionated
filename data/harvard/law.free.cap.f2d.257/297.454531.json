Steen, covering 28 auto tire products in molds sold by The Grimes Company, a Texas manufacturer to Steen. Talcott sought possession of these molds from James P. Grace, the Trustee in Bankruptcy who, by his answer, admitted execution of the contract but denied that title had been reserved to Grimes, the vendor or Talcott, as assignee. After a hearing the Referee in Bankruptcy made findings of fact and conclusions of law and dismissed Talcott\u2019s petition for reclamation, with prejudice. The Referee found for the Trustee on the ground that under Texas statutory<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provisions 16 Vernon\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Annot.Civil Stats., c. 6, art. 5489-5490) \u201cthe reservation of title to chattels as security in a conditional sales contract is void as against the vendee\u2019s creditors unless the said instrument so executed is forthwith recorded in the county where the property is then situated.\u201d \u201cThat by reason of the non-recordation of said conditional sale contract in Dallas County, Texas, the reservation of title provided for in said contract is void.\u201d The district judge overruled Tal-cott\u2019s petition for review of the Referee\u2019s findings, affirmed his order, entered June 27, 1957, and this appeal followed. The district court ruled correctly and for that reason the salient facts can be adapted from the Referee\u2019s findings. In re Garden City Brewery, 7 Cir., 1954, 208 F.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Charles Steen did business as Steen Tire Distributors, Factory Outlet Tire Co. and Tire Jobbers Company in Chicago, Illinois, and was adjudicated a bankrupt on January 31, 1957. Grimes Company, located in Dallas, Texas, manufactures auto tire production molds. Steen paid $1602 to Grimes August 27, 1956, against a total time purchase price of $6683.64 for 28 molds produced by the seller at its Dallas factory. Shortly after September 5,1956 Steen in Chicago received, by mail, from Grimes in Dallas four copies of a conditional sale contract (See Appendix \u201cA\u201d to this opinion) and an installment promissory note for $5081.61, representing the balance on the purchase price. All of these documents were unsigned, dated September 5, 1956 and sent Steen for his signature. He signed all these papers, mailed them back to Grimes in Dallas, and, the latter in turn, posted a copy of the contract, signed \u201caccepted\u201d by Grimes, to Steen in Chicago. Grimes sold the Steen note and conditional sale contract for value, on October 2, 1956, to James Talcott, Inc., petitioner here, which is a New York corporation engaged in commercial financing, and having a Chicago office. The contract and note (See Appendix \u201cA\u201d) were printed forms prepared by Talcott and described as the property sold the 28 molds, each identified in the contract dated September 5, 1956, by model and serial number. It is expressly provided, under the terms of the contract, that the molds were \u201cto be located and kept for use at\u201d Steen\u2019s Chicago place of business; title and ownership of the molds to remain in Grimes, its successors or assigns, until payment of the purchase price and if Steen defaulted, or in the event of his bankruptcy, then Grimes could accelerate the maturity date of the purchase price balance and repossess the molds.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The subject matter of this contract, <em>i. e., </em>the 28 molds were in actual existence on or about September 5, 1956 and were situated in Dallas. There they remained until Grimes delivered them to a motor truck carrier, in four separate groups over a period of several weeks, for transportation to Steen at Chicago. On October 12, 1956, the first shipment-arrived in Chicago and the last shipment reached Steen sometime between October 29, 1956 and November 2, 1956. The contract contained no provision for the delivery of these molds.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">By its terms, the note was payable to the order of \u201cThe Grimes Company, Dallas, Texas, at 11th floor, 225 Fourth Avenue, New York 3, N. Y., or at such other place as the holder * * * may from time to time appoint * * \u2022*/&gt; There is no evidence that any place other than New York was appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The conditional sale contract was'recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds, Cook County, Illinois on October 15, 1956, roughly two weeks after Tal-cott became the assignee of this contract. No recordation of the contract was made in Dallas County, Texas. Steen defaulted on the installment due December 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>1956 and was given an extension to January 10, 1957. Because of this default, coupled with Talcott\u2019s petition, the entire balance of the purchase price, $4209.-70 as of January 31, 1957 became due and payable to Talcott.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The Trustee never had actual custody, possession or control of the molds. After Steen\u2019s bankruptcy Grimes delivered a letter, dated February 1, 1957, to Steen demanding that he surrender possession of the molds to a Grimes\u2019 nominee, C. &amp; S. Tire Company, Chicago, and Steen complied. The Referee, at this point, also found \u201cThat Grimes repossessed said molds for the benefit of Talcott to the extent that Talcott was then the owner and holder of the conditional sales contract and note and that Grimes\u2019 interest was as guarantor, even though there was no direct evidence that Tal-cott at that time knew about or authorized said repossession by Grimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The main question is which law is to prevail \u2014 Illinois or Texas recording laws. When he was ruling on the Referee\u2019s findings, the district judge observed: \u201cAlthough this Court may have taken a view opposite to that of the Illinois courts on the issue, it is bound by Illinois decisions and therefore must affirm the findings and order of the Referee.\u201d Neither the district judge nor referee cited any Illinois authorities and on appeal Talcott places heavy reliance on George v. Haas, 1924, 311 Ill. 382, 143 N.E. 54, while the Trustee rests his case, primarily, on Harrison v. State Bank of Hull, 1956, 11 Ill.App.2d 471, 138 N.E.2d 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Of course it is undisputed that these tire molds were in Dallas, Texas at the time when Steen signed the contract and note and when Grimes wrote \u201caccepted\u201d on that printed agreement. The conditional sale contract- is a device for protecting creditors whose lien flows with the chattel. But as Professor Beale long ago pointed out: \u201cWhether a sale of a chattel conditioned on the retention of title by the vendor is legally effective to keep title in the vendor depends upon the law of the place where the chattel was at the time of the sale.\u201d 2 Beale, Conflicts of Laws, \u00a7 272.2 (1935). George v. Haas is a, conflicts of law decision on issues involving usurious rate of interest on a promissory note and is inapposite here on the problem before us where the situs of the chattels involved were in Texas when the parties were signing the papers. On the other hand, Harrison v. State Bank of Hull, supra, was a suit for conversion of farm equipment sold under \u201cthe usual combination note and conditional sales contract,\u201d and is readily distinguishable from George v. Haas. The Illinois Appellate Court was clearly not, despite Talcott\u2019s tenuous arguments, overruling the Illinois Supreme Court in the earlier case, and the following view of the Appellate Court supports the decision in the current appeal [11 Ill.App.2d 471, 138 N.E.2d 44] :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQu\">\u201cReference is made in the briefs of counsel to cert\u00e1in statements appearing in the Restatement, Conflict of Laws. There, it is stated, that the rules, where there is a conflict of law, respecting conditional sales are analogous to the rules dealing with chattel mortgages. Section 273-278. Thus the general rule is stated to be that the validity and effect of a mortgage of a chattel are determined by the law of the state where the chattel is at the time when the mortgage is executed, Restatement, Conflict of Laws, Section 265, and by analogy, whether a conditional sale is effective to enable the vendor to retain title is determined by the law of the state where the chattel is at the time of the sale, Restatement, Conflict of Laws, Section 272. One exception is noted in the sections above, namely a situation where the conditional sales contract, <em>by its terms, </em>provides for delivery of the chattel by the vendor to the vendee before the transaction is complete, in which event the law of the state where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the contract is completed, <em>i. e., </em>where delivery is made, applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">\u201cThe contracts between plaintiff and Thomason were conditional saies contracts in Missouri and their validity is to be tested by the law of that state. To be valid against subsequent purchasers in good faith and creditors, the contracts were required to be recorded by the laws of Missouri. Failure to record these contracts in accordance with these statutory provisions is fatal to the seller\u2019s remedy against a citizen of our state who is within the specified class.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">The order appealed must be affirmed.

It is significant that appellant, in its petition for rehearing, does not challenge the correctness of that interpretation as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-21\">For these reasons, I have voted to deny appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
