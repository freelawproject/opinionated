Brazil, sued to recover damages allegedly sustained because of negligence and \u201cthe unsea-worthy condition of its vessel * * * in that [the defendant] failed to take proper precautions to protect the plaintiff from suffering severe injuries and damages at a time when she was disabled and unable to help herself and in failing to provide the plaintiff with adequate and proper medical attention when she came to be in need of the same\u201d (First Cause of Action, Compl. pars, Eighth and Tenth). A second cause of action sought maintenance and cure. The action against the defendants other than Moore-McCormack, Inc. was discontinued. The first cause of action was submitted to the jury which returned a verdict in favor of the defendant. The court decided the maintenance and cure cause of action, awarding plaintiff $360 (60 days at $6 a day).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">On appeal plaintiff limits her assignment of error to failure to furnish adequate medical care and to the alleged refusal of the trial court to give certain charges requested by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">The case is almost entirely factual. Plaintiff, a hair stylist, prior to her employment on the S.S. Brazil had been a patient at the United States Marine Hospital, Stapleton, Staten Island, suffering from amoebic dysentery. Pronounced \u201cfit for duty\u201d both by the hospital and defendant\u2019s doctor in April and May 1954, she made a thirty-eight day voyage on the cruise ship without 'event but on a second voyage became ill. She was examined by the ship's doctor and, preferring her own cabin to the ship\u2019s hospital, returned to bed there where the doctor again visited her. During the night while attempting to leave her bed plaintiff \u201cblacked out,\u201d fell against the wash basin and fractured her nose. She was given medical attention that day by the ship\u2019s doctor and the defendant\u2019s port doctor and on the following day was removed to the Strangers\u2019 Hospital in Rio de Janeiro. There she was treated for infectious hepatitis, jaundice and the fractured nose. Plaintiff remained in that hospital from May 28, 1954 until July 20, 1954 when she returned on the S.S. Brazil and was taken by ambulance to the same Marine Hospital on August 2. She remained there as an in-patient until September 11 but continued as an outpatient until November 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-17\">After November 9 plaintiff continued to revisit the Marine Hospital and received treatment for various ailments, none of which appeared to be due to any condition arising on the S.S. Brazil. There were nine visits between November 9, 1954 and March 14, 1955 primarily for eyes, sinuses and headaches. A clinical entry on March 14, 1955 describes \u201cmost of her difficulty [to be] on anxiety basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-18\">In March 1955 plaintiff took a part-time position for about a month. Between April 20, 1955 and July 2,1955 she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>made many visits to the Marine Hospital complaining of occipital headaches, fatig-ability, constipation and vision difficulties. Physical examinations revealed no liver or spleen abnormalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">In the beginning of July 1955 plaintiff accepted a position at the Schroon Manor Hotel where she worked from July 3 until August 15. She was hospitalized in Glens Falls for twelve days and after one more week at the hotel returned to her home. During September and October plaintiff again went to the Marine Hospital where she received further treatment as an in-patient. In October plaintiff resumed work as a hair stylist and continued until the end of December 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">In February 1956 plaintiff claims that she found a doctor who treated her for hepatitis and that under his care she improved rapidly.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s history of ailments has been quite extensive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-9\">\n<em>August 2-29, 1952 Brooklyn Jewish Hospital</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-10\">(chills and fever, sinus, headaches, diarrhea, abdominal swelling)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-11\"><em>March 1953 Mayo Clinic </em>\u2014 twelve <em>clays</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-12\"><em>August 24,1953-November 8,1958 Marine Hospital, Staten Island </em>(amoebiasis, history of diarrhea and constipation for five years)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-13\">\n<em>January 11,1954-February 8,1954 Marine Hospital</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-14\">(hysterectomy and appendectomy and treatment for various complaints)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-15\">\n<em>May 28, 1954-July 21, 1954 Strangers\u2019 Hospital, Bio de Janeiro</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-16\"><em>August 2,1954 </em>\u2014 September <em>11, 1954 Marine Hospital</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-17\">(in-patient)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-18\">\n<em>September 11,1954~November 9,1954 Marine Hospital</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-19\">(out-patient)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-20\">December 16, 1954 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaqo\">December 22, 1954 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayj\">January 7, 1955 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"asc-dedup-0\">January 20, 1955 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a6o-dedup-0\">February 3, 1955 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aui-dedup-2\">February 24, 1955 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsBC\">March 8, 1955 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a-x-dedup-0\">March 14, 1955 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuMf\">April 20, 1955 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlM5\">April 25, 1955 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxgH\">May 9, 1955 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AncQ\">May 23, 1955 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZs\">May 24, 1955 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_GR\">June 21, 1955 Marine Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-22\">\n<em>August 15-27,1955 Glens Falls Hospital</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-23\">(diagnosis ureter spasm, subsiding cystitis)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-24\">\n<em>September 12-20, 1955 Marine Hospital</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-25\">(diagnosis, genito-urinary observation; psycho-physiologic reaction)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-27\">Against this factual background appellant argues that \u201cafter November 14, 1954, the United States Marine Hospital refused to treat the condition of the plaintiff for infectious hepatitis\u201d (Applt.\u2019s Br., p. 6). The record discloses that subsequent to November 14, 1954 plaintiff made at least sixteen visits to the Marine Hospital and in September 1955 was given eight days of in-patient care. There is no basis whatsoever for her charge that after November 14 \u201cdefendants refused to provide it [treatment]\u201d (Applt.\u2019s Br., p. 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-29\"> Plaintiff next complains of an alleged refusal by the court to submit to the jury \u201cfailure of the defendants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>provide medical care and attention to the plaintiff for the period of time between November 10, 1954 and February 1956\u201d (Applt.\u2019s Br., p. 11).' This argument is equally without factual foundation. The trial court specifically submitted to the jury plaintiff\u2019s claim \u201cthat she was not provided with proper medical attention\u201d (87a). They were instructed that defendant was under a duty to provide treatment and that their burden amongst other things was \u201cto resolve the conflict * * * as to whether there was proper and reasonably good medical treatment\u201d (100a). The court adequately complied with plaintiff\u2019s request to charge that she was entitled to care subsequent to her leaving the ship \u201cno matter what her health was before the voyage\u201d (103a). Although parties are privileged to submit requests to charge the court is not required to deliver its charge in the very words chosen by the parties. If the law is fairly and accurately stated as it was here there is no error in the refusal to use the phraseology selected by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">In final analysis plaintiff\u2019s real grievance here is that the jury decided against her. Medical witnesses for the defendant testified as to the care and attention which plaintiff received. There was medical testimony that plaintiff\u2019s troubles from November 9, 1954 to November 27,1955 were not due to hepatitis and that plaintiff was not in need of treatment for this disease on November 7, 1955 when she was examined. Plaintiff\u2019s doctor testified to the contrary. Having seen and heard plaintiff and the various medical witnesses, the jury, after a comprehensive charge, returned a verdict in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">As to maintenance and cure the trial court on the basis of plaintiff\u2019s claim at the rate of $42 a week carefully calculated the periods during which plaintiff could properly be awarded damages. There has been no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
