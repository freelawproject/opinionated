The appellant is a World War I veteran and has been denied claimed compensation in connection with his army service. To process the appeal therefrom he requested the aid of Hymen Schlesinger, Esquire, of the Bar of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. On failing to secure the Veterans Administration\u2019s approval of a 40% contingent fee arrangement, his lawyer obtained a three-judge court upon the allegation that the enforcement of the statutory limitation of $10.00 for compensation to an attorney handling a veteran\u2019s claim denied the client the right to counsel and, therefore, was unconstitutional. The three-judge court dismissed the petition on the ground that no substantial constitutional question was presented. It then remanded <em>the case </em>to the district judge for further proceedings on nonconstitutional issues. The denial by the three-judge court was made the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court. This was dismissed on March 3, 1958, 355 U.S. 608, 78 S.Ct. 546, 2 L.Ed. 2d 525. The remanded case was decided against the appellant by the district judge and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">While the appellant has argued and the respondent replied to the argument on the question of the constitutionality of the $10.00 limitation, we think that this Court has neither authority nor responsibility to consider that issue. It was brought up before a three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2282 and 2284 and appeal as of right was taken to the Supreme Court following adverse decision. We think the Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal settles the matter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">On the nonconstitutional point, appellant urges that the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001-11, in its provision for representation of persons by counsel, id. \u00a7 1005(a), removes the limitation of the $10.00 fee as provided in the veterans\u2019 legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">This argument is wrong for two reasons. The first is the one pointed out by this Court in Securities and Exchange <em>Commission v. </em>Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, 3 Cir., 1953, 209 F.2d 44, 49, that section 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1011, expressly provides that: \u201cNothing in this Act shall be held *\u2022 * * to limit or repeal additional requirements imposed by statute or otherwise recognized by law.\u201d This point was emphasized by Judge Willson in his dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>trict court opinion, D.C.W.D.Pa.1957, 153 F.Supp. 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The second reason for the incorrectness of the appellant\u2019s position is that the provision attacked has been reenacted by Congress at a time later than the passage of the Administrative Procedure Act. As a result of the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act of 1957, which became effective January 1, 1958, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 102 is now 38 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 3604. The purpose of this reenactment was, in the words of the House report, \u201cTo consolidate into one act, and to simplify and make more uniform the laws on these subjects [veterans benefits] .\u201d See 2 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad. News P. 1214 (1957) (H.R.Rep. No. 279, 85th Cong., 1st Sess.).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-16\">.
