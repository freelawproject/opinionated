The facts are stated in Spevack v. Strauss, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 339, 248 F.2d 752, decided September 19, 1957. After that decision, appellant moved for leave to amend his complaint. We denied the motion and denied a petition for rehearing. The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari, </em>vacated our judgment and orders, and remanded the cause to us with instructions \u201c(1) to allow petitioner\u2019s proposed amendments to the complaint and (2) to determine, in light of the amended complaint, the issues raised by petitioner\u2019s appeal.\u201d Spevack v. Strauss, 355 U.S. 601, 78 S.Ct. 536, 2 L.Ed.2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-21\">The amended complaint says the proposed publication is unauthorized, and also that it would deprive appellant of property without compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The original complaint raised no constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u2022In our former opinion we pointed out that Congress has authorized this sort of publication. We now hold that the Constitution does not forbid the publication. In determining this issue we need not pass upon appellant\u2019s contention that the publication will be a taking of his property for which compensation must be paid. For the Court of Claims has \u201cjurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution or any Act of Congress. * * *\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (Supp. V). \u201cWhere the action against which specific relief is sought is a taking or holding of the\" plaintiffs\u2019 property, the availability of a suit for compensation against the sovereign will defeat a contention that the action is unconstitutional as a violation of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 697, footnote 18, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628. \u201c[I]f the authorized action in this instance does constitute a taking of property for which there must be just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, the Government has impliedly promised to pay that compensation and has afforded a remedy \u2019 for its recovery by a suit in the Court of Claims. * * * '\u2018The Fifth Amendment does not entitle * * * [the owner] to be paid in advance of the taking\u2019 and the statute affords a plain and adequate remedy. * * * Yearsley v. W. A. Ross Construction Co., 309 U.S. 18, 21, 60 S.Ct. 413, 84 L.Ed. 554; United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256, 66 S.Ct. 1062, 90 L.Ed. 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Appellant\u2019s amended complaint therefore fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted. By Rule 15(c), F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C., the \u201camendment relates back to the date of the original pleading.\u201d Accordingly we treat the appeal as though the amended complaint had been filed in the District Court. The case is remanded to that court with instructions to dismiss the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Remanded..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
