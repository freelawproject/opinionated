On September 6, 1956, we set aside a Commission order affirming that grant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the basis of the Commission\u2019s findings, we held that (1) the modification resulted in \u201ca curtailment of service to the Spartanburg area which, unless outweighed by other factors, is not in the public interest,\u201d 99 U.S.App.D.C. at page 96, 237 F.2d at page 577; and (2) Spartan \u201cmisrepresented material facts concerning its proposal,\u201d which \u201cmispresentation was calculated, deliberate and not insignificant.\u201d Ibid. We added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-18\">\u201cBut we have no way of determining from the record whether service curtailment may be outweighed by other factors pointing toward, rather than away from, public interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As we have said, such a question is for the Commission\u2019s consideration, as is also the question whether in-tervenor\u2019s misrepresentation so far deprives it of reliability as to disqualify it as a licensee. For consideration of those questions, the case is remanded to the Commission.\u201d 99 U.S.App.D.C. at pages 93-97, 237 F. 2d at pages 577-578.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-19\">On July 18, 1957, the Commission, after reconsideration of the case on remand, reaffirmed its grant of the modifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>cation permit. From that action the present appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The Service Curtailment Question</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The first factor found by the Commission to outweigh the curtailment of service resulting from the modification was that the availability of a network affiliation at the new location assured the community that Spartan would actually commence operation. The Commission referred to the following observation it had made two years earlier in another proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">\u201cAt this stage in the development of the television industry, network programming is essential to the profitable operation of most stations; and, <em>in many instances, </em>its availability <em>may be </em>determinative of a station\u2019s ability to survive and furnish a needed television service to the public. The obtaining of network programs is such a vital and valuable asset to stations that we believe maximum opportunity should be given to all stations to compete for network programming.\u201d * * [Report and Order released June 24, 1955, In the Matter of Amendment of Sections 3.685(b) of the Commission\u2019s Rules and Regulations, 12 Pike &amp; Fischer Radio Reg. 1537 (emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">That network availability <em>may </em>determine <em>in many instances </em>whether a station will survive does not, of course, mean that it determines whether a particular station will commence operation. The Commission\u2019s general observation about the industry is, therefore, insufficient basis, standing alone, for a finding that Spartan\u2019s commencement of operations depended upon changing its transmitter site. And the observation does stand alone, for, as the Commission stated, \u201cThe record herein is silent as to whether Spartan would have commenced operation without a network affiliation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">The second countervailing factor the Commission found was that, as a result of the modification, many persons in the coverage area would receive CBS network programs for the first time and other, already receiving CBS programs from other stations, would receive them on a stronger signal. The Commission has heretofore held that network programming is not so significant a factor as to warrant a preference in a comparative proceeding in favor of an applicant proposing to carry it as against one who proposes only locally originating programs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yet, if it now holds here that the value of network programming is such as to justify curtailing a station\u2019s coverage, that is a conclusion within its competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">But, even if availability of a network affiliation outweighs curtailment of coverage, whether this modification was in the public interest depends additionally, as we said on the last appeal, upon \u201cwhether a network other than CBS might be available without a change, and whether a CBS affiliation necessitated lowering both power and antenna height, as well as relocating the transmitter.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By making no findings as to these additional matters, the Commission has ignored them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-14\">Perhaps the record would support a finding that no network affiliation would be available to Spartan at the original transmitter site. It may be, also, that a finding could be made that other network services would have less value to the community than CBS because they would be more duplicative of existing services. But these are matters for findings by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Commission and the Commission has made no such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The Misrepresentation Question</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We left it for the Commission to conclude on remand whether Spartan\u2019s \u201ccalculated, deliberate and not insignificant\u201d misrepresentation \u201cso far deprives it of reliability as to disqualify it as a licensee.\u201d The clear implication of our remand was that the Commission could properly conclude that a given misrepresentation, although \u201ccalculated, deliberate and not insignificant,\u201d was excusable. The Commission\u2019s conclusion, of course, was to be based on findings supported by available evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The Commission concluded that Spartan\u2019s misrepresentation did \u201cnot so far deprive it of reliability as to disqualify it as a licensee.\u201d This conclusion was based on the Commission\u2019s determination that Spartan was not guilty of \u201cwillful deception.\u201d To say that a \u201ccalculated, deliberate\u201d misrepresentation is not \u201cwillful\u201d is a contradiction in terms. The Commission's determination that Spartan was not guilty of willful misrepresentation is, therefore, not a valid finding supporting the conclusion of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">We do not hold now, as we did not on the last appeal, that Spartan is disqualified. But if its willful, calculated and deliberate misrepresentation is to be excused, some reason must appear. Since Spartan has for some time been the licensee of a standard broadcast station and an FM station, it may have a record of past reliability and candor to be considered by the Commission together with other circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">The service curtailment resulting from the modification of Spartan\u2019s permit still remains unjustified by countervailing factors. Spartan\u2019s misrepresentation still remains as an unexcused bar to qualification. The order appealed from, reaffirming the modification, must be set aside and the case once more remanded to the Commission for its determination of the justifiability of the service curtailment and the excusability of the misrepresentation. If the Commission deems it advisable to reopen the record to recieve new evidence, for example as to Spartan\u2019s past record as a licensee, it may do so. As to any new matters introduced in such reopened proceedings, it is assumed that all the parties to the case will be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">In No. 14018, appellant seeks an order requiring the Commission, in effect, to take Spartan off the air pending the final outcome of the proceedings on the modification permit. We dealt with that issue in our order of June 4, 1957, in No. 13231. We now adhere to the position we then took. In taking that position, we assumed that the Commission would \u201cproceed as expeditiously as possible to carry out [our] mandate of September 6, 1956. * * * \u201d In adhering to that position, we make a like assumption as to our present mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">The Commission\u2019s order dated July 18, 1957 (released July 22, 1957) is set aside and the case remanded to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-12\">.

We pointed out, for example, that, if the Commission had recognized the service curtailment, \u201cit could then have considered whether the value to the community of a network affiliation outweighed the curtailment of coverage, whether a network other than CBS might be available without a change, and whether a OBS affiliation necessitated lowering both power and antenna height, as well as relocating the transmitter.\u201d 99 U.S.App.D.C. at page 91, 237 F.2d at page 572.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\">.

It appears that Spartan is now operating at an effective radiated power of 257 kw, rather than the 200 kw authorized in the modification. But this does not yet aproach the 316 kw authorized in the original construction permit. The antenna height, originally 2,000 feet and modified to 1,182 feet, remains at the latter figure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b695-15\">FAHY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ah-M\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-17\">As to the misrepresentation, we decided when the case was here before, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 86, 237 F.2d 567, that, though calculated, deliberate, and not insignificant, the misrepresentation did not automatically result in disqualification. We left to the Commission on remand to decide whether or not it so far deprived Spartan of reliability as to disqualify it as a licensee. The Commission, on the remand, considered that the misrepresentation was not a willful deception since it had to do with the \u201cindecision\u201d of Spartan at the time it requested the temporary authorization at Hogback; that is, the Commission does not read into the misrepresentation \u201ca deliberate desire to commit wrong.\u201d The Commission concludes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-18\">\u201c[W]hile Spartan\u2019s misrepresentation is not to be condoned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>nature of its misrepresentation and the facts surrounding it do not so far deprive it of reliability as to disqualify it as a licensee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">It is quite true that the characterization by the Commission of the misrepresentation as not willful is inconsistent with our previous characterization of it as calculated and deliberate; but notwithstanding this I do not think we should consider the Commission\u2019s decision on remand as intended to evade our decision but as a good faith conclusion that the misrepresentation was not such wrongful conduct as to disqualify Spartan.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
