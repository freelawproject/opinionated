(28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-27\">A fire occurred on December 20, 1954, on and in the Los Angeles premises occupied by appellant. Judgment was recovered on the first policy (No. 12073, insuring against loss of damage by fire to stock and merchandise) in the sum of $56,309.66, without interest or costs, and on the second policy (No. 11944, insuring against loss of equipment located on those premises) in the sum of $36,-223.66, without interest or costs \u2014 or a total of $92,533.32. Appellee was awarded its costs, taxed at $359.72. Appellant, dissatisfied with the judgment, appeals, and relies on five alleged errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-28\">(1) The court erred in holding the appraisers appointed acted within, and did not exceed their authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-29\">(2) The court erred in holding that the policies covered all goods and equipment owned by appellant, and that coverage was not limited to the street number addresses listed on the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-30\">(3) The court erred in holding that certain goods and equipment stored elsewhere were not considered by the appraisers.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>(4) The court erred in holding buildings described by street numbers and \u201cdesignating areas covered by the policies,\u201d had no meaning or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">(5) The court erred in not allowing appellant interest on the sums awarded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">I. The Conflicting Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AMA\">Appellant apparently fails to realize that the first four alleged errors relate to findings made by the trial court which were based on disputed questions of fact. Appellant repeatedly refers to evidence which, if believed, would substantiate its position. It emphasizes that some of this testimony favorable to it was un-contradicted. But neither of these factors is enough to justify a reversal here. In its constant reference to the favorable testimony, it overlooks and nowhere refers to the unfavorable or contradictory testimony in the record. Nowhere does appellant attempt to point out a total lack of evidence to support any finding of fact made by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We are faced with the elementary rule of law embodied in our Court rules that the findings of the trial court are presumptively correct and will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 28 U.S.C. Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc., v. Linde Air Products Co., 1949, 336 U.S. 271, 69 S.Ct. 535, 93 L.Ed. 672. That same rule cautions us, as an appellate court, that due regard shall be given to the opportunity resting with the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses and to appraise the significance of conflicting testimony. Such admonition is particularly apposite here for two reasons. First, the trial court made a personal visit to the insured\u2019s premises to observe the physical plant; to note how the dog-food processing plant operated; and, after viewing it, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">\u201c * * * I am holding as a matter of fact that this policy covers the entire plant [and not merely the premises designated by street numbers in the policy]. I don\u2019t think there is any way you can get away from that.\u201d [Tr. p. 444.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">The trial judge then gave his reasons for such finding of fact, including the forceful observation that there existed conveyor belts extending through the walls of some buildings which \u201cconnect [ed] the entire plant together.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">Secondly, the matters urged upon us as improper findings manifestly depend upon conflicting testimony. For example, appellant strenuously urges that the amount found by the court as the value of the property insured on the 30th day of November, 1954, $346,422.66,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> must have been based upon an original figure of $418,509.14 for stock on hand, less $72,-000 worth of stock stored at the El Monte plant, and did not take into consideration the approximately $187,000 in stock allegedly stored outside the state of California which would have resulted in insurable stock at the plant worth approximately $159,000. The court was required to accept this figure, says appellant, and it was error not to do so. Yet defendant introduced testimony that two certified public accountants had determined the actual value of the stock as of November 30, 1954 at the various Los Angeles buildings covered by the policy, to be (after deducting the El Monte stock) $325,022.25. They did not take the Honeyville, Utah stock of $21,-000 into consideration originally, nor the lump storage of $2,964, nor the barley in Utah, nor any goods in outside locations except El Monte. The defendant relied on the testimony of public insurance adjuster Greenspan, who had determined the actual cash value of the stock of goods on hand on November 30, 1954 as $148,509.14. This did not include anything outside the plant. Despite this testimony in the record, which was based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>on an auditor\u2019s examination of appellant\u2019s available books, ledgers and records (some of which had been destroyed in the fire), appellant attacks the witnesses\u2019 conclusions as erroneous because those same books, ledgers and records showed various amounts of stock stored in Utah and at the Federal Warehouse in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"> We would be the first to agree that the record in this case is in some areas confusing and contradictory. The trial court\u2019s patience was near the breaking point (Tr. pp. 352-357). Yet he patiently heard all the testimony, then re-opened the case to hear further testimony from appellant which had been originally ruled out. He physically viewed the premises. After study, the court came to a conclusion. Having had the opportunity to observe the various witnesses, he concluded that appellant \u201chad failed to establish that any improper matters were considered by the appraisers.\u201d The memorandum opinion of the trial court clearly shows the basis for this factual determination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The appellee was the prevailing party below, and hence we must take that view of the evidence most favorable to it, just as we must take the view most favorable to the appellant in interpreting the insurance policies involved. Appellee is entitled to the benefit of all favorable inferences from the facts proved relative to the amount of the property insured. If, when so viewed, there was substantial evidence to sustain the findings then the judgment, may not be reversed by this Court unless against the clear weight of the evidence, or unless influenced by an erroneous view of the law. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Cohen, 9 Cir., 1958, 254 F.2d 417; United States v. First Trust Co. of St. Paul, 8 Cir., 1958, 251 F.2d 686; Ellison v. Frank, 9 Cir., 1957, 245 F.2d 837; Vidales v. Brownell, 9 Cir., 1954, 217 F.2d 136. There was much evidence to support the factual conclusions of the trial court, and we see no reason to disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">II. Policy Provisions and Findings</p>\n<p id=\"Axu\">The policy involving the loss of goods and merchandise contained a \u201cValue Reporting Clause\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u201cFull Reporting Clause.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The last report of value made by appellant in accordance with said contract provision was made on December 18,1954, reporting the values of the property insured under said policy as of November 30, 1954 to be $132,000. The-court found the value of the property specified in the policy as insured, on that, same date of November 30, 1954, to be-$346,442.66 (Finding III). The fire damage was $187,228.59 (Finding VI). The formula used by the court to determine what the insurer was obligated to pay,, is found in Finding VII;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">\u201cThat by reason of the provisions of the said policy above quoted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Plaintiff, by reason of said damage by fire, became entitled to recover from Defendant not to exceed that proportion of said loss or damage as the amount reported by Plaintiff to Defendant as the actual cash value of the property insured as of November 30th, 1954, to wit: $132,-000.00 bore to the actual cash value of the said property as of the date for said report, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\">$132,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">$346,442.66 or $346,442.66' of $187,-228.59, or the sum of $71,359.76.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Salvage was next considered in Finding VIII,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and credited in accordance with the policy provisions. The net amount so found due was found to have been promptly tendered by appellee to appellant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These findings are not attacked by appellant, except for the last.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">III. The Failure to Award Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Appellant\u2019s fifth error relied upon is the failure of the trial court to award interest. The court failed to award interest becouse it found, as noted above, that the amount due appellant by appellee had been timely tendered by ap-pellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">The parties stipulated that \u201ctender was made as alleged in (defendant\u2019s) answer.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The answer recited a tender of $56,309.67 on the first cause of action<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and $36,223.66 on the second.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These were the precise respective sums awarded to appellant totaling $92,533.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-18\">Appellant cites three cases in support of this point, none of which controls. Thus, Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York v. Wells Fargo Bank, 9 Cir., 1936, 86 F.2d 585, 588, is not applicable, for there the tender was in a lesser amount than that ultimately found due. Appellant cites the case of Sanitary Farm Dairies v. Gammel, 8 Cir., 1952, 195 F.2d 106, for the general rule that when defendant attempts by pleading to prevent plaintiff from obtaining any recovery, the tender is not effective to stop interest. That valid rule is not here applicable, because defendant in answering both the first and second cause of action contained in plaintiff\u2019s complaint admitted there were due the sums found due (Tr. pp. 15, 16, 18) and tendered the same. In addition, ap-pellee raised as a separate defense to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>second cause of action only the defense of misrepresentation. Nor was the tender here made <em>conditional, </em>and hence the cited case of Maryland Casualty Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., 9 Cir., 1942, 119 F.2d 672, is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The law of California is controlling (Concordia Ins. Co. of Milwaukee v. School District, 1931, 282 U.S. 545, 51 S.Ct. 275, 75 L.Ed. 528) and is found in California Civil Code sections 1504 and 3287, California Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 2074, and such cases as Lineman v. Schmid, 1948, 32 Cal.2d 204, 195 P.2d 408; Happoldt v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 1949, 90 Cal.App.2d 386, 203 P.2d 55, and, National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., v. California Cotton Credit Corp., 9 Cir., 1935, 76 F.2d 279, 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">. Statement made by the court below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV0Q\">\u201cOriginally those buildings were probably separate buildings but now they have all been united into one plant and I think under the terms of the policy <em>* * * everything in that </em>plant is covered by the policy.\u201d [Tr. p. 446.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ahz\">. Finding III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b593-6\">. \u201cThis action is brought to recover damages and is based upon two separate policies of insurance covering plaintiffs property which was partially destroyed by fire. The parties were unable to agree on the amount due under the policies, and pursuant to the terms of the contract submitted the controversy to appraisers, who selected an umpire, and returned an award. Defendant insurance company tendered this amount, which was refused by plaintiff hence this litigation. This is the usual case whore a plaintiff under reporting policies fails to make accurate reports and then in case of a loss finds itself without full <em>protection.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AII\">\u201cThe policies contained identical provisions for submission to appraisers of controversies over amounts due under the policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADqJ\">\u201c \u2018Appraisal. In case the insured and this company shall fail to agree as to the actual cash value or the amount of loss, then, on written demand of either, each shall select a competent and disinterested appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within 20 days of such demand. The appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire; * * *. The appraisers shall then appraise the loss, stating separately actual cash value and loss to each item; and, failing to agree, shall submit their differences, only, to the umpire. An award in writing, so itemized, of any two when filed with this company shall determine the amount of actual cash value and loss * * *.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a6f-dedup-0\">\u201cThe first policy contained a full-reporting or so-called \u2018honesty\u2019 clause, which limits recovery to that proportion of the loss which the last reported value bears to the actual cash value of the property covered. The second policy contained an average clause which limited recovery to the proportion of the loss which the face value of the policy bears to the actual value of the property at time of loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abt-dedup-0\">\u201cThe, controversy over both policies is the same and relates solely to the accuracy of the appraisers\u2019 estimate of the actual cash value of the property covered at the time of loss. Plaintiff asserts that the figure is substantially too high, thus resulting in a reduced recovery under the above clauses. Having heard the testimony of the appraisers, I have concluded and am satisfied that they performed their duties with great care and deliberation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alu-dedup-0\">\u201cPlaintiff contends that the award should be set aside on the grounds that the appraisers exceeded the limits of the submission agreement by including in the actual cash value property not covered by the insurance contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9h\">\u201cThe premises involved are a dog food cannery. The policy by its terms covers \u2018801-805-817 E. 18th St. and 1701 Griffith St., Los Angeles, California.\u2019 The mailing address and main entrance are 817 E. 18th <em>St </em>and the promises are usually known as 817 E. 18th St. Prom the outside the structure appears to be one large building, and is used as such and each unit is connected by a conveyor belt. On the inside the building contains several semi-separate units, which have been assigned by the city different street numbers, including some not listed in the policy. The appraisers considered all <em>the property in the </em>building in arriving at the actual cash value. Plaintiff contends that only the property located in the units whose addresses appear on the policy should have been considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al2\">\u201cThe court, having viewed the premises and having heard testimony as to the operation of the plant, is of the opinion that the entire plant is one integrated unit. This is admitted by plaintiff. The policies in question covered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>entire premises and not just the addresses listed on the policy. In fact, the street numbers encircled the entire plant. There was thus no error by the appraisers in fixing the actual cash value to include all property located throughout the building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aue-dedup-0\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s second attack on the award is that property located in certain outside warehouses was erroneously included in the actual cash value. It is true that such would not properly be in-cludable in determining actual cash value under the terms of the policies. But plaintiff has failed to establish that any improper matters were considered by the appraisers. The rule is well settled that every reasonable intendment is in favor of an award made by appraisers who have acted pursuant to the terms of a clause in a policy such as is involved here. [Aetna Ins. Oo. v. Hefferlin, 9 Cir., 260 F. 695; Lundblade v. Continental Ins. Co., D.C.Cal., 74 F.Supp. 795], Plaintiff has failed to establish any facts which would justify this court in finding that the appraisers had violated the terms of the submission agreement. On the contrary, the evidence shows that nothing in the outside warehouses was considered by the appraisers in determining the actual cash value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ankq\">\u201cIt is hereby ordered that plaintiff recover the amount awarded by the appraisers in the sum of $92,533.33, which the parties agreed was in accordance with the formula set forth in the policies, without interest, defendant to recover costs. Defendant will prepare findings in accordance with the rules of this court.\u201d [Tr. pp. 25-28.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"aiu-dedup-1\">. \u201cValue Reporting Clause: (a) It is a condition of this policy that the insured shall report to this company on the last day of each calendar month of the policy term, the exact location of all property covered hereunder, the actual cash value of such property at each location and the amount of specific insurance in force at each location, all as of the last day of that month.
