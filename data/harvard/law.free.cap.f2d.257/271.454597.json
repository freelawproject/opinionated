There were four specific counts in two separate indictments, returned December 14, 1955, charging petitioner-appellant with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 by aiding, abetting, counseling, commanding and procuring certain named individuals to transport in interstate commerce, from the State of Indiana to the State of Ohio, certain falsely made, forged, altered, and counterfeited checks, each payable to one Howard Wheeler. Each check was drawn against the Cleveland Trust Company Terminal Office, Cleveland, Ohio, account of the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad Company. The same district judge who sentenced petitioner on his (LaFever\u2019s) plea of guilty to these counts sustained respondent Government\u2019s motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition without a hearing, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-22\">Section 2255, provides in part relevant, here: <em>\u201cUnless </em>the motion and the files and records of the case <em>conclusively </em>show that prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.\u201d Of course, a plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>of guilty, while admitting all non-jurisdictional facts contained in the indictment cannot be taken as an admission or waiver of jurisdictional facts. Martyn v. United States, 8 Cir., 1949, 176 F.2d 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In his <em>pro se </em>pleadings below petitioner alleged, in substance, that, at common law \u201cthere is no \u2018forgery\u2019 where an individual presents himself to a person cashing a check as \u2018John Doe,\u2019 and proceeds to cash the instrument signing a \u2018John Doe\u2019 name .... (petitioner) and \u201chis co-defendants did sign \u2018John Doe\u2019 names, such names being an alias and not purporting to represent any person other than that [sic] the co-defendants and the movant himself, it is urged that no crime of \u2018forgery\u2019 existed * * * that in the presence of each person who cashed one of the aforementioned checks, the co-defendants represented ther [sic] selves to be the \u2018John Doe,\u2019 and so signed, the very presence of the persons aiorementioned, thus the original and the counter-signature on each check did in no way purport to be the signature of any persons other than the movant and his co defendants who was in effect \u2018John Doe.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Bearing in mind, petitioner as a layman is trying to explain that he signed a fictitious name to the checks in question and when they were cashed, he, the petitioner represented himself as the person whose signature appeared on the cheeks and did not represent that the signatures were of anyone other than himself, it is apparent the attack goes to the jurisdiction, of the trial court to entertain a plea of guilty under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. See e. g. Greathouse v. United States, 4 Cir., 1948, 170 F.2d 512; United States v. Greever, D.C.1953, 116 F. Supp. 755. But whether forgery was the offense need not, cannot now be decided on this record without findings of fact and conclusions of law entered below. Indeed the question whether petitioner was entitled to a hearing, by force of \u00a7 2255 is the critical .issue before us. If \u00a7 2255 procedure is to be adequate and effective in this case the order of dismissal must be set aside and the cause remanded for hearing. United States v. Hayman, 1952, 342 U.S. 205, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Court appointed counsel Herbert B. Olfson, merits the Court\u2019s acknowledgment for the professional services he rendered the petitioner without compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The order appealed is reversed and the cause is remanded for a hearing under and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
