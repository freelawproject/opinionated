In 1956 they filed motions to vacate the sentences upon the ground that their pleas of guilt had been coerced. These appeals followed the district court\u2019s denial of the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-22\">In denying the motions the district court correctly pointed out: \u201cThe transcript of the record demonstrates conclusively that the petitioners were carefully interrogated by the District Judge with respect to the offense; that a competent attorney was appointed to represent them; that they discussed their offense freely, openly and voluntarily; that they were fully aware of their rights; and that they freely admitted their guilt, in effect stating that they expected to receive a severe sentence. No intimation whatever was made by them to the effect that they had been coerced into pleading guilty or that the plea of guilty did not represent the exercise of their own free will and judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-23\">There is another and even more cogent reason why the motions were properly denied. At the time of the district court\u2019s order the appellants had completed service of the sentences to which their motions were directed. \u201c[T]he right to relief under [28 U.S. C.A.] Sec. 2255 is limited by the express terms of the statute to situations where the prisoner is attacking the judgment under which he is in custody and, if successful, would be entitled to be released.\u201d Duggins v. United States, 6 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 479, at page 484. \u201cIf a prisoner has already served the sentence which he is attacking by a proceeding under Sec. 2255, he is not in cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>tody under that sentence and cannot maintain the proceeding.\u201d Id., at page 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
