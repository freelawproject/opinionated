The United States claims full ownership. The question is highly debatable. Because we think it cannot be decided in a suit in which the United States is not a party, we do not reach it. The United States is not being sued and has not consented to be sued. We think the District Court was therefore right in entering summary judgment for the Secretary. Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628; cf. Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731, 737-738, 67 S.Ct. 1009, 91 L.Ed. 1209. If the Secretary were violating a plain legal duty in regard to the lands, the case might be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
