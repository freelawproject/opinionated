We think this interpretation not unreasonable: it is consistent with procedure sanctioned when a trial judge grants a \u201cmotion for a new trial\u201d under Rule 59(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Even though the opinion several times spoke of a \u201cnew trial\u201d and remanded \u201cfor a new trial on the valuation of the condemned property,\u201d it also noted that the \u201cnew trial\u201d was necessary only because of the exclusion of the September sale and thus might be deemed to imply that the proceedings on remand need go no further than to expand the record by proofs as to the September sale and a redetermination of the value on the record thus enlarged. This interpretation was obviously in harmony with considerations of expedition and of economy in judicial administration. Cf. United States v. City of New York, 2 Cir., 165 F.2d 526. And the practice which it envisaged had previously been utilized in this circuit. United States v. Brooklyn Union Gas Co., 168 F.2d 393 ; United States v. 25.4 Acres of Land, D. C., 83 F.Supp. 433; Gulbenkian v. Gulbenkian, 147 F.2d 173; Riordan v. Ferguson, 147 F.2d 983. If the defendants, when first informed of the Judge\u2019s ruling, had promptly applied to the panel of this court which had handed down the former opinion for a clarification, cf. National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications, 2 Cir., 198 F.2d 927, it is highly likely, especially in view of the cases just above cited, that Judge Inch\u2019s interpretation of the mandate would have been approved. In view of all the foregoing, we dispose of the defendants\u2019 principal ground of appeal by sustaining Judge Inch\u2019s action in limiting the scope of the proceedings on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">Other grounds of appeal are still less tenable. In view of the limited scope of the proceedings, we think the celerity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>with which the hearing was scheduled and held was not improper. The denial of the motion for trial by jury first made after the remand was not erroneous. And we find no error in denying on July 3, 1957 the other requests in the defendants\u2019 motion of June 28, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
