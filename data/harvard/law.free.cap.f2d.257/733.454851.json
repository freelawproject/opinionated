His brother, Vincent Dellaripa, was appointed administrator of Alfred\u2019s estate and, on March 8, 1955, commenced the present action under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 51 et seq., claiming damages under \u00a7 51 for Alfred\u2019s death and under \u00a7 59 for the injuries he suffered. The jury returned a verdict of $2,500 for the claim under \u00a7 51 and $22,500 for the claim under \u00a7 59. Defendant\u2019s motions for judgment n. o. v. or, in the alternative, for a new trial, were denied by the trial judge and this appeal ensued. Upon the appeal, the \u00a7 51 award is unchallenged, but the defendant contends that the \u00a7 59 award must be reversed because the cause of action thereunder abated during the pendency of the action and because the amount of the verdict is so excessive as to be \u201cmonstrous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The contention that the \u00a7 59 cause of action abated is based upon the fact that Frank Dellaripa, Alfred\u2019s father and nearest surviving relative, died after commencement of the action and prior to trial. Since the action could be maintained only for Frank\u2019s benefit, Chicago, B <em>&amp; </em>Q. R. Co. v. Wells-Dickey Trust Co., 1927, 275 U.S. 161, 48 S.Ct. 73, 72 L.Ed. 216, the defendant, though conceding that the cause of action under \u00a7 51 did not abate with his death, Van Beeck v. Sabine Towing Co., 1937, 300 U.S. 342, 57 S.Ct. 452, 81 L.Ed. 685, nevertheless contends that the \u00a7 59 cause did abate when Frank died. To this contention, the plaintiff replies only that under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105 this court lacks jurisdiction to reverse the judgment below on the ground that the action abated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are clear that this challenge to our jurisdiction is without merit. Section 2105 relates to matters which are quite different than those raised by this appeal. See Snyder v. Buck, 1950, 340 U.S. 15, 32, 71 S.Ct. 93, 95 L.Ed. 15 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); Bowles v. Wilke, 7 Cir., 1949, 175 F.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">Turning to the merits of defendant\u2019s claim we discover that apparently the only case squarely on point is Rogers v. Fort Worth &amp; D. C. Ry. Co., Tex.Civ.App.1936, 91 S.W.2d 458, in which the Texas court held that causes of action under both \u00a7\u00a751 and 59 abated when the sole beneficiary of the action died during its pendency. The court reasoned that inasmuch as the sole beneficiary could no longer benefit from a recovery, the congressional purpose of limiting recovery to designated classes would be frustrated by allowing recovery for the benefit of the deceased beneficiary\u2019s estate. However, at least insofar as the \u00a7 51 cause of action is concerned, Rogers was overruled by the U. S. Supreme Court in Van Beeck v. Sabine Towing Co., supra. In that case, the Court held that the death of the sole beneficiary during the pendency of an action under \u00a7 51 did not abate the cause of action and that recovery might be had on behalf of the deceased beneficiary\u2019s estate for such loss as the beneficiary sustained during her lifetime. Inasmuch as the deceased employee had died at once upon the sinking of the vessel upon which he had been employed, no \u00a7 59 claim was before the Court, and decision upon the issue of whether a cause of action under that section abated with the death of the sole beneficiary was expressly reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">It is difficult to discern any reason why a cause of action under \u00a7 59 should abate upon the death of the sole beneficiary when a \u00a7 51 cause of action does not. Both sections, though end<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>bracing distinct claims, St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. Ry. Co. v. Craft, 1915, 237 U.S. 648, 35 S.Ct. 704, 59 L.Ed. 1160, are rooted in dissatisfaction with the two common law rules that the death of an injured person extinguishes the cause of action that he had during his lifetime for his personal injury; and that no cause of action exists at all for a death resulting from a wrongful act. To suggest, therefore, as does the defendant, that \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 59 are to be treated differently because the former creates a \u201cproperty\u201d right while the latter creates a \u201cpersonal\u201d right is merely \u201cperpetuation of a policy which now has had its day.\u201d Van Beeck v. Sabine Towing Co., supra, 300 U.S. at page 351, 57 S.Ct. at page 456. Whatever may be the persuasiveness of the Rogers decision as an original matter, the identity<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the relevant language in \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 59 and the close relationship between the purpose served by both of them indicates that when, during the pendency of an action, the sole beneficiary of a deceased employee dies, no purpose would be served by holding that a \u00a7 59 cause of action abates while a \u00a7 51 cause of action retains vitality. Consequently, we hold that the death of the decedent\u2019s father during the pendency of the case did not terminate the plaintiff administrator\u2019s right of recovery. Continuation of the action for the benefit of the father\u2019s estate was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">After the jury returned its verdict, the defendant moved in the trial court to set aside as excessive the award of damages for the \u00a7 59 claim, a contention which is renewed before us on appeal. The trial judge, though observing that the jury\u2019s award was perhaps higher than another trier of fact, including himself, would have awarded, concluded that the jury verdict should not be set aside as excessive in view of the extreme nature of the decedent\u2019s injuries, his consequent pain largely unalleviated by drugs, and his apprehension that his leg would have to be amputated. Assuming, without so deciding, that we have the power to review the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in this particular, we cannot find that under the circumstances of this case he abused his discretion by denying a new trial. Particularly in a case such as this, where the amount of the award is necessarily a determination that cannot be reached with exactitude, some leeway must be granted the jury. Surely the trial court has the power to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict if he believes that it is excessive, but obviously that power must be exercised with due regard for the jury\u2019s primary responsibility to fix the amount of the damages. However, responsibility for the amount of damages awarded does not lie exclusively with the jury \u2014 its responsibility is primary, but not final. The ultimate responsibility rests with the trial judge who may set a verdict aside. His power to set aside a verdict as excessive implies that he has a duty to do so when he conscientiously belives that the jury has exceeded the bounds of propriety. This duty should not be avoided by hiding behind the jury\u2019s verdict. Here, because we believe that the trial judge in this case did conscientiously exercise his discretion, and that he did not abuse it, we avoid reaching the issue of our power to-review his exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"aep-dedup-2\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105 provides that \u201cThere shall be no reversal in the Supreme Court or a court of appeals for- error in ruling upon matters in abatement which do not involve jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-5\">.
