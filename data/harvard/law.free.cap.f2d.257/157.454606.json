Instead, the court gave in charge to the jury defendant\u2019s specifically requested instructions: that it had the same right of occupancy and control of the surface of the land as the owner or lessee of the surface himself; that it had a right to use as much of the surface of the land as may be reasonably necessary to conduct its operations, including seismograph operations; that \u201can oil and gas lessee is not required to obtain permission from a surface or grazing lessee before it can conduct operations upon the surface\u201d; and that an oil and gas lessee is not liable for any damages unless it has been negligent in conducting its operations or has used more of the surface than was reasonable and necessary in the conduct thereof. Instructing the jury specifically that defendant was not liable for any damages for the death of, or injury to cattle unless it negligently did some act during its operations to cause their death or injury and such negligence, if any, was the direct and proximate cause thereof, it further instructed the jury, on the issues of grass damage and the purchase of extra feed, that plaintiffs could recover both if defendant was found at fault on the water taking issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">The jury returned a general verdict for appellees and this appeal is from a judgment on that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">Here, insisting that, as to the death of the cattle, no fault whatever was shown, and that, if mistaken in this, no substantial proof was made that the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the cattle was caused thereby, appellant cites many cases,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> * particularly Lynn v. Maag, 5 Cir., 220 F.2d 703 and Warren Petroleum Corp. v. Martin, 153 Tex. 465, 271 S.W.2d 410, holding that in situations of this kind the lease owner has a right to enter and use the property and his only liability is for negligence in exercising his rights or an overt trespass beyond them; and that, to recover on a claim for damages, there must be clear proof that a wrong was done and that damage resulted therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">On the basis of these views and these cases, appellant insists that the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to instruct a verdict as to the claim for damages for death of the cattle and to submit to the jury the question of the recovery of either the value of the grass destroyed because of the exhaustion of the water tank or the cost of the purchase of feed made necessary thereby, but not both.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We agree with appellant that, except as to the claim for damages as a result of drawing more than half the water from the tank, measured by the value of the grass lost or the cost of the feed which its loss required plaintiff to purchase, one or the other but not both, the judgment must be reversed and the cause of action dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In United States v. Huff, 5 Cir., 175 F.2d 678, this court had occasion to deal with a claim for sheep losses as the result of army maneuvers, inadequately proven as here. What was said there applies with full force here. Appellees took their grazing leases subject to the mineral leases, and, as the judge charged the jury, appellant did not have to obtain permission from plaintiffs to enter upon and make use of the lands under their oil and gas leases. The fact alone, therefore, which seems to be plaintiffs\u2019 only ground of recovery as to the cattle losses, that defendant entered without first notifying plaintiffs, will not support the recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">In addition, search the evidence as one will, no legal basis can be found there for attributing the claimed deaths of cattle to any of the actions of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">On Appellees\u2019 Motion to Tax Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">It is ordered that appellees\u2019 motion to tax costs be, and it is hereby denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-9\">. No record was made and kept by appellees as to the days the cattle died, no qualified person was called to determine, and there was no opinion evidence, lay or expert, as to, the cause of their deaths. No claim was made by appellees that any cattle died because of any other reason than following appellant\u2019s vehicles. In addition to the cattle claim, there was a claim and some evidence that appellant used all the water in a surface tank in the eastern part of the ranch when it was only entitled to use half, that appellees were compelled to move their cattle from the pastures adjacent to this watering place to others not so good, and that appellees lost the use of some 10,000 acres of grass and had to buy extra feed for their cattle because of the loss of grass.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-21\">.
