White, III, appellants, seek restoration of an area variance to construct a swimming pool adjacent to their home in Annapolis that had been granted by the County Board of Appeals of Anne Arundel County (the Board), only to be snatched away by the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Robert H. Heller, Jr., J.) based on a petition for judicial review filed by John C. North, II, Chair, Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission, appellee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We shall affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Although appellants frame two questions on appeal, we have condensed them into the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">If there was substantial evidence before the Board to support its findings as to each of the ordinance requirements for the grant of the variance, was it arbitrary and capricious for the circuit court to substitute its judgment for that of the Board?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\n<em>The Factual Record and Legal Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Apparently sometime in 1996<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellants applied for certain variances to enable them to construct decks<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on their existing house at 1913 Martins Cove Court in Annapolis and a swimming pool in the rear yard of the 1.52 acre lot. The apparent variances sought were from the requirements of Anne Arundel County Code 1993, Article 28, Section 1A-I04(a)(l) and (c)(H):<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00a7 1A-104. Plan requirements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">(a) All development plans in the critical area shall contain notations of the following criteria that shall be a condition of development on the property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\"><em>(1) There shall be a minimum, 100-foot buffer landward from the mean high-water line of tidal waters, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>tributary streams, and tidal wetlands. The buffer shall be expanded </em>... <em>to include any contiguous, sensitive areas such as steep slopes ... and shall include all land within 50 feet of the top of the bank of steep slopes. </em>There shall be a minimum 25-foot buffer surrounding all nontidal wetlands;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">* * <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">(c) Within limited development areas and resource conservation areas the following additional criteria shall apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">\n<em>(12) Within limited development areas, new development activities are not permitted in the buffer except water-dependent facilities[.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The parties do not contest the fact that appellants\u2019 lot, to a substantial degree, and the proposed pool site, in particular, presently fall within the designation of a limited development area (LDA) and the extended critical area buffer for purposes of Maryland Code (1974, 1990 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.), Natural Resources Article, \u00a7\u00a7 8-1801 to 8-1813 (\u201cChesapeake Bay Critical Area Protection Program\u201d); Title 27 of COMAR (\u201cChesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission\u201d); and Articles 28 (\u201cZoning\u201d) and 26 (\u201cSubdivision\u201d) of the Anne Arundel County Code. The parties also do not dispute that the proposed swimming pool, for purposes of applicable critical areas laws and regulations, constitutes an \u201cimpervious area\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and is not a \u201cwater-dependent facility.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>critical areas regulatory scheme is to prohibit the construction of the pool within the extended critical area buffer unless a variance is obtained. The Whites suggest that the origin of their problem is the nonserendipitous timing of the full legal effective of the critical areas regulatory scheme vis \u00e1 vis the Whites\u2019 intended development of their lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The Whites purchased their previously subdivided lot (Lot 16, Martin\u2019s Cove Farm subdivision) in 1983. Ms. White testified at the Board\u2019s 9 September 1996 variance hearing that she and Mr. White \u201cspent several years planning the house.\u201d Although apparently aided by various professionals, such as Mr. Daniel J. Werner, a registered professional engineer with Anarex, Inc., Ms. White stated she and Mr. White \u201cdrew the plans ourselves and submitted them ourselves\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u201cbegan initial construction, lot clearing, and so forth in 1987.\u201d Construction of their home, however, did not begin until 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">During the \u201clot clearing\u201d phase, the Whites not only \u201ccleared the site,\u201d but performed site grading. The site grading included excavation of the home site and deposit of the excavated and disturbed earth elsewhere on the lot. Ms. White testified, with regard to the site grading, that \u201c[i]t was a gradual slope [referring to the pre-grading conditions on the lot], but it wasn\u2019t \u2014this 15 percent slope is created by the excavation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Mr. Werner, testifying before the Board as part of appellants\u2019 case, stated with regard to the effect and extent of the site grading that preceded the commencement of house construction that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">the whole site is created, by the way. It\u2019s completely cleared____ And the soils around the house and in the disturbed area were changed during the construction of the house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Thus, the area where the pool was proposed ultimately was \u201cdisturbed [built-up] and created by the grading [for] the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Describing the soil that existed on the lot in its pre-graded state, Mr. Werner referred to it as a \u201cEsboro loamy sand,\u201d generally with a clay layer somewhere beneath. In the course of the grading activity, however, sandy clay soil became the dominant soil in the area where the pool is proposed now. Moreover, the redistribution of earth created a steeper slope than had previously existed in the same area. Mr. Werner described the pre-grading soil condition as \u201cmore permeable\u201d than the \u201crelatively impervious\u201d post-grading condition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Ms. White stated that she and Mr. White had intended from the beginning of their house planning efforts to include tiers of decking on the exterior of the home and a swimming pool at some undefined location on the lot. Although some decking was shown on the approved home construction plan, no decking was actually constructed at that time. No swimming pool was depicted on any house or site plan submitted by the Whites at that time. Ms. White attributed this omission from the 1990 house plans to \u201cprobably just an oversight.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Explaining why she now wanted to construct a pool, she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>[T]o enjoy it. Several of my Mends have pools on waterfront properties[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] And, since we\u2019re not even near the waterfront, I never anticipated this to be such an issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">I have a youngster who is interested in swimming, as\u2014 just as a course of relaxation and enjoyment, and just as part of enjoying my house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">When the Whites ultimately decided it was time to build a swimming pool, they claim to have discovered for the first time that the critical areas regulatory scheme, at both the State and Anne Arundel County levels, existed and was fully effective<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This regulatory scheme, as noted earlier in this opinion, proclaimed an extended buffer of at least 50 feet from the top of steep slopes (defined as 15% or greater) that lead to the primary 100 foot buffer adjacent to any watershed that drains to the Chesapeake Bay. Within this extended buffer, non-water dependent impervious structures are prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The proposed pool, 546 square feet in area, was sized by the Whites, on advice of their pool contractor, because it was the smallest pool that could safely accommodate a diving board. Ms. White indicated a \"willingness to reduce the size of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>pool to 400 square feet (\u201cabout the smallest that they\u2019re [the contractor] accustomed to building\u201d) and forego the diving board.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">With regard to why the proposed pool was sited in the rear yard (south) of their home, Ms. White stated there was no other part of the lot where it could be placed. Evaluating the alternatives, she opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">I cannot put it in my front yard because of the covenants in our community.[ <footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] And, from aesthetic points of view, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want it there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">To the east side of the house is another slope, which is even greater than the one in the back. And it\u2019s wooded on that side, and it\u2019s currently a drainage [area] anyway. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to put it in the drainage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">The back side of the house is really the only place that would accommodate it, and that\u2019s where it was intended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_i\">Upon closer oral examination by a member of the Board, Ms. White offered the following elaboration regarding an east side alternative pool location:</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Q. In looking at the [variance] site plan, is there any reason as to why the pool could not be located to the east side of your house where it says \u201crailroad tie wall approximately two feet high\u201d? In that area?</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">A. Well, the purpose of that railroad tie wall was to retain a slope that\u2019s even greater than the one we\u2019re talking about in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">And then there\u2019s about an area about the width of a car\u2014 maybe not even \u2014 the width of a tractor, I guess \u2014 that\u2019s level, and then it drops off again down to the bottom of the ditch. So it\u2019s quite a significant slope on that side.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">Q. So you\u2019re saying the slope is greater on the side?</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">A. The slope is greater on that side of the house than it is in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Another Board member focused Ms. White on the site conditions to the west of the existing house:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Q. Ms. White, I have a couple questions. I\u2019m looking at the site plan once again. I notice there are some \u2014 there is an existing carport [adjoining the house on its western side]?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">A. That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Q. And also a garage [adjoining the carport to the west]. And is that a concrete slab next to it [further to the west]?</p>\n<p id=\"A-g\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Q. Does that represent relatively a level area there? Are they located there right now?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Q. Is that relatively a level area in that spot?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">A. It\u2019s level \u2014 the back side of the garage apron drops off, and the back side of the garage drops off. I mean, those\u2014 it\u2019s a steeper grade over there than it is behind the house.</p>\n<p id=\"ARd\">Q. So you have a \u2014 between your house and your garage is an existing carport with noting overhead?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">A. A roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Q. There is a roof over top your carport?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">A. Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">Q. Just an open roof? And there\u2019s \u2014 and the house and a garage, and there\u2019s nothing in the front or the back of it?</p>\n<p id=\"AAE\">A. Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">Q. Then on the opposite side of your garage, there\u2019s a concrete slab.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] Is there anything \u2014 is there an overhead structure there too?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-18\">Turning his attention to an area of the lot east of the primary septic system drainage field (which is located north<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>east of the front elevation of the house) and apparently west and outside of a line drawn on the variance site plan delineating the limits of \u201cExpanded Buffer In The Critical Area,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Board member and Ms. White explored that possible alternate site for a pool:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Q. Back, I guess, on the northern end of your site plan, where it says \u201cinitial systems,\u201d it would be next to the\u2014 probably your draining systems. You see the circular area there, where it says \u201cinitial systems\u201d ... I guess it would be the front side of your property? It\u2019s circular? Is that your property there? See where you have the existing fields for your septic system? And right next to it it says \u201cinitial systems\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">A. Oh, \u201cinitial.\u201d Yes, I see.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Q. See where it says \u201cexpanded buffer in the critical area\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">A. Yes, I see.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Q. To the left of that, it says \u201cInitial systems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Q. It seems to be an area there that seems relatively flat, or a two-foot drop; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">A Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Q. What is it? Is it a heavily treed area? What is in there?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">A. No. It\u2019s open. That\u2019s [part of] the front yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">Q. That\u2019s the front yard. All right. And then your driveway is on the opposite end?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">A The driveway comes in, right, from the left [northwest] on the plan. When you approach the house, you see the garage first.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Q. Okay. And do you see this front yard area from the road that you described as the front yard area, where it says \u201cinitial systems\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">A. Right. From the lane, you see it. You don\u2019t see it from the cul-de-sac.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Q. What lane do you see it from?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">A. This private lane that serves these three properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Q. Okay. But you don\u2019t see it from the cul-de-sac.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">A. That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">Q. And that\u2019s relatively a flat area?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">A. It\u2019s not really flat. We don\u2019t have any \u2014 there is nothing flat on the entire lot except where the house is, where it was made flat.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Q. Then these contours are incorrect? I mean it certainly shows a two-foot \u2014 as flat as this property is required to be\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">A. It\u2019s about as flat as \u2014 it\u2019s about as flat as it gets right there in front of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">Q. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">A. And I built that up a lot to make it flatter.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">Following Ms. White\u2019s testimony before the Board, her pool contractor, Mr. Larry Hyland of O\u2019Neil Swimming Pools, testified.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He initially described how the pool would be constructed where proposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-17\">We actually cut into the slope and use a steel and reinforced concrete method. And the back side of the pool would actually be out of the ground. And I would assume that the wooden deck would go on that side of the pool.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Asked if he meant that he would be excavating into the side of the hill in order to install the pool, leaving the downslope side of the pool exposed, Mr. Hyland theorized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">Well, it really depends on the depth and the grade there. It may have to go below grade. But, in a lot of cases, it\u2019s\u2014 you cut into the hill. And the bottom of the pool has to be supported on virgin ground, and the back side can be freestanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Mr. Hyland next expressed his view of the environmental benefits of installing the pool in the location proposed. Although he never quantified his conclusion, Mr. Hyland maintained generally that the pool would act as a catch-basin for rainwater that fell on its surface area. Evaporation would follow.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, the amount of rainwater intercepted by the pool would not be available for surface runoff down the existing steep slope and inferentially would not contribute to the erosion potential of the soils on the slope. Mr. Hyland described the vegetative cover on the slope as \u201clow grass and weeds.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">He also was of the opinion that the reinforced concrete pool would stabilize the area somewhat, \u201ccreating a level area which is now a sloped area.\u201d This too, he opined, could affect beneficially any erosion potential of the slope in the expanded critical area buffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The Board explored with Mr. Hyland, as it did with Ms. White, possible alternative sites for the proposed pool. Although Mr. Hyland conceded that a swimming pool (but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>explicitly one the same as proposed in Ms. White\u2019s testimony) \u201ccould be constructed almost any place\u201d on the property, he specifically identified two areas where he believed a pool could be installed without interfering with steep slopes \u2014 the front yard and the \u201c30 by 30 area\u201d (referring to the concrete slab/patio west of the garage).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Appellants\u2019 final witness was Mr. Werner, their professional engineer. He explained that initially when his firm designed the layout of the lot for the house location and other improvements (pre-1990) it had proposed siting the home 35-40 feet \u201ccloser to the front of the lot.\u201d Due to Health Department recommendations for where the septic system should be located, however, the house location had to be moved \u201cfurther down the slope.\u201d Responding to appellants\u2019 counsel\u2019s leading question, Mr. Werner agreed with the contention that this movement of the house location \u201cputs the pool in an area where it <em>must </em>be in the expanded buffer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Although commenting that steep slopes, and particularly those where soils are relatively impervious, typically lead to stormwater run-off problems and attendant soil erosion, Mr. Werner also testified that the steep slopes on the Whites\u2019 property where the pool was proposed contained \u201cno evidence of any erosion taking place,\u201d despite the \u201csparse vegetation\u201d on the slope. In sum, he did not \u201csee any problem with the steep slope as it was.\u201d Moreover, the pool, he thought, would have no effect, positively or negatively, on the stability of the slope. Mr. Werner opined (in response to the Board\u2019s questions) that, with \u201cfertilization and lime and stuff like that,\u201d grass could be grown and that such additional ground cover would \u201cimprove the run-off situation that\u2019s currently existing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Ms. Lisa Herger, an environmental specialist with the Chesapeake Bay Critical. Area Commission (Commission), presented to the Board the Commission\u2019s opposition to the grant of a variance for the pool. Purportedly responding to the criteria for the grant of a variance as expressed in the County Zoning Ordinance, \u00a7 2-107, Ms. Herger explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>a. the Whites\u2019 lot is \u201cvery typical of lots that were platted and created prior to the adoption of not only the State critical area law and criteria but the County\u2019s, which was adopted in \u201988;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">b. \u201c[t]here [are] other property owners who \u00e1lso have properties very similar to this one. They\u2019re very steeply sloped. They\u2019re in the LDA. It\u2019s not untypical to see this type of lot, since they were platted prior to the adoption of critical area rights;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">c. \u201cthose owners \u2014 if they have a pool, it was because it was existing prior to the critical area law;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">d. \u201cother applicants similarly situated would not be allowed a pool in the expanded buffer;\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">e. \u201cthe ... Commission [created] the expanded buffer ... because it recognizes sensitive areas. In this case, we have steep slopes. The addition of any new impervious area would adversely affect its functioning, not only for water quality ... but also for the habitat that it\u2019s provided for.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Additionally, Ms. Herger reasoned that denying the Whites the ability to build their pool within the expanded buffer would not result in the imposition on the Whites of an \u201cunwarranted hardship,\u201d within the meaning of the Ordinance criteria, because the Whites already enjoyed a reasonable use of their property \u2014 the dwelling located on it. The pool, she explained, was merely an accessory structure or recreational amenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Ms. Herger perceived a difference between the \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d standard for granting an area variance outside the critical areas and the \u201cunwarranted hardship\u201d criterion required to be found in order to grant the same variance from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>a critical areas buffer prohibition. She described the former to be \u201ca little bit easier burden to get over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The final witness before the Board was Ms. Patricia Miley, a planner with the Department of Planning and Code Enforcement for Anne Arundel County. Ms. Miley related that her agency questioned \u201cthe inherent hardship in this request [as to the pool]. Not only is the pool proposed in the expanded buffer, it\u2019s also proposed on steep slopes. We find this to be unacceptable.\u201d The documentary evidence and other testimony of Ms. Miley was consistent with that of Ms. Herger. Appellants\u2019 cross-examination of Ms. Miley adduced that the County \u201chas always opposed the construction of a pool within the buffer,\u201d without exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">We repeat here substantial portions of appellants\u2019 closing arguments, not merely because it contains the best explanation of their theory of their case, but because it will illuminate perhaps what led the Board majority to the decision it made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjL\">[W]hat a variance is all about is looking to see whether the property that we\u2019re interested in and the requests being made is, in fact, unique.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">And the uniqueness comes from two different issues. One is whether there is some form of unique hardship, and whether or not the property itself or the request that\u2019s being made is unique in that it doesn\u2019t really affect or act as a detriment to the things that were being attempted to be protected by the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">The Whites were going to build a house. And, due to the county\u2019s reconfiguration of the location of the house, the house was pushed back in such a fashion that because of the covenants on the property, which preclude location of a pool in the front yard, the steep slopes around the property, and the expanded buffer, which was imposed later, there\u2019s no place now to put a pool.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">Now a pool is not an atypical amenity that goes with houses of this type.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>And to deny people typical amenities is to deny these people the typical privileges that come with having a house of this type.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">And what\u2019s unique about this property and why other properties have pools when this one does not is that the location of this house as placed by the county at a time when there was no buffer or expanded buffer law has put this property in a spot where had it been located differently\u2014 and it may well have been located differently had everyone known this buffer exemption was coming \u2014 they could have had a pool. They might very well have had a pool.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">But now, because of the imposition of the buffer law after the house was constructed, this house is denied a privilege that is generally available to houses located in a limited development area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">The peculiar thing on this house is the steep slopes and the way in which the house is located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">Therein lies the hardship.' It is the imposition of the law after the house was begun, the construction was begun, the location of the house was set, and the cost and the ability to relocate the pool becomes basically a non-possibility, that a hardship is imposed on this property owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">[T]aking the pool away does preclude this individual from enjoying some of the things that are generally available to people even in a limited development area. In this particular case, they don\u2019t \u2014 can\u2019t enjoy it because they cannot locate the pool in a normal spot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">Now, a couple of possibilities arose where you could tear up the carport, or you could maybe fit it on the pad. The pad, as you\u2019ll note, is within the expanded buffer, so you\u2019ll probably be limited there. You begin to get into the question of whether or not you\u2019re in the front yard, so there may be covenant problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u00ed{\u00ed <em>% </em>H\u00ed H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">One of the other comments is the quote, \u201cIs the question deniable of reasonable use?\u201d And I recognize that maybe a pool isn\u2019t always necessary, but it\u2019s certainly a reasonable use of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">Is this particular case, the question is wouldn\u2019t it be a denial of reasonable use? Yes. There\u2019s nothing that should preclude them from having a pool. There\u2019s nothing in the law that precludes it, as long as you find that there are some unique circumstances in this case that makes this different from the average one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Thereafter, a majority (three) of the Board members hearing the case adopted written findings of fact and conclusions of law granting the variance to construct a 400 square foot pool within the expanded critical areas buffer. A two member minority of the Board filed a written explanation of the reasons they concluded the variance should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The Board majority, in its 14 November 1996 written decision, made the following findings of fact and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">The Board finds that unique physical conditions exist on the property. This property is steeply sloped and wooded. The lot is also an irregularly shaped parcel with a pipestem driveway located significantly within the expanded buffer to the critical area. The septic system consumes the bulk of the front yard which is the only flat area of the parcel. The location of the septic system forced construction of the existing residence towards the rear of the lot into the area of the steep slopes. The steep slopes allow at-grade access to the main floor from the front yard, but the main floor becomes a second story at the rear of the house. Although there are doors to provide rear safety access to the main floor, there is no decking or steps to allow the occupants to exist safely. The at-grade exit to the rear of the house is dirt and similarly does not provide proper safe access. The steep slopes in the rear yard appear difficult to stabilize and would be enhanced by the construction of the proposed retaining wall. As a result of these unique physical condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>tions, there is no reasonable possibility of developing the lot as proposed without a variance to the Code requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">The testimony of one of the Petitioners indicates that the proposed swimming pool is small. The record reflects that several homes in the neighborhood have swimming pools. The proposed swimming pool would not be visible from most properties in the neighborhood due to the pipestem shape of the lot, the dense woods and its location to the rear of the house. The Board noted that many homes in the neighborhood are improved with decks and retaining walls. As a result, the Board concludes that the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the lot is located, will not substantially impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, and will not be detrimental to the public welfare. The decking proposed is modest in depth and is attached to the house. Because the pool cannot be moved to the front of the property as a result of the septic system, restrictive covenants and tree cover and cannot be moved closer to the house because of the location of the deck access, the Board concludes that the variance granted is the minimum necessary to afford relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">The property is located within the critical area, therefore, consideration of environmental impacts is essential. Because of the severe location restrictions and the lack of safety access to the rear of the main floor, insufficient access at grade to the rear of the house and inability to place a pool in the rear yard, the Board concludes that the features of this property would cause a strict implementation of the critical area program to result in an unwarranted hardship. The Board finds that the swimming pool would not negatively impact the critical area because it acts as a catch basin for stormwater. Thus, the run-off on the steep slopes will be lessened and the slopes stabilized by the concrete. The water in the pool can freely evaporate and recharge the hydrology of the ecosystem, but will not cause erosion and siltation into the critical area. The retaining wall will assist in slope stabilization and the pervious deck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>ing will decrease erosion from pedestrian traffic. As a literal interpretation of the relevant COMAR and County Code provisions would prohibit the Petitioners from constructing decks, a retaining wall and a pool as their neighbors have, the Board concludes that such an interpretation would deprive the Petitioners of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners in the area, and within the critical area. For the same reason, the granting of this variance will not confer on the Petitioners any special privilege that otherwise would be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsZ\">The lot conditions that cause the unwarranted hardship were not created by the Petitioners. Therefore, the request for the variance is not based on conditions or circumstances that are the result of actions by the Petitioners. Likewise, the variance request does not arise from any condition relating to land or building use on any neighboring properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">Through the action of the pool, eliminating run-off and erosion, and the retaining wall stabilizing the grade and the pervious decking decreasing pedestrian erosion, the Petitioners will actually improve water quality. Such improvements is clearly consistent with the County\u2019s critical area program. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the granting of this variance will not adversely affect water quality and will be in harmony with the general spirit and intent of the critical area program. Finally, testimony indicated that the pool will be constructed on an open lawn with mowed weeds and grass. Therefore, there is negligible habitat. Thus, the Board concludes that the proposed variance will not adversely affect fish, wildlife, or plant habitat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The two dissenting members of the Board filed the following written opinion appended to the majority decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">We respectfully dissent from the, opinion of the majority and would deny the requested variance to allow the construction of an in-ground swimming pool within the expanded buffer. We believe that the evidence does not establish the existence of a hardship. Here, the evidence simply is that the Petitioners would like to have a pool for recreation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>in their rear yard. Not having one, however, is not an unwarranted hardship. In <em>North v. St. Mary\u2019s County, </em>99 Md.App. 502, 638 A.2d 1175 (1994), the Court of Special Appeals held that a property owner\u2019s desire to construct a gazebo in his front yard so that he could read, contemplate and observe the creed did not constitute evidence of an unwarranted hardship. Such is the case here, as well. We believe that the subject property already is fully developed with an attractive single family dwelling. Thus, we find that no unique physical conditions, exceptional topographical conditions, or exceptional circumstances exist that preclude the development of the lot. The lot is already developed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">We find that the pool could be constructed elsewhere on the lot. The Petitioners\u2019 pool company witness testified that he could also place the pool to the east or west of the house or in the location of the existing carport. Thus, the pool would not require a variance to the critical area buffer standards, but for Petitioners\u2019 desire to have a pool in their rear yard. Locating the pool in the critical area when other options are available is not in harmony with the general spirit and intent of the critical area legislation to avoid impact to this sensitive area. Additionally, requesting a variance where one is not necessary cannot serve as a basis whereby the Board concludes that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">We most seriously disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s apparent determination that the proposed pool is beyond the application of the law. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the pool is not an impervious surface, the construction of a pool remains a new development activity within the critical area. Such new development activities are simply not allowed. <em>See, e.g., </em>Anne Arundel County Code, Article 28, Sections 1A-104(c)(13),. 1A-105(f). We find, however, that the pool is clearly an impervious surface. Indeed, Petitioners\u2019 pool company and professional engineering witnesses both confirmed that this pool (and any pool) is an impervious surface. No witness testified that the pool is a pervious surface.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>We would conclude that the Petitioners have not met all of the requirements for a variance, and would deny the request to allow the construction of a pool.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">We concur, however, with the decision of the majority to the extent that it pertains to the variance to allow the construction of two decks, retaining wall and patio so long as they are constructed of wood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The Chair of the Commission filed in the circuit court a timely petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. After considering the parties\u2019 legal memoranda and oral arguments, the court filed on 6 May 1997 a Memorandum Opinion and Order reversing the Board\u2019s grant of the variance(s) for the swimming pool. The court concluded that the Board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence regarding all of the ordinance requirements. In particular, the court\u2019s perusal of the record led it to conclude that the finding of unwarranted hardship was not justified by the necessary quantum of evidence, that the Board had misconstrued the law as to whether depriving the Whites from having a pool in the expanded buffer would amount to the denial of a right commonly enjoyed by others, and that granting the variance(s) to the Whites would not confer to them a special privilege not afforded to other property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The Whites filed this timely appeal from the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Our role in reviewing an administrative decision \u201cis precisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v.

Because of the severe location restrictions and the lack of safety access to the rear of the main floor, insufficient access at grade to the rear of the house and inability to place a pool in the rear yard, the Board concludes that the features of this property would cause a strict implementation of the critical area program to result in an unwarranted hardship.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">At the outset of our analysis, we pause to note that we shall be considering whether the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence based solely on the record as transmitted to this Court.

Both the Anne Arundel County Code (1992), article 8, \u00a7 1-104, and the Board\u2019s Rules (1994), Rule 3-104(b), prohibit ex parte communications by and between Board members, parties, and parties\u2019 representatives while a case is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">At the end of the Board\u2019s evidentiary hearing in the instant case on 9 September 1996, the Chair announced that it was the Board\u2019s intent to \u201cconduct an on-site inspection\u201d on 13' September 1996. This inspection would be done in two shifts, three members arriving at noon and two at 6:00 p.m. It is apparent from the Chair\u2019s comments that, with the express permission of Ms. White, the Board, invoking its \u201cpower\u201d pursuant to Rule 4-101(g), was to \u201ceye ball,\u201d if you will, the Whites\u2019 property and possibly its environs. The physical record as transmitted to us (and presumably as it existed before the circuit court and the Board), however, is silent as to whether the intended \u201con-site inspection\u201d actually occurred or what the Board learned from such a visit if made. In its Memorandum of Opinion, in the Summary of Evidence section,' no mention is made of any additional facts or information obtained by the Board during any \u201con-site inspection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The foregoing digression before approaching our analysis of the Board\u2019s grant of the swimming pool variance occurs because, as we shall later explain, the record before us does not support the conclusion that there exists substantial, material, and competent evidence to support the Board\u2019s decision as to each element of \u00a7 2-107(b) and (c). \u201cWithout a record of the facts or the reasons for its action, a reviewing court cannot properly perform its duty of determining whether the action of the [Board] was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Mortimer v. Howard Research Dev. Corp., </em>83 Md.App. 432, 447, 575 A.2d 750 (1990) (citations omitted). We speculate, based on certain of the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions, that it may have seen conditions or things on its \u201con-site inspection\u201d that affected its judgment, but which facts, information, or observations it did not include properly in the record. Obviously, we cannot consider in aid of determining whether the Board\u2019s decision is affirmable anything that is not in the record. To the extent the Board obtains information from such an \u201con-site inspection,\u201d and such information is not already a matter of record in the pending case and is material to the ordinance requirements and the Board\u2019s decision, the Board would do well for itself and parties before it in the future to conceive of a technique to supplement the record with such evidence before rendering its decision. In doing such, the Board needs also to be mindful of the right of opposing parties to be apprised of that additional evidence, and given an opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Returning to our main task, we note that the record contains only fragmentary and imprecise evidence as to the topography or vegetative conditions of the Whites\u2019 lot prior to their 1990 site grading, excavation, and re-distribution of earth. The record is devoid of any substantial evidence that would permit comparison of the topography, vegetation (or lack thereof), or shape of the Whites\u2019 lot, whether before or after 1990, with any other lot abutting, adjacent, or nearby to the Whites\u2019 property. Moreover, whether and to what extent other properties, regardless of whether such were in the undefined \u201cneighborhood\u201d of the Whites\u2019 property, are affect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ed by the critical areas regulations relevant to the Whites\u2019 variance application is wholly unexplored territory on this record, at least insofar as such information could be viewed as supportive of the Board\u2019s decision. It is implicit in the requirement of \u00a7 2 \u2014 107(b)(1) that the \u201cfeatures of the site or other circumstances\u201d that lead to the finding of an unwarranted hardship must be unique to the Whites\u2019 property and not shared by neighboring properties. <em>See Cromwell v. Ward, </em>102 Md.App. 691, 719, 721, 651 A.2d 424 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Before the Board, appellants\u2019 counsel, near the end of his closing argument at the 9 September 1996 hearing, argued boldly (and without citing authority) that it would deny appellants a reasonable use of their property if the swimming pool variance were not approved. On appeal to this Court, appellants muster a similar argument, but with more authoritative constitutional gloss.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This argument, we conclude, is misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Appellants\u2019 constitutional syllogism goes like this: (1) Neither of the objectives intended to be benefited by the imposition of the critical areas buffer requirements (protection of water quality through the control of storm water runoff problems and protection of the habitat, according to Ms. Herger\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>testimony) would be harmed by appellants\u2019 swimming pool in the location proposed. (2) To the contrary, additional stabilization of existing impervious soils in the area of the steep slope within the buffer and interception of rainfall on the surface of the pool would advance the protection of water quality, presumably over the natural, though altered, condition. Further, there was no evidence that the habitat of any particular flora or fauna would be harmed by the pool\u2019s installation. (3) Consequently, denying the variance in the face of such evidence merely because the regulations prohibited a swimming pool in the expanded buffer generally denies the Whites an economically beneficial, productive, or reasonable use of their land, to wit, a taking in a constitutional sense. (4) Finally, sprinkled throughout appellants\u2019 argument are citations to and excerpts from <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992); <em>Nollan v. California Coastal Comm\u2019n, </em>483 U.S. 825, 107 S.Ct. 3141, 97 L.Ed.2d 677 (1987); <em>Steel v. Cape Corp., </em>111 Md.App. 1, 677 A.2d 634 (1996); and <em>North v. St. Mary\u2019s County, </em>99 Md.App. 502, 638 A.2d 1175 (1994), as authorities supporting appellants\u2019 taking argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The most obvious flaw in appellants\u2019 constitutional formula is their dependence on the assumption that denial of any reasonable use will give rise to a taking. In <em>Baltimore City v. Borinsky, </em>239 Md. 611, 212 A.2d 508 (1965), the Court of Appeals adopted a strict and exacting standard in this regard, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201cIf the owner affirmatively demonstrates that the legislative or administrative determination deprives him of all beneficial use of the property, the action will be held unconstitutional. <em>But the restrictions imposed must be such that the property cannot be used for any reasonable purpose. </em>It is not enough for the property owners to show that the zoning action results in substantial loss or hardship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 622, 212 A.2d 508 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Appellants urge that, under the more recent Supreme Court pronouncements, that is no longer the test. It seizes upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>articulation in <em>Nollan, </em>483 U.S. at 834, 107 S.Ct. at 3147, and <em>Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1015, 112 S.Ct. at 2893, that a regulation may constitute a taking if it denies the owner of \u201ceconomically viable use of his land.\u201d At least implicit in their argument is that an owner can be denied the economically viable use of his land even though he is not denied \u201call beneficial use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The simple and most direct answer to this assertion is that appellants have overlooked the important modifier \u201call.\u201d In <em>Lucas, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that the standard was whether the regulation \u201cdenies <em>all </em>economically beneficial or productive use of land.\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1015, 112 S.Ct. at 2893 (emphasis added). The Court later supplied its own emphasis to the word \u201call\u201d when it stated that an owner suffers a taking when he has been called upon \u201cto sacrifice <em>all </em>economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is to leave his property economically idle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1019, 112 S.Ct. at 2895. In <em>Waters v. Montgomery County, </em>337 Md. 15, 650 A.2d 712 (1994), the Court of Appeals noted that, under <em>Lucas, </em>a regulation does not go \u201ctoo far\u201d unless it \u201cdenies <em>all </em>economically beneficial or productive use of land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 650 A.2d 712 (quoting <em>Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1015, 112 S.Ct. at 2893 (emphasis added)). The Court of Appeals then reiterated the <em>Borinsky </em>test, that \u201c[t]o constitute a taking in the constitutional sense ... the state action must deprive the owner of all beneficial use of the property.\u201d <em>Waters, </em>337 Md. at 40-41, 650 A.2d 712 (quoting <em>Pitsenberger v. Pitsenberger, </em>287 Md. 20, 34, 410 A.2d 1052 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">As is obvious from the record in the instant case, appellants will continue to enjoy their primary residence on the subject property. With the addition of the decking, retaining wall, and patio authorized by the unchallenged parts of the variance, that use will be further enhanced. The addition of a swimming pool would be an amenity, as Ms. White testified. The absence of a pool, by virtue of the application of the critical areas buffer requirements and prohibitions, does not amount to a constitutionally-cognizable taking on the record of this case. The absence of the Whites\u2019 desired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>pool is no more a hardship than was the denial of Mr. Enoch\u2019s gazebo in <em>North v. St. Mary\u2019s County. See North, </em>99 Md.App. at 519, 688 A.2d 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>Deprivation of Rights Commonly Enjoyed by Other Properties Within Critical Area \u00a7 2-107(b)(2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\n<em>AND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\n<em>No Special Privilege Conferred On Appellants \u00a7 2-107(b)(3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">It appears to us that the Board\u2019s additional findings and conclusions explaining further why it favorably found for appellants under these two sub-sections is contained essentially in the following portion of the Memorandum of Opinion (again, relevant determinations as to the pool are underscored):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\"><em>The Board finds that the swimming pool would not negatively impact the critical area because it acts as a catch basin for storm water. Thus, the runoff on the steep slopes will be lessened and the slopes stabilized by the concrete. The water in the pool can freely evaporate and recharge the hydrology of the ecosystem, but will not cause erosion and situation into the critical area. </em>The retaining wall will assist in slope stabilization and the pervious decking will decrease erosion from pedestrian traffic. As <em>a literal interpretation of the relevant COMAR and County Code provisions would prohibit the Petitioners from constructing </em>decks, a retaining wall and <em>a pool as their neighbors have, the Board concludes that such an interpretation would deprive the Petitioners of rights commonly enjoyed by other property oumers in the area, and within the critical area. For the same reason,, the granting of this variance will not confer on the Petitioners any special privilege that otherwise would be denied.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Although there was evidence meeting the substantial evidence standard to support the Board\u2019s findings as to arguably beneficial effects from the construction of the pool on soil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>stabilization and rain water interception, it is a complete <em>non seqwitur </em>to conclude from such findings or evidence that denial of the variance would deprive appellants of \u201crights commonly enjoyed by other properties in similar areas within the critical area of\u2019 Anne Arundel County. Likewise, viewed through the reverse prism of whether the grant of the variance would confer a special privilege on appellants that would be denied otherwise \u201cto other lands or structures within the [Anne Arundel] County critical area,\u201d the Board\u2019s conclusion is no more logical.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">As noted previously, there is no evidence<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> in the record bearing on which (if any) of the Whites\u2019 neighbors, with waterfront or non-waterfront properties, have swimming pools. It follows, therefore, that when any such neighbor\u2019s pool was constructed, vis \u00e1 vis the date of full implementation of the County\u2019s critical areas regulatory framework, or, if constructed following adoption of the County\u2019s critical areas program, whether such was done under color of a variance such as that sought here by the Whites, also goes unaddressed on this record.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Without some substantial, material, and credible evidence bearing on these matters, the Board\u2019s conclusions are arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>Conditions or Circumstances Not The Result of Actions By Applicant \u00a7 2-107(b) (4) (i)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The Board concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">The lot conditions that cause the unwarranted hardship were not created by the Petitioners. Therefore, the request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>for the variance is not based on conditions or circumstances that are the result of actions by the Petitioners. Likewise, the variance request does not arise from any condition relating to land or building use on any neighboring properties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Although this element of the required findings under \u00a7 2-107(b) was not challenged expressly by the opposition witnesses before the Board (nor by appellee before the circuit court and only weakly before us), there seems grave doubt from our review of the record that substantial evidence exists to support the Board\u2019s decision in this regard as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Considering the evidence in a light most favorable to the Whites and the Board, we view the major premise to be that the Whites (and their consultants) did not realize during the planning and construction of their home that the critical areas regulations generally, and the expanded buffer prohibitions specifically, were either enacted or in the process of being imminently enacted. Had they known better, and therefore realized that the movement of the proposed house location necessitated by the Health Department\u2019s insistence on siting the septic field in the front yard would cause the Whites\u2019 house location to be pushed further to the rear of the lot (with attendant grading and excavation for the house site) and a logical rear yard pool site accordingly pushed into the steep slopes that would become the expanded critical area buffer, they would have constructed the pool, in the location proposed in the variance application, in 1990 when they built the house. Not only is such a justification a prime example of bootstrapping, it is unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">As we noted earlier, <em>supra </em>at 205, n. 11, 708 A.2d at 1098, n. 11, the critical areas regulations in Anne Arundel County were up and operative by May 1988. As the Whites did not commence construction of their home proper until 1990, even had they been fully informed of the status and progress of the critical areas law and regulations at that time, they could not have built the pool in 1990 where they proposed in 1995, free of the need for a variance. In point of fact, Ms. White explained the absence of a pool on the 1990 building plans as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u201cprobably just an oversight.\u201d No external force majeure was blamed by appellants\u2019 evidence for preventing them from building the pool at that time. It is difficult to imagine then, confining ourselves to appellants\u2019 apparent theory, why the presently alleged unwarranted hardship was created other than by appellants\u2019 negligent omission. <em>See Ad + Soil, Inc. v. County Comm\u2019rs of Queen Anne\u2019s County, </em>307 Md. 307, 340, 513 A.2d 893 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Of additional relevance on this point is appellants\u2019 uncontested evidence that they cleared, excavated, and graded the lot, between 1987 and 1990, in such a way as to turn \u201ca gradual slope\u201d into a \u201c15 percent slope.\u201d Specifically, \u201cthe area where the pool was proposed ultimately was disturbed and created by the grading for the house.\u201d In the process, the permeability of the soil was changed from loamy sand (with a clay layer \u201csomewhere\u201d beneath) to sandy clay, or, as Mr. Werner put it, the \u201cmore permeable\u201d pre-grading soils became \u201crelatively impervious.\u201d To later premise in any way the site\u2019s uniqueness for variance justification purposes on the steep slopes and soils susceptible to erosion created by appellants\u2019 actions cannot form a reasoned basis for the Board to conclude that conditions or circumstances causing an unwarranted hardship were not, in any part, the result of appellants\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we are in agreement with the circuit court\u2019s analysis that, on this record, the Board\u2019s grant of the variance as to the Whites\u2019 swimming pool proposal was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-12\">.

Lot 16 is a pan-handle, or pipe-stem, lot that obtains its vehicular access off a cul-de-sac (presumably a dedicated public road), along with apparently two other lots, via a relatively long 40 foot wide private right-of-way (within which is a 20 foot wide paved driveway).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b241-19\">. Mr. Hyland had been in the swimming pool business for 9 years at the point in time he testified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b242-9\">. Mr. Hyland indicated that the Whites' pool would have 4 inches of free-board, i.e., the intended water level of the pool was not to be higher than 4 inches from the top. Thus, it would take a minimum of 4 inches of rainfall for the pool to overflow, an event he found unlikely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b242-10\">. Ms. White earlier described the vegetation on the slope in the area of the proposed pool site as \"nothing but weeds\u201d that she and Mr. White mow. The photographs put into evidence by appellants appear to have been taken well after the most recent mowing, given the height of the \"weeds.\u201d Yet, Ms. White also contended that the \"hard clay lype dirt\u201d there, which \"water does not penetrate,\u201d prevented or made difficult growing \u201canything.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\">. Under cross-examination by appellants\u2019 counsel, Ms. Herger explained that the two purposes served by the buffer conceptually are to protect water quality in the receiving water bodies by controlling storm water runoff problems, such as erosion, and to protect the habitat. She conceded there were no trees or shrubs in the immediate area of the pool site, only \"some grass, some dirt,\u201d and that a pool acts as a catch-basin for rainfall to some degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b254-12\">. For an excellent discussion of the difference between special exceptions/conditional uses on one hand and variances, <em>see Cromwell v. Ward, </em>102 Md.App. 691, 699-721, 651 A.2d 424 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\">. We observe what we believe to be an internal inconsistency implicit in Rule 4-101. Despite the obvious general intent of the Rule to create and preserve a record of the evidence upon which a case is to be decided, subsection (g) of the Rule acknowledges an opportunity for Board members potentially to obtain additional input-bearing on a case based on their observations while on a site visit. That additional input, if any, however, is in no way preserved on the record, at least insofar as subsection (g) is framed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\">. An argument can be made that appellants have failed to preserve properly for appellate review any constitutional argument in this matter. As noted previously in the factual recitation, <em>supra </em>at 215, 708 A.2d at 1102 appellants waited until closing argument before the Board to make reference (and then in both a passing and oblique manner) to any assertion that denial of their variance request as to the swimming pool, in their view, would have constitutional implications. For obvious reasons, the Board majority opinion did not decide directly this \"lip service\u201d constitutional innuendo. We think it open to some question whether appellants\u2019 argument to us that a taking of constitutional dimension would occur unless the variance is granted is properly before us on this record. <em>See Holiday Point Marina v. Anne Arundel County, </em>349 Md. 190, 707 A.2d 829 (1988); <em>see also Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Equitable Life Assurance Society, </em>339 Md. 596, 619, 664 A.2d 862 (1995) (\"[Wjhere a party is not challenging the validity of a statute as a whole, but is arguing that the statute as applied in a particular situation is unconstitutional, and where the legislature has provided an administrative remedy, this Court has regularly held that the constitutional issue must be raised and decided in the statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial review proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\">. When we refer to evidence, we mean substantial evidence. As that term has been described somewhat metaphysically, ten gossamers of evidence equals a scintilla, and more than a scintilla is required to achieve the critical mass of substantial evidence. <em>See Turner v. Hammond, </em>270 Md. 41, 60, 310 A.2d 543 (1973). '</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\">. The only \"evidence\u201d on this topic was testimony by opposition witnesses that no variances had been granted in Anne Arundel County since imposition of the expanded buffer regulations and, therefore, any pools now existing in areas encompassed by the buffer were installed when such was not prohibited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
