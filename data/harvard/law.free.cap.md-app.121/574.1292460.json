Chertkov filed on 8 February 1995 a petition for review of an order of the State Board of Social Work Examiners (the Board) imposing sanctions on her for multiple violations of the Health Occupations Article. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County adopted every one of the Board\u2019s findings of fact, but it determined that the six-month suspension of appellee\u2019s license to practice social work was arbitrary and capricious. The court modified the Board\u2019s sanction by reducing the suspension period to one month and subsequently denied the Board\u2019s motion to alter or amend judgment. The Board noted this appeal in a timely fashion and presents the following questions, which we have recast as bifurcated:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">1. Did the circuit court err in its determination that the suspension portion of appellee\u2019s sanction was arbitrary and capricious?</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">2. Did the circuit court err in its reduction of the suspension period to one month?</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The answer to the first question is affirmative, and we reverse without addressing the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Appellee is a social worker licensed by the Board of Social Work Examiners. In 1981, she and her then-husband, Keith Wagner, who is also a licensed social worker, formed an organization called the Montgomery County Family Life Center (the Center) to provide therapeutic counseling for severely disturbed children and their families. Appellee was President and Executive Director of the Family Life Center and was responsible for clinic supervision, while Wagner served as Vice President and Clinical Director and was responsible for billing. The Center applied for and received in October 1982 status as a provider in the Maryland Medical Assistance Program, commonly referred to as \u201cMedicaid.\u201d Medicaid regulations require that any service billed to the Medicaid program must be provided to the person whose name appears on the Medicaid card, on the stated date, and in the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>prescribed. These regulations also require the provider to make and keep contemporaneous notes of all individual and group therapy sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The Center utilized several irregular billing practices, most of which were masterminded and carried out not by appellee but only by Wagner and Ms. Jane Margolius, the Center\u2019s billing clerk. For example, the Center had a policy to bill Medicaid for a scheduled therapy session if notice of cancellation was not received forty-eight hours prior. In light of other billing practices, however, such a policy seems hardly necessary. Services were regularly billed to Medicaid in conformity with each patient\u2019s treatment plan but regardless of whether the specific service billed was actually performed. Group therapy was billed for each patient assigned to the group but without consulting attendance records and regardless of whether the patient actually attended. Some group therapy sessions were billed for patients who the Center knew were no longer attending at all. Some individual therapy sessions occurring at a time when the patients\u2019 Medicaid numbers were invalid were billed as occurring months earlier. Under a concept called \u201cintensity of service,\u201d individual therapy sessions were billed for individual attention during group sessions or for school visits, telephone visits, and even discussions in staff meetings. Medicaid was often billed in advance of service even if the service was never provided, and billings were submitted for days on which the entire Center was closed. Individual therapy sessions were once billed for those patients whose parents attended a Center party.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In 1984, at a time before the institution of many of the above billing practices, the State Medicaid program conducted a limited inquiry into the Center\u2019s practices. The State requested that the Center provide treatment records for ten Medicaid patients. The Center, however, did not have a policy of making treatment records for every individual visit and instead supplied the patients\u2019 treatment plans. The State informed the Center that such documents were not sufficient and that it needed to provide the contemporaneous notes regarding treatment. The Center staff thereupon recreated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the notes for the required patients and dates and sent the information to the State. The State closed its inquiry with no further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In 1989, the State began a separate audit and requested treatment records for twenty-six patients. For a variety of reasons, these records were not complete. Appellee directed the staff to reconstruct the requested notes as best they could remember, but she never specifically instructed anyone to create phony notes. One therapist informed appellee that he would not create notes concerning some non-existing treatment sessions with appellee\u2019s daughter, who was a regular patient at the Center. Appellee herself created the fraudulent notes concerning her daughter\u2019s non-existent sessions. There is no evidence she participated in any other aspect of the record reconstruction. After the notes were sent to the State, appellee circulated a memorandum to the staff outlining the manner in which therapy notes were to be made in the future. The memo instructed them never to indicate an absence in their notes but instead either to leave a blank space at the date of the absence or to write in some information about the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">On the basis of the documents provided, the State suspected fraud and executed a search warrant, seizing documents, clinical files, and computers from the Center. Among the documents were several incriminating communications between Wagner and Margolius detailing their fraudulent billing practices. Criminal charges were filed against Wagner, Margolius, and appellee. Margolius pled guilty to felony Medicaid fraud in December of 1990. Wagner followed suit in June of 1991, agreeing to plead guilty to Medicaid fraud and conspiracy to commit Medicaid fraud. Both agreed to testify against appellee as part of their plea agreements. Appellee pled guilty to one count of misdemeanor Medicaid fraud for collateral billing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and entered an <em>Alford </em>plea to one misdemeanor count of conspiracy to commit Medicaid fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The Board then filed disciplinary charges against appellee, alleging four violations of the Health Occupations Article. The specific charges were that she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axm\">\u201cViolate[d] the code of ethics adopted and published by the Board,\u201d Md.Code Ann., Health Occ. \u00a7 19-311(7);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">\u201c[Wa]s convicted of or pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or to a crime involving moral turpitude, whether or not any appeal or other proceeding is pending to have the conviction or plea set aside,\u201d <em>id </em>\u00a7 19-311(8);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">\u201cWillfully ma[de] or file[d] a false report or record in the practice of social work,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 19-311(12);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">\u201cSubmitted] a false statement to collect a fee,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 19-311(14).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Merry C. Hudson made over two hundred findings of fact in the course of determining that appellee had violated subsections (7), (8), and (13), but that insufficient evidence existed to find a violation of subsection (12). At that time, the Board\u2019s prosecutor did not request any specific sanction. The ALJ noted that appellee\u2019s violations \u201cmust be considered serious\u201d and that her behavior \u201cadversely affects the public interest and reflects poorly on the profession.\u201d On the other hand, the ALJ noted that except for the instant case appellee had \u201can exemplary record,\u201d and commented on \u201cthe innovative treatment programs [appellee] established at the Center, as well as her personal commitment and dedication to the service of her clients.\u201d After considering the nature and severity of the violations and weighing them against the mitigating evidence, the ALJ recommended that appellee\u2019s license be suspended for one year and that she be placed on probation for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Appellee filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s recommendation with the full Board, and although she argued that there was no basis for such \u201ca significant sanction,\u201d she did not make a specific exception to the length of the sanction. After a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>hearing, the Board adopted all of the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact and analysis except with respect to the sanction. Without expressing any specific disagreement with the ALJ regarding the sanction and, in fact, after repeating substantially all of the ALJ\u2019s analysis thereon, the Board stayed six months of the one-year suspension and retained the two year probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Appellee filed a petition for review in the circuit court, challenging each finding of a violation and also arguing that the sanction was arbitrary and capricious for being disproportionate to the sanction imposed on Wagner. Appellee claimed Wagner had received only a thirty-day suspension, and characterized her own suspension as \u201ctwelve times\u201d as severe. Her argument was that the Board had punished her for refusing to bargain for a sanction, in contrast to Wagner, who apparently had bargained for a reduced sanction. She further alleged that the Board improperly adopted the rationale set forth in a single sentence of the Board prosecutor\u2019s responsive brief before the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">The fact that other participants in the Medicaid scam admitted liability and entered into an agreement, whereby they received less punishment tha[n] [appellee], who is either in denial or has deluded herself and chose not to negotiate an agreement with the Board, should have no bearing on the ALJ\u2019s and, subsequently, the Board\u2019s sanctioning the misconduct committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The Board responded to this argument by asserting that the circuit court did not have any factual basis on which it could find appellee\u2019s sanction to be disproportionate to the one imposed on Wagner, because the record contained \u201cno indication of the terms of any sanction given to Mr. Wagner.\u201d The circuit court upheld every aspect of the Board\u2019s decision except the sanction. In that regard, the court stated, \u201c[I]t strains belief that the Board would mete out a suspension six times longer to [appellee] than to the perpetrator of the actual frauds [Wagner], who displayed flagrant disregard for Medicaid regulations, the Board\u2019s Code of Ethics, and the law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>The court found both sufficient evidence of Wagner\u2019s sanction and sufficient preservation of the issue in a single transcript reference to Wagner\u2019s 30-day suspension made by counsel for appellee during opening arguments at the exceptions hearing before the Board. As for the prosecutor\u2019s statement in his responsive brief to the Board, the court wrote, \u201cThis statement raises the troubling possibility that the Board might have thought it permissible to sanction Petitioner more severely because she exercised her statutory rights and did not admit responsibility.\u201d The court claimed that the Board had determined that appellee\u2019s sanctionable conduct was not as extensive as that of either Wagner or Margolius. Considering this in light of appellee\u2019s good reputation and dedication to her clients, the court found, \u201c[T]he imposition of a one year suspension, with six months stayed, was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d Thereupon, the court modified the suspension such that all but thirty days of the one year period was stayed. The sanction was upheld in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Board alleges that the sanction it imposed is neither arbitrary nor capricious and that the lower court erred in comparing it to a separate sanction concerning separate facts, the terms of which were not factually supported in the record. Appellee responds that the circuit court properly evaluated the relative severity of the two sanctions and that its finding of arbitrariness and capriciousness is adequately supported by the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiN\">Judicial review of the Board\u2019s final decision is authorized by Md.Code Ann., Health Occ. \u00a7 19 \u2014 313(b), and is to be governed by the Administrative Procedures Act, Md.Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10-222. According to subsection (h) of the latter statute, a reviewing court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of he</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">(iv) is affected by any other error or law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">Our role in reviewing an administrative agency decision is precisely the same as that of the circuit court, and we apply the same standards of review as those applied below. <em>Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 303-04, 641 A.2d 899 (1994). Judicial review of agency action has been described as \u201cnarrow.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 576, 650 A.2d 226 (1994). Review is generally restricted to the evidence developed before the agency, although in some circumstances the circuit court may receive additional evidence of arbitrary or capricious action. <em>Ad+Soil, Inc. v. County Comm\u2019rs of Queen Anne\u2019s County, </em>307 Md. 307, 321-22, 513 A.2d 893 (1986). Final agency decisions are presumptively correct, and a court must show deference both to findings of fact and drawings of inferences by an agency. <em>Liberty Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>330 Md. 433, 442-43, 624 A.2d 941 (1993). A court should never substitute its own judgment for that of the agency. <em>Bernstein v. Real Estate Comm\u2019n, </em>221 Md. 221, 230-32, 156 A.2d 657 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">We review here only the severity of the sanction imposed by the Board, as no other appeals have been taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>from any other aspect of the case, and our primary concern is the \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d standard contained in \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(vi). In many prior cases, the \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d standard is treated as nothing more than the default status resulting when an agency action fails either the substantial evidence test or the legality tests contained elsewhere in subsection (h)(3). <em>See, e.g., Moseman v. County Council, </em>99 Md.App. 258, 262, 636 A.2d 499 (1994); <em>Mortimer v. Howard Research, </em>83 Md.App. 432, 441, 575 A.2d 750 (1990). The substantial evidence test is applied to agency findings of fact and requires \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Doctors\u2019 Hosp. v. Maryland Health Resources Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>65 Md.App. 656, 501 A.2d 1324 (1986). Perhaps because the lion\u2019s share of our administrative law cases involves review of agency factual findings, we often describe the reviewing court\u2019s role as limited to determining solely whether the agency\u2019s action is supported by substantial evidence and is not contrary to law, without even mentioning the arbitrary or capricious standard. <em>E.g., United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994). We have sometimes even collapsed the legality test into the mix and referred to the product as the \u201cfairly debatable test\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\">In making a determination of whether the Board of Appeals\u2019 decision is arbitrary, illegal or capricious, the reviewing court must decide whether the question before the agency was fairly debatable. An issue is fairly debatable if reasonable persons could have reached a different conclusion on the evidence and, if so, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. The fairly debatable test is analogous to the clearly erroneous standard under Rule 8-131(c) and a decision is fairly debatable if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><em>Mortimer, </em>83 Md.App. at 441, 575 A.2d 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The instant case is somewhat out of the ordinary because we are reviewing an agency\u2019s selection of a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>sanction from the wide range of possibilities before it. Under Health Occ. \u00a7 19-311, the Board is authorized to \u201creprimand any licensee, place any licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license\u201d if any one of sixteen types of misconduct occurs. There are no further statutory restrictions or guidelines imposed on the exercise of the Board\u2019s discretion in this regard. As is true for all professional licensing boards, the disciplinary actions of the Board of Social Work Examiners are supposed to be \u201ca catharsis for the profession and a prophylactic for the public,\u201d not a punishment. <em>McDonnell v. Comm\u2019n on Medical Discipline, </em>301 Md. 426, 436, 483 A.2d 76 (1984). Yet the law gives broad discretion to the Board to select the appropriate sanction for professional misconduct, and this species of discretion is quite different in nature from that involved in the more common \u201cup-or-down\u201d types of agency decisions, such as making factual determinations or deciding whether to grant a particular petition. In cases of the former, broader type of agency discretion, the arbitrary or capricious test may provide a level of judicial review beyond that provided by the substantial evidence test, which is primarily designed for reviewing the latter type of agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Even in cases reviewing the severity of agency sanctions for arbitrariness or capriciousness, some Maryland cases have disposed of the entire issue purely on the basis of whether the decision to impose a sanction satisfies the substantial evidence test. <em>Board of Educ. of Prince George\u2019s County v. Waeldner, </em>298 Md. 354, 363-64, 470 A.2d 332 (1984); <em>Hoyt v. Police Comm\u2019r of Baltimore City, </em>279 Md. 74, 90-93, 367 A.2d 924 (1977). In doing so, the Court appears not to be reviewing the degree of the sanction at all. In other cases, however, the Court has applied the arbitrary or capricious standard to review the severity of a sanction, even though the decision to sanction satisfies the substantial evidence test. <em>Resetar v. State Bd. of Educ., </em>284 Md. 537, 561-63, 399 A.2d 225 (1979). In <em>Resetar, </em>for example, the Court of Appeals upheld an agency sanction against the charge that it was too severe under the circumstances of the case. The Court noted, \u201cIt is impossible to catalogue just what would or would not consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>tute arbitrary action on the part of an agency ... in imposing sanctions, since each situation must be judged on its own facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 399 A.2d 225. Other viable theories of arbitrary or capricious sanctions may include taking improper information into consideration in selecting the sanction, <em>id. </em>at 561-62, 399 A.2d 225, or deviating unexplainedly from prior established precedents. <em>Eaton v. Rosewood Ctr., </em>86 Md.App. 366, 374-76, 586 A.2d 804 (1991) (citing <em>Montgomery County v. Anastasi </em>77 Md.App. 126, 137, 549 A.2d 753 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Appellee\u2019s argument is that it was arbitrary or capricious for her sanction to be more severe than that imposed on Wagner because Wagner was \u201cmore culpable\u201d than appellee in engaging in the fraud at the Center. We first point out that, to the degree that this issue is at all dependent on the substantial evidence test, we find ample evidence in the record to support the imposition of the one-year suspension with six months stayed plus the two-year probationary period. The appropriateness of this particular sanction was \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d as is demonstrated by the fact that the ALJ originally suggested no six-month stay during the year\u2019s suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We reject the lower court\u2019s efforts to ascribe an improper motive to the Board via the Board prosecutor\u2019s written brief. We review the agency\u2019s decision, not arguments before the agency. <em>Williams v. McCardell, </em>198 Md. 320, 330, 84 A.2d 52 (1951) (\u201c[Olrdinarily courts are concerned with results rather than methods. They review the action, not the opinion, of the board.\u201d). The Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and indicates no improper considerations. It was error to read any external statement into the Board\u2019s decision. Furthermore, the lower court interpreted the prosecutor\u2019s statement as if it evinced a desire to punish appellee for failing to engage in bargaining, but such a reading is precisely the opposite of what the plain language of the statement imparts. The statement posits that any bargaining engaged in by others \u201cshould have no bearing on\u201d appellee\u2019s sanction, <em>i.e., </em>that appellee should be sanctioned based on the circumstances of her own case and not with reference to any other case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>This statement affords no basis for concluding that the Board improperly sought to punish appellee for failing to engage in bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Appellee\u2019s argument of disparate treatment is dependent upon demonstrating that her sanction is actually harsher or more severe than Wagner\u2019s; the claim must fail due to the lack of any evidence in the record setting forth the terms of Wagner\u2019s sanction. The lower court relied exclusively on an oral statement made by counsel for appellee in argument before the Board. Oral arguments are not evidence. <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 317, 681 A.2d 30 (1996). There is nothing else in the record showing the terms of Wagner\u2019s sanction. A substantially similar situation was present in <em>Eaton, </em>when the appellant claimed that the Secretary of the Department of Personnel\u2019s decision to intervene in the case was an arbitrary or capricious act, since the Secretary had never before intervened in any other case. We noted, \u201c[Appellant\u2019s] argument fails for several reasons, not the least of which is the fact that the record is devoid of any evidence concerning the frequency, or, for that matter, infrequency with which the Secretary has overruled the decisions of [the Secretary\u2019s Designee].\u201d 86 Md.App. at 375, 586 A.2d 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">We are aware that appellee provided the circuit court with a copy of a public notice of Wagner\u2019s thirty-day suspension as an exhibit to a reply brief, but that document never became part of the record. The lower court was sitting as a reviewing court and could not consider new evidence, except according to \u00a7 10-222(f) of the Administrative Procedure Act, which was not invoked here and which would have required a remand. Even if the lower court could have re-opened the record to admit new evidence, there is nothing to indicate that it did so, and the court in its memorandum declined to place any reliance on this document. Similarly, when the Board finally submitted a copy of Wagner\u2019s actual sanctioning document as an exhibit to its motion to alter or amend the court\u2019s judgment, such evidence was not properly entered into the record. Because the record contains no evidence of the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Wagner\u2019s sanction, appellee\u2019s claim that her sanction is out of all proportion to Wagner\u2019s sanction cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">There are, of course, other problems with appellee\u2019s argument, which we address briefly. Sanctioning is primarily individualized in nature; there is no right to receive the same sanction as a co-participant in the underlying misconduct. <em>See Hoyt, </em>279 Md. at 88, 367 A.2d 924. Moreover, the record indicates that appellee and Wagner engaged in very different types of misconduct and were not necessarily being sanctioned based on the same acts. The Board adopted ALJ findings that appellee engaged in collateral billing, fabricated therapy notes for her daughter\u2019s billing records, and instructed the staff never to note a patient\u2019s absence. There is no finding that Wagner took part in these acts. Wagner and Margolius engaged in long-term fraudulent billing practices, of. which appellee apparently knew nothing. The record does not even indicate the specific violations supporting Wagner\u2019s sanction, nor which specific acts constituted such violations. Under these circumstances, there is no basis for directly comparing the severity of the respective sanctions. Contrary to appellee\u2019s contentions and the lower court\u2019s findings, there is no indication from the record that the Board found Wagner\u2019s misconduct to be \u201cmore culpable\u201d than appellee\u2019s in any relevant sense. Furthermore, the Board may have (and should have) based its sanctions on all the circumstances of the two cases before them and not just on the parties\u2019 conduct. Appellee alleges that Wagner bargained with the Board for a consent sanction, and, if true, this fact alone could support a decision by the Board to impose a lesser sanction on Wagner than he would have otherwise received, further attenuating the comparability of Wagner\u2019s and appellee\u2019s sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We also note that, having had the opportunity to review the terms of Wagner\u2019s sanction even though it is not a part of the record, it is by no means clear that his sanction is less harsh than appellee\u2019s. The lower court focused only on the duration of the respective license suspensions, but the complete sanction also includes probationary restrictions, which differ great<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ly. Appellee\u2019s probationary period is two years in duration and commences at the end of her license suspension. With the successful completion of probation, she may petition for full re-instatement. Wagner\u2019s probationary period began immediately and is indefinite, although he may petition to terminate his probation after three years. While both were instructed to take an ethics course, Wagner was also forced to take a business course. While both were to be supervised by a mentor, Wagner was also subjected to a therapist\u2019s supervision. Unlike appellee, Wagner may be immediately suspended from practice with only twenty-four hours notice upon recommendation by either his mentor or his therapist. With Board approval, his therapist or mentor may demand additional probationary restrictions. His license is made explicitly revocable upon the occurrence of any further violation, and even when he petitions to end his probation after three years, the Board reserved the right to make further modifications. Wagner is clearly subjected to more thorough supervision over a longer probationary period, but the lower court apparently was not aware of this aspect of the sanctions when it determined from the limited record that appellee was sanctioned \u201cmore severely\u2019 than Wagner.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Because there is no basis in the actual record for the lower court\u2019s conclusion that appellee\u2019s sanction was any more severe than Wagner\u2019s, appellee\u2019s claim that the Board\u2019s sanction was arbitrary or capricious fails. We reverse the lower court\u2019s order and remand with instructions to affirm the Board\u2019s order. We thus have no occasion to address the Board\u2019s further argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO AFFIRM THE ORDER OF THE STATE BOARD OF SOCIAL WORK EXAMINERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\">.
