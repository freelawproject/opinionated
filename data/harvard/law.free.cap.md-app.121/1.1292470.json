After experiencing water and drainage problems with their properties, they brought suit in the Circuit Court for Frederick County against appellees, the builder of their houses and its general partners, alleging violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, Maryland Code, (1990 Repl.Vol., 1997 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 13-301 through 13-501 of the Commercial Law Article (the \u201cCPA\u201d), and asserting claims in contract, warranty, and tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">From July 19, 1996 to August 16, 1996, the case was tried before a jury presided over by Judge Mary Ann Stepler. At the close of appellants\u2019 case, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion for judgment on the CPA claim. The remaining claims were submitted to the jury, which returned a verdict in favor of appellants for breach of contract, breach of express warranty, and negligent misrepresentation and awarded each appellant $1.00 in nominal damages. Appellants challenge the judgment on appeal, presenting three questions for review, which we have reordered and slightly rephrased:</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">I. Did the trial court err in ruling that appellants were limited to nominal damages for their property loss?</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">II. Did the trial court err in ruling that appellants were not entitled to damages for \u201closs of use and enjoyment\u201d of their houses in addition to damages for injury to their property value?</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">III. Did the trial court err in failing to submit the Consumer Protection Act claim to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">We find no reversible error on the part of the trial court. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>FACTS<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">In 1989, Kingsbrook Limited Partnership (\u201cKLP\u201d) began developing a 217 acre tract of land that it owned in Frederick County into \u201cKingsbrook,\u201d a residential community. KLP divided the property into lots and sold them to appellee Lovell Regency Homes Limited Partnership (\u201cLovell Regency\u201d). Lovell Regency constructed single-family dwellings on the lots and sold the improved residential properties to interested buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Between July, 1992 and September, 1993, appellants James and Janice Hall, Mickey and Mary Ellen Mitchell, Richard and Linda Harcum, and Ronald and Lorene Pregenzer (\u201cthe homeowners\u201d) purchased from Lovell Regency lots improved by newly-constructed dwellings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">After the homeowners moved into their new houses, they noticed that the streets in their section of Kingsbrook would flood after heavy rains or snow, that their yards collected water and stayed \u201csoggy\u201d for long stretches of time, and that their sump pumps continuously pumped out large volumes of water. The Halls found standing water and mud around the perimeter of the their house. Water accumulated in an unpaved portion of the Halls\u2019 basement. Their basement walls became discolored and \u201csplotched\u201d and developed cracks. Excessive moisture in their basement caused mold and fungi to proliferate. These water and drainage problems prevented the Halls from finishing their basement, adding a deck to their house, or fencing their yard. The other three families experienced similar problems with their properties: water in their basements, cracks in basement walls and floors, exterior wall cracks, and ground sinking. They, too, were unable to finish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>their basements and to use their properties as they had planned. The homeowners remained in their properties nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In February, 1995, the homeowners filed the instant law suit against Lovell Regency and against Lovell Homes, Inc. and Lovell Regency Homes Corporation, the general partners in Lovell Regency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Their complaint sets forth claims for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, breach of implied warranties, breach of express warranty, fraud, breach of contract, and violation of the CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">At trial, the homeowners presented evidence, including expert witness testimony, demonstrating that Lovell had misrepresented and warranted that their houses had been waterproofed; that Lovell had showed them and other prospective buyers a Camelot model house with a finished basement, thereby misrepresenting that the houses they were purchasing would be suitable for use in fully finished conditions; that Lovell\u2019s sales brochures misleadingly touted the ideal location and setting of the community; that Lovell expressly warranted that there were no water problems in the neighborhood and that the houses would contain dry, usable basements; and that Lovell breached its construction contracts by failing to waterproof the houses as promised, by building the houses in violation of certain zoning and building standards, by building the houses near or in a flood plain and on soil not suitable for construction of that sort, and by not building the houses in conformity with sound engineering standards but instead with structural defects that were exposing them to potential health hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">According to the homeowners and their expert witnesses, the defects in their properties were irreparable and their properties were uninhabitable. The homeowners called Peter Vidi, a real estate appraiser, to testify about damages. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Vidi opined as follows about the present fair market value of each family\u2019s property:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">[T]he properties are for all intents and purposes not marketable to someone who understands the degree of risk that is involved in purchasing the properties ... [T]he values of the properties were negligible and that relative to their original market value, their fair market value, at their purchase prices, that they had lost all of their value, that the fair market value that they paid at the time that they paid it was not in my opinion a well informed buyer purchasing what they knew [the value] to be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Mr. Vidi explained that when real property has a \u201czero\u201d fair market value, the value is not measurable: \u201cit has no quantification.\u201d He opined that because the present fair market value of each family\u2019s property was zero, each family had lost a sum equal to the total purchase price of its property plus the amount of any down payment made and the cost of any subsequent improvements to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">On cross-examination, Mr. Vidi acknowledged that he had not obtained any information about comparable sales of properties in the neighborhood and that because he considered that the defects in the properties could not be cured, he did not obtain estimates of repair costs. Mr. Vidi did not supply an opinion about the fair market values of the properties with the alleged defects at the times that they were purchased. He also did not express an opinion about the present fair market values of the properties without the alleged defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">On direct examination, homeowner Richard Harcum was asked: \u201cDo you know what the market value of your home is?\u201d Mr. Harcum responded, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to answer that right now. I know that I would not feel comfortable selling [my] house at market value, which is in the $220,000 to $230,000 range.\u201d When asked the basis for that testimony, Mr. Harcum stated, \u201cJust my general knowledge of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>houses like mine tend to sell for when they\u2019re up for sale.\u201d Later in Mr. Harcum\u2019s direct examination, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">MR. STEELMAN: If a willing and knowledgeable buyer was to be told that there\u2019s no problems to a house, there\u2019s no water problems, the community is beautiful, its everything in the brochures, what would you put the value of a comparable house like yours?</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">MR. HARCUM: In a condition where everything\u2019s fine, I think I said that I would guess my house is around $220,000.00 to $230,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The homeowners introduced into evidence the contracts of sales and settlement sheets for their properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">At the close of the homeowners\u2019 case, Lovell moved for judgment on numerous grounds. The trial court ruled that the homeowners could not recover damages for emotional distress or punitive damages and reserved ruling on other issues raised in the motion. Subsequently, the trial court granted Lovell\u2019s motion for judgment on the CPA claim. It concluded that the homeowners had not presented cost of repair evidence and that they had not submitted evidence competent to show the difference between the fair market values of their properties with and without defects at a given point in time. On that basis, the court ruled that the homeowners\u2019 evidence was not legally sufficient to permit the jury to award contract, warranty, or tort damages for loss in fair market value measured under an \u201cout of pocket\u201d or \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d test. Accordingly, they had not submitted proof that they had sustained actual injury or loss, which is necessary to support a private right of action under the CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">In its case, Lovell introduced evidence showing that it had inspected the homeowners\u2019 properties and that the water problems about which they complained, to the extent that they .existed, could be repaired for a total sum of $10,000.00 to $12,000.00.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The homeowners requested a jury instruction on damages for loss in fair market value. The trial court refused to grant the instruction, stating: \u201cWe just don\u2019t have [in evidence] two values at the same point of time to award either out of pocket or benefit of bargain ...\u201d The homeowners also requested that the jury be instructed on damages for \u201closs of use and enjoyment\u201d of their properties. The court denied that request as well, ruling that the evidence presented by the homeowners on \u201closs of use and enjoyment\u201d was speculative. The court refused to grant an instruction requested by Lovell that would have directed the jury that if it found for the homeowners, it could award nominal damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The trial court instructed the jury on damages as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">I [ ... ] ruled that there was no evidence that could be submitted to the jury as a result of any loss in value or loss of use of the properties. Therefore if you return a verdict for any of the [homeowners] on any of their claims, you may award such [homeowners] those damages that compensate them for any actual cost of repair to their properties. If, however, you return a verdict for any of the [homeowners] on any of their claims, but you do not specifically find that such [homeowner] has proved actual costs of repair damages, you may not award such [homeowner] damages for any other alleged injuries. In this situation, the amount of the verdict would be for $1.00 to each [homeowner].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">What this means is, if you find that____there is evidence, by a preponderance of the evidence, of damages of repair, then you proceed to make that finding. If you find that the [homeowner] has not shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, damages of repair, but you still find [Lovell] liable, then you enter what we call nominal damages, and that would be for $1.00. That is, if you find that there is liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The jury deliberated and returned a verdict against the homeowners and in favor of Lovell on the claims for negligence, fraud, and breach of implied warranties. It found for the homeowners and against Lovell on the claims for breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>contract, breach of express warranty, and negligent misrepresentation and awarded nominal damages. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The homeowners argue that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could not award damages for loss in fair market value of their properties or for \u201closs of use and enjoyment\u201d of their properties and in directing the jury, in effect, to award nominal damages if it found in their favor on any of the claims. Lovell counters that the trial court correctly ruled that the homeowners did not present evidence legally sufficient to allow the jury to award those types of damages and that it properly instructed the jury in accordance with that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">In reviewing the propriety of a trial court\u2019s granting of a particular jury instruction or refusal to grant an instruction, our task is to determine whether the instruction at issue was a correct exposition of the law, whether it was accurate in light of the evidence before the jury, and whether, if a requested instruction was refused, its substance was fairly covered by the instructions that were actually given. <em>Rustin v. Smith, </em>104 Md.App. 676, 679-80, 657 A.2d 412 (1995). In this case, the instruction at issue incorporated the court\u2019s prior ruling on damages. The compound nature of the instruction means that, in passing on whether the court\u2019s instruction was accurate in light of the evidence before the jury, we must undertake the same analysis as the trial court and decide whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the homeowners, was legally sufficient to permit the jury to award damages for loss in value or \u201closs in use of enjoyment\u201d of the properties. <em>See Toft v. Pimentel, </em>108 Md.App. 206, 222, 671 A.2d 99 (1996). We embark upon our task by briefly reviewing the measures of damages applicable to the homeowners\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>In tort actions founded on misrepresentation, \u201cthe aim of compensation ... is to put the buyer, as nearly as practicable, in the position he would have been had he not been defrauded.\u201d <em>Beardmore v. T.D. Burgess Co., </em>245 Md. 387, 390, 226 A.2d 329 (1967). In fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation actions in which a plaintiff has purchased real property that was not as it was represented to be, Maryland law applies a \u201cflexible\u201d measure of damages that allows the plaintiff to chose between two tests for damages. <em>Hinkle v. Rockville Motor Co., </em>262 Md. 502, 511, 278 A.2d 42 (1971); <em>Ward Development Co. v. Ingrao, </em>63 Md.App. 645, 659, 493 A.2d 421 (1985). The preferred test is the \u201cout of pocket\u201d rule, <em>Weisman v. Connors, </em>69 Md.App. 732, 749-50, 519 A.2d 795 (1987), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>312 Md. 428, 540 A.2d 783 (1988), which is \u201cthe difference between the amount of the purchase price the buyer has paid and the actual value of the property on the date it was sold.\u201d <em>Beardmore, </em>245 Md. at 390, 226 A.2d 329. The other acceptable measure of damages for misrepresentation is the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d test, in which damages are \u201cthe difference between the actual value of the property at the time of making the contract and the value that it would have possessed if the representations had been true.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Call Carl, Inc. v. BP Oil Corp., </em>554 F.2d 623, 629 (4th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 923, 98 S.Ct. 400, 54 L.Ed.2d 280 (1977)(applying Maryland law).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The amount of damages recoverable for breach of contract is that which will place the injured party in the monetary position he would have occupied if the contract had been properly performed. <em>Beard v. S/E Joint Venture, </em>321 Md. 126, 133, 581 A.2d 1275 (1990), <em>reconsideration denied, </em>322 Md. 225, 587 A.2d 239 (1991); <em>Casualty Ins. Co. v. Messenger, </em>181 Md. 295, 301-02, 29 A.2d 653 (1943); <em>National Micrographics v. OCE-Industries, </em>55 Md.App. 526, 538, 465 A.2d 862 (1983), <em>cert. denied, Oce-Indus. v. National Micro-graphics, </em>298 Md. 395, 470 A.2d 353 (1984); <em>Dialist Co. v. Pulford, </em>42 Md.App. 173, 179, 399 A.2d 1374 (1979). In a breach of contract action for defective performance of a real estate construction contract, the primary measure of damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>is the cost of repairing or remedying the defect. <em>Andrulis v. Levin Construction, </em>331 Md. 354, 370, 628 A.2d 197 (1993); <em>Gilbert Const. Co. v. Gross, </em>212 Md. 402, 411, 129 A.2d 518 (1957); <em>Ray v. Eurice, </em>201 Md. 115, 129, 93 A.2d 272 (1952). If the plaintiff presents proof that repairing the defect in the property would be infeasible or impracticable, however, an acceptable secondary measure of damages is the loss in value of the property caused by the breach, <em>i.e., </em>the difference between the fair market value of the property without the defect and the fair market value of the property with the defect. <em>Gilbert, </em>212 Md. at 411, 129 A.2d 518; <em>Mullan v. Hacker, </em>187 Md. 261, 270, 49 A.2d 640 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Damages for breach of contract \u201cseek to vindicate the promisee\u2019s expectation interest.\u201d <em>Andrulis, </em>331 Md. at 374, 628 A.2d 197. Expectation interest damages include losses sustained, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cout of pocket damages,\u201d and gains lost, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d damages. <em>Beard, </em>321 Md. at 133, 581 A.2d 1275. Compensatory damages for breach of contract may be recovered subject to \u201climitations of remoteness and speculativeness.\u201d <em>Dialist, </em>42 Md.App. at 179, 399 A.2d 1374. Such damages \u201cmust be proved with reasonable certainty, and may not be based on speculation or conjecture____\u201d <em>Asibem Assoc., Ltd. v. Rill, </em>264 Md. 272, 276, 286 A.2d 160 (1972). Finally, the measure of damages for the breach of an express warranty in the sale of real property is the same as the measure of damages for breach of contract. <em>Hooton v. Mumaw Plumbing, </em>271 Md. 565, 573, 318 A.2d 514 (1974) (applying contract law and stating that the \u201c \u2018measure of damages [in a breach of warranty action] is that amount of money which will render that which is guaranteed to be as warranted.\u2019 \u2019\u2019(quoting <em>Correlli v. National, </em>240 Md. 627, 632, 214 A.2d 919 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">In the case at bar, the contract, tort, and warranty damages sought by the homeowners and potentially recoverable by them were essentially identical. Because the homeowners maintained that the defects in their properties could not be cured, they did not introduce cost of repair evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>instead sought to recover contract and warranty damages for the diminution in the fair market values of their properties caused by Lovell\u2019s breach, under the \u201cout of pocket\u201d or \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d tests. They also sought damages in tort for loss in value using the same \u201cout of pocket\u201d and \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d tests. The valuation evidence on which the homeowners based these damage claims consisted of the \u201czero\u201d present fair market values of their properties with defects (testimony of Mr. Vidi); the estimated \u201c$220,000.00 to $230,000.00\u201d present fair market values of their properties without defects (testimony of Mr. Harcum); and the sums that they paid to purchase their properties from Lovell (contracts and settlement sheets).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The trial court\u2019s ruling on damages for loss in fair market value rested on the following considerations and decisions about the state of the evidence: 1) the contract prices for the properties were not competent evidence to establish their fair market values without defects at the times that they were purchased; 2) no evidence was introduced to show the fair market values of the properties with defects at the times that they were purchased; and 3) Mr. Harcum\u2019s testimony was not competent to establish the present fair market value of properties like his and like the other three properties but without defects, as that, testimony was speculative. The court reasoned that because the only admissible valuation figure introduced into evidence by the homeowners was Mr. Vidi\u2019s testimony that the present fair market values of their properties with defects was zero, the evidence was not legally sufficient to permit the jury to award damages for loss in fair market value. Even if the contract prices for the properties constituted competent evidence of their values without the alleged defects when they were purchased by the homeowners, the loss of value evidence remained legally insufficient because the only figures in evidence for the fair market values of the properties with the alleged defects pertained to the present and not to the times of the purchases. In short, the case was missing valuation evidence showing the difference between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>fair market values of the properties with and without defects at one point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">The homeowners assign several errors to the trial court\u2019s damages ruling that together comprise their argument that loss in value damages was a jury issue, contrary to the trial court\u2019s instruction. First, they contend that the court erred in ruling that the fair market values of their properties in non-defective conditions at the times of the purchases could not be proven by their contract prices, as reflected on their settlement sheets. Lovell counters that the trial court correctly ruled that the evidence of contract (or settlement) prices paid was incompetent to establish the values of their properties without defects at their times of purchase, under <em>Andrulis v. Levin Construction Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We examine <em>Andrulis </em>in some detail because it has broader relevance to the issues presented. In that case, purchasers of a newly constructed residential dwelling claimed that the builder had breached statutorily implied warranties either by constructing their house without waterproofing and a foundation drainage system or by constructing their house with defects in waterproofing and in the drainage system. In a bench trial, the circuit court found as a fact that the builder had not installed a drainage system. The court did not award damages for the sum sought by the purchasers to install such a system, however, because it found that the cost to cure would be unreasonably high. Instead, it awarded the purchasers one-half of the amount they sought, as \u201cdiminution in value\u201d damages. On appeal, the builder argued that there was no evidence to support that damage award and that nominal damages should have been awarded instead. <em>See, e.g., Asibem, </em>264 Md. at 276, 286 A.2d 160 (if plaintiff in breach of contract action fails to prove compensatory damages he is only entitled to recover nominal damages). In an unreported opinion, we reversed, holding that the trial court had erred in ruling that the cost of cure was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The Court of Appeals, affirming in part and reversing in part, explained that the ordinary \u201ccost of repair\u201d measure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>damages in a defective performance breach of contract action is limited by the economic waste doctrine, which provides that, if the breaching party proves that the cost to repair the defect is such as will result in unreasonable economic waste, the proper measure of damages becomes the difference between the fair market value of the property as contracted for (without the defect) and as performed (with the defect). In an action involving improvements to real estate, whether repair will produce economic waste is a question of \u201cdisproportionality\u201d that must be determined by comparing the cost to cure to \u201cany difference between the value of the property after the corrective work is done with the value of the property absent the corrective work.\u201d <em>Andrulis, </em>381 Md. at 374-75, 628 A.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The Court in <em>Andrulis </em>held that the trial court erred by applying the doctrine of economic waste without ascertaining those values. In its discussion of the valuation evidence that the trial court needed to consider when comparing the cost of repair to any difference between the value of the property with the corrective work and the value of the property without the corrective work, the Court observed: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 375, 628 A.2d 197 (emphasis supplied). In the case at bar, Lovell maintains that the comments highlighted above support the trial court\u2019s ruling that evidence of the contract prices paid for the homeowners\u2019 properties was not competent to establish their fair market values without defects at the times they were purchased. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The trial court sought to supply the missing evidence of values by substituting the reaction of a hypothetical buyer, armed in negotiations with the knowledge that the foundation drainage system is defective. That substitution constituted speculation. Nor should we assume that the Contract price represents the value of the premises, as warranted, and that the Contract price, less the cost of a drainage system as estimated by [the purchasers\u2019 expert witness] represents the value of the premises without a drainage system. It may be that the value of [the purchasers\u2019] house, without a drainage system, is depressed by more than the cost of the corrective work. It may be that buyers of this class of property in Montgomery County would prefer to purchase a code-complying house, rather than to endure the aggravation of having the corrective work done. There is no evidence on these points.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The generally accepted meaning of \u201cfair market value,\u201d as defined in condemnation cases, is \u201cthe price as of the valuation date for the highest and best use of the property which a [seller], willing but not obligated to sell, would accept for the property, and which a [buyer], willing but not obligated to buy, would pay....\u201d Md. Ann. Code (1996 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-105 of the Real Prop. Article. This definition has been adopted in contract cases involving real estate transactions. <em>See Asibem, </em>264 Md. at 277, 286 A.2d 160. The admission of evidence of contract price to show fair market value is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Maryland Community Developers, Inc. v. State Roads Commission, </em>261 Md. 205, 209, 274 A.2d 641 (1971); <em>City of Baltimore v. Schreiber, </em>243 Md. 546, 551, 221 A.2d 663 (1966); <em>Baltimore v. Smith &amp; Schwarz Brick Co., </em>80 Md. 458, 473, 31 A. 423 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The Court in <em>Andrulis </em>neither stated nor implied that the contract purchase price of real property may never be competent evidence of its fair market value at the time of sale. There is case law in Maryland that holds that damages for breach of a contract to convey real property must be based on fair market value at the time of the breach and not on contract price. <em>See Clagett v. Easterday, </em>42 Md. 617, 628 (1875). That law is inapposite, however, as the non-performance of the contract means that there is no evidence that a willing but not obligated buyer in fact purchased the property from a willing but not obligated seller for that price. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>that evidence existed. Proof of the contract prices paid by the homeowners for their properties in what they thought were non-defective states was not <em>conclusive </em>evidence of the properties\u2019 fair market values. It was <em>competent </em>evidence for consideration by the jury nonetheless. As we shall explain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>later in our discussion, however, any error on the trial court\u2019s part in ruling this evidence inadmissable was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The homeowners next contend that the trial court erred in ruling that they did not present competent evidence of the present fair market values of their properties without the alleged defects. They advance four sub-arguments to support their contention. First, they maintain that these values were not relevant because the \u201cout of pocket\u201d damages test relates to values as of the time of sale, not as of the time of trial. The homeowners are correct that, to the extent that they were seeking \u201cout of pocket\u201d damages, values as of the time of trial were not relevant. \u201cOut of pocket\u201d damages for loss in fair market value are determined as of the time of the transaction which, in this case, was the date of the purchase of each piece of property. Yet, the homeowners were seeking damages under the alternative \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d test as well. Because damages under that test may account for loss in value of an appreciating asset, they may be determined as of the date of the transaction or thereafter. Accordingly, the trial court properly considered the question whether there was competent valuation evidence relating to a point in time after the sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The homeowners also argue that the trial court \u201cfailed to give effect to the venerable presumption of continuance of a given state or condition,\u201d which would have permitted the jury to conclude that the present fair market values of the properties without defects were the same as the contract prices paid for the properties at the times that they were purchased. This argument has no basis in law or reality. The homeowners cite two cases to support the proposition that the value of real estate is a \u201cgiven state or condition\u201d that the law will presume will continue into the future: <em>Burgess v. Lloyd, </em>7 Md. 178, 199 (1854), and <em>Hammond\u2019s Lessee v. Inloes, </em>4 Md. 138, 172 (1853). Both cases concern a presumption of continuation of title to real property. They do not apply any such presumption of continuation to property values.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>In <em>Stitzel v. Kurz, </em>18 Md.App. 525, 308 A.2d 430, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 761 (1973), we explained the presumption at issue as follows: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">When it is shown that a condition existed at a certain time, and the condition is one which by its nature is relatively permanent, rather than transitory or changeable, it is rational to infer that the same condition existed before and after the time shown, for a length of time reasonably consistent with the circumstances, unless there is evidence from which a change in the condition could reasonably be inferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 538, 308 A.2d 430 (emphasis supplied). The value of a piece of real estate is not \u201ca condition ... which by its nature is relatively permanent.\u201d To the contrary, property values are by nature inconstant, changing, and highly variable. It would have been improper for the trial court to have instructed the jury that it could derive valuation figures for the present fair market values of the properties without defects by presuming that their fair market values as of their purchase dates continued into the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Next, the homeowners maintain that the trial court erred in ruling that Mr. Harcum\u2019s testimony about the present fair market values of their properties without defects was speculative and thus legally insufficient to support their damages claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are mindful in addressing this issue that a trial court is vested with substantial discretion in the reception or rejection of evidence. <em>State v. Conn, </em>286 Md. 406, 425, 408 A.2d 700 (1979); <em>Impala Platinum v. Impala Sales, </em>283 Md. 296, 332, 389 A.2d 887 (1978), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">In <em>Webster v. Archer, </em>176 Md. 245, 4 A.2d 434 (1939), the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">[O]ne \u2018having sufficient knowledge on the subject and acquainted with the land in question\u2019 may be permitted to express an opinion as to the value of land, even though he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>not an expert or specially qualified by training and experience to value land. But it is implicit in that rule that it must appear that even such a witness must have some knowledge of land values in the neighborhood of that which he is asked to value ... otherwise his valuation would not be a reasoned opinion but a mere conjecture or guess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX\"><em>Id. </em>at 256-57, 4 A.2d 434 (quoting <em>Baltimore v. Smith &amp; Schwarz Brick Co., </em>80 Md. 458, 472, 31 A. 423 (1895)). As we stated in <em>Anderson v. Sawyer, </em>23 Md.App. 612, 618, 329 A.2d 716 (1974), \u201cthe opinion or conclusion of an expert or lay witness is of no greater probative value than that warranted by the soundness of his underlying reasons and facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We note that the comment by Mr. Harcum that the homeowners contend was competent evidence of the present fair market values of their properties without defects was not elicited in response to a question on that topic. Rather, it was a side remark given in answer to the question whether he knew the present fair market value of his house with its defects. When Mr. Harcum was asked the basis for his observation that the \u201cmarket value\u201d of \u201ca comparable house\u201d without defects \u201cis around $220,000.00 to $230,000.00,\u201d he cited only his \u201cgeneral knowledge of what houses like mine tend to sell for,\u201d which he characterized as a \u201cguess.\u201d There was no evidence from Mr. Harcum or from any extrinsic source showing that Mr. Harcum was familiar with or had any knowledge about non-defective properties in the neighborhood that were similar to his property and, further, that he was informed about sales of any such properties and the sums for which the properties had been sold. (In fact, Mr. Harcum\u2019s testimony that the approximate value he would assign to a \u201chouse\u201d like his \u201c[i]n a condition where everything\u2019s fine\u201d was not expressed in terms of a comparable property in that neighborhood.) In the absence of competent foundation evidence for his opinion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Mr. Harcum\u2019s testimony was just as he described it; a \u201cguess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In the final prong of their four-pronged challenge to the trial court\u2019s ruling that they did not introduce competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>evidence of the present fair market values of their properties without defects, the homeowners argue that those valuations were irrelevant to the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d damages that they sought; they \u201cwere entitled to a home worth what they paid for it and to compensation for what they did not but should have obtained.\u201d This argument misconceives the nature of the loss in value damages for which the law allows recovery in contract, warranty, and tort actions such as this. It also leads us back to our examination of <em>Andrulis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">As we have explained, under the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d test, a plaintiff may be compensated for the lost benefit of his bargain by receipt of a sum in damages equal to the difference between the value of the property in its \u201cas represented\u201d condition and the value of the property in its \u201cas actually existed\u201d condition. A plaintiff seeking damages under the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d test might present evidence showing that, but for the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation, he now would own property worth \u201cx\u201d when in fact he now owns property worth \u201cx minus y.\u201d Alternatively, he might present evidence showing that, but for the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation, he would have purchased property worth \u201cx\u201d when in fact he purchased property worth only \u201cx minus y.\u201d (In the latter case, \u201cout of pocket\u201d damages and \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d damages would be the same.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Although spoken in the context of a discussion of the doctrine of economic waste, the Court\u2019s words in <em>Andrulis </em>implicitly convey the principle that to recover damages for loss in fair market value of real property, whether under the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d test or the \u201cout of pocket\u201d test, and whether in contract, warranty, or tort, the plaintiffs evidence must establish the difference between two like valuation variables <em>at one point of time. </em>It is the difference between two valuation figures at one point in time that quantifies the plaintiffs \u201clost benefit\u201d or his \u201cout of pocket\u201d loss. On the facts before it, the <em>Andrulis </em>Court explained that a loss in fair market value equation using as valuation variables the contract price of the premises as warranted and the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>price of the premises less the cost of a drainage system would not be reliable because \u201cthe value of the ... house, without a drainage system, [may have been] depressed by more than the cost of the corrective work.\u201d <em>Andrulis, </em>331 Md. at 375, 628 A.2d 197. In other words, an equation comparing the fair market value of property as represented at the time of purchase to the actual fair market value of the property at a later point in time is not workable, as the latter value may be accounted for by factors other than the absence of the represented attributes of the property. Accurate determination of loss in fair market value caused by a defendant\u2019s breach or wrongdoing and not by other factors requires comparison of valuation figures from one point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">If the trial court had ruled the evidence of the contract purchase prices competent to show the fair market values of the properties without defects on their purchase dates, the homeowners\u2019 valuation evidence would have consisted of those figures and the zero present fair market values provided by Mr. Vidi. The jury could not have determined loss in value damages under the \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d test from these figures alone. Without evidence of the fair market values of the properties with defects at the times of the purchases, \u201cout of pocket\u201d damages were not measurable. Likewise, the jury could not have used these figures to determine damages under the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d test because there was no evidence of the present fair market values of the properties without defects (needed to permit comparison between \u201cpresent\u201d values) and there was no evidence of the fair market values of the properties with defects at the times that they were purchased (needed to permit comparison between \u201ctime of purchase\u201d values). To award loss in value damages, the jury would have had to resort to improper speculation about a missing valuation variable.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The trial court correctly ruled, consistent with the reasoning of the Court in <em>Andrulis, </em>that the homeowners failed to present evidence legally sufficient to allow the jury to award loss in fair market value damages in contract, warranty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>or tort. <em>See, e.g., Dassing v. Fred Frederick, </em>240 Md. 621, 214 A.2d 925 (1965) (directed verdict properly entered in fraudulent misrepresentation action by purchaser of vehicle against seller where purchaser failed to produce evidence of the actual value of the vehicle at the time of purchase, a variable needed to prove the out of pocket damages they sought). The court\u2019s jury instruction in accordance with that ruling was proper as well.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The homeowners also contend that the trial court erred in not allowing the jury to award damages for \u201closs of use and enjoyment\u201d of their properties. In support, they cite cases in nuisance, trespass, and negligence that involve harm caused directly or indirectly to real property. Lovell responds that damages for \u201closs of use and enjoyment\u201d are not recoverable under any of the legal theories on which the homeowners sued and that they also are not recoverable because they are in the nature of mental and emotional distress damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">In an action alleging a temporary nuisance, the plaintiff may recover damages for the decrease in the value of the use or rental of his property and for \u201cthe substantial invasion of normal and comfortable enjoyment of [his] property,\u201d including the illness of a household member brought about by the nuisance. <em>Gorman v. Sabo, </em>210 Md. 155, 163, 122 A.2d 475 (1956) (nuisance created by defendant playing blaring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>radio music day and night); <em>see also Green v. Shoemaker, </em>111 Md. 69, 73 A. 688 (1909) (plaintiff entitled to recover damages for physical injuries due to nervousness and fright caused by defendant\u2019s blasting activities). In an action for trespass or negligence in which the defendant\u2019s conduct has caused temporary harm to real property, damages may be awarded for the cost of restoring the property to its previous state and for the value of the lost use of the property during the repair period. <em>Superior Construction Co. v. Elmo, </em>204 Md. 1, 12, 102 A.2d 739 (1954) (plaintiffs who were forced to vacate residence when debris created by construction on adjacent land entered property were entitled to recover restoration costs and damages for loss of use of property, calculated based upon minimal rental value of property during vacancy period); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 929 (1977).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When a private defendant\u2019s tortious conduct has permanently harmed property, the proper measure of damages is the difference between the fair market value of the property before the injury and after the injury \u201ctogether with such loss as ... sustained, if any, in the usable value of the property ...\u201d <em>Havre de Grace v. Maxa, </em>177 Md. 168, 182, 9 A.2d 235 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The case <em>sub judice </em>differs qualitatively from those cited by the homeowners because it does not concern tortious injury to real property. The homeowners did not claim (nor could they have claimed) that Lovell wrongfully interfered with their peaceful use and enjoyment of their undisturbed properties or that Lovell tortiously harmed their intact properties. The injuries for which the homeowners sought damages were not injuries to property; rather, they were pecuniary, <em>i.e., </em>injuries to their financial interests in their real estate transactions with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Lovell. The homeowners were entitled to seek damages for pecuniary losses caused by Lovell\u2019s breach of contract or negligent misrepresentation and for consequential pecuniary losses that could be proven with reasonable certainty and not on the basis of speculation or conjecture. <em>See Asibem Assoc., Ltd. v. Rill, supra, </em>at 276, 286 A.2d 160; <em>Reighard v. Downs, </em>261 Md. 26, 36, 273 A.2d 109 (1971) (party injured by survey- or\u2019s negligent misrepresentation not entitled to recover lost profits that were based upon speculation and conjecture).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In urging the lower court to instruct the jury that it could award damages for \u201closs of use and enjoyment,\u201d the homeowners, through counsel, informed the court that they \u201c[were] not asking for loss of rental value\u201d but were seeking damages for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">[T]he type of loss that they can\u2019t use their basements. Its the type of loss that they have a lot of tension between the spouse and the husband. They don\u2019t enjoy their home when they walk in there and think about what the fungus might be in the basement or think about in a few months when the winter comes the water table is coming up again, that they don\u2019t enjoy being there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The damages that the homeowners were seeking for loss of use of their basements (and their yards) were subsumed in and were not distinguishable from the damages that they were seeking for loss in fair market value of their properties. The conditions that the homeowners contended made their properties defective, and irreparably so, were the water and drainage problems that they asserted made their basements and yards unusable. The only non-speculative value that could be assigned to the homeowners\u2019 loss of use of those portions of their properties would be the difference between the value of each property with a usable basement and yard and its value without a usable basement and yard, at a single point in time, <em>i.e., </em>loss in fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">If we analogize to the property damage cases cited by the homeowners in support of their \u201closs of use and enjoyment\u201d damages argument, we reach the same conclusion. <em>Maxa </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>especially instructive for our purposes. There, a municipality dredged its bay shore line to create a yacht basin, causing fill material to spread in front of the plaintiffs property and to cut off his access by boat to the bay. The plaintiff was able to remain in the property but could no longer house his boat at the water\u2019s edge. He had to move the boat and pay storage and wharfage charges to keep it elsewhere. The Court explained that the proper measure of damages for the plaintiffs permanent deprivation of his customary use of the waterway was the difference between the fair market value of his property before and after the injury. The plaintiff could not recover for loss of \u201cusable value\u201d of the property as calculated on the basis of loss in rental value because he had remained in the property. Lost rental value thus would constitute double compensation. On the other hand, the sums paid by the plaintiff for boat storage and wharfage charges were recoverable as distinct items of loss brought about by the defendant\u2019s interference with the plaintiff\u2019s normal use of his property. <em>Maxa, </em>177 Md. at 182-83, 9 A.2d 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">By comparison, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the homeowners did not lose any rental value, as they concede, nor did they introduce evidence of any expenditures akin to the consequential damages incurred by the landowner plaintiff in <em>Maxa. </em>When pared to their essence, the \u201closs of use and enjoyment\u201d damages that the homeowners sought were damages for mental distress attendant to their claimed pecuniary injuries. The trial court ruled separately that the homeowners could not recover damages for mental distress and that ruling has not been challenged on appeal. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that it could not award damages for \u201closs of use and enjoyment\u201d of the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The homeowners contend that the trial court erred in granting Lovell\u2019s motion for judgment on their CPA claim because their evidence was legally sufficient to meet the \u201cactual injury\u201d requirement of the statute. Lovell contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>that it was not. In reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion for judgment on the CPA claim, we conduct the same analysis as it did, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the homeowners and affirming only if the evidence was insufficient to send the claim to the jury. <em>Cavacos v. Sarwar, </em>313 Md. 248, 250, 545 A.2d 46 (1988); Md. Rule 2-519(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Section 13-408(a) of the CPA creates a private right of action \u201cto recover for injury or loss sustained ... as the result of a practice prohibited by [the CPA].\u201d Md.Code Ann. (1990 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 13-408(a), Com. Law Article. In <em>Citaramanis v. Hallowell, </em>328 Md. 142, 151, 613 A.2d 964 (1992), the Court of Appeals held that \u201c[i]t is manifest from the language employed in \u00a7 13-408(a) that the General Assembly intended that a plaintiff pursuing a private action under the CPA prove actual \u2018injury or loss sustained.\u2019 \u201d; <em>see also Golt v. Phillips, </em>308 Md. 1, 517 A.2d 328 (1986)(\u201cin determining the damages due the consumer [under the CPA], we must look only to his actual loss or injury caused by the unfair or deceptive trade practices\u201d). In addition, \u201c[s]ection 13-408(a) ... requires an aggrieved consumer to establish the nature of the actual injury or loss that he or she has allegedly sustained as a result of the prohibited practice.\u201d <em>Citaramanis, </em>328 Md. at 152, 613 A.2d 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">As we have explained in parts I and II, when viewed in the light most favorable to the homeowners, the evidence and all favorable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence did not include any proof of cost of repair damages and was not legally sufficient to prove loss in fair market value or \u201closs in use and enjoyment\u201d of the properties. The trial court correctly granted Lovell\u2019s motion for judgment on the ground that the homeowners could not prove that they had sustained an actual injury or loss by any legally accepted measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-12\">.
