(N.B.S.), appeals from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City entered in favor of appellees, Rodney Harvey and Shawntier White. On appeal, N.B.S. poses the following questions, which we have slightly condensed:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">1. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony of appellant\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Henrietta Sachs;</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">2. Did the trial court err in denying N.B.S.\u2019s motion for judgment, at the close of both appellees\u2019 case and the entire case;</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">3. Did the trial court err in denying N.B.S.\u2019s motions for judgment <em>not withstanding the verdict (JNOV), </em>and new trial and/or remittitur;</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>4. Did the trial court err in denying N.B.S.\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>regarding a 1978 citation received for lead paint on the property in question; and</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">5. Did the trial court err in denying N.B.S.\u2019s request to supplement its response to appellees\u2019 request for admission of fact number 9?</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">We shall respond in the negative, and affirm the judgment of circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In October of 1980, Debbie Jones White (Ms. White) and her son, Rodney Harvey (Rodney), then three years old, rented and moved into 1040 N. Bentalou Street in Baltimore, owned and managed by N.B.S. At that time, Stanley Rochkind was the president of N.B.S. Ms. White was then pregnant with Shawntier White (Shawntier). On 21 September 1981, Rodney submitted to his first test to determine the level of lead in his blood. The test revealed a blood lead level of 54 micrograms per deciliter. Rodney\u2019s subsequent blood tests revealed lead levels in the area of 30 micrograms per deciliter. On that same day, Shawntier, then eight months old, also submitted to a blood test. Shawntier\u2019s test revealed a lead level of 20/21 micrograms per deciliter. Her subsequent blood tests revealed lead levels in the area of 20 micrograms per deciliter.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">On 23 March 1995, appellees filed a twelve count complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, claiming damages from N.B.S. on a variety of theories, including negligence and violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act. Tests revealed that Rodney\u2019s full scale I.Q. was 78, with a purported loss of 10 IQ points because of lead poisoning. Such tests revealed that Shawntier\u2019s full scale IQ was 63, with a purported loss of 5 IQ points because of lead poisoning. At the time of trial, Rodney was 19, had left high school after the tenth grade, and had never received a diploma. Shawntier was 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>and in the ninth grade at the time of trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the close of trial, the jury returned verdicts of $325,000 for Rodney, and $300,000 for Shawntier. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">N.B.S. first claims the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of its expert witness, Dr. Henrietta Sachs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Sachs\u2019 testimony was excluded following extensive questioning as to her qualifications. According to N.B.S., the trial court improperly excluded Dr. Sachs\u2019s testimony on the basis of the <em>Frye/Reed </em>standard, that is, whether her opinion is \u201cgenerally accepted\u201d in the relevant scientific community. <em>Frye v. United States, </em>54 App. D.C. 46, 293 F. 1013 (1923); <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 391 A.2d 364 (1978). In support of its position, N.B.S. relies on <em>Myers v. Celotex Corp., </em>88 Md.App. 442, 594 A.2d 1248 (1991), <em>cert. denied </em>325 Md. 249, 600 A.2d 418 (1992). In <em>Myers, </em>we concluded that the trial court had improperly employed the <em>Frye/Reed </em>standard and abused its discretion in not permitting a medical doctor \u201cto state his opinion as to how asbestos fibers cause cancer even though he could not state that the theory he espoused was generally accepted by the medical community.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 456, 594 A.2d 1248. N.B.S.\u2019s reliance on <em>Myers </em>is misguided. After consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ering Dr. Sachs\u2019s qualifications and deciding to exclude her testimony, Judge Rombro said, \u201cI am not satisfied at all with the qualifications of Dr. Sachs. This is a person who has been retired ... for 10 years____ What concerns me here is she is \u2014 it\u2019s not just a question of disagreeing with somebody, that\u2019s what expert testimony is for---- There isn\u2019t another scientist, there isn\u2019t another physician out there who agrees with her underlying premises, and that is that you\u2019ve got to be over 40 milligrams per deciliter ... before you\u2019re really dealing with illness.\u201d In other words, Judge Rombro concluded that Dr. Sachs was not qualified as an expert, given that there was no existing factual basis in support of her expert testimony. Rule 5-702(3). Thus, although appellees endeavored to exclude Dr. Sachs\u2019s testimony on the basis of the <em>Frye/Reed </em>standard, the trial court\u2019s exclusion of that testimony was based upon Maryland Rule 5-702.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">\u201cIt is firmly established that the admissibility of expert testimony is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. The court\u2019s action in this area seldom provides a basis for reversal, although it may be reviewed on appeal and reversed for an abuse of discretion, error of law, or other serious mistake.\u201d <em>Potomac Electric v. Smith, </em>79 Md.App. 591, 644-45, 558 A.2d 768 (1989), <em>See also, </em>Chief Judge Joseph F. Murphy, Jr.\u2019s Maryland Evidence Handbook, 708 (2nd ed.1996). Maryland Rule 5-702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">A review of the record reveals that, in excluding Dr. Sachs\u2019s testimony, the trial court focused on the first and third prongs of Rule 5-702.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court principally questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the probative value of Dr. Sachs\u2019s testimony due to her long absence from the treatment of patients suffering from lead poisoning, and from active participation in research in that field. <em>See I.W. Berman Properties v. Porter Brothers, Inc., </em>276 Md. 1, 13, 344 A.2d 65 (1975). In <em>Berman, </em>the trial court refused \u201cto allow [appellant\u2019s] architect ...,\u201d [ ] \u201cto testify as an expert budding contractor since he admitted that he had never been \u2018an individual builder,\u2019 [and] that the last time he had supervised construction of any type of building was for another contractor 30 years previously.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 12-13, 344 A.2d 65. As the trial court concluded, Dr. Sachs\u2019s absence from the practice of medicine was crucial because medical research in the field of lead poisoning had advanced substantially during those years. In fact, the first directive of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), concerning the effect of lead poisoning was not issued until 1975, three years after Dr. Sachs had ceased treating patients at her clinic. The CDC\u2019s most recent directive, issued in 1991, came four years after Dr. Sachs\u2019s retirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the trial court questioned the appropriateness of Dr. Sachs\u2019s testimony on the effect of lead poisoning, since she was unable to point to a single medical doctor currently practicing medicine or involved in such research who would agree with her view of the effects of lead poisoning. \u201cAn expert\u2019s judgment has no probative force unless there is a sufficient basis upon which to support his conclusions.\u201d <em>Worthington Constr. v. Moore, </em>266 Md. 19, 29, 291 A.2d 466 (1972). In view of the extensive voir dire of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Dr. Sachs as to her qualifications and her response to those questions, there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">N.B.S. next claims the trial court erred in denying its motions for judgment at the close of the evidence presented by appellees, and at the close of the entire case. N.B.S. believes appellees failed to prove the existence of chipping and flaking of lead paint at 1040 N. Bentalou Street, or that they had had any notice of such a condition. Acknowledging that Ms. White, appellee\u2019s mother, testified to these conditions, N.B.S. maintains that because her testimony was inconsistent, vague, and contradictory it should have been entirely disregarded. In support of this argument, appellant cites to Voss <em>v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>246 Md. 345, 351, 228 A.2d 295 (1967)(\u201c[T]he testimony of the appellant is so inconsistent and contradictory as to make it doubtful whether it should be the basis of a legal conclusion.\u201d); <em>Ray v. Bassil, </em>30 Md.App. 550, 352 A.2d 888 (1976)(Finding of negligence may not be sustained on evidence that is \u201ctoo inconclusive, uncertain, vague, and <em>contradictory\u201d)(quoting Olney v. Carmichael, </em>202 Md. 226, 231-32, 96 A.2d 37 (1953)); and <em>Tippett v. Quade, </em>19 Md.App. 49, 56 309 A.2d 481 (1973)(\u201cIf the direct evidence approaches the outer limits of credibility ... it would be insufficient.\u201d)(quoting <em>Short v. Wells, </em>249 Md. 491, 240 A.2d 224 (1968)). We disagree that Ms. White\u2019s testimony approaches \u201cthe outer limits of credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\u201cIn reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision ..., we \u2018shall consider all evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made.\u2019 Md.Rule 2-519(b) (1995) (citations omitted). Moreover, the court\u2019s determination should be upheld \u2018[i]f there is any evidence, no matter how slight, legally sufficient to generate a jury question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. v. Reading, </em>109 Md.App. 89, 99, 674 A.2d 44 (1996) <em>(quoting James v. General Motors Corp., </em>74 Md.App. 479, 484, 538 A.2d 782, <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 7, 542 A.2d 844 (1988)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u2018Maryland has gone almost as far as any jurisdiction that we know of in holding that meager evidence of negligence is sufficient to carry the case to the jury;\u2019 that the rule requires submission of the case to the jury if there be any evidence, however slight, legally sufficient as tending to prove negligence, the weight and value of such evidence being left to the jury; that to meet the test of legal sufficiency, the party having the burden of proving another party guilty of negligence cannot sustain this burden \u2018by offering a mere scintilla of evidence amounting to no more than a surmise, possibility, or conjecture that such other party has been guilty of negligence, but such evidence must be of legal probative force and evidential value.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><em>Curley v. General Valet Service, </em>270 Md. 248, 264, 311 A.2d 231 (1973) <em>(quoting Fowler v. Smith, </em>240 Md. 240, 246-47, 213 A2d 549 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">We are convinced by an examination of the record that appellees presented more than a \u201cmere scintilla of evidence\u201d of chipping and flaking lead paint in the premises. Ms. White testified that she had observed plaster falling from a crack in the ceiling while inspecting the premises, and notified N.B.S. of the problem. She also said she had obtained paint from N.B.S. because the premises needed painting. While painting, it was necessary for Ms. White to scrape peeling paint from and to repair holes in the walls. Ms. White was unaware of lead paint in the premises when she began renting it. Appellees presented sufficient evidence of lead paint, including the testimony of Stanley Rochkind and a 1978 notice of lead paint received from the City of Baltimore, for the trial court to deny N.B.S.\u2019s motion for judgment. To be sure, cross-examination developed sufficient inconsistencies to raise questions about Ms. White\u2019s credibility, but that is its purpose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Md. Rule 5-616. \u201cIf the testimony of one witness at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the trial is legally sufficient, it matters not that this testimony may be contradicted by ten witnesses for defendant, or <em>even that it may be in conflict with statements before the trial, or testimony in a previous trial or other legal proceeding, of the same </em>witness.\u201d <em>Bond v. Forthuber, </em>198 Md. 476, 483, 84 A.2d 886 (1951)(emphasis added). Generally, as was the case here, the question of a 'witness\u2019s credibility is left to the jury. <em>Beghtol v. Michael, </em>80 Md.App. 387, 564 A.2d 82 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">N.B.S. next claims the trial court abused is discretion in denying its motion for JNOV, new trial and/or remittitur because of the excessive and inappropriate verdicts returned by the jury. <em>Conklin v. Schillinger, </em>255 Md. 50, 257 A.2d 187 (1969). The trial court said the jury verdicts were within the range of those generally returned in lead paint cases. Moreover, we do not agree with N.B.S. that they were either inappropriate or excessive. Both Rodney and Shawntier presented ample evidence of their exposure to lead paint as children, which resulted in brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">N.B.S. next claims the trial court erred in denying its motion <em>in </em>limine,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Unfortunately for N.B.S., this issue has not been preserved for our review. \u201cObviously, the trial judge may either grant or deny the motion <em>[in limine </em>]. If the trial judge admits the questionable evidence, the party who made the motion ordinarily must object at the time the evidence is actually offered to preserve his objection for appellate review.\u201d <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 356, 535 A.2d 445 (1988).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>N.B.S. failed to object at the time the disputed evidence was actually offered, or when Mr. Rochkind was questioned about it, we decline to review the denial of the motion <em>in limine. </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Finally, N.B.S. claims the trial court erred in denying its request to expand its answer to appellees\u2019 request for admission of facts number nine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">The court may permit withdrawal or amendment if the court finds , that it would assist the presentation of the merits of the action and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice that party in maintaining the action or defense on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Md. Rule 2-424. Once again, our standard of review is whether the trial court abused its discretion, <em>Harvey v. Williams, </em>79 Md.App. 566, 558 A.2d 756 (1989), and we conclude that it did not. As the trial court properly pointed out, N.B.S. would have ample opportunity at trial to explain its response to that request for admission of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">. Both had, at various times, failed a grade. Rodney had failed both the second and ninth grades, and Shawntier had failed the fifth grade.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">. Dr. Sachs is a board certified pediatrician, licensed in 1948 to practice medicine in Illinois. From 1966 to 1972, she was actively involved in the operation of a clinic for the treatment of lead paint poisoning in the City of Chicago. Although she continued to consult at several such clinics, by 1977 she had stopped diagnosing and admitting lead paint patients into the hospital. Dr. Sachs retired in 1987, having spent the bulk of time between 1977 and 1987 consulting and conducting follow-up research to her work at the Chicago clinic. After 1987, her time was spent predominantly testifying as an expert witness, for both plaintiffs and defendants, in lead paint litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b370-9\">. The. testimony sought to be introduced was the doctor\u2019s opinion as to how asbestos fibers cause cancer. \"Such testimony was based upon [the doctor\u2019s] personal observations and professional experience, and thus required only a reasonable degree of medical probability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458, 594 A.2d 1248.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b371-12\">. We note that the trial court only referred explicitly to Rule 5-702\u2019s first prong. It is clear, however, that Rule 5-702\u2019s third prong was also relied on.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b372-5\">. N.B.S. believes <em>Berman </em>is distinguishable because Dr. Sachs\u2019s absence from the practice of medicine was far less (approximately 20 years) than that of the architect in <em>Berman </em>(approximately 30 years), and the expert in <em>Berman </em>had never been involved in the type of project about which he was going to testify. While we acknowledge that <em>Berman </em>does not rest on all fours with the case at hand, the differences are not so great as to render it inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\">. The CDC\u2019s 1991 directive sets the level of lead in the blood necessary for lead poisoning at 10 micrograms. Dr. Sachs, however, participated in the creation of a Surgeon General publication, which set the level necessary for lead poisoning at 80 micrograms. Needless to say, Dr. Sachs testified that she did not find the CDC's directive authoritative, it appears that she and the CDC view this area from separate generations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\">. The record fails to reveal the dramatic inconsistencies claimed by N.B.S. While Ms. White's deposition answers were less complete than those given at trial, she explained on re-direct examination that her memory had been refreshed by the testimony of N.B.S. president, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Stanley Rochkind, and after reviewing numerous \"work order\u201d documents, generated by N.B.S. when the apartment was repaired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\">. Its purpose was to exclude evidence of a 1978 citation issued to N.B.S. by the City of Baltimore requiring that lead paint found at 1040 Bentalou Street be abated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b375-11\">. But for an exception to this rule <em>see Watson v. State, </em>311 Md. 370, 372, fn. 1, 535 A.2d 455 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b376-11\">. Admission of facts number nine inquired whether N.B.S. \"was aware, prior to the infant Plaintiff's occupancy of the premises of the presence of lead paint in the interior of the premises.\" N.B.S.\u2019s response was \u201cadmitted,\u201d but it later sought to offer an explanation for that answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
