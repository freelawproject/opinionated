The owner of an automobile has a right to restrict the use of his car as he may please and when he does so and there is a deviation from his restriction by the person to whom he loans it, he is not liable. <em>(Chaika </em>v. <em>Vanderberg, 252 </em>N. Y. 101; <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Gruntz, </em>216 App. Div. 19; <em>Feitelberg </em>v. <em>Matuson, </em>124 Misc. Rep. 595.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-9\"><em>Ford White </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avt\">By employing the words, \u201c legally using or operating the same,\u201d the Legislature evidently, intended that Lability should not be restricted to negligent driving by the bailee of the car. <em>(Feitelberg </em>v. <em>Matuson, </em>124 Misc. Rep. 595.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Kellogg, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqb\">The plaintiffs in these actions were occupants of a c.ar with which an automobile owned by the defendant came into collision. There was evidence that the collision was occasioned by the negligence of the driver of the defendant\u2019s car. The resulting damage to each plaintiff was stipulated, and motions for a directed verdict were made by counsel for the opposing parties. Thereupon the court directed verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs against the defendant owner for the amounts stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">It is conceded that, prior to the collision, the defendant owner had loaned his car to Maggio, his nephew, for his personal use; that Maggio was in the car when the collision occurred; that the car was then being driven by Barone, the friend of Maggio, with the latter\u2019s permission; that Barone was negligent; that Maggio, except as the acts and omissions of Barone were his, was not guilty of negligence. It was shown that, although the defendant owner had permitted Maggio to make use of the car for his own personal ends, his assent to such use was accompanied by instructions that Maggio must not let Barone, or any person other than himself, drive or operate the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The question to be determined is whether or not the recoveries were authorized by the provisions of section 282-e of the Highway Law (now section 59 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law; Cons. Laws, ch. 71) which impose liability upon the owner of every motor vehicle for death or personal injuries \u201c resulting from negligence in the operation of such motor vehicle * * * by any person legally using or operating the same with the permission, express or implied, of such owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">We think that Maggio was at the time <em>\u201c </em>using \u201d the car, though Barone was driving, for Maggio <em>\u201c </em>did not abandon the car or its use when he surrendered to another the guidance of the wheel;\u201d he was \u201c still the director of the enterprise, still the custodian of the instrumentality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>confided to his keeping, still the master of the ship.\u201d (Per Cardozo, Ch. J., in <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Knepper, </em>245 N. Y. 158, 165.) We think, also, that Maggio was at the time using the car with \u201c the permission \u201d of the defendant owner. True it is, that if the collision had occurred in a territory where use had been expressly proscribed by the owner, Maggio would then have been using the car without permission. <em>(Chaika </em>v. <em>Vandenberg, </em>252 N. Y. 101.) Nor would it have been a permitted use, if Maggio, against the express instructions of the owner, had employed the car to provide a pleasure trip for Barone. <em>(Psota </em>v. <em>Long Island R. R. Co., </em>246 N. Y. 388.) An owner in loaning his car may reasonably restrict the uses to which it may be put; consequently, its employment for a proscribed purpose cannot be a permitted use. On the other hand, if the hunting instructions relate to the manner of operation, such as the speeding or careless pilotage of the car, though the instructions be disobeyed, nevertheless the use is with <em>\u201c </em>permission \u201d of the owner. Maggio was not instructed that Barone should not be accepted as a guest; he was merely told that Barone must not drive. The thing forbidden related to the operation of the car, not to the use which might be made of it. We conclude that Maggio was <em>\u201c </em>using \u201d the car with the <em>\u201c </em>permission <em>\u201d </em>of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The statement has been made that throughout the Highway Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 25) the word \u201c operate \u201d is used as signifying a personal act in working the mechanism of a motor vehicle. <em>\u201c </em>The driver operates the car for the owner, but the owner does not operate the car unless he drives it himself.\u201d (Per Pound, J., in <em>Witherstine </em>v. <em>Employers Liability Assur. Corp., </em>235 N. Y. 168, 172.) These words were written, and the case decided prior to the introduction into the Highway Law of section 282-e, through the enactment of chapter 534 of the Laws of 1924. In so far as the quoted words carry the implication that, to <em>\u201c </em>operate \u201d a motor vehicle, one must himself manipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>late the steering wheel, they cannot be regarded as conclusively determining the significance of the word \u201c operation \u201d or the word \u201c operating \u201d as employed in the section. This, not only for the reason that the section had not been enacted when the case was decided, but because there is self-contained in the statute a word combination belying the signification which the words quoted from the case might otherwise be thought to impress upon the statutory words. To bind the owner, there must be \u201c negligence in the operation \u201d of the motor vehicle; but the negligent act may be performed either \u201c by any person legally using \u201d the motor vehicle, or by any person \u201c operating the same.\u201d Thus, the legal user may be guilty of negligence in \u201c operation,\u201d though not \u201c operating \u201d the car, in the sense that he is driving with his own hands. The clear implication is that, if the legal user at the time be present in the car, still \u201c the director of the enterprise,\u201d still <em>\u201c </em>the master of the ship,\u201d the operation of the car is his operation, though the hands at the wheel are those of a substitute, and the negligent driving will bind the owner, with whose permission the car is used. That such is the meaning of the statute is indicated by the opinion in <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Knepper (supra), </em>when it was said: <em>\u201c </em>We think the effect of the statute is to read into our law the rule of liability laid down in <em>Geiss </em>v. <em>Twin City Taxicab Co. </em>(120 Minn. 368) \u201d (p. 165). This is the rule to which reference was made: \u201cWe approve the rule that, when the master entrusts the performance of an act to a servant, he is liable for the negligence of one who, though not a servant of the master, in the presence of his servant and with his consent negligently does the act which was intrusted to the servant.\u201d <em>(Geiss </em>v. <em>Twin City Taxicab Co., </em>120 Minn. 368, 371.) There were cases at the common law, other than <em>Geiss </em>v. <em>Twin City Taxicab Co. (supra), </em>which lend support to the rule as stated. Such was the case of <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Mister </em>(7 C. &amp; P. 66), in which Lord Abinger said: \u201cAs the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>servant was in the cart, I think that the reins being held by another man makes no difference;\u201d and such the case of <em>Simons </em>v. <em>Monier </em>(29 Barb. 419, 422), involving the liability of a master for the negligence of a servant in causing a bonfire to be lighted by his son, where the court said of the servant: <em>\u201c </em>It was his immediate personal act, for although it was done by the hand of the son, the hand was directed, guided and controlled by the mind and will of the father.\u201d We think that, in our case, there was <em>\u201c </em>negligence in the operation \u201d of the motor vehicle, committed by <em>\u201c </em>a person legally using \u201d it, with <em>\u201c </em>the permission \u201d of the owner, so that the owner, under section 282-e, became hable for the damage done.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The judgment in each action should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Cardozo, Ch. J., Pound, Crane, Lehman, O\u2019Brien and Hubbs, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
