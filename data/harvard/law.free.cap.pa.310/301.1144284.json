Her sole reason for asking that relief is, as she alleges, that there never was a legal reason for its existence or continuance, and hence she had at all times and now has the right to revoke it whenever she chooses so to do, though it truthfully states that she \u201chereby declares she has fully considered the matter of whether the trust hereby created shall be revocable or irrevocable; and that upon such full consideration she has determined, so declares, and it is therefore agreed, that the trust hereby created shall be irrevocable.\u201d The trustee, the only defendant named, filed preliminary objections to the bill, denying, as a matter of law, that plaintiff had a right to revoke the trust; the court below sustained the objections and dismissed the bill, whereupon plaintiff prosecuted the present appeal. The decree of dismissal must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">By the declaration of trust, the fund is to be held upon an active trust \u201cto invest the same and keep it invested, for and during the term of the grantor\u2019s natural life, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>to pay the net income unto the grantor in quarter annual payments\u201d and in further \u201ctrust upon the death of the grantor to pay and distribute the principal to such persons, in such amounts, and upon such trusts as the grantor shall by any last will and testament, or instrument in the nature thereof, limit and appoint; and in default of such appointment, or should such appointment for any reason fall or be void, to pay and distribute said principal upon the death of the grantor to and amongst the next of kin of the grantor in accordance with the intestate laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as if the grantor had died seized of the principal;\u201d and in further \u201ctrust to make all payments, whether of principal or income, unto the beneficiaries of the trust, including the grantor, upon their respective personal receipts, free, clear and discharged of and from the control of any husband which the grantor or any beneficiary hereunder may have or take; and free and discharged of the debts, contracts and engagements of the grantor or any other beneficiary hereunder, and without the right on the part of the grantor or any other beneficiary hereunder to alienate or anticipate any payments to be made hereunder to the grantor or any such beneficiary, and free, clear and discharged from the claims, levies, executions or attachments of any creditor of the grantor or any other beneficiary hereunder.\u201d The declaration of trust also gave to the trustee the power \u201cto invest and reinvest [the moneys in the trust] from time to time and to change investments at discretion,\u201d such investments not to be confined \u201cto what are known as legal securities for trustees under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\u201d and empowered it generally to deal with the trust estate as any person sui juris might do, except that no investment should be made in common stocks, without \u201cthe consent of the grantor first thereto had......always endeavoring, so far as practicable, to keep approximately one-third of the trust estate invested in first mortgages on real estate in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\u201d Then follows the paragraph regarding irrevocability, hereinbefore quoted, and one relating to the commissions on principal and income which the trustee should receive for its services.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel frankly admits that he cannot succeed unless all who are or may at any future time be interested in the trust are now before the court, so that their interests may be foreclosed by our decree. He alleges, however, that the language of the deed regarding the gift in remainder, operates to enlarge her life estate to an absolute one, and hence (1) all the possible interests \u201care before the court in the person of plaintiff\u201d herself; and (2) that the trust has no existing purpose to support it. She has to establish both of these contentions in order to sustain the bill. We probably would hold that she has not established either, but, for brevity\u2019s sake, will herein consider the second only, which she certainly has not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">It will be noticed that even plaintiff\u2019s life estate is subject to a spendthrift trust, and this we have always held to be sufficient of itself to sustain the trust. Dodson v. Ball, 60 Pa. 492, apparently the sole reliance of plaintiff on this point, itself says at page 496: \u201cAnd where the trust is not active the legal estate will remain in the trustee so long as it is necessary to preserve the estate itself, as in the case of a trust for a married woman to protect the estate from her husband; or a trust for a spendthrift son to protect it from his creditors.\u201d A fortiori this is so where, as here, the trust is an active one.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In Baughman\u2019s Est., 281 Pa. 23, 38-40, we reviewed many of our previous decisions, including Dodson v. Ball, and treated of the question now under review at considerable length. We there said (page 39) that such a \u201ctrust cannot be terminated unless there is \u2018no ultimate purpose of any kind requiring the continuance of the trust\u2019 expressed in it, or which \u2018can be implied from its terms, except the mere payment of the income to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>cestui que trust\u2019....... Thus, on a gift of a property to A, upon an active trust for B for life, with remainder to C, B cannot end the trust, without the consent of C, and not even then unless no other legal reason appears for keeping it alive; as, for instance, where the life estate in B is upon a spendthrift trust.\u201d No case has been cited to us, and we know of none, in antagonism to that principle, and we know of a number which support it. In Minnich\u2019s Est., 206 Pa. 405, we decided that a will creating an active trust will be sustained, if the income payable to the life tenant is subject to a spendthrift trust, although there is no gift over of the corpus after the death of the life tenant. This was cited in Shower\u2019s Est., 211 Pa. 297, 304, and Rockhill's Est., 29 Pa. Superior Ct. 28, 34, and, so far as we are aware, has never been overruled or even qualified. See also Moser\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 217, and King v. York Trust Co., 278 Pa. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The decree of the court below is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed, the costs thereof to be paid out of the income of the trust estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
