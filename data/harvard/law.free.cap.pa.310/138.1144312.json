Accompanying the agreement was a paper, signed by appellee, stating that testator, \u201cin addition to a life interest in his father\u2019s estate, was possessed outright of property having a value of at least $570,000.\u201d Evidently she obtained this information from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">By his will, dated October 31, 1928, testator directed payment of all his \u201cjust debts\u201d (which included, of course, his liability to appellee under the antenuptial agreement); made certain specific bequests, one of them being $10,000 to appellee, \u201cto be paid to her immediately after my deceasedivided certain of his personal effects among his children and friends, and gave the residue thereof to appellee; and directed his executors to maintain and pay the rental of his apartment \u201cuntil the expiration of the lease thereon at the time of my death, so that my wife may occupy the same without expense.\u201d The widow received the gifts above specified; but all the judges of the court below and all the parties in interest agree that this fact, standing alone, would not affect her claim under the antenuptial agreement, since there is nothing in that instrument denying her the right to receive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">But appellants contend that, because she accepted those benefits, she must be deemed to have affirmed the will in its entirety, and hence can only receive the $15,000 per year, if and when the income of the residuary estate is sufficient for the purpose, since, as appellants allege, it is so provided in the residuary clause of the will. For the same reason, they assert that if there is a deficiency of income in one year, it cannot be made up out of the surplus of later years. The decree below denies the correctness of these contentions, and this raises the substantial question to be decided by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">By the residuary clause, the balance of the estate is given to named trustees, appellee being one of them, \u201cto hold and invest the same, and keep the same safely invested for the uses, persons and purposes following, that is to say: 1st. Out of the income therefrom to pay over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>unto my wife, the sum of $15,000, in equal monthly installments, beginning immediately upon my death, in accordance with the terms of the antenuptial agreement entered into between my wife and myself dated May 23, 1928. 2d. As to the balance of the income from my residuary estate, to pay over unto my said wife...... one-half thereof for life.\u201d The other provisions of the will contain nothing of importance on the issues raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">After testator\u2019s death, and under the advice of counsel, appellee executed the usual formal declaration of her election to take under his will, and later amended it by inserting the words that it was made \u201cwithout prejudice to my rights, interest, estate and privileges to and in a certain antenuptial agreement, entered into between me and the decedent in his lifetime, dated May 23,1928, and reserving unto myself all rights, privileges, interest and estate vested in me by said antenuptial agreement.\u201d Each of these papers was a useless gesture. By the ante-nuptial agreement she debarred herself from taking against his will, the effect of which, if allowable, would simply have given her the proportion of his estate which she could have received under the intestate laws; and this, by the agreement, in consideration of the $15,000 to be paid to her annually, she expressly agreed she would not claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">From the time of testator\u2019s death on March 7, 1930, until February 15, 1931, appellee was paid each month the $1,250 provided for in the antenuptial agreement, but since that date she has received nothing, because of the serious depletion of the income from the well-known cause with which we are all too familiar. At the audit of the executor\u2019s account, appellee claimed that the income on hand should be awarded to her on account of the arrearages due her under the antenuptial agreement, and that the balance of those arrearages should be paid to her out of the principal of the estate. This the auditing judge directed, and, on exceptions by appellants, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>court in banc divided equally, resulting, therefore, in a decree confirming the adjudication. From it these appeals were taken, appellants renewing here their contention as above set forth. To it we cannot assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The basis of that contention, as tersely stated in the dissenting opinion below, is as follows: \u201cWhere a testator, by his will, modifies the terms of an antenuptial agreement, and his widow elects to take under the will ......she has thereby assented to such modification.\u201d Unhappily for this contention, it has no basis upon which to rest. Of course, a testator may, if he chooses, put his widow to the election of determining whether or not she will accept the provisions of his will and abandon her rights under a valid antenuptial agreement; but it must appear, with at least reasonable clearness, that such was his intention, before she will be required to make such election. Here, the exact reverse appears. In the first place: \u201cNo presumption arises that a legacy is given in satisfaction of a debt where [as here] the will contains a provision for the payment of debts......or where the legacy is not in all respects as beneficial as the debt:\u201d 40 Cyc. 1886. In the second place, instead of testator attempting to modify the agreement, he deliberately confirmed it just as it was originally written. It is as clear as anything can be, which is not expressly stated, that he intended appellee to get everything given to her by the agreement, and also the additional legacies stated in the will. True, as. the event turned out, the income of his estate fell off so greatly that it does not now amount to the $15,000 a year. But this does not prove an intent to modify the agreement; on the contrary, it is only another result of the depression under which the entire civilized world is laboring. That he thought the income from his residuary estate would be more than sufficient to pay the $15,000 per year is clear from the two paragraphs of the residuary clause of the will, for he not only provided for its payment, but also directed distribution of an expected surplus beyond that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>More than this, those provisions in terms provide for the payment of the $15,000. All that testator was doing was giving instructions to his trustees with regard to its payment in full, evidently thinking, as every one else did, and as past experience seemed to justify, that the income from the residuary estate would be more than sufficient to pay this sum to appellee; but he makes no attempt therein to limit her to the income of the residuary estate. He directs the payment to be \u201cin accordance with the terms of the antenuptial agreement.\u201d \u201cIn accordance with\u201d cannot be construed to mean \u201cin place of,\u201d or \u201cas a substitute for,\u201d and this is made especially clear by the fact that the payments provided for are to be \u201cin accordance with the terms\u201d of the antenuptial agreement, not with some of them, but with all of them, the most important of which \u201cterms\u201d is that she is to get \u201cthe sum of $15,000 per year in equal monthly installments, unconditionally, for and during the term of her natural life, and in the event that [testator] predeceased [appellee] said yearly sum shall be paid to [her] by his personal representatives during the term of her natural life.\u201d By the provision of the will under consideration, testator was endeavoring to insure compliance \u201cunconditionally\u201d with those \u201cterms,\u201d and not conditionally, as appellants now contend.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Viewed in this light, Bowman v. <em>Knorr </em>(No. 1), 206 Pa. 270, is controlling. There, by an antenuptial agreement, the widow was entitled to receive one-third of the income of her husband\u2019s estate for the term of her natural life. By his will he provided that she should receive that one-third while she was his widow, it being stated also that: \u201cThis will, so far as my wife is concerned, is according to antenuptial agreement dated October 6, 1876, hereto attached.\u201d We said at page 272: \u201cThe will gives her exactly the same interest, as to the amount of the estate she takes, as the agreement does. ...... The only change is in the period of enjoyment, from life to widowhood. Why this was made, or whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>it was merely an oversight, we need not consider in view of the express declaration that as far as his wife was concerned these instruments were in accordance with each other.\u201d It is not less so here, where the gift is \u201cin accordance with the terms of the antenuptial agreement\u201d which requires the $15,000 to be paid to her \u201cunconditionally\u201d each year during her life. The present case is, indeed, stronger than Bowman v. Knorr, supra, for it is clear testator desired the sum paid out of income in the first instance, because he believed there would be ample for the purpose. That the antenuptial agreement was attached to the will in that case, and in this one is not, is a matter of no moment, since here it is directly referred to in the will, and every one agrees as to what it provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The decree of the court below is affirmed, and each appeal is dismissed at the cost of the appellant therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
