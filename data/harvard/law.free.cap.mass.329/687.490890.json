The prayers are for an accounting and a return of the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The respondent moved that certain specified issues of fact be tried by a jury. The judge denied the motion \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d The respondent appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">It is plain that this was not a proceeding on the probate side of the court. Although brought in the Probate Court, it was a suit in equity to enforce a fiduciary obligation. It falls under a well known heading of general equity jurisprudence. It could be brought in the Probate Court because it relates to the administration of the estate of a deceased person. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 215, \u00a7 6, as appearing in part in St. 1939, c. 194, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"A2i\">The power of the Probate Court to frame jury issues extends to such a case as this, since by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 215, \u00a7 16, that power extends to \u201cany proceeding.\u201d But by the terms of that same statute the power must be exercised \u201cin accordance with the practice established by the supreme judicial court in like cases.\u201d The practice established by the Supreme Judicial Court before the year 1919, when the statute was originally enacted as St. 1919, c. 274, \u00a7 7, and since maintained, with respect to jury issues in suits in equity was and is that, while such issues are seldom actually granted, the court possesses, and on rare occasions for reasons deemed sufficient exercises, a discretionary power to grant them if justice seems to require it. This was the conclusion reached after most careful consideration in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>180 Mass. 334, 344-356, and confirmed in other cases. <em>Shapira </em>v. <em>D\u2019Arcy, </em>180 Mass. 377, 378-379. <em>Culbert </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>181 Mass. 24. <em>Bergeron </em>v. <em>Automobile Mutual Ins. Co. </em>261 Mass. 409. <em>Pappathanos </em>v. <em>Coakley, </em>263 Mass. 401, 406. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>298 Mass. 346, 355. <em>Gulesian </em>v. <em>Newton Trust Co. </em>302 Mass. 369, 371. <em>New England Novelty Co. </em>v. <em>Sandberg, </em>315 Mass. 739, 750-751. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 34. This practice in suits in equity is to be distinguished from the practice in proceedings in probate, where by 1919 the granting of jury issues had become confined to contested will cases. <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Sylvia, </em>240 Mass. 49, 52-53. <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>268 Mass. 531, 534-535.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Manifestly then the respondent could not insist upon a jury as a matter of right. This case is not like <em>Stockbridge </em>v. <em>Mixer, </em>215 Mass. 415, 418, <em>Cochrane </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>265 Mass. 249, 254, and other cases, where the suit is in essence an action at law accompanied by an equitable trustee process. <em>Bressler </em>v. <em>Averbuck, </em>322 Mass. 139, 141. But the respondent did have a right to have the judge consider his motion and pass upon it as a matter of discretion. This the judge precluded himself from doing by denying the motion \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d This creates the difficulty in the case. We must take the judge at his. word. We are far from saying that the motion ought to have been granted. We say only that to deny it \u201cas a matter of law\u201d in the face of the language of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 215, \u00a7 16, and the \u201cpractice established\u201d by this court was error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The record furnishes no basis upon which we ourselves can pass upon the question of discretion. There is no report of the evidence, if any, or of the statements of counsel at the hearing on the motion. The judge filed \u201cFindings of Material Facts,\u201d in which, however, he found no facts other than that the respondent \u201ccontended that he would introduce evidence by reputable witnesses that the deceased did not entrust him with any bank accounts, cash on hand, or other personal property, and that he was in no way indebted to the decedent\u2019s estate, nor that he was in a fiduciary relationship with the decedent.\u201d The motion must be reconsidered in the light of this opinion by the trial judge who heard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">\n<em>Order denying respondent\u2019s motion for jury issues reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
