L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 42A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 330. See <em>School Committee of Cambridge </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schools of Cambridge, </em>320 Mass. 516, 517-518. He appeals from a decree denying that he has rights under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The material parts of c. 71, \u00a7 42A, provide that \u201cNo principal or supervisor who has served in that position for over three years shall ... be demoted ...\u201d except as provided therein. The plaintiff contends that, although designated as a director, he was in truth a principal or a supervisor or both. We do not deal with this question, since in our opinion the plaintiff has failed to meet the other requirement of the section that he shall have \u201cserved in that position for over three years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The facts appear from findings of the trial judge based upon an \u201cagreed statement of facts.\u201d The plaintiff was first elected to the position of director of industrial arts on June 13, 1947, by vote of the school committee, \u201ceffective September 3, 1947.\u201d The records of the committee, opposite the marginal heading \u201celection of teachers,\u201d show that on June 4, 1948, he was again elected director of industrial arts. On June <em>7, </em>1949, his name as director of industrial arts was included among \u201cteachers\u201d elected. The two votes last mentioned contained no reference to time. In 1950 he was not reelected. On August 15 of that year he \u201cwas called in and questioned by the committee.\u201d On September 8 a motion that the plaintiff be elected \u201con tenure\u201d was voted down, and it was voted that he be relieved from his duties as director of industrial arts and returned to his former position as a teacher. This was the demotion claimed. Before this the plaintiff had been included among the assistant superintendents, supervisors and directors to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>whom the superintendent of schools had sent a circular letter, dated May 29, 1950, reminding them of the need of their services \u201cthe last week in August to assist in completing plans for the reopening of schools on September 6,\u201d and stating that the superintendent expected \u201cto find . . . [him] ready for work on and after Tuesday, August 29.\u201d Notwithstanding the failure of the committee to reelect the plaintiff, he reported for work on August 29 as director of industrial arts \u201cand served in that position through September 8, 1950,\u201d when the committee voted to deny him election on tenure. Subsequent votes are not important, except that the plaintiff's request for a hearing was ultimately denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The words of \u00a7 42A, \u201cNo principal or supervisor who has served in that position for over three years shall ... be demoted . . .,'' must be held to refer to lawful service rendered under authority of the school committee. They cannot refer to some kind of unauthorized service which one may manage to perform on his own volition or by direction of someone having no authority to direct. From the several votes passed by the school committee it is apparent that the plaintiff was elected annually for a term which presumably corresponded with the ensuing school year. This was in accordance with the prevailing practice in electing teachers. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 41, as most recently amended by St. 1950, c. 283; <em>Frye </em>v. <em>School Committee of Leicester, </em>300 Mass. 537; <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>306 Mass. 265, 268-269; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>313 Mass. 641, 644. In these votes the plaintiff was referred to as a teacher, and. it would seem that in all except the first his name was listed with those of teachers. At any rate, there is nothing whatever to show that any election was for a period longer than the ensuing school year, or that the plaintiff had any reason to suppose that it was. The plaintiff served lawfully and under the authority of the school committee for three school years. If the words \u201cthree years\u201d in \u00a7 42A are satisfied by three school years, which we do not decide, then he had lawfully served three years of the time required by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>statute. But at that point his right to serve ended. He was never reelected by the committee. Instead, he \u201cwas called in and questioned by the committee.\u201d The superintendent had no authority to direct him to continue his work after his term of employment had expired. Authority to employ him was vested solely in the school committee. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 37, 38. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>School Committee of Springfield, </em>241 Mass. 325. <em>Decatur </em>v. <em>Auditor of Peabody, </em>251 Mass. 82, 88-89. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>313 Mass. 641, 644. <em>School Committee of Cambridge </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schools of Cambridge, </em>320 Mass. 516, 519. And that authority could not be delegated. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Pittsfield, </em>316 Mass. 283, 285-286. It follows that, although the plaintiff may have served for three years, he did not serve1 \u2018 for over three years <em>\u201d </em>as was required by \u00a7 42A as a condition precedent to the rights which he now claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The final decree is to be modified in respect to the reasons stated therein so that the decretal part thereof shall read, \u201c. . . it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the plaintiff has no right to a hearing in accordance with the provisions of General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 42A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 330, for the reason that the plaintiff has not served in the position of principal or supervisor for over three years, as required by that section.\u201d As so modified the decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
