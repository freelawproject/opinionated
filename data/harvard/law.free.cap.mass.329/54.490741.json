L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 136, \u00a7 6. The evidence was that on that day at 1:15 p.m. he operated a \u201cliquid tank unit drawn by a tractor\u201d on a public way in Wrentham, and that when stopped he told a police officer that the tank unit contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>gasoline which he was transporting on behalf of his employer for hire from Revere to Providence, Rhode Island, and that the gasoline might just as well have been transported on the previous Saturday as on Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In the Superior Court the case was heard without jury, the defendant waiving his right to trial by jury. The defendant was found guilty, and the judge reported the case for the determination of the question whether the transportation of gasoline in the circumstances heretofore related constituted a violation of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 136, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 136, \u00a7 5, \u201cany manner of labor, business or work, except works of necessity and charity,\u201d is forbidden on the Lord\u2019s day. One of the exceptions to that general prohibition recognized by \u00a7 6 is \u201cthe operation of motor vehicles.\u201d This exception originated in St. 1914, c. 757, \u00a7 1. It is true that the act of the defendant was literally the operation of a motor vehicle. But there is another statutory provision that must be considered. By St. 1950, c. 681, another exception to the general prohibition was created, that of \u201cthe transportation of general commodities by motor truck or trailers, then engaged in interstate commerce before eight o\u2019clock in the forenoon and after eight o\u2019clock in the evening.\u201d The further exception, \u201cin the event of an emergency between the aforesaid hours,\u201d is not applicable because the judge rightly found in accordance with the evidence that no emergency existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The statute of 1950 impliedly makes unlawful the transportation of commodities between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on the Lord\u2019s day, in the absence of emergency. It is inconsistent with any right to transport them all day on the Lord\u2019s day, under the provision permitting \u201cthe operation of motor vehicles\u201d on the Lord\u2019s day. Both the statute of 1950 and the earlier statute are to be construed together so that they will be harmonious and not conflicting, all the words of each being given some effect. <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85. <em>Killam </em>v. <em>March, </em>316 Mass. 646, 649-650. <em>Libby </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Hartford Railroad, </em>273 Mass. 522, 526. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCaughey, </em>9 Gray, 296, 297.
