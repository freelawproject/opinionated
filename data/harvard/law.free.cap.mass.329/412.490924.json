Bogner, late of Northampton, to recover for his death on June 13, 1946, while he was helping the defendant install a heavy drop forge in the factory of the deceased\u2019s employer, the International Silver Company in Northampton, of which factory he was foreman, having only two superiors. The drop forge had been bought by the Silver Company from a firm in Hartford, Connecticut, and was being installed by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>fendant. The Silver Company owned a tow-motor, a heavy little truck on wheels, capable of lifting and moving objects up to two tons in weight. Part of the drop forge was called a \u201cway.\u201d It was about eight feet long, and weighed somewhat less than two tons.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">On the day of the accident the \u201cway\u201d was lying on the floor of a truck that had brought it to the factory, and had to be moved out of the rear end of the truck onto the tow-motor. The deceased was on one of two lifting forks on the front of the tow-motor when the way slipped from the truck, struck him, and caused his death. The Silver Company was a subscriber under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. Its insurer paid compensation for the death of the deceased, and brought this action to recover from the defendant. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 15, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">We need not consider whether the work done by the defendant which resulted in the death of the deceased was \u201cpart of or process in, the trade or business carried on by the insured,\u201d or merely \u201cancillary and incidental\u201d thereto, making the defendant a \u201cperson other than the insured\u201d and thus liable for negHgence. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 18, as amended. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>M. W. Leahy Co. Inc. </em>300 Mass. 565. <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Dowgielewicz, </em>304 Mass. 560. <em>Meehan </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>307 Mass. 59. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Miettinen, </em>317 Mass. 633. <em>Bencivengo </em>v. <em>Walter C. Benson Co. Inc. </em>319 Mass. 110. <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>Soule Mill, </em>323 Mass. 472. <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Link-Belt Co. </em>324 Mass. 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">If it be assumed that the work was such that the defendant would be Hable for negHgence, the plaintiff could not recover without proving negHgence. The heavy base of the \u201cway\u201d was toward the cab or front of the truck, and the lighter end was projecting about two feet out of the rear of the truck. There was no roUer under the base of the \u201cway,\u201d but there was a .two inch steel roller under the Hghter end near the rear of the truck, \u201cchocked\u201d with two tapering wooden wedges a foot long and four inches wide. Employees of the defendant were in the truck, but there was no evidence that they touched or moved the \u201cway\u201d while it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>in the position just described. The \u201cway\u201d started to move, apparently of itself, and killed the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The plaintiff, to prove negligence, relied on an expert witness named Gleason. He testified that the proper method of unloading a \u201cway\u201d is to put it on rollers and roll it over the tailboard down to the ground, holding it back by the use of a pulley block. But he did not know how the truck was constructed, and consequently could not tell how the pulley block could be attached to it. He admitted that a tow-motor was efficient for the moving of a \u201cway\u201d of the weight of the one in question. We do not find any evidence for the jury of the defendant\u2019s negligence. In our opinion there was error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
