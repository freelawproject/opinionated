The answer was a general denial. The testimony of the plaintiff was that after he had refused to do the job on the credit of the corporation, the defendant told him that the contract would be between him and the plaintiff, and that the defendant would pay the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the judge directed a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff excepted. The evidence warranted a finding that the plaintiff gave credit to the defendant and not to the corporation at all. <em>Colpitts </em>v. <em>L. C.
