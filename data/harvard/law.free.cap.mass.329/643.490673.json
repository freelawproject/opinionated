The husband appealed. The wife applied to the Probate Court for an allowance with which to defend against that appeal. On May 26, 1952, the judge ordered the husband to pay into court $500 for the use of the wife. The husband appealed from that order. On request of the husband, the judge found as the material facts that the wife intends to defend against the husband\u2019s appeal in good faith, that to prepare her case will require analysis, condensation and summarizing of the evidence, and that the husband is able to pay and in fairness ought to pay the wife $500 for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">By G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 208, \u00a7 38, as it appears in St. 1933, c. 288, the court in a divorce case may \u201caward costs and expenses\u201d to either party \u201cwhether or not the marital relation has terminated.\u201d .Such an award may include counsel fees. <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>326 Mass. 587, 594. <em>Sack </em>v. <em>Sack, </em>328 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Mass. 600, 605. The principle, stated in <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Hayden, supra, </em>at page 595, that the power to award costs and expenses ceases when the litigation is terminated, has no application here, for the appeal kept the litigation alive. <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>144 Mass. 415, 416. The amount of the allowance is supported by the findings of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab74\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
