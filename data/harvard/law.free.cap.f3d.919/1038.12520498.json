Buckler was tragically injured at his place of work, a surface gravel mine. Mr. Buckler sued the United States of America under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). He argued his injuries were caused at least in part by a federal mine inspector's inadequate inspection of the mine. The district court held Missouri law contained no private-analogue duty from which FTCA liability could arise. The district court held in the alternative that the discretionary-function exception to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity applied. With one limited exception, we agree the discretionary-function exception applies, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court in most respects. We reverse only as to the claim that the mine inspector failed to carry out a non-discretionary and mandatory duty to review training records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Buckler was injured when using an impact-based rock crusher located at the mine. The crusher had a rotating element to throw rocks against a steel anvil. Upstream from this rotator, a vibrating loading chute moved rocks towards the rotator. The vibrating chute became jammed, and workers turned off the vibrator, but not the rotator. Mr. Buckler attempted to clear the chute by pushing the rocks with an 8-foot steel bar. The bar came into contact with the rotator and crushed Mr. Buckler's upper spine, causing quadriplegia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The mine at issue was subject to two inspections per year by federal inspectors from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (\"MSHA\"). The last inspection occurred in March 2011, and the accident occurred in June 2011. According to Mr. Buckler, a hose that controlled a hydraulic rock clearer on the loading chute had been torn for several years, but no mine inspector had identified this shortcoming as a dangerous condition. Also according to Mr. Buckler, the inspector in March 2011 failed to observe rock crushing operations or maintenance, failed to note missing worker training documentation, and failed to disseminate safety information. Finally, Mr. Buckler emphasizes that, notwithstanding these alleged failures during the March inspection, the mine owner received citations for related safety violations discovered after the June accident. Those citations included a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2048.29\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for failing to have training documentation for Mr. Buckler available at the mine site for inspection by MSHA. They also included a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2057.14105\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 57.14105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for failing to de-energize equipment and block it against motion when performing maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Buckler sued the government pursuant to the FTCA. The government moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), asserting sovereign immunity and arguing a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The government argued specifically that there existed no state-law, private-analogue duty under Missouri law and that the discretionary-function exception to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity applied. Regarding the discretionary-function exception, the parties disputed whether the alleged infirmities with the inspection arose from the\n   inspectors' mandatory or discretionary functions. And, to the extent the alleged infirmities arose from discretionary functions, the parties disputed whether that discretion was subject to policy analysis. The district court dismissed the case, finding no state-law duty. The district court did not set forth an analysis of the discretionary-function exception but concluded its order by stating that, for the reasons listed in the government's brief, the discretionary-function exception would also bar recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We review de novo the district court's grant of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herden v.

Statutory limitations on this waiver that are material to the present case include: (1) the state-law, private-analogue duty requirement; and (2) the discretionary-function exception. The state-law, private-analogue duty requirement precludes the imposition of FTCA liability based solely on the breach of a federally created duty-if a private person acting in similar circumstances would not be liable under state law for the alleged harm, then there is no FTCA waiver of sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (allowing liability \"under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred\").

State-Law, Private-Analogue Duty\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Here, the parties address several possible sources for a state-law, private-analogue duty, focusing primarily on the Good Samaritan Doctrine as adopted in Missouri.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stanturf v. Sipes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10146622\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/447/558/#p561\">\n    447 S.W.2d 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561-62 (Mo. 1969) ;\n   <em>\n    Kraus v. Hy-Vee, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9154672\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/147/907/#p925\">\n    147 S.W.3d 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 925 (Mo. Ct. App. 2004). A key requirement for liability\n   under this doctrine is an increase in the risk of harm based upon the defendant's-the Good Samaritan's-actions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 323(a) (Am. Law Inst. 1965) (\"his failure to exercise such care increases the risk of such harm\"); \u00a7 324A(a) (\"his failure to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of such harm\"). The government argues a private inspector who negligently fails to detect or report a dangerous condition does not increase the risk of harm but, at most, allows an existing risk caused by another person to persist. According to Mr. Buckler, however, a Missouri Court of Appeals case demonstrates that an inspector's failure to report a dangerous condition should be viewed as increasing the risk of harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Michigan Millers Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9946826\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/665/630/#p636\">\n    665 S.W.2d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636 (Mo. Ct. App. 1984) (holding a private inspector increased the risk of harm by failing to report a dangerous condition regarding the risk of electric sparks in the presence of flammable grain dust). Mr. Buckler argues that\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   demonstrates the Missouri Supreme Court, if faced with the question, would conclude a negligent inspection can give rise to liability under the Good Samaritan Doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eubank v. Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052450\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/424/#p427\">\n    626 F.3d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 427 (8th Cir. 2010) (\"If the Supreme Court of Missouri has not addressed an issue, we must predict how the court would rule, and we follow decisions from the intermediate state courts when they are the best evidence of Missouri law.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   arguably is distinguishable from the present case in several respects. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , an insurer provided the inspector as a means of reducing risk and making insurance more affordable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9946826\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/665/630/#p636\">\n    665 S.W.2d at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , therefore, arguably involved the breach of a contractual duty. Regardless, the court in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   did not purport to rely on the arguably contractual nature of the duty to inspect. Rather, the Missouri Court of Appeals stated, \"Thus, under this theory, there is a factual basis for submission. Defendants, for whatever reason, undertook to inspect for hazards. The evidence unquestionably demonstrates that the existence and use of the plastic pipe was a hazardous condition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9946826\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/665/630/#p636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9946826\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/665/630/#p636\">\n    at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude a qualifying state-law duty exists because\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   provides the \"best evidence\" as to how the Missouri Supreme Court would rule if faced with the question of whether an assumed duty to investigate for hazards may give rise to state-law tort liability.\n   <em>\n    Eubank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052450\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/424/#p427\">\n    626 F.3d at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.

In fact, the statement of purpose, standing alone says nothing about what an MSHA inspector must do and provides no details that might govern and restrict how an MSHA inspector is to carry out inspections. Mr. Buckler relies on a similarly general statement of purpose found in the Handbook. Chapter 1.A of the Handbook states that the purpose of inspections is to \"assure that a safe and healthy workplace is provided and maintained for miners\" by various means including \"by providing information and assistance to the mining industry to aid in reducing and eliminating accidents, injuries, and illnesses in mines or mills.\"\n   <em>\n    Handbook\n   </em>\n   , at 1.

Inspecting Equipment and Observing all Mining Cycles\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Regarding the inspection of equipment and the observation of all mining cycles, Mr. Buckler cites various Handbook provisions addressing these inspection targets and reads them together with the inspectors' general duty to \"determin[e] whether an imminent danger exists,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20813\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and the corresponding duty to issue citations or impose an order to cease activities if an imminent danger is discovered,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20813\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 814(a).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   1\n   <em>\n    Program Policy Manual\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 107(a) (discussing imminent danger orders).

Again, however, the Handbook's use of the term \"shall\" does not reflect an absence of discretion. And, even if we were to interpret the phrase \"make every effort\" as mandating a particular course of action, Chapter 5.G expressly recognizes that not every cycle of a mining operation will be active at the time of an inspector's visit. As such, inspectors are to exercise discretion to satisfy themselves that their inspection is complete:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   At times, however, inspectors may not be able to observe every mining cycle at\n   every working place during a particular inspection.

Instead, required actions following the discovery of an imminent danger are duties flowing from an antecedent determination-a determination necessarily rooted in discretion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830358\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/890/#p895\">\n    17 F.3d at 895-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Until that assessment is made, the inspector is not bound by statute or regulation to do anything other than inspect.

As such, the MSHA inspectors are charged, first, with assessing conditions at a mine and then, based on that assessment, carrying out functions deemed appropriate and necessary for those conditions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 1\n   <em>\n    Program Policy Manual\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 107(a) (addressing imminent danger orders and stating, \"The imminence of danger is a judg[ ]ment to be made in light of all relevant circumstances. If the violative condition or practice is not an imminent danger, the proper action by the inspector is to issue a citation or order ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In fact, the inspection at issue in the present case illustrates this discretion well. Mr. Buckler argues a hydraulic line for a rock clearer on the crusher had been torn for years and yet neither the March 2011 inspector nor any previous inspectors had flagged the crusher as an imminent danger. According to Mr. Buckler, the torn line should have triggered additional inquiry which would have revealed workers were manually clearing rock jams. Manually clearing rock jams, however, is not necessarily inherently dangerous, much less an \"imminent danger,\" if equipment is de-energized and blocked from movement. An inspector, therefore, must make a choice in reviewing the condition and operation of equipment as to when the inspection is complete and whether follow-up is required. The Handbook provides no specific guidance as to this choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   c.

The mine operators\n   hold the primary responsibility for worker safety; it does not follow that a mandatory duty imposed upon a mine operator creates a mandatory duty for an inspector.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kane v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1527485\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/15/87/#p89\">\n    15 F.3d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89 (8th Cir. 1994) (\"Courts have protected agency decisions relating to 'the extent to which [an agency] will supervise the safety procedures of private individuals,' because of the impact of those decisions on the 'feasibility and practicality' of a government program with respect to 'staffing and funding' and the 'efficient allocation of agency resources.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kirchmann v.

Simply put, the fact that the mine operator is required to maintain certain forms and have them available for inspection, does not mean mine inspectors' review of those documents is strictly dictated in specific terms. As such, we find little authority in the cited provisions for mandatory duties on inspectors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Even those provisions that do set forth duties for inspectors concerning worker training documentation generally set forth\n   <em>\n    contingent\n   </em>\n   duties triggered by antecedent determinations. For example, the Mine Act provides that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the Secretary finds a mine employee who has not received \"the requisite safety training as determined under section 825 of this Title, the Secretary ... shall issue an order\" declaring the employee to be a \"hazard\" and requiring the employee to leave the mine.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20814\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). But, as already stated, we may not ignore the discretion associated with the underlying, antecedent determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Mr. Buckler correctly argues that at least some level of examination of training records is required; in fact the government concedes this point. The government argues, however, that substantial discretion remains as to how MSHA inspectors carry out such inspections and that MSHA inspectors may exercise discretion to \"review\" records through an audit or sampling method. In this regard, Handbook Chapter 5.T provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   During each regular inspection, inspectors shall review required mine operator and / or contractor documentation regarding mandatory health, training, and safety regulations. Documentation and / or forms which are required to be reviewed and noted by the inspector during every regular inspection include, at a minimum, the items listed on MSHA's inspection (Form 4000-49) forms. Reviews of required on-site documentation should go back to the previous regular inspection conducted by MSHA....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   ... Training records, and injury, illness, and employment reports shall be verified by inspectors by reviewing on-site documentation and discussing it with random miners and mine management to assure that this documentation is correct. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Inspectors should also verify that records at the mine or with the contractor match records on file (e.g., legal identity forms, Part 48 training plans) with MSHA....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Handbook\n   </em>\n   , at 37-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The argument that this Handbook provision sets forth mandatory, non-discretionary requirements for MSHA inspectors has some superficial appeal. As already noted, however, the Handbook defines the word \"shall\" as preserving inspector discretion. Moreover, the required worker-training documentation can be voluminous and it may be composite in nature-a single form is not necessarily limited to a worker's completion of a particular training session.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3 Program Policy Manual \u00a7 48.9/48.29 (addressing the use of composite forms rather than individual forms). In short, the number of records that the mine operators are required to maintain and that inspectors \"shall review\" will, at\n   many mines, be too large to permit individual verification of each record. In this context, we cannot interpret the relatively vague Handbook provision that calls for the \"review\" of records as eliminating inspector discretion in the manner of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   ii. Discretion Grounded in or Subject to Policy Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Having determined that the MSHA inspectors possess discretion in relation to the duties that Mr. Buckler challenges, we next examine the nature of that discretion to determine if it is subject to or grounded in policy analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p328\">\n    499 U.S. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p328\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Buckler argues that if discretion exists, it involves no balancing of competing policy interests. According to Mr. Buckler, the sole policy at issue is miner safety and to the extent inspectors exercise discretion, they do so only for technical reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This characterization vastly oversimplifies the role of the MSHA and presumes unlimited resources for inspectors to deploy at every mine.

In\n   <em>\n    Lather\n   </em>\n   , in contrast, a treating psychologist was focused singularly on providing healthcare to one patient.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532482\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/879/365/#p366\">\n    879 F.2d at 366-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Buckler seeks to characterize the current inspector's focus as singular, like that of the treating psychologist in\n   <em>\n    Lather\n   </em>\n   . That situation, however, is easily distinguishable. Even if a healthcare professional focusing on a single patient can be viewed as pursuing a singular goal, the inspector here is not akin to a healthcare professional focusing on one patient. The inspector is more akin to a triage nurse or doctor charged with assessing numerous patients, identifying needs and risks, and allocating resources among patients. Simply put, the inspector at issue in the present case was neither stationed permanently at one mine nor provided with unlimited resources to guarantee safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For this reason, our court has repeatedly characterized discretion in the context of safety inspections or safety warnings as susceptible to policy choice due to the need to balance safety against governmental efforts and costs and the need for professionals on the ground to adapt to the conditions they face in determining how to expend limited resources in the efforts to identify dangers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182492\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/1227/#p1231\">\n    785 F.3d at 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the Corps of Engineers' discretion as to placement of warnings and barriers was subject to policy analysis due to field-level cost-benefit considerations);\n   <em>\n    Demery v.

Factual Disputes\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In a slight variation on his other arguments, Mr. Buckler argues that the jurisdictional inquiry in this case presents a factual question not appropriate for resolution without a full trial on the merits. He argues the March 2011 inspector falsified records and failed entirely to perform any review of worker training documentation. He also argues such acts fall wholly outside any discretion that might otherwise exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Our court has indicated that, even if discretion exists as to the manner in which a government employee carries out an inspection or investigation, the employee may lack discretion to entirely forgo the inspection. For example, we refused to apply the discretionary-function exception where a federal grain inspector entirely failed to conduct an investigation, stating, \"[A]lthough the inspector had discretion in selecting how he would investigate the status of previously reported out-of-condition grain, he had no discretion not to undertake some investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Appley Bros. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381327\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/1164/#p1172\">\n    164 F.3d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1172 (8th Cir. 1999). This distinction is consistent with our general recognition that a policy may include some discretionary and some mandatory provisions, and that what matters for our analysis is the nature of the provision material to the challenged decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Compart's Boar Store\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340909\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/600/#p605\">\n    829 F.3d at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Parsing a government employee's duties this thinly is confusing to say the least. After all, the FTCA itself provides that the exception is to apply \"based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government,\n   <em>\n    whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). And, failing to conduct an investigation arguably could be described as a simple abuse of discretion. Falsifying records, however, would seem to be more than a mere abuse of discretion. Based upon\n   <em>\n    Appley Brothers\n   </em>\n   , therefore, we believe it is permissible, when analyzing the discretionary-function exception, to recognize that some duties are mandatory in that they must be performed\n   <em>\n    in some fashion\n   </em>\n   , even if the manner in which they are performed involves protected discretion. Moreover, the government in the present case concedes that at least some review of worker training documentation was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Drawing upon this authority, Mr. Buckler argues that, even if discretion otherwise exists as to the manner in which an MSHA inspector \"reviews\" training documentation, the inspector is without discretion to entirely forgo such a review. He then argues that the record as currently developed for Rule 12(b)(1) purposes shows the March 2011 inspector conducted no review of worker training documentation. He cites: his own declaration in which he asserts he received no training (and which the government does not dispute); the inspection form completed by the March 2011 inspector on which the inspector indicated he had reviewed six worker training forms; and the fact that the mine employed only six workers who required training. In addition, he cites evidence from the post-accident investigation and citation indicating that Mr. Buckler's records were missing. Finally, he cites deposition\n   testimony from the MSHA's Deputy Administrator for the Metal and Non-Metal program area who described inspectors' duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Mr. Buckler notes that the mine was cited for failing to have documentation of training for Mr. Buckler. He cites testimony to the effect that documentation of Mr. Buckler's initial worker training was requested but unavailable. According to Mr. Buckler, this information, read together, shows the March 11 inspector could not have reviewed the forms as claimed and had to have falsified his inspection form when reporting that he reviewed six worker-training forms. Mr. Buckler argues that, at a minimum, this creates a factual question as to whether the inspector actually conducted any investigation of worker training documentation. Mr. Buckler characterizes this question as a question for trial that cannot be resolved at the current stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osborn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536964\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/918/724/#p729\">\n    918 F.2d at 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the court's ability to resolve factual disputes on Rule 12(b)(1) motions, and stating, \"The only exception is in instances when the jurisdictional issue is so bound up with the merits that a full trial on the merits may be necessary to resolve the issue\" (citation omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We conclude that the evidence Mr. Buckler cites suffices, at this early stage in the case, to create a question as to whether the inspector performed any review of training records. Although the inspector possessed discretion as to the manner in which he reviewed documentation, and although it does not matter for purposes of the discretionary-function exception if the inspector acted negligently and sloppily in his investigation, he was wholly without discretion to not conduct at least some review of training materials.\n   <em>\n    Appley Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381327\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/1164/#p1172\">\n    164 F.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The cumulative effect of the evidence does more than cast a vague suspicion upon the inspector's claims to have reviewed training documents: the government does not contest Buckler's claim that he received no training, the record plainly shows there were no training records for Buckler, and the fact that the inspector claimed to have reviewed six records-the same as the number of employees subject to training requirements-supports the reasonable inference that the inspector falsely claimed to have reviewed records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We conclude, therefore, that as to the limited question of the inspector's alleged failure to fulfill his mandatory and non-discretionary duty to inspect training records, the jurisdictional inquiry is \"so bound up\" with the merits of the case as to require further factual development of this threshold jurisdictional question.\n   <em>\n    Osborn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536964\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/918/724/#p729\">\n    918 F.2d at 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At this preliminary stage, we make no comment as to the difficult issue of whether a failure to inspect training records can be shown as a proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We affirm the judgment of the district court finding no waiver of sovereign immunity and dismissing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in all respects other than the allegations of a failure to inspect training records.
