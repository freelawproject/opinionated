This opinion addresses Plaintiffs-Appellants' argument that Defendants-Appellees do not meet the definition of a \"prevailing party\" under section 505 of the Copyright Act or section 35(a) of the Lanham Act.

Oct. 26, 2016). In 2011, after a falling-out between Yun and Meissner, Yun allegedly formed Manhattan Enterprise as a competitor to Manhattan Review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manhattan Review LLC v. Yun\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Manhattan Review II\n   </em>\n   \"), No. 16 Civ. 102,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201330334\">\n    2017 WL 1330334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D.N.Y.

July 17, 2017). In operating Manhattan Enterprise, Yun allegedly used Manhattan Review's assets and intellectual property, including trademarks and copyrighted test preparation materials, without Meissner's consent. In December 2011, Yun also filed a Certificate of Cancellation of Manhattan Review's status as an LLC with the Delaware Secretary of State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March 2012, Meissner, individually and derivatively on behalf of Manhattan Review, sued Yun and Manhattan Enterprise in New York state court on various state law claims. The court initially dismissed Meissner's derivative claims due to the outstanding Certificate of Cancellation, holding that Meissner could not sue on behalf of Manhattan Review given its cancelled status. Seeking to rehabilitate those claims, Meissner filed a Certificate of Correction with the Delaware Secretary of State, challenging the validity of Yun's Certificate of Cancellation. After obtaining a Certificate of Good Standing for Manhattan Review, Meissner filed a motion to vacate the state court's dismissal of the derivative claims. The state court denied that motion on the ground that Meissner had not shown that issuance of the Certificate of Good Standing effected a nullification of the Certificate of Cancellation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2016, Plaintiffs-Appellants Manhattan Review and Meissner (suing only derivatively on his company's behalf) filed suit in federal court against Defendants-Appellees Yun, Manhattan Enterprise, and Kelly. Plaintiffs-Appellants' First Amended Complaint alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , copyright infringement pursuant to section 501 of the Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , trademark infringement pursuant\n   to section 43(a) of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and various state law causes of action. Defendants-Appellees moved to dismiss the First Amended Complaint, arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Plaintiffs-Appellants lacked standing to assert their claims. The magistrate judge recommended dismissing certain state law claims and allowing Plaintiffs-Appellants to amend their complaint. The district court adopted those recommendations on October 26, 2016,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manhattan Review I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206330409\">\n    2016 WL 6330409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, and Plaintiffs-Appellants filed a Second Amended Complaint repleading their Copyright Act and Lanham Act claims. None of Plaintiffs-Appellants' three complaints mentioned the prior state court action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants-Appellees moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. They argued that the state court orders precluded Plaintiffs-Appellants from bringing their federal suit. The magistrate judge agreed, holding that the \"state court['s] determin[ation] that the Certificate of Good Standing was not a proper nullification of the Certificate of Cancellation\" was \"decisive of Manhattan Review's capacity to bring direct claims as well as Dr. Meissner's capacity to bring derivative claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Manhattan Review II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201330334\">\n    2017 WL 1330334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. Because Plaintiffs-Appellants had received a full and fair opportunity to litigate that question in state court, collateral estoppel barred their claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. On July 17, 2017, the district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendations to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint and deny Plaintiffs-Appellants leave to file a third amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manhattan Review II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203034350\">\n    2017 WL 3034350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants-Appellees then sought an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to section 505 of the Copyright Act and section 35(a) of the Lanham Act. The magistrate judge recommended granting Defendants-Appellees' motion in part and awarding Defendants-Appellees $ 48,160.50 in attorneys' fees and $ 593.54 in costs. On December 5, 2017, the district court adopted that recommendation in its entirety.

We reject that argument.

Whatever the ongoing vitality of that holding in the wake of\n   <em>\n    CRST\n   </em>\n   , it has no application to the circumstances before us today.
