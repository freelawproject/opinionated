For the reasons set forth below, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2013, Defendant Tamela Lee was sworn in as a member of the Summit County Council to represent District 5 in Akron, Ohio. She signed an oath of office stating that she would \"faithfully, honestly, and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent on\" a member of the Council. (Supplemental Appendix at 90.) This case concerns Defendant's relationship with Omar Abdelqader (\"Abdelqader\"), who owned a business in District 5 but did not reside there. The FBI began investigating the relationship between Defendant in her position as Summit County Councilperson and Abdelqader in October 2013 following complaints that Abdelqader \"was insisting on monthly cash payments from other local businesses\" that he would give to Defendant in exchange for political favors. (R. 126, Transcript, PageID # 849-50.) Defendant knew Abdelqader through her husband, and Abdelqader helped support Defendant when her husband unexpectedly left the country for long stretches of time. Defendant's husband's departure left her in serious financial difficulties, and Abdelqader supported her by allowing her to take items from his convenience store, paying for services for her, and giving her money. The FBI obtained wiretaps on both Defendant's and Abdelqader's cellular phones, which allowed the FBI to monitor many conversations and text messages between Defendant and Abdelqader.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendant's Intervention in Assault Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 1, 2014, Abdelqader's nephews, Sharif Hamed (\"Hamed\") and Samir Abdelqader (\"Samir\"), were arrested for felonious assault after an altercation with an unidentified man in Akron. Abdelqader turned to Defendant for help with the matter on June 8, 2014. He first asked her to attend a hearing for Samir, and when she told him she could not attend, she offered to call or email the judge instead. In the same conversation, Defendant and Abdelqader discussed Defendant's financial problems, and Abdelqader promised her that they would \"work it out.\" (R. 126, Transcript, PageID # 911.) On June 9, 2014, Defendant placed calls to the Summit County Juvenile Court bailiff and the judicial assistant for the Summit County Juvenile Court judge. In a conversation with his brother (Samir's father) later that day, Abdelqader told his brother that he had discussed the case with Defendant, stating that he had given Defendant two hundred dollars and that he had promised to give her an additional three hundred dollars if she \"finish[ed] up this matter for [Abdelqader].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at PageID # 924-26.) Defendant deposited two hundred dollars in her bank account on June 10, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Two days later, on June 12, 2014, Abdelqader texted Defendant. He reminded her of his nephew's name and stated \"Please don't forget to call. We have court today at 2.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at PageID # 938.) That afternoon, Defendant placed several calls to the Akron Municipal Court judge who was handling the case and his staff. Those calls lasted 51 seconds and 5 minutes and 44 seconds, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The next day,\n   Defendant and Abdelqader discussed the case again. Abdelqader told Defendant \"I really need your help in these two cases ... with my two nephews.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at PageID # 946.) When Abdelqader expressed outrage at the charges, Defendant tried to describe to him why his nephews were culpable \"from a legal position,\" explaining \"you have to understand, that by the law of the State of Ohio and the United States of American [sic], when you do that-it's wrong!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at PageID # 947-49.) Defendant suggested that Abdelqader's nephew could try to press charges against the other man in the altercation. Abdelqader told Defendant \"the only thing I need from you is, is try to, try to explain to these people what exactly happened.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at PageID # 949.) The conversation shifted to Defendant's money problems, and Abdelqader told Defendant to come by his convenience store so he could give her money. Finally, Defendant promised Abdelqader right before they hung up that she would speak with her friend at the prosecutor's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 14, 2014, Defendant spoke with Abdelqader regarding her calls to the judge and stated that she was \"broke.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at PageID # 957.) Abdelqader told Defendant to send her daughter to pick up fifty dollars from his store. They also discussed his nephews' case: Defendant told Abdelqader that she had missed calls from the judge and the bailiff, and he asked her to \"try to get a hold of them and let them know what's going on.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at PageID # 960.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly before Hamed's hearing on June 17, 2014, Defendant went to the court and spoke with Judge Larson, the judge in the case. Defendant said that she was there as a character witness, incorrectly claiming that Samir was her relative. Defendant then went to discuss the issue with the prosecutor in the case, Marisa Pappas (\"Pappas\"). Defendant told Pappas that Hamed was her nephew, she wanted to be a character witness for him, and she was on the County Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 9, 2014, Defendant texted Gertrude Wilms (\"Wilms\"), the chief city prosecutor for the city of Akron, whom she knew through their mutual involvement in Akron politics. Wilms called Defendant back on July 10, 2014, and Defendant began talking about Abdelqader's nephews' case. Wilms told Defendant \"I don't know what we're talking about,\" and Defendant responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Okay, uh, the boy on Arlington the 17 year old who hit the guy with the car, anyway. Like my favorite, favorite, favorite people. I know Samir, I don't know the other boy. Samir works right here right around the corner from me. But anyway, I had asked them, why did anybody, you know the other guy was 28 and they were 17. I said, \"Why wasn't the 28-year-old charged?\" And anyway they said they had come down, the parents came down to um press charges against the 28-year-old. And I just told them, I said, \"Well look I'll call Gert, and I'll just tell her what I know.\" And I'm not trying to influence you, you can't say I'm trying to influence you. I'm trying to make you think. That's all I'm trying to do; just trying to make you think.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (R. 132, Transcript, PageID # 1378.) The conversation continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   LEE: But, the history with what happened with them and that 28 year old guy who started the fight. I've always known that story. You know, from the boy who works at Lorenzo's, you know I know everybody that works at everybody's store. And that he's a problem. And that he's the one who went into the, he saw their car, and went into the barbershop and started the fight. So this whole thing started because of this 28\n   year old bully, going in and harassing the 17 and 18 year old boys. And Samir is the nicest, sweetest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   WILMS: Well what happened that Samir got charged?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   LEE: Well because the 17 year old, when the police started coming, everyone started running, and the 17 year old was in the car and he was trying to get around the curb to run away, well he actually hit the 28 year old. (UI).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   WILMS: With the car?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   LEE: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   WILMS: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   LEE: So, all of their, their case is the 17 year old and the 18 year old, you know, both of their cases, you know, have gone forward because you know when it happened, you know I told them I said, \"Look you hit somebody with a car.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   WILMS: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   LEE: There, there's no getting around that, I mean that's just stupid. But Samir he says he \"Wasn't trying to hit him,\" he \"Was trying to get away.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   WILMS: Okay. Is his case still pending?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   LEE: Uh huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   WILMS: Who is the attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   LEE: I don't know who they went and got as their attorney?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   WILMS: Okay. So he told his attorney all this and everything. Is this the case that's pending in Larsen's Court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   LEE: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   WILMS: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   LEE: But they came, the parents came down to press charges against the 28 year old.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   WILMS: Whose parents?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   LEE: Both of them, Samir and his cousin, they both came down about a week ago and they were told that it's up to the Prosecutor, whether or not, you know to press charges against the 28 year old.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   WILMS: Alright, I'm going to have to look at this stuff and call you back because none of this story is making sense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   LEE: Is what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   WILMS: I'll pull some police reports and I'll call you back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   LEE: Okay honey and then maybe I'll make more sense when you know what I'm talking about.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   WILMS: Yeah, I don't know exactly what happened so and we usually don't sign charges when the police have made a decision on scene, who they think is the primary aggressor, we don't second guess that, so it's not likely to get charges but I'll look into it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   LEE: Okay. Because there were actually two altercations. Because he came into the barbershop and started the fight and then the barbershop owner told them, you know, to get off their property or whatever. (OV) What the witnesses saw, what the witnesses saw was the second, um, altercation-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   WILMS: Uh huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   LEE: -in the street. The 28 year old started it and then if you look at like the text message history and all the other stuff, well the 28 year old has been harassing these boys for months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   WILMS: Okay, let me take a look at it Tamela and I'll call you back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   LEE: Oh, okay thanks Gert.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   WILMS: Uh huh. Hmm. Bye.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   LEE: Bye bye.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 1379-81.) There was no prohibition on members of the public calling Wilms to discuss a case. After the call, Wilms checked the case file and discussed it with the prosecutor assigned to the case, ultimately concluding that no charges should be filed against the unidentified man. Wilms called Defendant back and left her a voicemail to that effect. Wilms testified that she believed if she did not call\n   Defendant back, Defendant might \"go over [Wilms'] head and contact [her] supervisor,\" the law director. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 1388.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant's Letter to the IRS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Abdelqader's friend Malek Albanna (\"Albanna\") had a son, George Albanna (\"George\"), who was under investigation by the IRS. Unbeknownst to Abdelqader and Defendant, Albanna was assisting the FBI in its investigation of Abdelqader and Defendant. Albanna recorded a conversation between himself and Abdelqader in May of 2014. In that conversation, Albanna and Abdelqader discussed George's case. Albanna told Abdelqader that a church had written a character letter supporting George. He then asked Abdelqader, \"Didn't you once tell me ... that you'd arrange for me a document, or a letter from her ... that girl you got ... she'd be testifying that George is upstanding?\" (R. 126, Transcript, PageID # 875.) Abdelqader replied, \"I can ... Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I can get her ... to put it in a document.... I'll get her to make you a document ... with a governmental stamp, also.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When Albanna stated \"No matter what it costs-I'll pay!\", Abdelqader responded \"whatever it does cost, I'll pay-because George is my son, man!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 876-77.) Abdelqader reiterated later in the conversation, \"I'll get her to prepare a document for you, and it would [be] stamped with the stamp of the government.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 877.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On June 20, 2014, Albanna and Abdelqader discussed George's case again. Albanna asked, \"What happened with the woman in regards to George?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 972.) Abdelqader responded, \"I swear ... I can go anytime to get the paper from the woman. She told me: 'Whenever you ready ... whenever you need it ... Anytime you need it-the paper is available.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 972-73.) Abdelqader continued, \"Do you understand me? She came ... to the court with my nephew ... I mean she'd do whatever ... you know what I mean? ... I just tell her whatever I want to do. But she said 'Whenever you need it' ... She tells me, 'I will bring it to you on the same day.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 973.) When Abdelqader mentioned the fact that Defendant had come to his nephews' trial, Abdelqader stated that \"her presence did change the entire situation, my man.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 976.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On July 26, 2014, Abdelqader and Defendant discussed the letter. Portions of that conversation are included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   LEE: I didn't get that letter done, or come up there, so,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ABDELQADER: Mmm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   LEE: And he didn't send me the letter, he just sent me a d--n blank letterhead, so,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   ABDELQADER: Mmm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   LEE: I have to re-type it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   ABDELQADER: Uh huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   LEE: And, it's been so long, Omar, I don't even remember. You have to tell me again, what it is that you need?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   ABDELQADER: Uh, just saying that you know this guy and you know his family, and he's a good, you know, good person, and, you know, your knowledge of them is, you know, they're good people, and, you know, something like that. Something just to show that you,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   LEE: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   ABDELQADER: His behaviors and stuff like that, you know?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   LEE: Okay, now who does this need to go to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   ABDELQADER: Huh?

But, just something about him and you know, you know the Albanna family and they are, you know good people, something like that. Alright, let me send you a text for where it's going to, but just bring me a copy to the store and if you want me, I'll send it or, if you guys are gonna send it, either way, but I would like to have a copy of it and give it to the parents, alright? Hello?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   LEE: I, I'm typing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   ABDELQADER: Okay. I have to write this down on a piece of paper and send it. I'm gonna send you a text in a few. Where's this going to.

Later that afternoon, Defendant and Abdelqader spoke on the phone again. Defendant asked Abdelqader to come by her house and pick up the letter. Defendant told Abdelqader that she was hungry and out of cigarettes, and Abdelqader offered to bring her cigarettes and food. Abdelqader later told Albanna, \"whatever I say she will do,\" referring to Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 1109.) On July 30, 2014, Abdelqader asked Defendant to mail the letter. In the same conversation, Abdelqader told Defendant he had $500 to give her, including $200 from Albanna. On July 31, 2014, Abdelqader told Albanna, \"I swear she is getting from me 200 to 300 a week. Cigarettes, chips, candy, and this and that; don't charge her.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 1141-42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In the letter, which Defendant wrote on Summit County Council letterhead, Defendant stated that she had \"known George and his family for 10 years.\" (Defendant Br. at 27.) She claimed that she had \"had numerous opportunities to work with and engage the family in the community on various issues related to the conduction of business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant also claimed that George's \"family is often my eyes and ears to ensure that our residents and consumers are protected and treated fairly and I value their contribution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In concluding, Defendant stated \"I am not privy to the facts in this case but I want to state with surety that whatever has prompted this is a sort of aberration and not business as usual for this family. George is young and possibly na\u00efve but I am certain that his father and family will be diligent in future oversight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She closed the letter by stating, \"I ask that you consider this letter and my confidence in the credibility of the family as you resolve the case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    C. FBI Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendant began to suspect that Albanna was recording her on August 28, 2014. On August 29, 2014, FBI officers searching Defendant's trash discovered that she had thrown away the letter she wrote to the IRS on behalf of Albanna's son\n   George. FBI agents then interviewed Defendant at her home on September 9, 2014. At trial, one of the FBI agents testified that Defendant answered several of his questions untruthfully during that interview. Defendant told the FBI agent,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that she \"disclosed on her campaign finance report all contributions that were made to her;\" that Abdelqader distributed invitations to Defendant's fundraisers when he collected donations for her; that she did not call Judge Larson; and that she had never spoken with the prosecution regarding Abdelqader's nephews' case. (R. 132, Transcript, PageID # 1430-32.) The government presented evidence at the trial indicating that these statements were all untrue. Defendant also told the FBI agent that \"anything that she received from Omar Abdelqader she would pay back after she got her paycheck and she'd pay him back on Fridays. And she also said if [the FBI] were to look at her Huntington Bank accounts [the FBI] would be able to confirm that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 1434.) But when the FBI reviewed her bank records, they only showed two transactions where Defendant transferred a total of $46 from her bank accounts to Abdelqader's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   After the agents left, Defendant and Abdelqader spoke on the phone. Defendant and Abdelqader had the following conversation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   LEE: The FBI just left my house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   ABDELQADER: Uh huh.

First, Defendant claims the government failed to allege facts sufficient to sustain Defendant's conviction on Counts One through Four. Second, Defendant claims that the government failed to allege facts sufficient to sustain Defendant's conviction on Counts Five and Six. Finally, Defendant argues that if this Court vacates Defendant's conviction for Counts One through Four but upholds her conviction for Counts Five and Six, this Court should vacate Defendant's sentences on Counts Five and Six and remand for re-sentencing. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Sufficiency of the Evidence on Counts One through Four\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Defendant argues that the district court erred by refusing to grant her motion for judgment of acquittal after the close of evidence. Defendant claims that the district court should have granted acquittal because \"the government [ ] failed to present evidence that Lee had actually exerted pressure on, had the power or leverage to exert pressure on, or was in an advisory role with, the other officials.\" (Defendant Br. at 51.) Defendant argues that the jury could have reached a guilty verdict for improper reasons, because the district court did not instruct the jury that, in order to convict, it was required to find that Defendant held an advisory role or held power or leverage over the officials with whom she communicated. But the jury instructions that the district court gave were consistent with both\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   's narrow definition of \"official act\" and Defendant's proposed instructions, and Defendant raised no objection to those instructions when they were presented to\n   the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   More importantly, as discussed above, we do not adopt Defendant's additional constraints on the requirements for an official to \"provide advice\" or \"exert pressure\" on another official.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Moreover, Defendant bases her argument on an incorrect standard of law. The government did not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant actually took official action or provided advice to or exerted pressure on another official to take an official action. Instead, the evidence was sufficient if it could have led a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant agreed to perform one of those actions in exchange for bribes from Abdelqader.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2370-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Court in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   Under this Court's precedents, a public official is not required to actually make a decision or take an action on a 'question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy'; it is enough that the official agree to do so. The agreement need not be explicit, and the public official need not specify the means that he will use to perform his end of the bargain. Nor must the public official in fact intend to perform the 'official act,' so long as he agrees to do so. A jury could, for example, conclude that an agreement was reached if the evidence shows that the public official received a thing of value knowing that it was given with the expectation that the official would perform an 'official act' in return. It is up to the jury, under the facts of the case, to determine whether the public official agreed to perform an 'official act' at the time of the alleged quid pro quo.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    at 2370-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The district court did not err in denying the motion for acquittal, because the evidence was sufficient for a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant agreed to perform official acts or pressure or advise other officials to perform official acts in exchange for gifts.

Because the jury in the case at hand was properly instructed under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   , the district court did not have to grant Defendant's motion for acquittal simply due to similarities between the facts of this case and of the facts in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The evidence presented at Defendant's trial was sufficient for a rational juror to have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant either performed or agreed to perform an official act or to pressure or advise another official to perform an official act, as construed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   .

The government presented evidence that as part of that conversation, Defendant stated \"I'm not trying to influence you, you can't say I'm trying to influence you. I'm trying to make you think. That's all I'm trying to do; just trying to make you think.\" (R. 132, Transcript, PageID # 1378.) A juror could easily have heard those words and concluded that they meant the exact opposite-that Defendant was, in fact, trying to influence the prosecutor. Moreover, the prosecutor testified that she believed if she did not return Defendant's calls, that Defendant \"might go over [the prosecutor's] head and contact [her] supervisor,\" the law director for the city of Akron, and that Defendant had never contacted her in such a way regarding other cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1388.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The government also presented evidence that Abdelqader told his brother he had given Defendant $200 and had promised to give her an additional $300 if she \"finish[ed] up this matter.\" (R. 126, Transcript, PageID # 924-26.) The jury certainly could have discounted this evidence or interpreted it in a different way, but a rational juror could have interpreted this evidence and other evidence the government presented as establishing a quid pro quo arrangement, as clarified by\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   , beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury could rationally have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt based on this evidence that Lee agreed to or \"intend[ed] to exert pressure on [the prosecutor] or provide advice, knowing or intending such advice to form the basis for an 'official act,' \" namely, opening charges against the unidentified man in the altercation with Abdelqader's nephews.\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Under Counts Five and Six, Defendant was found guilty of obstruction of justice and false statements to law enforcement.

In support of Defendant's argument that the evidence was not sufficient for a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that she was guilty on Counts Five and Six, Defendant cites the fact that \"[t]he testifying FBI agent acknowledged several times in her testimony that Lee appeared to be 'all over the place,' and that sometimes her answers conflicted and they could be construed as truthful.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58.) However, just because the jury\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   interpreted the evidence to indicate that the government had not proven Defendant guilty of Counts Five and Six beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean that the jury\n   <em>\n    had to\n   </em>\n   evaluate the evidence that way.

The government presented evidence that after Defendant became suspicious that she was being recorded, Defendant threw away a letter she had written to the IRS on behalf of Albanna's son. The government also presented evidence that Defendant falsely told an FBI agent that \"she disclosed on her campaign finance report all contributions that were made to her;\" that she falsely told the agent that Abdelqader distributed invitations to Defendant's fundraisers when he collected donations for her; that she falsely told the agent that she did not call Judge Larson; and that she falsely told the agent she had never spoken with the prosecution regarding Abdelqader's nephews' case. (R. 132, Transcript, PageID # 1430-32.) These are only some of the examples of evidence the government presented indicating that Defendant deliberately sought to obstruct justice and made\n   false statements to law enforcement officers. The jury could have determined, based on its own evaluation of the credibility of the evidence, that the evidence on Defendant's behalf was more compelling than the evidence the government presented. However, the government presented ample evidence at trial upon which a rational juror could have based a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant met the intent requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).

Nevertheless, I am troubled by this case and write separately to explain why. To be clear, there is nothing admirable or praiseworthy, to say the least, about defendant Tamela Lee's conduct. Lee very plainly traded on her status as an elected official to receive remuneration in a way that certainly \"looks\" illegal. But the question here is whether what she did was illegal under federal (not state) law and whether she must serve significant time in federal prison for what she did. Although I concur with the lead opinion in this case, I express two specific reservations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   First, the main question in this case is whether Lee received the relevant gifts in exchange for performing an \"official act.\" There is no dispute that Lee herself did nothing official: she took no action that would fall under the official responsibilities or duties of a Summit County Council member. Instead, the government alleged that Lee agreed to influence the official acts of others with regard to a state criminal case and an IRS investigation. But trying to influence someone else's official acts and performing one's own official acts would seem to be entirely different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The government's theory, though arguably inconsistent with what the statutes actually say, is consistent with what the Supreme Court said in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell v.

Birdsall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n    233 U.S. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n    34 S.Ct. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n    58 L.Ed. 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1914). But I question whether\n   <em>\n    Birdsall\n   </em>\n   should be read so broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <em>\n    Birdsall\n   </em>\n   concerns a scheme involving two subordinate officers, appointed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who accepted bribes in exchange for attempting to influence the Commissioner.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n    at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n    34 S.Ct. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But\n   <em>\n    Birdsall\n   </em>\n   differs from this case in this important respect: in\n   <em>\n    Birdsall\n   </em>\n   , the subordinate officers were responsible for advising the Commissioner-the same person whom they sought to influence. Indeed, the Court explained that \"by the regulations and established requirements of the Department of Interior [the officials] were charged with the duty of informing and advising the Commissioner of Indian Affairs\" regarding the matters involved in the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n    at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n    34 S.Ct. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Court stated that the public officials had been charged with receiving money \"with the intent that their\n   <em>\n    official action\n   </em>\n   should be thus influenced.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n    at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n    34 S.Ct. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Subordinates who must advise their superiors as part of their official duties are, in fact, performing \"official acts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Birdsall\n   </em>\n   does not support the much broader proposition that any public official who tries to influence another public official takes an \"official act\" herself, regardless of the relationship between the two officials. To say that Lee is positioned with respect to the IRS, for example, in the same way that the officials in\n   <em>\n    Birdsall\n   </em>\n   were positioned with respect to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, is a stretch. Yet it appears to be a stretch that\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   That leads to my second concern. Assuming that one reads the federal bribery statute broadly to encompass attempts to influence that are outside the scope of a defendant's official responsibilities, it would make sense to look for a limiting principle. Here, Lee suggests that a culpable public official must at least have some leverage over the public official that she is attempting to influence. Of course, there is nothing in the federal bribery statute that would require such leverage, but the statute does not seem to strictly prohibit one public official's attempts to pressure another public official into taking an official act, either. In effect, Lee's proposed leverage requirement would cabin the broad implications of the \"influence\" or \"advice\" theories generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Nevertheless, as the lead opinion recognizes, the Supreme Court has not recognized a leverage requirement, leaving the broader implications of\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   in place. To be sure, the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   Court rejected the even broader theories that the government tried to proffer with regard to the meaning of \"official act.\" But in so doing, I believe, the Court left in place equally broad (and questionable) theories in the particular influence scenarios that this case addresses.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    The Court also noted that it was not necessary that the duties of the subordinates be \"prescribed by a written rule or regulation.\"\n    <em>\n     Birdsall\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n     233 U.S. at 231\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673947\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/223/\">\n     34 S.Ct. 512\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Those \"duties\" could be \"fixed\" by \"established usage which constituted the common law of the Department\" or by \"settled practice.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . But that would make their actions no less official.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
