Eason objected. He pointed out that an ACCA \"serious drug offense\" is defined, in relevant part, as \"an offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(A)(ii). Eason argued that, under the Tennessee statute, his prior offenses could have been based on no more than the purchase of an ingredient that can be used to produce methamphetamine with reckless disregard of its intended use. This, he argued, was too attenuated from the manufacture of methamphetamine to\n   <em>\n    involve\n   </em>\n   it for ACCA purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The government countered, and continues to argue, that the Tennessee statute \"involves\" the manufacture of methamphetamine because it targets those who gather the necessary ingredients. And under the ACCA's definition of serious drug offense, there is no explicit\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement for the underlying state crimes-rather, the ACCA requires only that the predicate offenses involve certain activities related to controlled substances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court agreed with Eason. It explained that, while \"involving\" is an expansive term under the ACCA, purchasing an ingredient with reckless disregard of its intended use does not relate or connect closely enough with manufacturing so as to involve it. Without the ACCA enhancement, Eason was sentenced to 46 months' imprisonment, the top of the guideline range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We review a district court's interpretation and application of the ACCA de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523652\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/1242/\">\n    293 F.Supp.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Or. 2017), determined that an Oregon statute making it \"unlawful for any person to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance,\" was not a serious drug offense. But the court held so because the willingness of Oregon state courts to include solicitation as part of the statute's prohibition on delivery, even in the absence of possession, intent to possess, payment, or specific terms regarding the controlled substance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523652\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/1242/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523652\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/1242/\">\n    at 1248-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither solicitation, nor the meaning of delivery, is involved in the Tennessee statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    b. Our case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Here, the conduct prohibited by Tennessee Code \u00a7 39-17-433(a)(1) relates to and is connected with the manufacture of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine can be made largely from products purchased over the counter.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roberge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643088\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/1005/#p1007\">\n    565 F.3d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1007-08 (6th Cir. 2009). Thus, the purchase of those ingredients is often an essential first step to the drug's manufacture. And to ensure that the statute criminalizes only those purchases that relate to manufacture-for our purposes, that they are not too tangential from manufacture-the Tennessee legislature requires more: a person must purchase\n   the ingredient with knowledge that it will be used to produce methamphetamine, or with a \"reckless disregard of [the ingredient's] intended use.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-433\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-17-433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   That Eason could have done the latter does not attenuate the conduct from manufacturing. While true that, as culpability diminishes, so too does the connection to manufacturing, Tennessee's recklessness standard does not create a gap too far. To be convicted under \u00a7 39-17-433(a)(1), a purchaser of ingredients would have to be \"aware of but consciously disregard[ ] a substantial and unjustifiable risk\" of the ingredient's intended use. Tenn. Code. \u00a7 39-11-302(c). Purchasing ingredients needed to make methamphetamine, and\n   <em>\n    consciously disregarding an unjustifiable risk\n   </em>\n   regarding how those products will be used, \"indirectly,\" if not \"directly,\" connects with methamphetamine's \"production, preparation, propagation, compounding or processing.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (15) (defining manufacturing). Indeed, recklessly purchasing prerequisite ingredients, many of which are otherwise restricted, takes them out of the store and into the public, increasing the potential supply from which the drug can be made.\n   <strong>\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n   Thus, Eason's convictions involve the manufacture of methamphetamine under the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   And this reading is consistent with Tennessee's enforcement of the statute. That the Tennessee legislature meant to target a first step in methamphetamine manufacture is clear, since the statute was enacted as part of the Meth-Free Tennessee Act of 2005, the preamble of which explicitly recognized \"that the clandestine manufacture of the illegal drug methamphetamine is a clear and present danger to the health and well being of the State of Tennessee.\" Meth-Free Tennessee Act of 2005, 2005 Tenn. Pub. Acts, c.18. Eason references no state court cases in his briefing, much less identifies convictions under \u00a7 39-17-433(a)(1) that would not involve the manufacture of methamphetamine for purposes of the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, the rule of lenity does not prohibit application of the ACCA in this case. It is true that, \"where there is ambiguity in a criminal statute, doubts are resolved in favor of the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/#p348\">\n    404 U.S. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/#p348\">\n    92 S.Ct. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/#p348\">\n    30 L.Ed.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). But the rule of lenity is inapplicable unless ambiguity is left after the court has \"seize[d] every thing from which aid can be derived.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapman v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226195\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/453/#p463\">\n    500 U.S. 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 463,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226195\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/453/#p463\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226195\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/453/#p463\">\n    114 L.Ed.2d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) (citations omitted). Here, the categorical approach provides the process, and the ACCA's definitions provide the substance by which the court can readily determine if Eason's convictions are predicate offenses-there is no \"grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the language and structure of the Act\" required to invoke the rule of lenity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226195\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/453/#p463\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Since Eason's convictions are serious drug offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   his sentence\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for resentencing consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    A court is \"generally limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\"\n    <em>\n     Shepard v.
