In the sentencing analysis, Barthman was assigned a total of six criminal-history points due to prior convictions in Minnesota state court for first- and second-degree criminal sexual conduct, which were treated as a single sentence for crimes of violence under United States Sentencing Commission,\n   <em>\n    Guidelines Manual\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 4A1.1, comment. (n.5), and which yielded a criminal-history category of III.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Barthman was given a total offense\n   level of 32. The district court found his Guidelines range was 151-188 months. Barthman was sentenced to 151 months imprisonment, to run concurrently with a state-court sentence. The district court also imposed a lifetime of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, Barthman challenges his sentence, arguing that the district court committed procedural error because he should have received only three, not six, criminal-history points, which would have yielded a criminal-history category of II, not III, and would have placed him within a lower Guidelines range of 135-168 months. In other words, Barthman contends he was placed in the wrong criminal-history category when he was given three additional criminal-history points for the prior convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gall v.

The government concedes that the district court committed procedural error when it increased Barthman's criminal-history category by assigning three additional points and that such error was prejudicial to Barthman because he was given a higher Guidelines range. However, it argues that, under plain-error review, the error was not \"plain\" and that even if it was plain this Court should not exercise its discretion to remedy the error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellee's Br. 10-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6237509\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/725/#p733\">\n    507 U.S. at 734, 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6237509\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/725/#p733\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the second and fourth prongs of plain-error review).

Barthman bears the burden of establishing all four prongs of plain-error review.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, the government argues that, under the second prong, the error was not \"plain\" and that, even if the error was plain, this Court should not exercise its discretion to remedy the error pursuant to the fourth prong. We address each of the government's arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The government argues the district court's error was not plain because Barthman \"did not identify any flaw with the state statute or its breadth compared to the relevant federal statute. As a result, the district court was not on notice of any need to consult the state statute.\" Appellee's Br. 23. In other words, the government argues the error in this case cannot be plain because Barthman never brought the error to the district court's attention. We disagree. The government's argument overlooks that plain-error review assumes there was no objection made to the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henderson v.

At this time, without finality to the Minnesota proceedings involving Barthman's concurrent state sentence, it is reasonably likely that the error in calculating Barthman's federal sentence could result in him \"spend[ing] more time in prison ....\"\n   <em>\n    Rosales-Mireles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612311\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1897/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1909-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Barthman has established the fourth prong of plain-error review, and we exercise our discretion to remedy the district court's error in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Puckett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653331\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/129/#p135\">\n    556 U.S. at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653331\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/129/#p135\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   STRAS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I agree that we should vacate Barthman's sentence, and more specifically, that he has established that it is \"reasonably likely\" that a calculation error in his federal sentence will lead to a longer overall stay in prison.\n   <em>\n    Rosales-Mireles v.

But not for the reason the court suggests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   What is significant here is that the Minnesota Supreme Court has granted discretionary review in Barthman's direct appeal, which occurs in only a small percentage of cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Barthman\n   </em>\n   , No. A17-1191 (Minn. Nov. 27, 2018) (order granting review). If Barthman's case presents a close call, as many cases granted discretionary review before a court of last resort do, then it is reasonably likely that Barthman's concurrent state sentence may well be vacated or shortened, meaning that his federal sentence could end up determining how long he spends in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rather than focus on the specific facts of this case, however, the court broadly pronounces that the litmus test is \"finality\" under a theory that no one has briefed or argued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Puckett v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653331\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/129/#p135\">\n    556 U.S. 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 142,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653331\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/129/#p135\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653331\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/129/#p135\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (explaining that the \"fourth prong [of plain-error review] is meant to be applied on a\n   <em>\n    case-specific and fact-intensive\n   </em>\n   basis\" (emphasis added)). It is a strange place to draw the line. Under Minnesota law, a \"court may\n   <em>\n    at any time\n   </em>\n   correct a sentence not authorized by law,\" Minn. R. Crim. P. 27.03, subdiv. 9 (emphasis added), if it was \"unauthorized ... at the time it was imposed,\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Schnagl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6888606\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/859/297/#p301\">\n    859 N.W.2d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301 (Minn. 2015). The Minnesota Supreme Court has allowed district courts to use this rule to correct a broad range of errors, even after direct appeal, so finality in this context means little under Minnesota law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12145714\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/888/125/#p129\">\n    888 N.W.2d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 129-30 (Minn. 2016) (permitting a court to correct a sentence imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment);\n   <em>\n    State v.

Far more revealing is that the Minnesota Supreme Court has determined that Barthman's case, in particular, merits a closer look.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    We grant Barthman's motion to take judicial notice of his Minnesota state-court records.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Recent data shows a grant rate hovering between 10 and 12 percent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Court Information Office,\n    <em>\n     Minnesota Supreme Court\n    </em>\n    2 (2018), available at http://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/CIOMediaLibrary/DocumentLibrary/SupremeCourt.pdf.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
