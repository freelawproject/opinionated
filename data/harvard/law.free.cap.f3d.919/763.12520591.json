The participant contended that the trustee chosen for the ESOP by the corporation breached its fiduciary duties to the ESOP and overpaid for the stock - improperly enriching the corporation's owners at the expense of its employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following a multi-day bench trial, the district court issued detailed findings of fact concluding that the trustee had indeed breached its fiduciary duties, causing the ESOP to overpay for the corporation's stock by $ 29,773,250. The court entered judgment for the ESOP in that amount and awarded attorneys' fees to the participant's counsel. These appeals and cross-appeals followed.

The employer makes contributions to the plan that are used to purchase stock in the employer's company. Because - and only because - an ESOP contribution qualifies as employee compensation, an employer can deduct the total value of its ESOP contribution from its income tax liability as an ordinary business expense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.404\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)-1(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this way, an ESOP benefits both employees and employers by providing deferred compensation to the former and a valuable tax deduction to the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ERISA imposes duties and obligations on all pension plan fiduciaries, including those of ESOPs.

That valuation, termed the \"McLean Report\" by the parties, had been completed just months earlier by the McLean Group, an investment bank that had regularly provided annual share valuations for Constellis.\n   <em>\n    Brundle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d at 619, 634-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Wilmington's trial witnesses contended that consideration of the McLean Report \"would not have been helpful because it was prepared with a different purpose in mind - the valuation of a single share\" for stock options, rather than the valuation of a controlling interest for sale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 634-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the district court, relying on the uncontradicted testimony of a \"highly credible\" neutral expert, found that the two reports used \"essentially the same methodology\" despite being prepared for different purposes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Using that same methodology, the 2013 McLean Report estimated the per share value of Constellis stock as $ 1,838.11, while SRR estimated its median per share value as $ 4,235.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Yet the SRR Report, which guided Wilmington as it evaluated the ESOP transaction, did not even mention the McLean Report.

The district court concluded that a prudent fiduciary in Wilmington's position would have inquired as to SRR's omission. This was particularly so given that Constellis officers testified that the company's business prospects had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   dramatically changed in the period between the two reports, and the SRR Report\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   referenced a different \"valuation\" older than McLean's.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Relying on trial evidence, the district court concluded that even a cursory review of the McLean Report would have raised questions as to whether the share valuation in the SRR Report was too optimistic.

The court found that the answers to these questions were \"precisely the kinds of information that Wilmington, as trustee, should have sought and evaluated\" when considering the valuation of Constellis stock.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Wilmington offers both general and specific challenges to this finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, Wilmington argues that Constellis management's financial projections were, in fact, reliable and so required no probing. In support of this view, Wilmington contends that because the McLean Report also utilized management's financial projections to arrive at its own valuation of Constellis - a valuation the court treated as relevant - the court should have found the projections that the SRR Report used were also reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   But although both McLean and SRR relied on financial projections prepared by Constellis management, they did not rely on the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   financial projections.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The projections that Constellis provided to SRR forecasted revenue over a much longer time period,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 637-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , making them less accurate and less reliable. Further, Constellis management specifically prepared this set of projections for the purposes of SRR's valuation in connection with the ESOP sale. This created a risk that Constellis management might inflate its projections in response to incentives unique to the ESOP sale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of these distinctions, the district court's differing assessments of the two reports' comparative reliability were not inherently contradictory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   At a more granular level, Wilmington maintains that each of the red flags that the district court identified in Constellis's financial projections are \"non-existent.\" Wilmington Opening Br. 33-34, 38-39. Wilmington asserts largely factual, and universally unpersuasive, arguments in support of this view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Wilmington challenges the district court's conclusion that Wilmington should have been more critical of Constellis management's financial projections because management had a financial incentive to inflate the purchase price. The court found that this initial red flag should have alerted Wilmington to probe the SRR valuation of Constellis. The district court's finding on this issue primarily rested on the prospect of management receiving 5% of the purchase price in cash bonuses - a factual determination well supported by the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brundle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The district court also identified as a red flag an ongoing government investigation into accounting and record-keeping errors by Constellis, which the court concluded \"should have raised questions about the reliability of Constellis'[s] ... projections.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, contrary to Wilmington's suggestion, we see no basis for holding this finding clearly erroneous.

At first, the court incorrectly found that only Constellis had indemnified the ESOP, thus creating an illusory form of indemnification. But in denying Wilmington's Rule 59 motion, the court candidly addressed that error and acknowledged that, in fact, both Constellis\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the Sellers had indemnified the ESOP.\n   <em>\n    Brundle II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273596\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/647/\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, the ESOP governing plan document and the ESOP trust agreement each\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   Wilmington to vote its shares as the Constellis board (not the ESOP) directed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 626-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Wilmington maintains that the ESOP could independently exercise its voting powers because the plan documents included a clause nullifying any provision that violated ERISA. But Constellis's general counsel testified at trial that the ESOP could only contravene the plan documents and exercise its independent voting authority by filing a lawsuit - the same limited relief available to a\n   <em>\n    minority\n   </em>\n   shareholder. The district court thus concluded that Wilmington breached its fiduciary obligation in failing to question SRR's failure to discount for lack of control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Wilmington argues that SRR reasonably applied a \"modest\" 10% control premium given that market control premiums are often between 35-40%. But in light of the limited rights provided to the ESOP, we cannot conclude that the district court erred in finding that Wilmington should have done more to challenge the use of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   control premium. The SRR Report \"devoted just one sentence to articulating\n   its decision,\" yet Wilmington never asked SRR about its decision to apply a control premium.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This repeatedly increased the price the ESOP had to pay for the stock. The district court concluded that because an ESOP fiduciary should be concerned with achieving the lowest possible price for the ESOP, Wilmington ought to have asked why SRR consistently engaged in the upward rounding to the ESOP's detriment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 639-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Wilmington devotes only a short footnote in its opening brief to this issue and fails to address it at all in its reply brief. It thus appears to have forfeited an appellate challenge to the court's findings on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wahi v. Charleston Area Med.

So too here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Apart from Wilmington's four major failures to scrutinize SRR's report, the district court also found that Wilmington's conduct throughout the transaction provided further evidence that Wilmington failed to act as a prudent fiduciary solely on behalf of the ESOP participants. Although the court found that Wilmington's actions on behalf of the ESOP did not amount to bad faith, it recognized that \"ERISA demand[ed] more to excuse a fiduciary from liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Brundle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The district court found that Constellis's principal motivation for creating the ESOP was to further the Sellers' interests, not the interests of the ESOP participant buyers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The sale of Constellis to the ESOP enabled the Sellers to cash out their company stock, which they had tried and failed to accomplish several times,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   to reap substantial tax savings. Moreover, the ESOP's unique structure enabled the Sellers to avoid the downside risk of holding equity, yet profit from any upside, while also retaining control over the company. The court found that Wilmington, in its role as the ESOP's fiduciary, simply ignored these motivations rather than investigating whether they affected the ESOP's legality under ERISA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 640-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The district court additionally found that making the Sellers' interests paramount shortened the transaction timeline and rushed Wilmington's due diligence process and price and terms negotiations. To maximize the after-tax benefits to the Sellers, the ESOP sale had to conclude before the end of 2013. Accordingly, Wilmington and its agents completed their due diligence, made pricing decisions, conducted negotiations, and launched a tender offer in less than two months.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 621-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

SARs are incentives that Constellis would have owed to management had the company's value reached a certain price by a particular date. Wilmington argues the value of the SARs should not have been deducted from Constellis's estimated value because they were inchoate at the time of the sale.

The final transaction paid $ 20 million in cash to the ESOP - double the initial $ 10 million offer - as a result of the Sellers' agreeing to write off $ 33 million of the ESOP's debt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Wilmington argues that the ACADEMI sale proves that the ESOP did not overpay for Constellis seven months earlier. Relying on the first prong of DOL's proposed adequate-consideration regulations, Wilmington maintains that the ESOP paid \"fair market value\" for the Constellis stock because ACADEMI's purchase of Constellis stock implied an enterprise value of $ 288.3 million, which was within SRR's estimated range of $ 275 to $ 330 million. Wilmington contends this purchase price is of particular significance because in the\n   intervening time Constellis assertedly suffered several business setbacks that decreased its enterprise value.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   This argument is unpersuasive for several reasons. The proposed DOL regulations upon which Wilmington relies provide that a trustee can prove consideration is \"adequate\" if it reflects the stock's \"fair market value\"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   is \"the product of a determination made by the fiduciary in good faith.\" Proposed Regulation Relating to the Definition of Adequate Consideration, 53 Fed. Reg. at 17,633. Of course, because the DOL never enacted the proposed regulations, they are not binding. And, as we have explained, courts look to the\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   of the trustee and whether it met its fiduciary obligations, not to whether the trustee arrived at a \"fair\" value. But even if we were to adopt the DOL's proposed regulations, a trustee must satisfy\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   parts of the test to benefit from the adequate consideration exception.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the purchase was for \"fair market value,\" we find no error in the district court's findings that Wilmington failed to prove that the share price was\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   \"the product of a determination made by the fiduciary in good faith.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Furthermore, even if proving the ESOP paid \"fair market value\" sufficed to meet the requirements of \u00a7 1108(e), the facts of the ACADEMI sale do not prove that the ESOP paid only \"fair market value\" here. In fact, the district court found that the opposite was true. The court found that because ACADEMI, a private security company like Constellis, would benefit from synergies resulting from its purchase of Constellis, it would have been willing to pay significantly\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   for Constellis than the ESOP. Thus, that ACADEMI actually paid\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   for Constellis stock suggested a significantly\n   <em>\n    lower\n   </em>\n   fair market value for the stock at the time of the ESOP purchase. Of course, Wilmington's experts disagreed with this synergies analysis, but the district court found the testimony of other experts on this point more persuasive.\n   <em>\n    Brundle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Discounting the additional synergy value, the $ 33 million debt write-off by the Sellers, and an expected tax refund from the sale, the court found the ACADEMI purchase suggested that Constellis's fair market value was closer to $ 200 million - almost $ 100 million\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   than the enterprise value implied by the ESOP transaction. Thus, the court found, the ACADEMI sale could not support Wilmington's argument that the ESOP paid no more than adequate consideration for Constellis.\n   <em>\n    Brundle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267723\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/610/\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   We see no clear error in this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Additionally, we note that, despite paying\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   for Constellis stock, the ESOP did not obtain\n   <em>\n    nearly\n   </em>\n   the level of control that ACADEMI acquired. While the ESOP obtained only some\n   <em>\n    elements\n   </em>\n   of control, ACADEMI acquired absolute and uncontested control. Had the district court applied the \"standard\" 35-40% control premium\n   Wilmington's experts suggested was reasonable, Constellis's fair market value would fall somewhere between $ 145 million and $ 150 million, almost half the value of the stock purchased by the ESOP only months earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Having rejected all of Wilmington's challenges to the district court's findings as to its liability, we turn to the court's damages award.

According to Wilmington, \"the district court's failure to\" do so \"resulted in a clear windfall for the ESOP.\" Wilmington Opening Br. at 53. As the district court ably explained,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brundle II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273596\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/647/\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at 660-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this claim is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   ERISA expressly requires a fiduciary to \"make good to [an ESOP] any losses\" resulting from a given breach of duty.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201109\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 205 cmt. e (\"If the trustee is authorized to purchase property for the trust, but in breach of trust he pays more than he should pay, he is chargeable with the amount he paid in excess of its value.\"). Thus, in cases involving overpayment for ESOP assets, courts generally compute restitution damages exactly as the district court did here: by deducting the fair market value of the stock from the amount the ESOP actually paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Wilmington insists that the ESOP's subsequent and unrelated sale of the stock to ACADEMI requires a different result. This misapprehends the nature of the breach. If Wilmington had breached its duty by\n   <em>\n    purchasing\n   </em>\n   Constellis stock at all, then a damages award consisting of the purchase payments offset by any subsequent profits would indeed return the participants to the pre-purchase status quo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   But Wilmington breached here by\n   <em>\n    overpaying\n   </em>\n   for the Constellis stock. Principles of restitution therefore entitle the ESOP and its participants to compensation for the loss from\n   <em>\n    the overpayment\n   </em>\n   . Any subsequent gains involving the stock, which the ESOP would have obtained regardless of the overpayment, have no bearing on that loss. For this very reason, courts have uniformly rejected analogous offsets to damage awards in overpayment cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bruister\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5919569\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/250/#p263\">\n    823 F.3d at 270-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting offset to account for unpaid or forgiven ESOP debt and noting that \"[e]very court to consider this question\" agreed);\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

It claims the ESOP \"made $ 20 million for the nominal cost of carrying $ 200 million in non-recourse debt for a few months,\" because \"[j]ust seven months\" after the prohibited transaction, \"the ESOP exchanged its debt-burdened shares to ACADEMI for $ 20 million in cash.\" Wilmington Opening Br. at 55-56. We disagree. As a preliminary matter, the burden imposed in additional debt from a $ 30 million overpayment is far from \"nominal,\" even for \"just\" seven months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henry V\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660586\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/96/#p98\">\n    569 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   99 n.4 (explaining \"the obvious fact that the assumption of indebtedness has immediate legal and\n   economic consequences even before the borrower begins to repay the debt\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Moreover, if Wilmington seeks to portray the ACADEMI sale as an \"exchange\" in which the ESOP's pre-sale debt had no effect on its post-sale assets, this is both illogical and untrue. Had the ESOP not initially overpaid for the stock by $ 30 million, it would have shouldered tens of millions of dollars less in debt; in turn, it would presumably have been tens of millions of dollars better off after being compensated for the stock in the ACADEMI sale. Put differently, although the ESOP benefited despite the breach, it would have benefited at least as much - but\n   <em>\n    ended\n   </em>\n   in a far better position - without the breach. In fact, had the ESOP initially paid a fair (lower) value for the Constellis stock and therefore carried less debt, it would have entered the ACADEMI negotiations in a stronger bargaining position and may have profited further still.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Wilmington rejects this conclusion, stressing that the Sellers also agreed to write off more than $ 30 million of the ESOP's debt, which it describes as an \"effective[ ] reduc[tion]\" of the 2013 purchase price. Wilmington Opening Br. at 56. But once again, this independent act has no bearing on the ESOP's loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Wilmington unpersuasively contends that\n   <em>\n    Henry III\n   </em>\n   supports its argument. That case addressed very different facts. There, the Second Circuit held that - where sellers fully and voluntarily repaid an ESOP after the IRS found overpayment, but before a court entered a damages judgment - a duplicative recovery for the same overpayment might \"result in a windfall.\"\n   <em>\n    Henry III\n   </em>\n   , 445 F.3d at 624. Wilmington does not even argue that the Sellers' write-off here was meant to remedy the ESOP's overpayment. Nor could it: unlike the midstream repayment in\n   <em>\n    Henry\n   </em>\n   , the write-off here occurred more than a year\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the initiation of any legal proceedings alleging Wilmington breached its fiduciary duties. As Wilmington concedes, the write-off was part of a negotiated agreement to close the ACADEMI sale, a deal wholly unrelated to the issues raised here. Again, it is reasonable to assume that the ESOP would have negotiated equally favorable (if not more favorable) terms had it paid a fair value in the first instance and thus entered the ACADEMI discussions with substantially less debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In sum, we find no error in the district court's damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Finally, we examine the district court's award of attorneys' fees. The court awarded Brundle's counsel $ 1,819,631.11 in statutory fees and an additional $ 1.5 million in fees from the ESOP's damages judgment. No party has presented a substantive challenge regarding the award of attorneys' fees under the fee shifting statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brundle challenges the $ 1.5 million in additional fees (payable from the damages awarded to the ESOP) as too small; Wilmington and Constellis, as fiduciaries for the ESOP, challenge the award as legally improper.

The district court initially suggested that this arrangement was indeed controlling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brundle II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273596\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/647/\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at 671-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the court held its fee decision in abeyance to consider the views of plan participants and ultimately based its award on equity rather than contract. We can hardly find an abuse of discretion given that Brundle has no right to have the ESOP fund his own fee agreement with B&amp;G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Brundle contends that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) - which empowers ESOP participants and beneficiaries to bring suit on behalf of an ESOP - additionally authorizes him to enter into a legal services contract that binds the ESOP. Brundle musters no caselaw to support his interpretation of the statute, and for good reason. While \u00a7 1132(a)(2) provides Brundle the right to sue on behalf of the ESOP, neither it nor any other statute authorizes him to unilaterally bind the ESOP to a contract or fee agreement. For this very reason, the vast majority of suits on behalf of ERISA plans take the form of class actions, in which counsel can seek fees only after a class has been certified and class members have been given the opportunity to object or opt out.

We particularly note that a \"reasonable\" fee under ERISA's attorneys' fee provision (unlike a common fund award) precludes any compensation for contingency risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dague\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481026\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/557/#p565\">\n    505 U.S. at 565-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481026\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/557/#p565\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, we have previously underscored, contingent fees serve an important function in providing under-resourced litigants access to counsel and the courts.\n   <em>\n    In re Abrams &amp; Abrams, P.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230012\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/605/238/#p245\">\n    605 F.3d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245-47 (4th Cir. 2010). Conflating statutory attorneys' fees with common fund recoveries would squarely contravene this policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   We therefore agree with the Second, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits that a statutory fee-shifting provision (or an award of fees under such a provision) does not, as a matter of law, automatically preclude an award under the common fund doctrine. Accordingly, the district court retained discretion to award supplemental attorneys' fees from the common fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Having established the district court's authority to award supplemental fees, we turn to Brundle's contention that the court abused its discretion in awarding\n   its counsel too little from the common fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Before setting the amount of its common fund award, the district court fashioned an ad hoc process analogous to class settlement procedures under Rule 23.\n   <em>\n    Brundle II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273596\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/647/\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at 671-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court ordered Brundle's counsel, B&amp;G, to engage in a good faith effort to notify the approximately 1,800 former ESOP participants of its proposed contingency fee award. After B&amp;G did so, the court received 59 letters objecting to a one-third contingency award. As a result of the objections, the court decided to award B&amp;G only $ 1.5 million as a supplemental fee payable from the damages award, rather than granting counsel a full one-third ($ 9.9 million) of the ESOP's total damages recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In reviewing the district court's award, we note that Brundle had available a procedural mechanism designed to carefully balance the interests of counsel, plaintiffs, and other similarly situated beneficiaries from the start - namely, class certification pursuant to Rule 23. To be fair, Brundle and another plaintiff, Halldorson, did initially seek class certification, which the district court denied. But Brundle opted not to timely appeal this denial. And although Halldorson initially sought our review, he later withdrew his appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Had Brundle pursued class certification and prevailed, B&amp;G could have secured attorneys' fees from the class as a whole. Although a properly certified class might not have agreed to the same one-third contingency fee that Brundle did, the district court might well have awarded a fee significantly higher than the firm's ultimate recovery here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Brundle, represented by B&amp;G, instead opted to forego Rule 23's procedural strictures - thus avoiding \"the standards set for the protection of absent class members.\"\n   <em>\n    Amchem Prods., Inc. v.

In light of this choice, the district court's decision to limit the common fund award was not inequitable, as illustrated by the objections from some of the ESOP's participants. Nearly 60 of the 1,800 participants objected to the proposed common fund award, explaining that they had never been informed of the case status, never agreed to B&amp;G's representation, and never authorized the fund to pay a one-third fee. These process concerns would have been avoided upfront had Brundle persisted in his pursuit of class certification. But because he and his counsel abandoned Rule 23's class-protective procedures, equity cuts against awarding B&amp;G the full one-third contingency fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The district court properly weighed B&amp;G's efforts on behalf of the ESOP - including contingency risk - against the objections from ESOP participants to determine a proper common fund award.
