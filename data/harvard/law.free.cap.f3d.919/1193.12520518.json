In such circumstances, termination without prejudice may be appropriate because it forces the agency to begin anew-a remedy that properly recognizes the tainted nature of the initial detention and, one hopes, encourages agency compliance in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a final point, Judge O'Scannlain trots out a parade of horribles that are unsubstantiated and, at best, hypothetical. As the opinion emphasized, termination without prejudice is a remedy \"reserved for truly egregious cases\" of immigration enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518694\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/643/#p653\">\n    904 F.3d at 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Any fears that this remedy will spur crafty lawyers across the country to disrupt removal proceedings are belied by the fact that the Second Circuit recognized this very remedy in 2008 and there have been no such harebrained schemes since.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ***\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The reality of immigration proceedings-with no established right to appointed counsel, no right to discovery, or any other host of rights implicated in other proceedings-is that individuals would be hard-pressed to reach the stage that Sanchez has in proving a prima facie case of an egregious regulatory violation. Because he has met his initial burden of showing a racially motivated detention, we ordered a narrowly tailored remedy: Sanchez's removal proceedings would be terminated, but only if the Government cannot meet its burden of rebutting Sanchez's prima facie showing on remand. Given the procedural posture of this case, and all the reasons outlined above and in our opinion, the court wisely denied rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   O'SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    **\n   </footnotemark>\n   with whom CALLAHAN, BEA, IKUTA, BENNETT, and R. NELSON, Circuit Judges, join, respecting the denial of rehearing en banc:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In this deportation proceeding, which commenced over eight years ago, our court's opinion concedes that admissible\n   evidence establishes Mexican citizen Luis Enrique Sanchez's removability. Current immigration law therefore required the three-judge panel to allow the deportation order to take effect. Unsatisfied with such prospect, the panel holds instead that Sanchez's entire removal proceeding now must be\n   <em>\n    terminated\n   </em>\n   because he was detained without reasonable suspicion-a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Such an absurd result contravenes basic Fourth Amendment principles, defies Supreme Court precedent, and lacks any basis in our case law (or that of any other circuit). Worse, the panel disguises the Fourth Amendment harm as a \"regulatory violation\" to work a simple and obvious end-run around it. At bottom, the panel fails to grasp that Fourth Amendment wrongs warrant Fourth Amendment remedies-nothing less, but nothing more. This case has languished for almost a decade, and now the government is reduced to restarting deportation proceedings, using the same evidence to achieve the same outcome that the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") ordered in 2011. Our court should have reheard this case en banc to correct the panel's errant decision, a very unfortunate precedent with troublesome consequences for our immigration jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The facts are straightforward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Luis Enrique Sanchez is a citizen of Mexico who entered the United States without inspection in 1988. In 2004, Sanchez applied for and received \"Family Unity Benefits\" from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\"), which temporarily authorized him to live and to work in the United States. USCIS later denied Sanchez's request for an extension of these benefits in 2008, and at that point he no longer enjoyed lawful status to remain in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In February 2010, Sanchez and three others were marooned off the coast of California when their fishing boat's engine lost power. The Coast Guard towed their boat into port, demanded identification documents, and detained them for two hours until Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") officers arrived. The CBP officers took Sanchez to a CBP facility, interrogated and strip-searched him, and then released him. The officers prepared a Form I-213 (Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien), which included Sanchez's express admission to them that he had entered the United States without inspection and was undocumented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In November 2010, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued a Notice to Appear and charged Sanchez with being removable. To prove Sanchez's removability, the government relied on both the Form I-213 prepared by the CBP officers and on Sanchez's prior application for Family Unity Benefits. Sanchez sought to have the Form I-213 suppressed and to have his removal proceedings terminated. He argued that his detention by CBP officers was based solely on race in contravention of the Fourth Amendment and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20287.8\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which requires arresting officers to possess a \"reasonable suspicion\" of the person's unlawful presence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The IJ denied the motion and ordered Sanchez removed. In 2014, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") dismissed Sanchez's appeal, leaving the deportation order in place. It concluded that, regardless of whether the Form I-213 should have been suppressed, the government could use \"independent evidence ... to establish his nationality and identity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v.

Just as with the exclusionary rule itself, however, the panel's novel termination remedy does not \"cure\" the initial unlawful arrest.

But if this case involves a Fourth Amendment wrong, it should be controlled by Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    Those\n   </em>\n   principles, however, unambiguously foreclose the panel's extravagant remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Unsurprisingly, no other court has imposed such a remedy.

The opinion offers a windfall (termination of proceedings, no less) to those who can show that immigration officials violated their own regulations during the investigation, detention, and removal proceedings-even if such violations had\n   <em>\n    no effect\n   </em>\n   on the proceedings that followed. Lingering on such technicalities, however, ignores the Supreme Court's instruction that \"[p]ast conduct is relevant\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   insofar as it may shed light on the respondent's right to\n   remain.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   , 468 U.S. at 1038,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/#p1044\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At the same time, the panel's theory could deter the government from formulating \"additional standards to govern prosecutorial and police procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Caceres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188710\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/741/#p749\">\n    440 U.S. at 755-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188710\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/741/#p749\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The conclusion that regulatory violations authorize federal courts to terminate otherwise-meritorious removal proceedings could give the government reason to scrub from the books any regulations that benefit aliens. Perversely, then, the opinion's holding may help Sanchez only to deprive all other aliens of the benefits of the government's \"own comprehensive scheme for deterring Fourth Amendment violations by its officers.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   , 468 U.S. at 1044,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/#p1044\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The panel's novel termination-of-proceedings remedy also invites a wave of litigation to map its metes and bounds. The initial question, of course, is what exactly \"termination without prejudice\" means.\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518694\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/643/#p653\">\n    904 F.3d at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The BIA will undoubtedly dismiss proceedings, but DHS could then serve Sanchez with a new Notice to Appear and start all over again. The opinion offers Sanchez nothing more than a meaningless formality before his inevitable removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Perhaps, however, the panel has something more drastic in mind. Its reasoning, after all, is that the remedy must put Sanchez into his rightful position as if \"no procedural error [had] taken place.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518694\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/643/#p653\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518694\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/643/#p653\">\n    at 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Such reasoning sets up a counter-factual in which Sanchez was never detained, never interrogated, and never issued the Notice to Appear. Must the BIA tear up the Form I-213 about Sanchez? Delete all records of him from the government's databases? Order each implicated government official to forget everything he ever knew about Sanchez? Doubtless, enterprising lawyers will seize on the opinion's extravagant reasoning to seek still-more intrusive remedies in civil deportation proceedings. We should not invite their spurious arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   I also fear that the decision may not be limited to the immigration context. The opinion introduces a glaring discontinuity between civil removal proceedings on the one hand and other administrative proceedings and criminal prosecutions on the other. The opinion's holding allows aliens who suffer regulatory violations to reap a windfall not present in any analogous area of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A criminal defendant convicted on the basis of illegally obtained evidence or a coerced confession has no similar opportunity. He can ask for a new trial with the improperly obtained evidence suppressed, but he cannot demand that the court quash his indictment. Likewise, in administrative contexts, a party can challenge an enforcement action based on procedural failures by the agency. But courts do not enjoin the agency from altogether enforcing the law against the regulated party. I am sure that criminal defendants and civil litigants would much prefer that courts dismissed\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   cases too. When they ask our court to punish regulatory failures the same way in other contexts, how can we deny them the same windfall?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This case should have been simple. The sole question in a deportation proceeding is whether the alien has a \"right to remain in this country in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   , 468 U.S. at 1038,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/#p1044\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the government can establish Sanchez's unlawful status with admissible evidence, so the BIA correctly affirmed the IJ's removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Instead, the panel's refusal to accept this outcome has produced a decision that (1) defies the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   , (2) ignores basic Fourth Amendment principles by ordering a more-intrusive result than the Amendment authorizes, (3) fashions a remedy to enforce agency regulations without a sound legal basis for such an imposition, (4) shows a profound misunderstanding of the difference between substantive and procedural rights and their appropriate remedies, (5) cites as authority a handful of inapposite out-of-circuit precedents, and (6) imposes serious practical costs on the administration of immigration proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Worst of all, the opinion's imposition of an extraordinary remedy wastes everyone's time, for it does nothing but delay the petitioner's inevitable removal. The en banc process exists to ensure the sound development of our circuit's case law, and we should have used it here to correct the panel's extravagant and erroneous decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Judge O'Scannlain's reliance on\n    <em>\n     Lopez-Mendoza\n    </em>\n    is particularly telling as it illustrates a misunderstanding of the case law.
