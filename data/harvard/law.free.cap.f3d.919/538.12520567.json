The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") initiated removal proceedings. De Guevara conceded removability and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, with her children as derivative applicants. After a hearing at which de Guevara testified, the Immigration Judge (IJ) denied relief on multiple grounds -- de Guevara's testimony was not credible, she failed to articulate a particular social group on which to base a claim of asylum, she failed to prove past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, and she failed to show that the government of El Salvador was unable or unwilling to control alleged persecution by criminal gangs. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed in a thorough opinion. De Guevara petitions for review of the BIA's final agency action. We conclude that the BIA's decision was \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole\" and therefore deny the petition for review.\n   <em>\n    I.N.S. v.

De Guevara testified at the hearing that in October 2015, she received a phone call and then a letter from the gang \"Mara 18\" demanding $1500 and threatening to kill de Guevara or her children. She reported to the police but did not show them the letter because \"if you go to the police, they are going to kill you.\" Instead, de Guevara left El Salvador and entered the United States with her children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The IJ found de Guevara's testimony not credible because she gave a materially inconsistent explanation of her\n   fear of returning to El Salvador in a sworn statement to the Border Patrol and in a subsequent \"credible fear\" interview at the asylum office. The BIA ruled that this credibility finding was not clearly erroneous. We \"defer to the IJ's credibility findings if they are supported by a specific, cogent reason for disbelief,\" as they are in this case.\n   <em>\n    Alemu v.

The BIA noted that de Guevara \"did not testify to any ongoing threats or evidence that anyone still seeks to harm her.\" She testified that no member of her family has ever been harmed, and that her family remains unharmed in the village from which she fled. A generalized fear of gang violence is not a basis for asylum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Constanza v.

In a pair of cases decided on February 7, 2014, the BIA clarified its long-standing interpretation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [A]n applicant for asylum or withholding of removal seeking relief based on \"membership in a particular social group\" must establish that the group is (1) composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and (3) socially distinct within the society in question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Matter of M-E-V-G\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20227\">\n    26 I. &amp; N.

Thus, to warrant a discretionary grant of asylum, an applicant must \"demonstrat[e] the existence of a cognizable particular social group, [her] membership in that part particular social group, and a risk of persecution on account of [her] membership in the specified particular social group.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20208\">\n    at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, de Guevara argues the BIA erred in ruling she failed to prove past persecution on account of her membership in two particular social groups, \"Salvadoran female heads of households\" and \"vulnerable Salvadoran females.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The BIA ruled that \"Salvadoran female heads of households\" is not a cognizable particular social group \"because it lacks social distinction and particularity\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The respondent's proposed group is too broad and amorphous to meet the particularity requirement. The respondent did not show that 'head of household' has a commonly accepted definition with Salvadoran society, nor is such condition necessarily immutable. ... The respondent also did not establish that such group is socially distinct. The respondent's testimony that her neighbors knew she was living without a male companion is not sufficient to establish that society views her proposed social group as distinct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, de Guevara argues that El Salvador country reports document that women \"are targeted by gangs for violence and extortion,\" and she \"has personally experienced the dangers of living as a single woman in these conditions.\" But this is not evidence that \"female heads of households\" are recognized in El Salvador society as a particular, socially distinct group. Thus, the BIA did not err in ruling that de Guevara failed to prove persecution on account of membership in a particular social group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For these reasons, the BIA's decision to deny the asylum claims of de Guevara and her children is supported by substantial evidence on the administrative record as a whole. As petitioners relied on the same facts to support their claims for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture, claims they have not separately argued in their petition for review, denial of the claim for asylum forecloses these other claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin Martin v.
