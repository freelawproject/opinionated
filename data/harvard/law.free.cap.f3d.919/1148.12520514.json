California permits certain forms of class III gaming under an effective tribal-state gaming compact. The Tribes each have enacted gaming ordinances that were approved by the Chairperson. Each of the Tribes executed a compact with the State in 1999, and the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs approved each compact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 16, 2000, notice of that approval was published in the Federal Register.

The phrases \"standards for the operation of [gaming] activity\" and \"any other subjects ... directly related to the operation of gaming activities\" are naturally read as catch-all categories. Viewed in context, those terms are broader than the more specific topics enumerated in paragraphs (3)(C)(i)-(v). And once paragraphs (3)(C)(vi)-(vii) are properly framed as catch-all categories, the inquiry is whether a durational limit is either a \"standard[ ] for the operation of [gaming] activity\" or a term \"directly related to the operation of gaming activities.\" We conclude that, at a minimum, a durational limit is \"directly related to the operation of gaming activities.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(C)(vii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To start, IGRA's structure dictates this interpretation. Construing paragraph (3)(C)(vii)'s catch-all provision as permitting durational limits in compacts plainly coheres with IGRA's threshold requirement that a compact be \"in effect\" for class III gaming activity to lawfully occur.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2710(d)(1)(C). Congress's inclusion of that language indicates that it contemplated that a party could properly raise a compact's \"effective\" date during negotiations. And as a matter of common sense, given that a tribe may not conduct gaming activities without an effective compact, a durational limit on the effectiveness of a compact is \"directly related to the operation of gaming activities.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2710(d)(3)(C)(vii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Subsection (d)(1)(C)'s effectiveness requirement also undercuts the Tribes' position that IGRA gives tribes an indefinite right to administer class III gaming. Rather, that regulatory right is qualified by the existence of a valid tribal-state compact.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Numerous other sections in IGRA support this view.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2710(d)(2)(C) (\"[C]lass III gaming activity on the Indian lands of the Indian tribe shall be fully subject to the terms and conditions of the Tribal-State compact entered into under paragraph (3) by the Indian tribe that is in effect.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2710(d)(5) (\"Nothing in this subsection shall impair the right of an Indian tribe to regulate class III gaming on its Indian lands concurrently with the State,\n   <em>\n    except to the extent\n   </em>\n   that such regulation is inconsistent with, or less stringent than, the State laws and regulations made applicable by any Tribal-State compact entered into by the Indian tribe under paragraph (3) that is in effect.\") (emphasis added).

First, the proper inquiry here is whether a compact's end date is so attenuated from gameplay that it falls outside of paragraph (3)(C)(vii), an issue the\n   <em>\n    Bay Mills\n   </em>\n   Court did not address.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 785,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007,7343111\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2024/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The question in this case is whether tribal sovereign immunity bars Michigan's suit against the Bay Mills Indian Community for opening a casino outside Indian lands.\"). Second, if anything,\n   <em>\n    Bay Mills\n   </em>\n   suggested a broad view of negotiable subjects when it noted that states and tribes \"need only bargain\" for a term or condition, which in that case was a waiver of tribal sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 796-97,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007,7343111\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2024/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f a State really wants to sue a tribe for gaming outside Indian lands, the State need only bargain for a waiver of immunity.\"). The Court added that \"[s]tates have more than enough leverage to obtain such terms because a tribe cannot conduct class III gaming on its lands without a compact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007,7343111\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2024/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, we reject the Tribes' argument that\n   <em>\n    Bay Mills\n   </em>\n   compels the conclusion that a durational limit is not \"directly related to the operation of gaming activities\" within the meaning of paragraph (3)(C)(vii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Our prior examinations of Section 2710(d)(3)(C) also support today's holding. In\n   <em>\n    Coyote Valley II\n   </em>\n   , for example, we considered the permissibility under IGRA of three compact provisions: \"(1) the Revenue Sharing Trust Fund provision [RSTF]; (2) the Special Distribution Fund provision [SDF]; and (3) the Labor Relations provision.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351442,9114551\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/1094/\">\n    331 F.3d at 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These provisions required compacting tribes to share gaming revenue with non-gaming tribes and the State, and to address the labor rights\n   of gaming facility employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351442,9114551\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/1094/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351442,9114551\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/1094/\">\n    at 1104-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff tribe challenged these provisions as \"outside the list of appropriate topics for Tribal-State compacts set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(C),\" which the tribe argued raised a presumption that the State negotiated in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    at 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We disagreed and held that IGRA did not \"categorically forbid[ ]\" the negotiated provisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Congress sought through IGRA to \"promot[e] tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2702(1). The RSTF provision advances this Congressional goal by creating a mechanism whereby all of California's tribes-not just those fortunate enough to have land located in populous or accessible areas-can benefit from class III gaming activities in the State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    at 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We found that paragraph (3)(C)(vii) was \"not ambiguous,\" that the RSTF \"clearly\" fell within its scope, and that there was no ambiguity to construe in the tribe's favor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Citing the same reasons, we upheld the SDF's requirement that gaming tribes share revenue with the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We further held that the Labor Relations provision was \"directly related to the operation of gaming activities\" and thus permissible under paragraph (3)(C)(vii): \"Without the 'operation of gaming activities,' the jobs this provision covers would not exist; nor, conversely, could Indian gaming activities operate without someone performing these jobs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    at 1115-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This reading of paragraph (3)(C)(vii) as unambiguous and allowing for negotiation regarding unenumerated topics supports our holding here: a duration provision is at least as closely related to the operation of gaming activities as the topics we found to be permissible subjects for negotiation in\n   <em>\n    Coyote Valley II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In summary, the State is correct that IGRA's plain language permits durational limits on compacts under the catch-all provision of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(C)(vii).
