Prior to July 1, 2015, Sawyer was familiar with three men who frequented his store: Jones; Jones's brother, Dontario Jones (\"Dontario\"); and Antonio Brown. Sawyer knew Jones and Dontario's family and had spoken to Jones and Dontario on numerous occasions in the store. During a two-year period, Sawyer spoke to Brown almost every day because of Brown's prior relationship with a store employee. Sawyer was familiar with all three men's voices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the night of July 1, 2015, just prior to closing, Sawyer went to lock the store's front door. He saw Brown approaching. Sawyer permitted Brown to enter the store because he knew Brown well. Once inside the store, Brown spoke to Sawyer and bought two items, including the last bottle of a certain beverage. Tracey Hon, a cashier, handled Brown's purchase. She also knew Brown because he frequented the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sawyer noticed that Brown had purchased the last bottle on the shelf and began walking to the storeroom to check inventory for restocking. Before reaching the storeroom, Sawyer heard the front door violently open, as if someone had kicked it in. Two men wearing facemasks and displaying handguns ran into the store. The first man ran to the cashier's area and threw Hon to the floor. The second man ran to an area next to a coin-operated carnival machine. Without speaking, both men opened fire on Sawyer. Four bullets struck Sawyer, causing him to fall to the floor. Sawyer shouted that he would tell them the money's location if they would quit shooting. They stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The second man to enter the store approached Sawyer and demanded that Sawyer empty his pockets. Sawyer complied. Sawyer carried a 9 mm Kel-Tec pistol. The man took Sawyer's pistol. Sawyer then told Hon where the moneybags were located. Hon gave two moneybags to the first man, who had demanded the store's money. One of the moneybags was tan, and the other was green with \"BancorpSouth\" printed on it. Hon also opened the cash register drawers, and the first man took the cash. The cash registers and the two moneybags contained approximately $ 5,000. Sawyer kept a shotgun underneath the front counter. The first man grabbed it and headed for the door, but before leaving, he shot at Hon, barely missing her head. Both men left the store. William Bundy, a store employee, witnessed the robbery and called 911. Bundy reported seeing a gray car leave the store's parking lot after the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sawyer told investigating officers that he recognized the two men's voices when they shouted during the robbery. Sawyer\n   believed they had come to the store on other occasions. He identified the first man as Jones and the second man as his brother Dontario.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Kennett Police Officer Phillip Caldwell received a police dispatch alerting him to a robbery and shooting at Curt's Grocery. Officer Caldwell was informed that the car involved in the robbery was a gray or silver Toyota, traveling south. Officer Caldwell identified the car and gave chase to the Arkansas border, where Arkansas law enforcement continued the chase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the car crossed the Arkansas state line, Mississippi County Deputy Sheriff Dale Stracener attempted to block the road with his patrol car, but the car evaded the obstruction and continued toward Blytheville, Arkansas. The car's occupants shot at Officer Stracener and other officers attempting to stop the vehicle. Officer Stracener returned gunfire. As it entered Blytheville, the car left the roadway and crashed in a muddy field. The three occupants fled on foot. Officer Stracener gave chase, finding the vehicle's driver under some bushes. The driver was identified as Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Blytheville resident Steven Ellis (\"Steven\") witnessed the chase. He later saw a man in a neighborhood running down the street apparently talking on a cell phone. Steven did not recognize the man as a neighborhood resident. He watched as a yellow Cadillac Escalade picked up the man and drove away. Steven reported his observations to the police department, including the Cadillac Escalade's license plate number. He told the police that the Cadillac Escalade was traveling south toward Osceola, Arkansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Osceola Police Department Officer Chris Ellis heard police dispatch relay Steven's information, including the car's license plate number. Officer Ellis was familiar with the car and the license plate number. Officer Ellis and another officer intercepted the Cadillac Escalade as it entered Osceola. After stopping the vehicle, the officers identified the female driver as Reshawn Jones and the passenger as Jones, her husband. After Jones got out of the vehicle, Officer Ellis noticed that Jones's pants were covered with dirt and mud. Without prompting, Jones stated, \"I haven't done anything. I'm just coming from Kennett gambling.\" Jury Tr. Proceedings, Vol. I, at 232,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jones\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-cr-00035 (E.D. Mo. Mar. 13, 2017), ECF No. 78. After detaining Jones, Officer Ellis drove to Jones's home in Osceola. Upon his arrival, he found Brown's Chevrolet Tahoe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The officers who searched the Cadillac Escalade recovered a green BancorpSouth moneybag and a tan BancorpSouth moneybag. Sawyer later identified these moneybags as belonging to Curt's Grocery. The green moneybag contained $ 1,783 in cash, and the tan moneybag contained $ 350 in cash.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Arkansas State Police Officer Scott Pillow searched the crashed Toyota Camry at the scene. He found several firearms in and around the vehicle, including the pistol stolen from Sawyer and the store's shotgun. Officer Pillow also found three ski masks in the car. One of those masks had\n   DNA matching Jones's as a major contributor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Jones was charged with Hobbs Act robbery, aided and abetted by Brown and Dontario (\"Count I\"). He was also charged with possession of a firearm in furtherance of a COV, aided and abetted by Brown and Dontario (\"Count II\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A few days prior to trial, the government sent Jones's attorney an e-mail, which provided in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   By the way, Lee [Sawyer] and Tracey [Hon] both knew Brown very well. Sawyer knew both Jones brothers very well and will testify that he recognized their voices that night. He told Kennett police officer Waynick, as he was being loaded in the ambulance that, \"Those were the same two ... that robbed me the last time.\" Turns out that Lee [Sawyer] was robbed about a year earlier and that he recognized the voices then as the two Jones brothers. No arrests out of that case, even though it was reported. I don't intend to refer to the prior robbery and I've instructed Lee [Sawyer] not to answer any question with an answer about the prior robbery\n   <em>\n    unless you ask it\n   </em>\n   . I intend to call Officer Waynick and ask him a leading question, \"Did Lee Sawyer tell you that he recognized the voices of the two men that robbed him?\" That question, which Waynick will answer yes, will not disclose the prior robbery.\n   <em>\n    If you want to ask any followup, I'll leave that to you.

Jones's counsel cross-examined Sawyer, apparently intending to show that Sawyer should not be believed when testifying that he recognized the voices of the Jones brothers. The following exchange occurred while Jones's attorney cross-examined Sawyer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q [by Jacob Zimmerman, Jones's counsel] I want to go back to you recognizing the voices of these individuals. How many times have one of your customers come in there and yelled loud at you, calling you a \"motherf****r\" or things like that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A Not very many.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q Not very many.

So they weren't coming in using their normal voices. They were yelling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q And you believe, based on them yelling, you're telling us that you still were able to identify their voices?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Jury Tr. Proceedings, Vol. I, at 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After questioning Sawyer about how he was able to recognize the assailants' voices, Jones's counsel then questioned Sawyer about his conversation with officers following the robbery. Sawyer confirmed that officers asked him questions about the shooting to obtain information to apprehend the individuals and that Sawyer told the officers how the incident occurred. Thereafter, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q\n   <em>\n    But the first officers you spoke with, you didn't tell them that you recognized the voice of the two assailants, correct?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q That would have been very important, though, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Q I mean you just testified that you knew that it was important for them to try to apprehend these assailants, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q I mean guys that just had shot you, right?

The district court denied the motion, concluding, \"I do think that opened the door and he just responded. I'm going to deny your request for a mistrial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Both at the close of the government's case and at the close of all evidence, Jones moved for judgment of acquittal, which the district court denied. The jury found Jones guilty of both crimes. The probation office prepared a presentence investigation report (PSR), which calculated Jones's total offense level as 34 and his criminal history category as III, resulting in a Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months' imprisonment for Count I and 120 months' imprisonment for Count II. The district court sentenced Jones to a within-Guidelines sentence of 188 months' imprisonment on Count I and 120 months' imprisonment on Count II, to be served consecutively. The total sentence was 308 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On appeal, Jones argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial and in denying his motions for judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Motion for Mistrial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Jones argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial during Sawyer's testimony. On cross-examination, Sawyer testified that Jones had robbed him on a prior occasion. Jones asserts that Sawyer's answer was non-responsive to his counsel's cross-examination questions that focused on whether Sawyer told the initial investigating officers that he recognized his assailants' voices. Jones argues that at no time did his counsel ever ask Sawyer about other facts that would him enable to identify the robbers aside from their voices. He insists his trial counsel never \"opened the door\" to permit testimony regarding the alleged prior robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Appellant's Br. at 11. He contends that the court erred by not giving a limiting instruction to limit the unfair prejudice caused by Sawyer's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"We review a district court's denial of a motion for a mistrial because of a witness's improper comment for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The prosecution asked [the witness] about her transfer of $ 25,000 to a man that she knew as Josh Edwards ....\"). By contrast, Jones moved for a mistrial based on testimony elicited by his own counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Applying the aforementioned factors to this unique case, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jones's motion for a mistrial or plainly err in omitting a curative instruction. First, the government did not solicit the remark from Sawyer. Instead, Sawyer spoke in response to a series of questions by defense counsel. Viewed in their totality, these questions, outlined above, demonstrate that defense counsel's line of questioning concerned whether Sawyer, on July 1, 2015, told law enforcement anything about the robbers' identities, including recognition of their voices. This line of questioning was not limited to Sawyer's ability to recognize Jones's voice. To be sure, Sawyer could have simply answered the final question, \"No.\" Instead, Sawyer used the answer to clarify what he actually had told the officers. He said, \"I didn't say I recognized their voice. I just plainly told them it was the same two guys that robbed me the first time.\" Jury Tr. Proceedings, Vol. I, at 134. Jones's counsel requested and received a sidebar seeking a mistrial but did not request a curative instruction. Sawyer's answer was not so unresponsive as to have warranted a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The second factor concerns the reasonableness of the government's line of questioning. Here, however, defense counsel asked the questions that produced the allegedly improper comment. During its direct examination, the government asked about Sawyer's prior dealings with the Jones brothers, and Sawyer testified that he had spoken with Jones \"dozens\" of times,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 123, and Dontario \"hundreds of times.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124. Sawyer testified in response to leading questions that he recognized both of the robbers' voices and that he told \"the officers that night that [he] recognized the voices of the two men.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126. The government's unobjected-to line of questioning avoided eliciting a response\n   from Sawyer concerning the prior robbery. These questions were reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The third factor concerns whether the district court gave an \"immediate, clear, and forceful\" curative instruction following an improper comment.\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901321\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/745/#p752\">\n    685 F.3d at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Jones never requested a curative instruction following Sawyer's testimony. On these facts, not issuing the instruction sua sponte was not error, plain or otherwise. The district court correctly found that Sawyer's answers were responsive to Jones's counsel's line of questioning and that Jones's counsel \"opened the door\" to the prior robbery statement by Sawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Fourth, there was no bad faith on the government's part resulting in Sawyer's testimony about the prior robbery. The government alerted Jones in advance of its use of Sawyer's testimony and kept its direct examination in line with its stated use and avoided any mention of the prior robbery. The government suggested that Jones's counsel might want to limit his questions when inquiring about how Sawyer reported the identity of the robbers to the investigating officers. The government's conduct here is far removed from bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rounsavall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11980641\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/115/561/#p565\">\n    115 F.3d 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565 (8th Cir. 1997) (holding that witness's reference to defendant's prior incarceration did not justify a mistrial, where witness made improper statement after six days of trial testimony that included \"overwhelming\" evidence of defendant's guilt, statement occurred during cross-examination by defense counsel, prosecution never discussed remark, witness had no motive to hurt defendant, jury received immediate and appropriate instructions to disregard improper statement, and court offered to give similar jury instructions at close of prosecution's evidence and at end of trial, but defense counsel declined).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, Sawyer's \"remark was only a small part of the evidence against the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901321\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/745/#p752\">\n    685 F.3d at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Branch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507840\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/602/#p608\">\n    591 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   608 ). The evidence against Jones is overwhelming. Sawyer identified Jones's voice as belonging to one of the two men who shot him and the man who accosted his cashier and took the money from her. Jones's DNA was on a ski mask left in the getaway car after it crashed in Blytheville. Jones was arrested a short time after the Blytheville crash in the second getaway car in Osceola, Arkansas, and two money bags taken from Curt's Grocery were found in the second getaway car less than an hour later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Jones also argues that the district court erred in denying his motions for judgment of acquittal on the ground that his Hobbs Act robbery falls under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B) instead of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Jones contends that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutionally vague, and as a result, his conviction cannot constitute a COV.
