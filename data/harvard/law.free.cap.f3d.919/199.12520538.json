But Spencer's lawsuit proposes comparing her pay to that of two former University administrators, Drs. Michael Shackleford and Cortez Dial, who each earned over $ 100,000 per year as professors in other departments. While Spencer asserts that the difference in pay was due to her sex, the University provides a different explanation: Shackleford's and Dial's jobs differed from Spencer's and, as former administrators, their pay\n   was set as a prorated portion of their previous salaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After discovery, the district court granted summary judgment for the University (and its former president, Dr. Keith Miller). We affirm. Though Spencer establishes a pay disparity, she fails to present evidence that creates a genuine issue of material fact that Shackleford and Dial are appropriate comparators. In any event, unrebutted evidence shows that the University based Shackleford's and Dial's higher pay on their prior service as University administrators, not their sex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The statute forbids the University (like other employers) from:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Discriminat[ing] ... between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees ... at a rate less than the rate at which [the employer] pays wages to employees of the opposite sex ... for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). To prove a violation of the Act, Spencer must make an initial (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , prima facie) showing of three elements: (1) the University paid higher wages to an employee of the opposite sex who (2) performed equal work on jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and responsibility (3) under similar working conditions.\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

By choosing two of the highest-paid professors at the University, Spencer ensured that her wages were much lower. Yet that same decision to pick Shackleford and Dial precludes her from establishing, as the second element requires, that she and they performed \"equal\" work requiring \"equal skill, effort, and responsibility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Equality under the Act is a demanding threshold requirement. It requires a comparator to have performed work \"virtually identical\" (or the apparent synonym, \"substantially equal\") to the plaintiff's in skill, effort, and responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Wheatley v.

Similarity of work is not enough; the Act explicitly distinguishes between the work itself (which must be \"equal\") and the conditions of work (which need only be \"similar\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1).

(explaining that, when trying to identify \"comparable\" pay for unequal work, there are \"no good answers that are within the competence of judges to give\"). Instead, the Act's inference of discrimination may arise only when the comparator's work is equal to the plaintiff's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In alleging this necessary equality, a plaintiff may not rely on broad generalizations at a high level of abstraction.\n   <em>\n    Wheatley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139508\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/328/#p332\">\n    390 F.3d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Spencer attempts just such an impermissibly general comparison. In Spencer's view, all University professors perform equal work because they all perform the same essential tasks: preparing syllabi and lessons, instructing students, tracking student progress, managing the classroom, providing feedback, and inputting grades.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Brief at 9. The performance of these tasks, Spencer posits, requires the same skills: studying, preparing, presenting, discussing, and so forth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. But these tasks and skills are shared by middle-school teachers and law-school professors, pre-algebra teachers and biomedical-engineering professors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This attempted comparison ultimately relies on the common title of \"professor\" plus some generalized responsibilities (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , teaching students). Yet we have rejected an analogous claim that jobs with the same title and only vaguely corresponding responsibilities can be considered equal. In\n   <em>\n    Wheatley\n   </em>\n   we concluded that the plaintiffs, supervisors in a county's emergency-services department, failed to meet their burden to show that supervisors in different departments performed equal work because they could not demonstrate that the different jobs were equal in skill and responsibility.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139508\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/328/#p332\">\n    390 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   334 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sims-Fingers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3512342\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/768/#p771\">\n    493 F.3d at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Spencer's case suffers from a near-identical flaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Spencer's bird's-eye view is particularly unpersuasive given the inherent features of academia. Professors are not interchangeable like widgets. Various considerations influence the hiring, promotion, and compensation of different professorial jobs.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zahorik v. Cornell Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1938949\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/729/85/#p93\">\n    729 F.2d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93 (2d Cir. 1984) (discussing the tenure process). As a result, faculty salary decisions require a complex balancing of factors. Among other things, those decisions account for the differences in skill and responsibility attendant to different jobs. For instance, an engineering professorship requires different skills, effort, and responsibility than professorships in other fields, such as sociology. Evidence offered by Spencer proves this very point: The University systematically pays engineering professors more than humanities professors. J.A. at 136. This reflects differences in skill along with market forces that compensate engineers more highly. This market reality confirms that Spencer's broad generalizations about tasks and skills, which apply to virtually all teachers, fail to satisfy her burden to show equal work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In contrast to Spencer's generalized tasks and skills, a litany of concrete differences underscore that Spencer does not perform work equal to that of Shackleford and Dial. First, Shackleford and Dial taught in different departments than Spencer did. While comparisons might be drawn between some departments, any\n   such comparison requires the plaintiff to articulate with specificity why the work performed and skills needed by a professor in one department are virtually identical-and not just generally related or of comparable worth-to those in another. As our precedents recognize, the differences between academic departments generally involve differences in skill and responsibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strag v. Bd. of Trustees, Craven Cmty. Coll.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414996\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/55/943/#p950\">\n    55 F.3d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 950 (4th Cir. 1995) (finding that the Biology and Mathematics departments required instructors to have different skills and responsibilities);\n   <em>\n    Soble v.

Along with serving in different departments, the three professors taught at different class levels at the University. Spencer taught mainly undergraduate courses, while Shackleford and Dial taught more graduate courses. And Shackleford also supervised doctoral dissertations. Contrary to Spencer's assertion, the fact that the University credited hours spent supervising dissertations in a similar manner to hours spent teaching regular courses does nothing to establish the equivalency of supervising dissertations and teaching undergraduates. Nor did the professors work equal hours, as the record shows that Shackleford and Dial worked more than Spencer did week to week.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   None of this is to say that the Equal Pay Act cannot apply in the higher-education context. But in that context-one where the work is an exercise in intellectual creativity that can be judged only according to intricate, field-specific, and often subjective criteria-Spencer must provide the court with more than broad generalities to meet her burden. She must present evidence on which a jury could rely to decide that she, Shackleford, and Dial had\n   <em>\n    equal\n   </em>\n   jobs, not just that they all performed vaguely related tasks using nominally comparable skills. That is, there must be evidence showing the jobs were equal in the strict sense of involving \"virtually identical\" work, skill, effort, and responsibility, not in the loose sense of having some comparative value.\n   <em>\n    Wheatley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139508\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/328/#p332\">\n    390 F.3d at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Despite all of these issues, Spencer claims her expert, Joseph Rosenberg, found \"that Shackleford and Dial were significantly overpaid\n   <em>\n    in comparison to Spencer\n   </em>\n   .\" Appellant's Brief at 44 (emphasis added). Not only is this irrelevant to establishing equal work, this claim is a bit misleading: Rosenberg asserted that Shackleford and Dial were overpaid relative to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   other professors, both men and women.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition to looking at her chosen comparators, Spencer's expert tried to identify a general disparity between the pay of men and women at the University. But his efforts revealed no statistically significant disparity within each \"school.\" If anything, this evidence undermines Spencer's claimed inference of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strag\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414996\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/55/943/#p950\">\n    55 F.3d at 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (suggesting that \"isolated incidents or random comparisons demonstrating disparities in treatment may be insufficient to draw a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   inference of discrimination without additional evidence that the alleged phenomenon of inequality also exists with respect to\n   <em>\n    the entire relevant group of employees\n   </em>\n   \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Houck v.

Granting summary judgment on this ground required the district court to find that the proffered reason\n   <em>\n    did in fact\n   </em>\n   explain the wage disparity, not merely that it\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263572\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/114/#p120\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263572\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/114/#p120\">\n    at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, there is no dispute that the wage difference at issue resulted from the University setting Shackleford's and Dial's pay at 75% of their previous salaries as administrators. In practice, the University generally paid former administrators who became professors \"9/12ths\" of their administrator salary. This practice appears to rest on the theory that professors work nine months out of the year, while administrators work year-round. Indeed, Spencer admits that her comparators' pay during their short stints as University professors was set according to the 9/12ths practice. Appellant's Reply Brief at 16 (\"Shackleford and Dial's salaries were set entirely on their prior salaries as administrators.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In response to the University's explanation, Spencer claims that the 9/12ths practice should not have been used to calculate Shackleford's and Dial's salaries. According to her, the University's historical practice only applied to administrators who were previously tenured faculty. But even if the University erroneously applied its 9/12ths practice to overpay Shackleford and Dial, such an imprudent decision would still serve as a non-sex-based explanation for the pay disparity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

But this tool must be tempered by adherence to its provisions.
