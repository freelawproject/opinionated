Algonquin has received a certificate of public convenience and necessity (\"CPCN\") from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\"), but that certificate is conditioned upon the receipt of a consistency determination from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act (\"CZMA\"). To complete its CZMA review, Massachusetts requires Algonquin to furnish a permit from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (\"MassDEP\"). But MassDEP will not issue such a permit until the Town of Weymouth approves the project under its local ordinance or a court finds that ordinance preempted as applied to the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After unsuccessfully seeking Weymouth's approval to begin construction, Algonquin repaired to the U.S. District\n   Court for the District of Massachusetts, from which it obtained a ruling that Weymouth's ordinance, as applied to the project, is indeed preempted. Weymouth now appeals that ruling.

In response to rising demand for natural gas, Algonquin's proposed \"Atlantic Bridge Project\" aims to increase the delivery capacity of its existing natural-gas transmission system in the northeastern United States. Algonquin seeks to construct a new compressor station-an appurtenance that is placed alongside a gas pipeline to maintain pressure and gas-flow rates-in Weymouth, Massachusetts as part of this project. The proposed site is located within and adjacent to a wetlands area. It is also situated in a coastal zone subject to Massachusetts' coastal-management program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In October 2015, Algonquin applied to FERC for a CPCN to construct and operate the Atlantic Bridge Project. FERC completed an environmental assessment of the proposed project pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201501.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which it found that the proposal would have no significant environmental impact. Subsequently, on January 25, 2017, FERC issued Algonquin the CPCN.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC Mars. &amp; Ne.

Significant to this appeal, FERC's CPCN requires that Algonquin obtain a \"determination of consistency with the [CZMA]\" from Massachusetts OCZM \"[p]rior to construction of the Weymouth Compressor Station.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   By the time Algonquin received the CPCN from FERC, it had already applied for several Commonwealth authorizations needed to obtain a determination of consistency from Massachusetts OCZM. Pursuant to the Massachusetts WPA and the Weymouth WPO, Algonquin sought authorization from the Weymouth Conservation Commission to begin construction. The Conservation Commission denied Algonquin's WPA and WPO permit applications. It found that Algonquin had not sufficiently addressed hurricane and explosion risks associated with the project. It also concluded that a Weymouth WPO permit could not be adequately conditioned to sufficiently mitigate the air, water, aesthetic, and recreational impairments that would result from construction and operation of the facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   MassDEP has ultimate authority over Algonquin's WPA application, so Algonquin appealed Weymouth's WPA denial to MassDEP, seeking a superseding order of conditions. In a series of rulings and orders, MassDEP agreed with Algonquin and reversed the Massachusetts WPA permit denial. But Weymouth administratively appealed that reversal, pursuant to 310 Mass. Code Regs. \u00a7 10.05(7)(j)(2), and MassDEP stayed the adjudication of Weymouth's appeal (and thus the finalization of the WPA authorization) until a court determines whether federal law preempts Weymouth's denial of the project under the Weymouth WPO. Massachusetts OCZM has yet to issue a consistency determination for the proposed project and maintains that it cannot do so until Algonquin proffers all relevant Commonwealth authorizations, including a final Massachusetts WPA permit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To summarize: FERC has concluded its proceedings and has issued Algonquin a permit that is conditioned on receipt of a CZMA consistency determination from Massachusetts OCZM; Massachusetts OCZM will not issue its determination until MassDEP conclusively rules in favor of Algonquin on Weymouth's challenge to the Massachusetts WPA approval; and MassDEP will not dispose of that challenge until a court (or FERC) resolves Algonquin's preemption challenge to the application of Weymouth's ordinance to the compressor station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thus matters stood on May 4, 2017, when Algonquin commenced this action in federal district court against the Town of Weymouth and the Weymouth Conservation Commission (collectively \"Weymouth\"), seeking a declaratory judgment that the construction and operation of the Weymouth Compressor Station is not subject to the Weymouth WPO and enjoining enforcement of the permit denial because the ordinance, as it applies to the compressor station, is preempted under federal law. The district court entered summary judgment for Algonquin, relying on both field preemption and conflict preemption grounds in doing so.\n   <em>\n    Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Weymouth Conservation Comm'n\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-10788-DJC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206757544\">\n    2017 WL 6757544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-7 (D. Mass. Dec. 29, 2017). Weymouth's appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Weymouth advances two reasons why we should reverse the district court's entry of summary judgment for Algonquin. First, it argues that the district court erred in not finding this action to be time-barred. Second, as to the merits, Weymouth argues that application of its ordinance to the proposed compressor station is not foreclosed by federal law under theories of conflict and field preemption. We consider each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When a federal statute creates a cause of action for damages or other legal relief but provides no applicable statute of limitations, \"we generally 'borrow' the most closely analogous state limitations period.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham Cty.

And in its CPCN, FERC specifically addressed environmental justice, aesthetic, and air quality concerns regarding the siting of the compressor station but found such impacts either not\n   significant or adequately addressable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *23-24, 37-39. The CPCN also considered risks from flooding and impacts from hurricanes but concluded that the station's proposed design would minimize these risks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *26-27. It further concluded that the project would have no direct impact on water resources or nearby wetlands since no dredging or in-water construction at the Weymouth site would be required.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *30-34. Finally, as to risks from a potential explosion, FERC's CPCN noted that Algonquin has committed to comply with all applicable Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulations, thereby minimizing any such risk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Based on its economic and environmental review, and its finding that there was no better site for the Weymouth Compressor Station,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *26, FERC concluded that its construction and operation would serve the public interest,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-6. The Conservation Commission's order reaches the opposite conclusion based on essentially the same environmental considerations. In so doing, the Conservation Commission's permit denial certainly poses a significant obstacle, indeed an effectively complete obstacle, to FERC's ultimate determination that \"public convenience and necessity\" \"\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   \" that the Weymouth Compressor Station be built. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(e) (emphasis added). Accordingly, FERC's issuance of a CPCN to Algonquin in this case conflict preempts the Conservation Commission's WPO permit denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oneok, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 1595.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Weymouth seeks to avoid this result by arguing that Algonquin breached a duty to \"make a reasonable attempt to obtain an approval before asserting that the local authority has 'prohibited' the project.\" Weymouth provides no support for the existence of such a duty under federal law. To the extent that Weymouth makes this argument in reliance on the portion of FERC's certificate that \"encourages cooperation between interstate pipelines and local authorities,\"\n   <em>\n    Algonquin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20383829\">\n    2017 WL 383829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12, we note that this provision does not require such cooperation from Algonquin; it merely \"encourages\" it, perhaps to the satisfaction of FERC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But nothing in the FERC certificate or any federal law to which Weymouth points would allow us to forgo our preemption ruling on the basis that Algonquin did not try hard enough to convince Weymouth to allow the project to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Weymouth also passingly invokes the doctrine of unclean hands to suggest that we should decline to grant the declaratory and injunctive relief that Algonquin seeks in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texaco P.R., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Consumer Affairs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12044652\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/60/867/#p880\">\n    60 F.3d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 880 (1st Cir. 1995). But even assuming (without deciding) that Algonquin somehow owed an enforceable duty to Weymouth to seek Weymouth's approval of the project under its ordinance, Weymouth points to no evidence in the record to support its proposition that Algonquin pursued a WPO permit in less than good faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Weymouth also argues that FERC's CPCN cannot have preemptive effect in this case due to its \"conditional\" nature. We reject this argument for essentially the same reasons we found this dispute to be\n   ripe. FERC has conclusively and finally weighed the environmental, safety, and siting considerations associated with this project in its CPCN, and FERC's determination that the project is necessary and in the public interest is at this point only \"conditional\" in that it awaits the conclusion of MassDEP's proceeding and a consistency determination from Massachusetts OCZM, both of which, in turn, hinge on our preemption decision. Whether and to what extent the FERC permit is otherwise conditioned we need not decide. Likely for similar, albeit unstated reasons, we have, in at least one instance, readily assumed that FERC approvals containing similar conditions precedent still have preemptive force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500401\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/458/#p468\">\n    589 F.3d at 472-474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the D.C.
