Before addressing these arguments, we first provide a brief overview of the applicable regulatory framework and the facts and procedural history of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The IDEA provides funds for states to educate children with disabilities, subject to conditions imposing substantive requirements on the education that is provided.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statute was enacted to ensure that children with disabilities have access to an education that meets their unique needs, to protect the rights of these children and their parents, and to prevent the unnecessary exclusion of these children \"from the public school system and from being educated with their peers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1400.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To that end, the IDEA requires that participating states provide a FAPE to children with disabilities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1412(a)(1). The mechanism by which a state provides a FAPE is an IEP--a document that describes the child's unique needs and the state's plan for meeting those needs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Endrew F. ex rel.

An IEP must contain an assessment of the child's \"present levels of academic achievement and functional performance,\" measurable annual goals that are designed to \"meet the child's needs that result from the child's disability\" along with a statement of how progress toward those goals will be measured, a description of \"the special education and related services and supplementary aids and services\" that the school will provide for the child, and an \"explanation of the extent[ ] ... to which the child will not participate with nondisabled children in the regular class.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A)(i). The IEP team--a group comprised mainly of school staff and a child's parents--should revise the IEP \"as appropriate\" to address various circumstances, including a \"lack of expected progress towards the annual goals\"; \"the results of any reevaluation\"; \"information about the child provided to, or by, the parents\"; \"the child's anticipated needs\"; or \"other matters.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1414(d)(4)(A).

J.A. 24. Her aggressive behaviors, which include \"grabbing people, pulling hair, biting, and placing her mouth on others,\" often manifest during transitions in the school day.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R.F. also exhibits physical limitations--for instance, she has significant neuromuscular deficits, so she sometimes needs assistance sitting up straight and being aware of her body's position when navigating steps and curbs. R.F. \"requires adult supervision and assistance at all times.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She also has a short attention\n   span and has difficulty processing information quickly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   CCPS first identified R.F. as a student qualifying for special education and related services when she was two years old. It developed IEPs for R.F. for half-day kindergarten in the 2014-2015 school year and for full-day kindergarten in the 2015-2016 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before R.F. entered first grade, CCPS took steps to address R.F.'s behavioral issues. CCPS hired a consultant from the Kennedy Krieger Institute to instruct its staff on conducting functional behavior assessments (\"FBAs\") for students with significant disabilities and autism. CCPS staff conducted an FBA for R.F. in April 2016 and created a behavior intervention plan (a \"BIP\") for her that focused on biting as her primary interfering behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The BIP set out actions for CCPS staff to take to reduce R.F.'s unwanted biting and to intervene when she began to bite. Steps to reduce R.F.'s biting included ensuring that R.F.'s NovaChat (a device that allows R.F. to press pictures on a screen to communicate) was accessible to her at all times, maintaining a \"clear and consistent daily routine\" and a visual schedule to ease transitions during the day, reminding R.F. of appropriate behaviors by presenting social stories to her throughout the day, providing R.F. with \"short verbal instructions with visual supports,\" and using a token reinforcement system. J.A. 29. Steps to intervene when R.F. began to bite included redirecting R.F. to her NovaChat, to appropriate oral stimulation items, or to vibration tools meant to calm R.F., followed by reviewing social stories to remind R.F. why biting is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As relevant to the dispute on appeal, R.F.'s IEP team--comprised primarily of CCPS staff and R.F.'s parents--met in May 2016 to revise her IEP for the 2016-2017 first grade school year (the \"May 2016 IEP\"). The May 2016 IEP incorporated R.F.'s BIP. It also included thirteen goals to address R.F.'s academic, behavioral, physical, and speech and language needs. The IEP team determined that to make progress on these goals, R.F. would require sixteen hours and fifty-five minutes outside the general education setting and fourteen hours and thirty-five minutes inside the general education setting each week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   R.F.'s mother attended this meeting and objected to the May 2016 IEP. She did not think that R.F. should be included in classes with nondisabled peers and requested that CCPS pay for R.F.'s tuition at the Benedictine School, a private school. The other members of R.F.'s IEP team disagreed and noted that CCPS was developing an intensive communication support classroom (an \"ICSC\") for children with communicative difficulties. The IEP team again met in June 2016 to evaluate R.F.'s progress on her IEP goals before the start of the 2016-2017 school year. Appellants' arguments on appeal focus solely on the 2016-2017 school year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the start of the 2016-2017 school year, CCPS provided most of R.F.'s special education services in the ICSC. Although CCPS anticipated the participation of other students in the ICSC, those students did not attend in the fall of 2016 due to unexpected circumstances. Consequently, R.F. was the only student in the ICSC. R.F. joined the general education classroom for \"specials\" (e.g. gym, art, music),\n   recess, field trips, and occasional reading and math classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. K., a special education teacher, provided R.F. with special education services in the ICSC. CCPS also assigned a paraprofessional to support R.F. throughout the day. In the ICSC and throughout R.F.'s day, CCPS offered R.F. a number of specialized services, including individualized supervision and instruction, and supports. These supports included objects meant to help R.F. transition to new activities and locations, a visual schedule with verbal cues, and low lighting and reduced noise. CCPS \"implemented the BIP regularly, but not perfectly.\" J.A. 44. For instance, while Mr. K. used the behavior reduction and intervention steps in the BIP, he did not always follow them in order. To monitor R.F.'s progress toward her IEP goals, Mr. K. collected data on R.F.'s behavior and performance every other week and incorporated that data into quarterly progress reports. He destroyed his raw data after writing the quarterly reports, even though CCPS requires teachers to maintain data for two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In August 2016, approximately three weeks after the start of school, Mr. K. began to notice that R.F. struggled when she joined her nondisabled peers in the general education setting. She had difficulty walking between classrooms and staying seated and quiet in the general education classroom. She also often failed to finish her lunch in the school lunchroom because she became distracted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response to these difficulties, Mr. K. gradually began providing more instruction to R.F. in the ICSC instead of the general education classroom. For instance, while R.F.'s schedule placed her in the general education classroom for reading comprehension, Mr. K. would sometimes remove her from that class and take her back to the ICSC. This decision varied daily and, according to Mr. K., was \"responsive to her needs depending on her success in the class.\" S.A. 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On some days, Mr. K. was unable to take R.F. to the general education classroom \"if she was exhibiting really aggressive behaviors or if she was having a really difficult time walking or with mobility.\" S.A. 4. As a result of these adjustments, R.F.'s hours in the ICSC exceeded the number specified in the May 2016 IEP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In December 2016, R.F.'s IEP team met again to revise her IEP (the \"December 2016 IEP\"). The team decided to reduce the number of hours that R.F. spent in the general education setting so that she would only attend specials with nondisabled peers. Accordingly, the December 2016 IEP increased R.F.'s weekly time outside the general education setting from sixteen hours and fifty-five minutes to twenty-nine hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   R.F.'s parents attended the meeting and opposed CCPS's approach. R.F.'s mother again expressed opposition to placing R.F. in a general education setting \"at all during the school day.\" J.A. 45. R.F.'s parents also presented a report by Lisa Frank, an education consultant, who recommended placement in a \"full-day evidence-based program for children with autism\" like the Benedictine School.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The other members of the IEP team disagreed with this proposed placement and determined that the ICSC was the best placement for R.F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Shortly after R.F.'s IEP team compiled the December 2016 IEP, R.F.'s parents initiated this action, alleging that CCPS violated the IDEA and seeking to have R.F. placed at the Benedictine School or\n   another private school at CCPS's expense. As required under the IDEA, they first filed a due process complaint with Maryland's Office of Administrative Hearings, resulting in a hearing before an ALJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). The hearing before the ALJ addressed whether CCPS denied R.F. a FAPE or failed to offer her an IEP that would provide her with a FAPE during the 2016-2017 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. K testified at the hearing. As relevant to one of Appellants' principal claims concerning CCPS's procedural violations of the statute, Mr. K. stated that he was unaware that CCPS required teachers to maintain raw data for two years. The ALJ concluded that he had violated CCPS's retention policy but \"did not do so for any nefarious purpose,\" and she declined to draw any negative inferences from his testimony. J.A. 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The ALJ also heard evidence regarding how CCPS calculates special education hours for the purposes of preparing IEPs and recording services provided. She found that, while Maryland requires schools to define special education hours in terms of the number of hours a child spends outside the general education classroom, CCPS defines them in terms of the number of hours of instruction focused on a child's IEP goals. Therefore, the ALJ concluded that experts who testified that R.F.'s IEP contained an inadequate number of special education hours did so based on a misunderstanding of how CCPS calculates those hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Based on the testimony and data presented at the hearing, the ALJ evaluated R.F.'s progress on her IEP goals. She found that R.F. had made progress toward some of her physical goals as well as some of her speech and language goals. She also found that R.F. did not make progress toward her behavioral or academic goals. She concluded that, overall, R.F. had \"made incremental progress on some, but not all of her goals\" and that this was appropriate for R.F. \"given her unique circumstances.\" J.A. 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The ALJ issued a decision holding that CCPS procedurally violated the IDEA by changing R.F.'s placement in August 2016 by gradually increasing her hours in the ICSC without notifying her parents or revising her IEP. She also concluded, however, that this violation did not deny R.F. a FAPE, crediting Mr. K.'s testimony that R.F. was having difficulty in the general education setting and benefitted from additional time in the ICSC. Overall, the ALJ concluded that \"CCPS offered [R.F.] 'an IEP reasonably calculated to [enable her to] make progress appropriate in light of the child's circumstances.' \" J.A. 87 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610008\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/988/#p994\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   999 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Appellants challenged the ALJ's decision in federal district court, naming as defendants CCPS, its superintendent, and its director of special education, in their official capacities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted CCPS's motion for summary judgment for reasons similar to those stated in the ALJ's decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In IDEA cases, we conduct a modified de novo review, \"giving 'due weight' to the underlying administrative proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    M.S. ex rel.

Indeed, while R.F. received most of her instruction in the ICSC, CCPS gave her multiple daily opportunities to interact with her nondisabled peers.

These opportunities, combined with R.F.'s instructional time in the ICSC, did not deny R.F. a FAPE, particularly where Mr. K. noted that R.F. had trouble concentrating and accessing material in the general education population.

This argument miscomprehends the LRE requirement, which is defined in terms of the extent to which children with disabilities \"are educated with children who are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   disabled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1820971\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/882/876/#p878\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1820971\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/882/876/#p878\">\n    at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). But even under Appellants' standard, CCPS did not violate the LRE requirement. Instead, the ALJ correctly noted that \"CCPS thought there would be other students in the [ICSC], but it did not turn out that way\" due to unforeseen circumstances. J.A. 73. CCPS cannot be said to have denied R.F. a FAPE merely because fewer students with disabilities enrolled at R.F.'s school than CCPS anticipated.

Specifically, they argue that CCPS failed to implement R.F.'s IEP when Mr. K. changed R.F.'s placement and began providing her with more instruction hours in the ICSC than her IEP called for. While this was a procedural violation of the IDEA, we hold that it was not a substantive violation because R.F. was not denied a FAPE as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A school must follow procedures specified in the IDEA before changing the child's placement as identified in her IEP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) (requiring written prior notice to the child's parents before the local education agency may change a child's educational placement). Here, CCPS did not follow these procedures before changing R.F.'s placement. Instead, Mr. K. increased her hours in the ICSC beyond those specified in her IEP without giving notice to R.F.'s parents. This constitutes a procedural violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   However, as we have noted, not all procedural violations of the IDEA result in the denial of a FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    T.B., Jr.\n   </em>\n   , 897 F.3d at 573.

Mr. K. recognized that R.F. was struggling in the general education classroom, and he determined that she would make more progress with more one-on-one instruction in the ICSC. He did so on a gradual and individualized basis, based on close attention to R.F.'s performance in a general education setting and in the ICSC. We conclude that R.F. received a FAPE when CCPS changed her placement, even though it failed to follow the IDEA's procedural requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Appellants also contend that CCPS violated the IDEA by taking certain actions that impeded her parents from participating in decisions about her education.

Therefore, their ability to \"participate in the decisionmaking process\" regarding R.F.'s education was not \"significantly\n   impeded.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(E)(ii)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We in no way minimize the necessity of compliance with the procedural requirements of the IDEA, including those pertaining to parental participation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DiBuo ex rel.

But here, we cannot find that CCPS significantly impeded R.F.'s parents' participation rights when it changed R.F.'s placement and destroyed raw data on R.F.'s progress. Accordingly, we affirm that CCPS did not violate R.F.'s parents' rights under the IDEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, Appellants contend that CCPS violated the IDEA because it failed to provide R.F. with an IEP that was sufficient to meet her needs, thus denying her a FAPE. Specifically, they contend that R.F.'s BIP was insufficient because it primarily focused on biting while ignoring R.F.'s other behaviors, that R.F.'s IEP was inadequate because it lacked a social skills goal, and that R.F.'s IEP contained an insufficient number of hours of special education instruction to meet her needs. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As we have discussed, \"[t]o meet its substantive obligation under the IDEA, a school must offer an IEP reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child's circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 999. Courts conduct this analysis with an understanding that \"crafting an appropriate program of education requires a prospective judgment by school officials.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   First, with respect to the BIP, Appellants contend that it rendered R.F.'s IEP inadequate because it should have addressed behaviors other than biting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the ALJ found that, at the time the May 2016 IEP was created, biting was R.F.'s primary problem behavior. She also deferred to testimony by Sarah Farr, CCPS's director of special education, that \"[t]he skills set forth in the BIP for the primary behavior [here, biting] can be generalized to other behaviors.\" J.A. 68-69. Therefore, the behavior strategies in the May 2016 IEP were \"reasonably calculated\" in light of R.F.'s circumstances at the time that IEP was created, and CCPS did not deny her a FAPE.\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Appellants contend that the December 2016 IEP was inadequate because it incorporated the BIP without revising it to include interventions for R.F.'s other interfering behaviors. However, Appellants present no evidence that by the time the IEP team met to revise R.F.'s IEP in December, CCPS was aware that biting was not R.F.'s only interfering behavior. While it is true that Mr. K. testified in March 2017 that if he were to develop a new BIP for R.F., it would include biting, hair pulling, grabbing, hitting, kicking, and scratching, this says nothing about what CCPS knew in December 2016. Without other evidence indicating that CCPS knew in December 2016 that R.F. needed interventions for behaviors other than biting, we cannot say that CCPS procedurally\n   violated the IDEA by failing to account for those behaviors in her IEP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Regardless, any error in failing to update the BIP did not deny R.F. a FAPE because CCPS took steps that were \"reasonably calculated\" to address R.F.'s behavioral needs \"in light of [her] circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For instance, Farr testified that R.F.'s existing BIP was sufficient to address R.F.'s behaviors. Farr explained that R.F.'s other interfering behaviors did not need to be included in a new BIP because \"they're being addressed in a very appropriate way. [CCPS is] altering the environment to change those behaviors.\" S.A. 24. Farr emphasized that R.F.'s interfering behaviors, including biting, have decreased because CCPS is taking steps to reduce those behaviors. Therefore, CCPS did not violate the IDEA and deny R.F. a FAPE by failing to address behaviors other than biting in the BIP that was incorporated in her May 2016 and December 2016 IEPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Second, with respect to whether R.F.'s IEP was inadequate because it lacked a social skills goal, the ALJ found that \"[R.F.] could benefit if her IEP contained a measurable socialization goal\" but noted that \"an IEP is not required to contain every goal from which a student might benefit.\" J.A. 70. She concluded that \"[t]aking the IEP as a whole,\" R.F. \"was not denied a FAPE due to the lack of a social skills goal in her IEP.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   We agree and note that the IEP did build in opportunities for R.F. to practice her social skills. For instance, R.F.'s BIP included the use of social stories to remind R.F. of appropriate social interactions, and her schedule included regular walks around the building to greet students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, with respect to whether R.F.'s IEP contained inadequate hours of special education, the ALJ correctly noted that, because IEPs are prospective, Appellants cannot rely on the fact that R.F.'s hours of special education were increased in the December 2016 IEP as evidence that the May 2016 IEP was defective when created.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 74 (\"The appropriateness of the May 2016 IEP must be judged as of the time it was adopted, not in December 2016.\"). The ALJ also found that Appellants' experts who testified that the May 2016 IEP contained an inadequate number of special education hours did so under an incorrect understanding of the way CCPS calculates and records special education hours. Appellants offered no other evidence that the May 2016 IEP contained an inadequate number of special education hours to enable R.F. to \"make progress appropriate in light of the [her] circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 999. Therefore, we affirm and conclude that the content of R.F.'s IEP was sufficient to provide her with a FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In sum, although CCPS violated the IDEA in some procedural respects, we affirm because it did not deny R.F. a FAPE. The education that R.F. actually received during the 2016-2017 school year reinforces our decision that CCPS provided her with a FAPE. The May 2016 IEP set out thirteen goals addressing \"all of R.[F.]'s identified special needs.\" J.A. 35. These goals \"focus[ed] on the particular child.\"\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 999. The IEP's use of the ICSC, with its specialized supports to target R.F.'s issues with focus and stress, \"aim[ed] to enable [her] to make progress,\" while its efforts to include R.F. in a general educational setting for specials aimed to avoid unduly isolating her from her peers at school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Under this IEP, as the ALJ found, R.F. did make \"progress toward achieving some of the goals on her IEP during the 2016/2017 school year,\" although not all of\n   them. J.A. 46. To facilitate her progress, Mr. K. and a paraprofessional worked closely and constructively with R.F. throughout the year to determine how to best enable her to make progress towards these goals. Such efforts include an ongoing assessment of whether R.F. was able to make progress in general educational settings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The IEP did not aim for grade-level advancement through the general curriculum or for standard letter grades because these were not considered \"a reasonable prospect\" for R. F.\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1000. But this does not indicate a failure to set \"challenging objectives\" for R.F.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The IEP team also revised the IEP in December 2016 to account for the progress that R.F. had made to date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This combination of reasonably ambitious goals that were focused on R.F.'s particular circumstances and that were pursued through the careful and attentive instruction of specialized professionals provided the education that R.F. is entitled to under the statute. We therefore conclude that CCPS provided R.F. with a FAPE despite its procedural violations of the IDEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Although CCPS procedurally violated the IDEA in certain technical respects, it did not substantively violate the IDEA because it did not deny R.F. a FAPE.
