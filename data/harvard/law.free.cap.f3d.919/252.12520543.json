The district court sentenced him to fifty-seven months' imprisonment, in part because his criminal history included a prior sentence of thirty days' imprisonment for an uncounseled misdemeanor offense. Defendant argues that the district court contravened the Sentencing Guidelines in calculating his criminal history by counting the prior uncounseled misdemeanor that resulted in imprisonment. Finding no reversible error, we affirm Defendant's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 8, 2017, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of North Carolina returned a superseding four-count indictment charging Defendant with: (1) two counts of possessing a firearm after being convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) &amp; 924 ; and (2) two counts of distributing heroin, a Schedule I controlled substance, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Thereafter, on November 6, 2017, Defendant pleaded guilty to all four counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 7, 2018, the district court conducted a sentencing hearing. Before sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepared a presentence report that calculated the Defendant's offense level and criminal history category. The Probation Office first determined that Defendant had an offense level of 19. Next, considering Defendant's prior offenses, the Probation Office determined that Defendant had a criminal history score of 10, and thus Defendant had a criminal history category of V. As relevant here, the Probation Office added one point to Defendant's criminal history score because Defendant pleaded guilty in April 2015 to the misdemeanor offense of providing false information to a police officer and failure to wear a seatbelt. Defendant did not dispute-and therefore conceded for purposes of this appeal-that he validly waived his right to counsel in the proceedings giving rise to that conviction and that he was imprisoned for thirty days. Because Defendant had an offense level of 19 and a criminal history category of V, the Guidelines' advisory sentencing range was fifty-seven to seventy-one months' imprisonment for each of the four counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At his sentencing hearing, Defendant objected to adding a criminal history point for the misdemeanor offense of providing\n   false information to a police officer. Defendant argued that because he was uncounseled-albeit voluntarily-and was imprisoned, the Guidelines precluded the district court from adding a point for that offense. To support this position, Defendant relied upon the Guidelines background commentary, which provides: \"[p]rior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the criminal history score, including uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where\n   <em>\n    imprisonment was not imposed\n   </em>\n   .\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 (background) (emphasis added). Without this additional point, Defendant would have had a criminal history score of 9 and a criminal history category of IV, and the Guidelines' advisory sentencing range would be forty-six to fifty-seven months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At sentencing, the district court adopted the Probation Office's recommendation and rejected Defendant's reading of the background commentary. The court reasoned that the Guidelines required it to count the offense of providing false information to a police officer because Defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). And though the background commentary explicitly contemplates counting prior uncounseled misdemeanors for which \"imprisonment was not imposed,\" this reference is preceded by the word \"including,\" indicating that the Guidelines do not exclude counting other valid convictions, like Defendant's voluntarily uncounseled misdemeanor which resulted in imprisonment. Thus, because Defendant was imprisoned for thirty days after pleading guilty to providing false information to a police officer, the court added one point for that offense. Thereafter, the court concurrently sentenced Defendant on all four counts to fifty-seven months' imprisonment-the bottom of the Guidelines' advisory range. Defendant timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before this Court, Defendant solely contends\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the district court misapplied the Guidelines in calculating his criminal history by counting his prior uncounseled misdemeanor that resulted in 30-days imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"On a challenge to a district court's application of the Guidelines, we review questions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And when the Guidelines provide \"commentary [that] interprets a guideline provision or explains how a guideline is to be applied, the commentary is controlling ... unless it: [1] violates the Constitution or a federal statute; [2] is inconsistent with the Guidelines; or [3] constitutes a plainly erroneous reading of the Guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519311\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/671/#p677\">\n    909 F.3d at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Stinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p44\">\n    508 U.S. at 37-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p44\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When computing a defendant's criminal history for sentencing, the Guidelines require the district court to count certain prior misdemeanor offenses, including Defendant's prior offense of providing false information to a police officer, \"only if (A) the sentence was a term of probation of more than one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to an instant offense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). Defendant does not dispute that he was imprisoned for thirty days after pleading guilty to the misdemeanor offense of providing false information to a police officer. Thus, under the plain language of Guideline 4A1.2(c)(1), Defendant's offense should be counted in calculating Defendant's prior criminal history.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p44\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nevertheless, Defendant argues that the district court erred in counting his uncounseled misdemeanor offense resulting in 30-days imprisonment because a \"background\" statement in the Guidelines commentary states that when courts count prior offenses, \"[p]rior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the criminal history score,\n   <em>\n    including\n   </em>\n   uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where\n   <em>\n    imprisonment was not imposed\n   </em>\n   .\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 (background) (emphases added). Appealing to the interpretive canon\n   <em>\n    expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n   </em>\n   , Defendant maintains that the negative implication of Guideline 4A1.2's background commentary barred the district court from counting prior uncounseled misdemeanor convictions for which\n   <em>\n    imprisonment was imposed\n   </em>\n   -even when, as here, a defendant validly waives his right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under the\n   <em>\n    expressio unius\n   </em>\n   canon, \"expressing one item of an associated group or series excludes another left unmentioned.\"\n   <em>\n    N.L.R.B. v.

In February 1990, when the Sentencing Commission first proposed including background commentary to the relevant guideline, it explained that its intention was to make clear that \"all sentences resulting from\n   <em>\n    constitutionally valid\n   </em>\n   convictions ... are counted.\" Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Fed.%20Reg.%205718\">\n    55 Fed.

Though the language of the background commentary was modified before its enactment in November 1990, the Commission reemphasized its intention to avoid \"considerable disparity in guideline application\" and to count those misdemeanor convictions \"for which counsel constitutionally is not required.\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C, amend. 353 (1990). Accordingly, because Defendant voluntarily proceeded without counsel in the prior proceeding-meaning that Defendant's constitutional right to counsel was not abridged and, therefore, that his misdemeanor conviction was \"constitutionally valid\"-the district court did not err in counting the prior misdemeanor conviction in determining Defendant's Guidelines' advisory range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant's voluntary waiver of his right to counsel in the prior proceeding also sets this case apart from the principal decision upon which Defendant relies-the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, this case does not invoke the \"constitutional problems\" that the Second Circuit confronted in\n   <em>\n    Ortega\n   </em>\n   . Put simply,\n   <em>\n    Ortega\n   </em>\n   is inapposite.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, we affirm Defendant's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   RICHARDSON, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I enthusiastically join my good colleague's opinion except for the analysis of regulatory history. That analysis relies substantially on language in the draft background commentary initially proposed by the Commission. Ante at 256-57. After receiving comments, the Commission discarded that proposed background commentary and adopted different language.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Fed.%20Reg.%205718\">\n    55 Fed. Reg. 5718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5741 (Feb. 16, 1990) (notice of proposed amendments),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Fed.%20Reg.%2019%2C188\">\n    55 Fed. Reg. 19,188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19,204 -05 (May 8, 1990) (amendments submitted to Congress). That initial, unadopted background commentary provides no reliable interpretative guidance. What is more, the passing paragraph discussing it is unnecessary given the rest of my friend's analysis. So I join only the rest of the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    In his brief, Defendant also argued that the district court erred by adding three criminal history points for each of Defendant's prior state convictions of possessing a stolen firearm and of breaking or entering and conspiracy to commit breaking or entering of a building with intent to commit a felony or larceny. According to Defendant, the court erroneously considered the statutory post-supervisory release period in determining whether a conviction constitutes a term of imprisonment exceeding one year. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1 &amp; 4A1.2. But Defendant recognized that this position was foreclosed by\n    <em>\n     United States v. Barlow\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081242\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/133/\">\n     811 F.3d 133\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (4th Cir. 2015), and thus withdrew this contention at oral argument. Oral Argument at 8:50-9:00.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
