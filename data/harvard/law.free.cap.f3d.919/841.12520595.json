The district court denied Guzman's motion. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 31, 1998, Guzman, a citizen of El Salvador, entered the United States without authorization. That same day, the federal government initiated removal proceedings. An immigration judge granted Guzman voluntary departure; when he failed to timely depart, the grant converted into a removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Approximately a year later, in response to a series of earthquakes, Attorney General John Ashcroft designated El Salvador for the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C214\">\n    66 Fed. Reg. 14,214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14,214 (Mar. 9, 2001). TPS \"allows eligible nationals of a foreign state to temporarily remain in the United States during the pendency of that state's designation.\"\n   <em>\n    Cervantes v.

Once granted, the government \"shall not remove\" an individual with TPS. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(a)(1)(A). Salvadorans were eligible for TPS if they \"ha[d] been 'continuously physically present' in the United States since March 9, 2001,\" \"ha[d] 'continuously resided' in the United States since February 13, 2001,\" and satisfied other statutory requirements.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Fed.%20Reg.%2014%2C214\">\n    66 Fed. Reg. at 14,214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254a(c)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Guzman's attorney submitted a TPS application on his behalf. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) requested additional documentation as to Guzman's continuous physical presence and continuous residence in the United States. Although the relevant documentation was present in the INS's file, it was not appended to the TPS application as required, and Guzman's attorney did not timely respond to the inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a result, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied\n   Guzman's TPS application. The agency notified Guzman's lawyer that he could appeal within 30 days and indicated that it had also mailed a notice to Guzman. But Guzman did not appeal, and in 2007, he was removed. He returned without authorization sometime thereafter and was convicted of three state crimes, rendering him ineligible for TPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2016, a grand jury returned a federal criminal indictment charging Guzman with felony illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Guzman moved to dismiss the indictment, relying on\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   . The parties stipulated that at the time Guzman applied for TPS in 2002, he satisfied all the requirements and that, had USCIS reviewed his full immigration file, he \"should have been granted\" TPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court denied Guzman's motion to dismiss the indictment. It reasoned that\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   permitted collateral attacks only against removal orders, not TPS denials. In the alternative, the court relied on a basis not briefed by the Government: it held that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which limits district court jurisdiction to review immigration determinations, also deprived the court of jurisdiction to consider Guzman's defense to his criminal charge. Reserving the right to seek our review, Guzman pled guilty and timely noted this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review de novo a denial of a motion to dismiss an illegal reentry indictment.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Before undertaking this review, we first outline the statutory and constitutional history at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government must prove two elements to convict a defendant of felony illegal reentry: (1) the defendant was \"deported[ ] or removed\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the United States \"while an order of ... deportation[ ] or removal [was] outstanding,\" and (2) the defendant subsequently \"enter[ed], attempt[ed] to enter, or [was] at any time found in, the United States\" without authorization.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Guzman asserts a due process challenge to a portion of the first element of the crime: the fact of a previous removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under current law, this removal element requires proof of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   a prior removal\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the existence of an outstanding removal order. However, this was not the case when the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   . At that time, \u00a7 1326 made no reference to removal orders: the removal element required only that the defendant had \"been arrested and deported or excluded and deported.\"\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n    481 U.S. at 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997, Pub.

Under this statute, a defendant in an illegal reentry prosecution may, as a statutory defense, collaterally attack the order underlying his prior removal if he shows that (1) he exhausted any available administrative remedies against the\n   <em>\n    removal order\n   </em>\n   , (2) he was \"improperly deprived ... of the opportunity for judicial review\" in his\n   <em>\n    removal proceeding\n   </em>\n   , and (3) \"the entry of the\n   <em>\n    [removal] order\n   </em>\n   was fundamentally unfair.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (emphasis added). These statutory requirements are identical to the constitutional standards that many courts applied, prior to \u00a7 1326(d) 's enactment, in\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   challenges to removal orders.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He instead challenges USCIS's\n   <em>\n    denial of TPS\n   </em>\n   as violative of the Due Process Clause under\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before reaching the merits of this argument, we pause to consider whether federal district courts have the power to evaluate such a claim. The district court held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear Guzman's challenge because Congress has eliminated district courts' jurisdiction to review TPS determinations. Although this may appear to be the case, it conflates the underlying determination and the specific procedural context in which this appeal arose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While the statute on which the district court relied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , limits only a court's jurisdiction to review\n   <em>\n    immigration\n   </em>\n   determinations, it says nothing about jurisdiction to hear a challenge to a\n   <em>\n    criminal\n   </em>\n   indictment. To the contrary, another federal statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , vests district courts with original jurisdiction over criminal proceedings. Thus, district courts regularly hear constitutional challenges to criminal indictments like the one at hand.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

After all, it is a cardinal principle that \"repeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of [Congress] to repeal is clear and manifest.\"\n   <em>\n    Hui v. Castaneda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582219,12448446\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/799/\">\n    559 U.S. 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582219,12448446\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/799/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582219,12448446\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/799/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, to our knowledge, until this case no court has ever construed \u00a7 1252 to impliedly repeal \u00a7 3231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Indeed, to do so by extending \u00a7 1252 's jurisdictional limitations would raise \"[s]erious\n   constitutional concerns.\"\n   <em>\n    Charleswell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3351921\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/347/\">\n    456 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   352 n.4. This is so because it would permit Congress to enact a criminal statute and then prohibit courts from exercising jurisdiction over a constitutional challenge to that statute. The Supreme Court has long recognized that such restrictions on first-instance judicial review of constitutional claims are problematic, even in immigration proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    INS v. St. Cyr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p305\">\n    533 U.S. 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p305\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p305\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (teaching that \"a serious Suspension Clause issue would be presented\" if Congress withdrew all judicial review of \"pure questions of law\" in immigration proceedings). Surely, they are at least as troubling in a criminal context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Furthermore, the district court's interpretation would lead to absurd results. Section 1252 provides that \"a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals\" is \"the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). Thus, if we were to endorse an interpretation of this statute that conflated judicial review of immigration determinations with collateral challenges in criminal proceedings, no district court would have jurisdiction to hear\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   or \u00a7 1326(d) challenge - even one identical to that in\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   itself. This cannot be so.\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   announced a constitutional due process right that Congress may not abrogate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Guzman did not ask the district court to grant him relief from removal; he raised a constitutional challenge to a criminal charge.

Guzman urges us to decide a constitutional question of first impression: does the\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   due process principle extend beyond removal orders to authorize constitutional challenges to TPS denials within criminal prosecutions for illegal reentry?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Guzman asserts that the denial of his TPS application violated due process and he was deprived of judicial review of the decision. In support of his view that\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   authorizes this collateral attack, Guzman relies on the Court's generalized discussion of due process constraints on \"administrative proceeding[s]\" that play a \"critical role\" in a subsequent criminal prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n    481 U.S. at 837-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Government counters that\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   addresses infirmities in \"deportation proceedings and nothing more.\" Gov. Br. 30. Although the Third Circuit has interpreted\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   to permit collateral attack against removal orders\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   reinstatement orders,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Charleswell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3351921\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/347/\">\n    456 F.3d at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we are aware of no court that has considered whether\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   reaches challenges to TPS determinations as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We need not resolve this novel question. Even assuming that\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   permits a constitutional challenge here, Guzman's claim fails at a more basic level: he has not asserted a due process violation that would render the adjudication of his TPS application fundamentally unfair.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n    481 U.S. at 837-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On appeal, Guzman's sole claim of fundamental unfairness is that USCIS violated his due process right to have the agency \"fairly and thoroughly review the materials in the government's possession\" when evaluating his TPS application. But if Guzman had a due process right to fair and thorough review, it would only require USCIS to review the materials\n   <em>\n    within his TPS application\n   </em>\n   . USCIS did exactly that: it reviewed Guzman's submission, found it\n   to be lacking, requested additional evidence to no avail, and only then denied relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Guzman cites no authority to support his broader claim that USCIS was required to go beyond his application and review\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   materials in its possession. In fact, TPS applicants bear the burden to \"submit all documentation as required ... or requested.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20244.9\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Thus, the record establishes that USCIS did not err in adjudicating Guzman's TPS application - let alone err on the magnitude of fundamental unfairness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Similarly, we need not determine whether Guzman exhausted his administrative remedies or was improperly deprived of judicial review. Because Guzman has failed to present any due process violation in the administrative proceedings he seeks to attack - the core of any\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   challenge - we must reject his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    After the INS's request for evidence but before its final decision, Congress abolished the INS and created USCIS, in which it vested responsibility for adjudication of immigration benefits.

He attempted to raise this claim at oral argument but offered no justification for his forfeiture.
