In this case, California demanded that organizations that were highly controversial due to their conservative positions disclose most of their donors, even though, as the district court found, the state did not really need this information to accomplish its goals. Although the state is required to keep donor names private, the district court found that the state's promise of confidentiality was illusory; the state's database was vulnerable to hacking and scores of donor names were repeatedly released to the public, even up to the week before trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ams. for Prosperity Found. v.

Their names and addresses, and even the addresses of their children's schools, were posted online along with threats of violence. Some donors' businesses were boycotted. In one incident, a rally of the plaintiff's supporters was stormed by assailants wielding knives and box cutters, who tore down the rally's tent while the plaintiff's supporters struggled to avoid being trapped beneath it.

Alabama\n   </em>\n   and that California's disclosure requirement cannot be constitutionally applied to the Foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Americans for Prosperity Foundation is a conservative organization dedicated\n   to \"educating and training citizens to be advocates for freedom.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It develops educational programs to \"share knowledge and tools that encourage participants to apply the principles of a free and open society in their daily lives.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   People publicly affiliated with the Foundation have often faced harassment, hostility, and violence, as shown by the evidence adduced at trial in this case. For example, supporters have received threatening messages and packages, had their addresses and children's school addresses posted online in an effort to intimidate them, and received death threats. One blogger posted a message stating he contemplated assassinating a Foundation supporter: \"I'm a trained killer, you know, courtesy of U.S. taxpayers, and it would be easy as pie to ... take [him] out.\" In the same vein, a consultant working for the Foundation posted threats of physical violence against Foundation employees. On a different blog site, a person claiming that he worked at the Foundation posted that he was \"inside the belly of the beast,\" and could \"easily walk in and slit [the Foundation CEO's] throat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Foundation supporters have also been subjected to violence, not just threats. For instance, at a rally in Michigan, several hundred protestors wielding knives and box cutters surrounded the Foundation's tent and sawed at the tent ropes until they were severed. Foundation supporters were caught under the tent when it collapsed, including elderly supporters who could not get out on their own. At least one supporter was punched by the protestors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Opponents of the Foundation have also targeted its supporters with economic reprisal. For instance, after an article published by\n   <em>\n    Mother Jones\n   </em>\n   magazine in February 2013 revealed donor information, protesters called for boycotts of the businesses run by six individuals mentioned in the article. Similarly, Art Pope, who served on the Foundation's board of directors, suffered boycotts of his business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Given this history of harassment, the Foundation was reluctant to make information about its donors public.

Here, the panel not only failed to defer to the district court, but reached factual conclusions that were unsupported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, the district court held that disclosure of the Schedule B information to the state could result in the names of the Foundation's donors being released to the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ams. for Prosperity Found.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134088\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/182/1049/#p1057\">\n    182 F.Supp.3d at 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There was ample evidence of human error in the operation of the state's system. State employees were shown to have an established history of disclosing confidential information inadvertently, usually by incorrectly uploading confidential documents to the state website such that they were publicly posted. Such mistakes resulted in the public\n   posting of around 1,800 confidential Schedule Bs, left clickable for anyone who stumbled upon them.\n   <em>\n    AFPF II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518505\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1000/#p1017\">\n    903 F.3d at 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the public did find them. For instance, in 2012 Planned Parenthood become aware that a complete Schedule B for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, Inc., for the 2009 fiscal year was publicly posted; the document included the names and addresses of hundreds of donors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   There was also substantial evidence that California's computerized registry of charitable corporations was shown to be an open door for hackers. In preparation for trial, the plaintiff asked its expert to test the security of the registry. He was readily able to access every confidential document in the registry-more than 350,000 confidential documents-merely by changing a single digit at the end of the website's URL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AFPF II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518505\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1000/#p1017\">\n    903 F.3d at 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the plaintiff alerted California to this vulnerability, its experts tried to fix this hole in its system. Yet when the expert used the exact same method the week before trial to test the registry, he was able to find 40 more Schedule Bs that should have been confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In rejecting the district court's factual conclusions, the panel violated our standard of review as well as common sense. The panel concluded that in the future, all Schedule B information would be kept confidential. It reasoned that because the state technician was able to fix the security vulnerability exposed by the Foundation's expert, \"[t]here is no evidence to suggest that this type of error is likely to recur.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518505\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1000/#p1017\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518505\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1000/#p1017\">\n    at 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The panel did not address the fact that even a week before trial, the state could not prevent a second disclosure based on the same security vulnerability. Further, the panel claimed that despite the state's long history of inadvertent disclosure of Schedule B information through human error, the state's new efforts to correct human errors through additional \"procedural quality checks\" and \"a system of text-searching batch uploads before they are scanned to the Registry site to ensure none contains Schedule B keywords\" would obviate future disclosures.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518505\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1000/#p1017\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But no evidence supports this claim, and it is contrary to any real-world experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, the district court found that the state did not have a strong interest in obtaining the Schedule B submissions to further its enforcement goals.

Indeed, if the Foundation's evidence is not enough to show that California cannot adequately secure its information, no plaintiff will be able to overcome a state's empty assurances. \"The possibility of prevailing in an as-applied challenge provides adequate protection for First Amendment rights only if ... the showing necessary to obtain the exemption is not overly burdensome.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455279,3644367\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/186/\">\n    561 U.S. at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455279,3644367\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/186/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Alito, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In short, the panel's conclusion is contrary to the reasoning and spirit of decades of Supreme Court jurisprudence. Under the panel's analysis, the government can put the First Amendment associational rights of members and contributors at risk for a list of names it does not need, so long as it promises to do better in the future to avoid public disclosure of the names. Given the inability of governments to keep data secure, this standard puts anyone with controversial views at risk. We should have reheard this case en banc to reaffirm the vitality of\n   <em>\n    NAACP v.

For groups with \"dissident beliefs,\" it is fragile. The Supreme Court has recognized this time and time again, but the panel decision strips these groups of First Amendment protection.

At the time of trial in 2016, the Registry Unit had halted batch uploads altogether in favor of loading each document individually, as it was refining the text-search system. After forms are loaded to the Registry, the Charitable Trusts Section runs an automated weekly script to identify and remove any documents that it had inadvertently misclassified as public. There is also no dispute that the Registry Unit immediately removes any information that an organization identifies as having been misclassified for public access.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"655692\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/860/346/#p350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There was no evidence that these \"cybersecurity protocols are deficient or substandard as compared to either the industry or the IRS, which maintains the same confidential information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518505\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1000/#p1017\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518505\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1000/#p1017\">\n    at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   We also emphasized that we were addressing an\n   <em>\n    as-applied\n   </em>\n   challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518505\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1000/#p1017\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The key question, therefore, was not whether there was a \"risk of inadvertent disclosure of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   Schedule B information in the future,\" but rather whether there was a significant \"risk of inadvertent disclosure of\n   <em>\n    the plaintiffs'\n   </em>\n   Schedule B information in particular.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518505\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1000/#p1017\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There can be no question that this risk - which the district court failed to consider - is exceedingly small, so the plaintiffs did not show \"a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of [their major] contributors' names will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
