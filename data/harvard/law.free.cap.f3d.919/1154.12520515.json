Kathryn Steinle (\"Steinle\"), a 32-year-old woman, was shot and killed by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented alien with a criminal record, after he was released from custody by the San Francisco Sheriff's Department. In this appeal, Steinle's parents, James Steinle and Elizabeth Sullivan (\"Plaintiffs\"), challenge the district court's dismissal of their general negligence claim against the City and County of San Francisco and Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi (collectively, \"City Defendants\"). While we deeply sympathize with Steinle's family, the question of discretionary immunity raised in this case is controlled by California law. After careful deliberation, we conclude that California law bars Plaintiffs' negligence claim. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In February 2015, then San Francisco Sheriff Mirkarimi, through a meeting with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Deputy Director, informed the United States that the Sheriff's Department would not honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") detainer requests or notify ICE of the pending release of any undocumented alien unless a judicial order or warrant was issued for the alien's removal. Shortly thereafter, Sheriff Mirkarimi issued a memorandum, dated March 13, 2015 (the \"Memo\") to all Sheriff's Department employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Memo established protocols and parameters for communications between Sheriff's Department employees and ICE representatives. It stated that employees \"shall not provide\" \"non-public\" information to ICE, including \"release dates or times,\" but that employees were authorized to provide certain \"public\" information to ICE. Disclosure of any information beyond the public information explicitly authorized by the Memo would require consultation with the Sheriff's Department's legal counsel, confirmation by counsel that disclosure was required by court order or law, and authorization by Sheriff Mirkarimi.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Memo changed the \"longstanding policy and procedure\" of the Sheriff's Department \"to freely provide information to ICE regarding undocumented immigrant felons in custody.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Memo referenced Chapter 12H of the San Francisco Administrative Code, which is commonly referred to as the \"Sanctuary City Law,\" and other relevant laws and regulations, including the California Public Records Act and the San Francisco Sunshine Ordinance of 1999. While the Sanctuary City Law limits information that San Francisco and its officers and employees share with federal immigration officials, it includes an exception for cooperation as required by state or federal law. It also allows, but does not require, communication and cooperation with federal authorities regarding individuals previously convicted of felonies. The Memo, however, contained no exception regarding individuals previously convicted of felonies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From 1993 to 2011, Lopez-Sanchez was convicted of \"at least seven felonies\" related either to controlled substances or to illegal reentry after deportation. He also was removed to Mexico at least five times during that time period. After completing a 46-month sentence in federal prison, Lopez-Sanchez was released to the custody of the Sheriff's Department on March 26, 2015, to face felony charges for selling marijuana. The charges against him were dropped on March 27, 2015, and on that same day, ICE sent a detainer request asking the Sheriff's Department to notify ICE 48 hours before releasing Lopez-Sanchez and to hold him until ICE could take custody of him. The Sheriff's Department did not respond to the detainer request or otherwise communicate with ICE, and Lopez-Sanchez was released on April 15, 2015, without notification to ICE. After his release, Lopez-Sanchez acquired a government-issued handgun belonging to a U.S. Bureau of Land Management ranger. The handgun had been stolen from a vehicle on June 27, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 1, 2015, four days after the handgun had been stolen and approximately two and one-half months after Lopez-Sanchez had been released by the Sheriff's Department, he shot and killed Steinle near Pier 14 of the San Francisco Embarcadero. Steinle was shot \"in the chest, piercing her aorta.\" There is no allegation that Lopez-Sanchez knew Steinle. After the shooting, ICE stated: \"If the local authorities had merely notified [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] that they were about to release this individual into the community, ICE could have taken custody of him and had him removed from the country-thus preventing this terrible tragedy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the United States, City Defendants, and Lopez-Sanchez,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging claims for negligence per se, general negligence, and deprivation of civil rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . City Defendants and the United States moved to dismiss all claims against them under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court granted City Defendants' motion and granted in part and denied in part the United States's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claims against City Defendants were dismissed without leave to amend, based on futility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Final judgment on the dismissed claims was entered pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Plaintiffs timely appealed. On appeal, Plaintiffs challenge only the dismissal of their general negligence claim against City Defendants. The district court dismissed that claim pursuant to California Government Code sections 820.2 and 815.2(b) because it concluded that the alleged negligent act-the issuance of the Memo-was an immune discretionary act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that dismissal of their general negligence claim was improper because 1) the district court erred in finding immunity on a motion to dismiss, 2) the district court erred by taking judicial notice of the contents of the Memo, and 3) the Sheriff's act of withholding Lopez-Sanchez's release date from ICE was ministerial and thus not entitled to discretionary immunity even if entitlement to immunity could be determined on a motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs also make various arguments in support of their contention that Sheriff Mirkarimi lacked discretionary authority to issue the Memo and, therefore, is not entitled to immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"We review de novo a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), and we can affirm on any ground supported by the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

Discretionary Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We agree with the district court that the issuance of the Memo was a discretionary act that is entitled to immunity under section 820.2 of the California Government Code. Section 820.2 provides, in pertinent part: \"[A] public employee is not liable for an injury resulting from his act ... where the act ... was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In applying section 820.2, the California Supreme Court has stated that \"the existence of some ... alternatives ... does not perforce lead to a holding that the governmental unit thereby attains the status of non-liability under section 820.2.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The Memo was issued by Sheriff Mirkarimi, who had the \"sole and exclusive authority to keep the county jail and the prisoners in it.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2026605\">\n    Cal.

On appeal, Plaintiffs state that they \"dispute the accuracy of the contents of the memorandum,\" but their substantial reliance on the Memo and their failure to question its accuracy below directly belies their position. Indeed, Plaintiffs' own legal counsel, by declaration, submitted a copy of the Memo in support of their motion for judgment below. Additionally, they did not oppose City Defendants' request for judicial notice of the Memo below\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, in their opposition to City Defendants' motion to dismiss, they actually cited and relied upon the Memo that was attached to City Defendants' request for judicial notice. Moreover, Plaintiffs fail to identify any specific part of the Memo that they claim is inaccurate, i.e., not part of the actual Memo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In short, the district court appropriately considered the Memo under the incorporation by reference doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Silicon Graphics Inc.

Accordingly, we hold that, although \u00a7\u00a7 1373(a) and 1644 prohibit restrictions on providing certain types of information to ICE, they plainly and unambiguously do not prohibit the restriction at issue in this case regarding release-date information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, our inquiry is at an end, irrespective of legislative history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Immigration Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that Sheriff Mirkarimi did not have discretionary authority to issue the Memo because the Memo \"invaded\" the federal government's authority over immigration law and frustrated ICE's ability to detain and deport Lopez-Sanchez. We accept as true, as we must at this stage of the proceedings, that the issuance of the Memo interfered with ICE's ability to detain and deport Lopez-Sanchez, and that ICE would have detained Lopez-Sanchez\n   had ICE been provided with his release date. We also acknowledge Congress's plenary or near plenary power over immigration issues.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fiallo v.

Notwithstanding these principles, Plaintiffs fail to cite any authority that required Sheriff Mirkarimi to provide ICE with the release date. That Sheriff Mirkarimi's actions adversely affected ICE's ability to do its job does not, without more, strip him of the discretionary authority under California law to institute the policy that he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Legislative Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Memo was an \"act of legislating\" and that Sheriff Mirkarimi did not have authority to legislate. Consequently, according to Plaintiffs, the Sheriff is not entitled to immunity because he exceeded his discretionary authority in issuing the Memo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs appear to believe that the Memo was a legislative act because it involved policymaking by the Sheriff. But action by a government official that involves some weighing of policy is not the equivalent of a legislative act. \" 'Policy' is a broad term that is not synonymous with legislation.\"\n   <em>\n    Worthington v.

California Public Records Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that the failure to provide ICE with Lopez-Sanchez's release date violated the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") and that the Sheriff lacked discretion to contravene the CPRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CPRA concerns \"a request for a copy of records.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   As alleged, though, ICE's detainer request was not a request for a copy of records under the CPRA. Plaintiffs assert that \"ICE sent a detainer request to [the Sheriff's Department]\n   <em>\n    asking to be informed\n   </em>\n   of Mr. Sanchez's release date.\" The complaint states that a \"detainer request asks the receiving agency\n   <em>\n    to perform two tasks\n   </em>\n   in regard to an undocumented immigrant in custody: (1)\n   <em>\n    to notify\n   </em>\n   ICE forty-eight (48) hours prior to the release of the undocumented immigrant so that ICE can assume custody; and (2)\n   <em>\n    to detain\n   </em>\n   the individual until\" ICE can assume custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Those allegations do not describe \"a request for a copy of records.\" Additionally, even if ICE's detainer request were construed as a public records request for documents reflecting a release date, the Sheriff's Department did not violate the CPRA because the CPRA does not require public agencies to create records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sander v. State Bar of Cal.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514816\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/237/276/\">\n    26 Cal.App.5th 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514816\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/237/276/\">\n    237 Cal.Rptr.3d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 288 (2018). There is no allegation that the Sheriff's Department had but withheld an existing record with Lopez-Sanchez's release date at the time the detainer request was made. Plaintiffs' contentions based on the CPRA do not show that the Sheriff's Department's failure to provide the release date information to ICE contravened the CPRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    E. California Health and Safety Code Section 11369\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Memo violated California Health and Safety Code section 11369, which provides: \"When there is reason to believe that any person arrested for a violation of [certain laws regarding controlled substances], may not be a citizen of the United States, the arresting agency shall notify the appropriate agency of the United States having charge of deportation matters.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Contrary to Plaintiffs' argument, nothing in section 11369 requires the transmission of an inmate's release date to ICE and, as noted above, the complaint affirmatively asserts that ICE already knew that Lopez-Sanchez was not a citizen of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Further, Plaintiffs allege that the federal government transferred Lopez-Sanchez to the custody of the Sheriff's Department after he completed a federal prison sentence. Accordingly, as the district court correctly ruled, section 11369 is inapplicable here because the Sheriff's Department was not the \"arresting agency.\" Plaintiffs' allegations fail to demonstrate any violation of section 11369.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Other Local Laws\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that other local laws prohibited Sheriff Mirkarimi from limiting cooperation with ICE. They cite section 67.24(d) of the San Francisco Administrative Code, which provides in pertinent part: \"The District Attorney, Chief of Police, and Sheriff are encouraged to cooperate with the press and other members of the public in allowing access to local records pertaining to investigations, arrests, and other law enforcement activity.\" By its plain text, section 67.24(d) simply \"encourage[s]\" cooperation; it does not mandate cooperation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs also assert that San Francisco Administrative Code section 12H.2-1 prohibited Sheriff Mirkarimi from limiting cooperation with ICE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 12H.2-1 at all relevant times provided, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Nothing in this Chapter shall preclude any City and County department, agency, commission, officer or employee from (a) reporting information to the Federal agency charged with enforcement of the Federal immigration law regarding an individual who has been booked at any county jail facility, and who has previously been convicted of a felony ... [; or] (b) cooperating with a request from the Federal agency charged with enforcement of the Federal immigration law for information regarding an individual who has been convicted of a felony ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   However, this section does not, by express provision or implication, mandate that the Sheriff (or any other officer) provide information to ICE regarding a convicted\n   felon-it simply makes clear that the Chapter does not prohibit the same. As the Chapter does not bar the Memo, it cannot have the effect of stripping the Sheriff of his discretionary authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that, when read together, section 6.105 of the San Francisco Charter (the \"Charter\") and section 8.27 of the San Francisco Administrative Code\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   the Sheriff to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, including ICE. Charter section 6.105 sets forth the duties of the Sheriff and provides that, among other duties, the Sheriff \"shall ... [r]eceive all prisoners committed to jail by competent authorities.\" Section 8.27 concerns the fixing of fees charged by the Sheriff's Department for the care and maintenance of prisoners from other jurisdictions, for the furnishing of reports and other materials, and for the imprinting and processing of fingerprints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs appear to reason that these sections require the Sheriff to cooperate with ICE because, when receiving and caring for prisoners from other jurisdictions, the Sheriff necessarily must cooperate with other law enforcement agencies. While it is necessary for the Sheriff to cooperate with other law enforcement authorities in performing his duties, there is no text in these sections that can be construed as prohibiting the issuance of the Memo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In summary, Plaintiffs' arguments fail to show that Sheriff Mirkarimi lacked discretionary authority to issue the Memo. We therefore hold that the issuance of the Memo was a protected discretionary act under California Government Code section 820.2 and that City Defendants are immune from liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20815.2\">\n    Cal.

Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   During oral argument, Plaintiffs requested leave to amend the complaint to remove all references to the Memo. However, this issue is waived because Plaintiffs failed to raise it in their opening brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Balser v.

Even if the request had been properly raised on appeal (which would have been difficult, as Plaintiffs never made this argument below), the district court's denial of leave to amend was proper because Plaintiffs' claims would not be saved by any amendment; the Memo, on its face, reflects a basic policy decision entitled to discretionary immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carrico v.

While that part of the Memo is directly contrary to the mandate of \u00a7\u00a7 1373(a) and 1644, the operative part of the Memo on which Plaintiffs' claims rest-the withholding of release date information-is not inconsistent with those statutes. Moreover, according to Plaintiffs, ICE was already aware of Lopez-Sanchez's immigration status. Under the circumstances here, we see no reason, based on California law, to strip the Sheriff of his discretionary authority to promulgate the portion of the Memo directly at issue in this case because he may have lacked the authority to issue a different part of the Memo. And Plaintiffs do not make any specific arguments based on California law that would support such a holding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    We do note that at least some of the legislative history cited by Plaintiffs supports their argument. For example, the House Conference Report that accompanied the bill related to \u00a7 1644, states, in relevant part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    The conferees intend to give State and local officials the authority to communicate with the INS regarding the presence, whereabouts, or activities of illegal aliens. This provision is designed to prevent any State or local law, ordinance, executive order, policy, constitutional provision, or decision of any Federal or State court that prohibits or in any way restricts any communication between State and local officials and the INS.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    H.R.
