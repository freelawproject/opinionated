This \"exemption\" is set forth in OSHA Directive CPL 2-2.69, which provides Enforcement Procedures for the Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens (\"BBP Enforcement Procedures\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The BBP Enforcement Procedures were issued with the purpose of establishing policies and clarifications to ensure uniform inspection procedures. The policy provides that citations should be issued for employers who have not offered the hepatitis B vaccine to first aid providers (who have occupational exposure) before those workers are exposed to hepatitis B. An exemption is carved out for instances when the following three conditions are met:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   a. The primary job assignment of such a designated first aid provider is not the rendering of first aid or other medical assistance, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   b. Any first aid rendered by such person is rendered\n   <strong>\n    only as a collateral duty\n   </strong>\n   , responding solely to injuries resulting from workplace incidents, generally at the location where the incident occurred.\n   <strong>\n    NOTE:\n   </strong>\n   This exception does\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   apply to designated first aid providers who render assistance on a regular basis, for example, at a first aid station, clinic, dispensary or other location where injured employees routinely go for assistance; nor does it apply to any healthcare, emergency, or public safety personnel who are expected to render first aid in the course of their work. These employees must be offered the vaccine prior to exposure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   c. The employer's exposure control plan must specifically address the provision of the hepatitis B vaccine to all unvaccinated first aid providers who render assistance in any situation involving the presence of blood or OPIM (regardless of whether an actual \"exposure incident\" as defined by the standard occurred) and the provision of appropriate post-exposure evaluation, prophylaxis, and follow-up for those employees who experience an \"exposure incident.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   BBP Enforcement Procedures, at XIII.F.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Wal-Mart contends this exemption required OSHA to forgo issuing a citation (or at least classify the citations as de minimis) because Wal-Mart proved each of\n   the listed conditions were true as to the relevant SIRT members. We disagree because substantial evidence supports the ALJ's finding that Wal-Mart failed to show the conditions in subparagraph b. of the BBP Enforcement Procedures were satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The ALJ reasoned the collateral duty exception did not apply here, in part because SIRT employees did not respond to workplace injuries \"generally at the location where the incident occurred\" as subparagraph b. requires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, the ALJ found the \"undisputed testimony established the great majority of the first aid administered by the SIRT team occurs in the SIRT Room\" - a first-aid room separated from the main work area by a set of double doors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   From our review of the record, we conclude substantial evidence supports the ALJ's finding. \"Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Omaha Paper Stock Co. v. Sec'y of Labor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11402074\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/304/779/#p782\">\n    304 F.3d 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 782 (8th Cir. 2002). This standard is met here. Two SIRT team members testified that when they received notification of a medical incident, they almost always responded by going to the SIRT room. Testimony and exhibits also established the SIRT room was labeled \"FIRST AID ROOM,\" was separated from the warehouse by double doors, and was described as \"the image of a modern-day clinic,\" in that it was well-stocked with medical supplies, a patient cot, and other things typically found in a clinical setting. Considering this evidence, we find no basis to disturb the ALJ's factual finding that SIRT employees did not respond to injuries \"generally at the location where the incident occurred.\" The ALJ did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Wal-Mart's broad interpretation of the exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We next address Wal-Mart's contention that we should vacate Citation One, which charged Wal-Mart with violating the standard by failing to provide the hepatitis B vaccination series to SIRT members in accordance with the CDC's recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The standard requires all employers to make sure the hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination series are \"[p]rovided according to recommendations of the U.S. Public Health Service current at the time these evaluations and procedures take place, except as specified\" in the regulation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201910.1030\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1)(ii)(D). The CDC's recommendations set forth a timetable for completing the three-shot hepatitis B vaccination series with the third shot to be given four to six months after the first shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because Wal-Mart did not provide four SIRT members with the third dose of the vaccine (at least until after the inspection), the ALJ held Wal-Mart violated the standard. We generally agree with the ALJ's assessment. The undisputed evidence shows Wal-Mart's supervisor of the SIRT team knowingly failed to provide four SIRT members the third dose of the vaccine until after the inspection. As a result, the lapse between the second and third doses for these employees ranged from twenty-one to twenty-four months, which far exceeded the range recommended by the CDC. Substantial evidence therefore supports the ALJ's determination that the hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination series was not \"[p]rovided according to recommendations of the U.S. Public Health Service.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Wal-Mart makes several arguments as to why the ALJ's conclusion was wrong.

While it is true the guidelines as issued by the CDC are voluntary and not enforceable by the CDC or the U.S. Public Health Service, they were incorporated into the BBP standard as mandatory requirements. The regulation expressly states \"the employer shall ensure that all ... vaccination series ... are provided in accordance with [CDC] recommendations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201910.1030\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1)(ii)(D).

Neither argument is meritorious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The ALJ found the Secretary established Wal-Mart failed to make the hepatitis B vaccine available to certain SIRT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   volunteers within ten working days of assignment. The ALJ relied on two types of evidence to reach this conclusion. First, the ALJ relied on testimony from Wal-Mart's AP manager in charge of the SIRT team during the relevant time period, who conceded he failed to offer the vaccine to certain SIRT volunteers after they had completed their training. The ALJ also relied on documentary evidence suggesting members of the SIRT team were never offered immunization. This inference was created by comparing a roster of SIRT members with documentation maintained by Wal-Mart (as required by regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201910.1030\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(i) and (ii) ), which showed who had either completed immunization or declined immunization. If there was no such documentation from a known SIRT member showing either immunization or declination, the ALJ inferred Wal-Mart did not offer it to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Wal-Mart argues that by considering the lack of documentation, the ALJ in effect improperly shifted the burden of proof away from the Secretary to Wal-Mart. Instead of requiring the Secretary to meet its burden of proving Wal-Mart did not comply with the standard, Wal-Mart complains the ALJ required it to prove it did comply. We reject this argument because it fails to consider the testimony from WalMart's AP manager, who testified that despite knowing SIRT members had to be offered the vaccination and that he was responsible for ensuring compliance, he \"did not comply with those responsibilities.\" Combined with the gaps in documentation indicating multiple SIRT members were not offered vaccinations, we conclude substantial evidence supports the ALJ's finding that Wal-Mart violated \u00a7 1910.1030(f)(2)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This leaves one final argument for us to consider - Wal-Mart's contention the ALJ erred by designating its violation of \u00a7 1910.1030(f)(2)(i) as a repeat violation. Congress provided that an \"employer who ... repeatedly violates the requirements of ... any standard ... promulgated pursuant to section 655 of this title, or regulations prescripted pursuant to this chapter may be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $ 70,000 for each violation, but not less than $ 5,000 for each willful violation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Both parties cite to a Commission case as setting the standard for proving a citation should be classified as \"repeat.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Potlatch Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20BNA%20OSHC%201061\">\n    7 BNA OSHC 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1063 (No. 16813, 1979).

The ALJ determined Wal-Mart failed to rebut the presumption these violations were substantially similar. We agree, even though the 2012 citation was for a violation at a Wal-Mart store, as opposed to a Wal-Mart distribution center. There is no allegation the store and the distribution center are owned by separate entities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Sec'y of Labor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1095769,3439949\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/406/731/\">\n    406 F.3d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 737 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (holding a repeat citation was warranted for a second violation of the same standard at a different store because they were owned by the same corporation). And Wal-Mart has failed to\n   articulate through record evidence how the failure to offer the hepatitis B vaccine to the SIRT employees resulted in a different hazard than occurred from the failure to offer the vaccine to the retail store employees in 2012. Indeed, both classes of employees faced the same hazard - contraction of hepatitis B without vaccination - as a result of the violation. Accordingly, the repeat designation is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

For instance, Wal-Mart complains the recommended range in dosing schedules are vague and do not provide sufficient notice to employers as to what is required. Wal-Mart further plausibly argues there is reason to interpret CDC's timetable as providing minimum (as opposed to maximum) intervals between doses. Because Wal-Mart did not raise these objections in its petition to the Commission, however, these arguments are not properly before this court and we express no opinion as to their merits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
