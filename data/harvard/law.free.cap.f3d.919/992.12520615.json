Resolving requests for certification often entails a difficult analysis of several competing considerations. But the mere fact that ceding our discretion would be easier, and perhaps even more expedient, is not an adequate reason for us to shirk from our judicial obligations. Rather than adopt a rigid formula that answers the question for us of when to certify, we should trust ourselves and our own judgment, and that of our capable colleagues on this Court, to exercise our discretion wisely after considering the unique circumstances and considerations that may be present in a given case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the surface, my colleagues purport to take issue with this Court's procedure for certification.

To the extent that they would create new rules to infringe upon jurisdictional prerequisites for referral of cases to state courts, they engage in judicial activism in contravention of Congress's prerogative to define the jurisdiction of federal courts. Even if they doubt the wisdom of the scope of federal court jurisdiction as it currently stands, that does not justify their oblique attempt to circumscribe federal jurisdiction by impeding or eliminating our discretion to decide when certification is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Moreover, my colleagues' concerns are unfounded. When this Court sits in diversity, we apply state law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erie R.R. Co. v.

When required to do so, we predict state law, but we do not devise it. In many instances, federal courts are more than capable of correctly deciding state law issues without certifying them to the state's highest court. In those cases, certification would serve little purpose other than to needlessly delay resolution of the ultimate issues in the case. Some state courts frequently take an extended period of time to decide whether to address certified questions, only to ultimately reject the certification request and refuse to answer the questions for which we have sought guidance. I am personally aware of multiple instances in which state courts in our circuit have sat on certification requests for up to a year or more, only to deny the requests without taking any action. Of course, certification may be warranted in some cases. But we should not create a mechanical rule that would require us to certify issues in circumstances where our sound discretion and judicial experience would not direct us to seek certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Finally, in arguing for certification here, my colleagues have taken my statements from\n   <em>\n    Rutherford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034685\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/616/#p628\">\n    575 F.3d 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , out of context. In\n   <em>\n    Rutherford\n   </em>\n   , this Court faced the question of whether the equitable doctrines of estoppel, laches, and waiver applied to an express easement under Ohio law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034685\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/616/#p628\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034685\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/616/#p628\">\n    at 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I dissented, arguing that\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   did not preclude certification because\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   \"relied almost exclusively\" on a single intermediate court case that was likely wrongly decided, and because\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   failed to discuss, much less distinguish, several cases from the Ohio Supreme Court that indicated that body would likely reach the opposite conclusion as the\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   panel.\n   <em>\n    Rutherford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034685\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/616/#p628\">\n    575 F.3d at 620-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Clay, J., dissenting).\n   <em>\n    Rutherford\n   </em>\n   is the inverse of this case. There, the panel privileged federal precedent over state decisions. Here, the panel stands accused of doing the opposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ultimately, this panel properly considered the circumstances of the case. A jury found in Plaintiff's favor in December 2014. Three and a half years later, when this appeal was briefed and argued, neither party moved for certification. The State as intervenor did so only in a footnote, and only with regard to \"the constitutional questions.\" But of course, the district court had already certified the constitutional questions to the Tennessee Supreme Court. That body, after waiting approximately seven months, declined to answer. Under these circumstances, it was well within our discretion to elect against a second certification attempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Accordingly, I concur in the denial of rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISSENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   JOHN K.

This lack of direction creates the potential for intra-circuit conflict as to when certification is appropriate and reduces predictability. The lack of predictability convinces me that this circuit should have more concrete standards to guide its decisionmaking in these recurring situations; what is more, this was the ideal case in which to begin delineating those standards. Specifically, we should seriously consider establishing a presumption in favor of certification where, as here, the state supreme court has not settled the issue; a prior published panel decision has addressed the issue but the current panel is inclined to disagree with the prior decision; and neither party objects to certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sixth Circuit case law states that certification is appropriate if the question of state law is \"new\" and \"unsettled,\" but that case law unfortunately fails to provide guidance in a recurring set of cases.\n   <em>\n    Transamerica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413064\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/50/370/#p372\">\n    50 F.3d at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although undoubtedly a true statement, that objection did not counsel against certification here for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, even if the state court declined to answer, this court would still have done the Tennessee Supreme Court the courtesy-requested by the Tennessee attorney general-of giving it the opportunity to speak authoritatively on its own law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   En Banc Pet. of State of Tenn. as Intervenor-Def./Cross-Appellee at 6.

To the extent that a federal court applies different legal rules than the state court would have, the state's sovereignty is diminished [because] the federal court has made state law. Such an impact on state sovereignty is no small matter, especially since a federal court's error may perpetuate itself in state courts until the state's highest court corrects it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Haley v.

Thus, the Tennessee judiciary has a favorable view of certification as a general matter, although, of course, the Tennessee Supreme Court is under no obligation to answer certified questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Third, in this case specifically, the Tennessee Supreme Court expressly stated in its denial of the district court's certified constitutional questions that it was making no comment on what it might do if the Sixth Circuit later certified the question of constitutionality and that question had become determinative because the predicate question of punitive damages' availability was also presented and certified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lindenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519669\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/348/#p357\">\n    912 F.3d at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Larsen, J., dissenting in part). So the danger that the court would decline to answer certified questions was no greater than usual here and quite possibly less than usual, given the importance of the state constitutional question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Speaking of the constitutional question, it is unusual for the panel to have invalidated a state statute on state constitutional grounds. This decision is in tension, in two respects, with the approach that the Supreme Court of the United States and our court have counseled in similar cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, the Supreme Court and our court have indicated that abstention or certification is appropriate where a decision on state law may allow the federal court to\n   avoid a\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   constitutional question.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bellotti v.

Because federalism concerns as well as avoidance concerns appear in a case like this one, where a\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   constitutional question lurks behind a predicate state-law question, certification seems doubly wise. Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit has noted that \"[c]ertification ... is especially appropriate in a case ... where the decisional task involves interpreting the state constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    LeFrere v. Quezada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062297\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/1260/#p1268\">\n    582 F.3d 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1268 (11th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, and relatedly, the Supreme Court has indicated that the possibility of making an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   guess that results in invalidating a state law should be avoided where certification makes avoidance possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizonans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651034\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/43/#p79\">\n    520 U.S. at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651034\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/43/#p79\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Also important to note is that, although neither Ms. Lindenberg nor Jackson National moved our court to certify the particular questions at issue here, our court can and does certify questions sua sponte.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Am.

The district court did certify the constitutional question (and one other constitutional question, not at issue here), but the Tennessee Supreme Court declined to answer it because it would not have been determinative of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519669\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/348/#p357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519669\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/348/#p357\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519669\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/348/#p357\">\n    at 371-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Larsen, J., dissenting in part).

Then, when asked at oral argument before our court if they had any objection to certification of the now determinative questions regarding the availability of punitive damages and the constitutionality of the punitive-damages cap, both sides agreed that certification would be appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Thus, all factors seem to point toward certification here. But because our circuit has no guidelines for certification beyond suggesting that it is appropriate for novel and unsettled questions of state law, the panel could disregard the availability of the certification procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To clarify our standards is the primary reason we should have granted rehearing in this case. The case is appropriate for en banc reconsideration in other ways as well, however. The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure state that one ground for en banc rehearing is a split in circuit precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 35(a)(1). We have that here.

But, in any event, if we had reheard this case en banc, we could have considered a very important\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   question: what certification standard should apply in our circuit to implement the constitutional federalism principles articulated by\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   and its progeny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In other words, we should have used this case to articulate more meaningful standards to guide certification decisions. At the very least, there should be a presumption in favor of certification where, as here, a state supreme court has not decided an issue; neither party objects to certification; and a prior precedential panel decision of this court stands between the current panel and the decision it wishes to reach on state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clark,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 4, at 1553-54 (arguing for \"a presumption in favor of certification in cases presenting\" unsettled questions of state law whose \"resolution entail[s] the exercise of significant policymaking discretion\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199921\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/148/#p157\">\n    119 F.3d at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Calabresi, J., dissenting) (stating that certification is \"appropriate\" in \"virtually any case in which 1) a significant and dispositive issue of state law is in genuine doubt ... and 2) certification is specifically requested by the party that did not invoke federal court jurisdiction\"). There should likewise be a presumption in favor of certification where the panel is facing an unclear issue of state constitutional law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeFrere\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062297\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/1260/#p1268\">\n    582 F.3d at 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Such a presumption would not upend the way we currently decide cases in the Sixth Circuit. I am not advocating for certifying questions in a vast set of new situations or for requiring every panel to certify if a certain group of boxes is checked. However, I do think we should make it easier for litigants to predict when this court will certify questions and easier for the en banc court to determine whether a panel has made a grave error in deciding a question of unsettled state law itself instead of certifying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, we have missed an opportunity to address a significant issue that is likely to recur. Assuming the Supreme Court\n   provides no further guidance (but perhaps it will, which I would welcome), the burden falls on each circuit to define standards for certifying questions, and at some point we should examine our standards more carefully. Otherwise, we risk validating the prediction of the Antifederalists: that an encroaching federal judiciary would use federal judicial power to diminish the power of state judiciaries. To minimize the risk of unnecessary interference with the autonomy and independence of the states, we should more frequently accept state courts' open invitations to pose to them certified questions regarding their own law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   NALBANDIAN, Circuit Judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Today's decision marks a missed opportunity for our court to more firmly establish its commitment to a \"cooperative judicial federalism.\"\n   <em>\n    Arizonans for Official English v.

But the panel's decision not to certify the questions is not the last word on the matter.

But we have endorsed using the certification process to clarify state law in this exact situation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geib v.

The state court, of course, can turn us down.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geib v.

And in that case we must keep following the dictates of stare decisis.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . But until the state judiciary speaks on an unsettled issue of state law, no amount of decisions from this court prevents the\n   <em>\n    next\n   </em>\n   court from certifying the question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Years after\n   <em>\n    Geib\n   </em>\n   , another panel in our circuit faced this same dilemma.

That's because asking the state court to weigh in does not modify or overturn prior precedent.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . It's an exercise of deference to the judicial body that actually holds the power to resolve unsettled questions of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   And, more importantly, the majority's decision in\n   <em>\n    Rutherford\n   </em>\n   was not inconsistent with what we said in\n   <em>\n    Geib\n   </em>\n   . The majority in\n   <em>\n    Rutherford\n   </em>\n   only exercised its discretion not to certify that particular question, did not cite the prior panel decision in\n   <em>\n    Geib\n   </em>\n   , and did not discuss the question of whether certification would have been inconsistent with stare decisis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To be sure, not every circuit agrees. The Fifth Circuit, for example, adopts a more restrictive view of stare decisis.
