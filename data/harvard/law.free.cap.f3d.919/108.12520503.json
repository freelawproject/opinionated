The Trooper contacted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Officer for help identifying the passengers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When asked for his identification, Garcia-Zavala produced a consular ID card. An ICE Officer ran that ID through ICE databases and determined that Garcia-Zavala was suspected of illegal reentry.

Thirteen days later, he was charged with one count of illegally entering the United States after removal, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and made his initial court appearance.

Garcia-Zavala argues that this is such a case. He argues that, thirty minutes into the stop, it was already clear that he would be criminally charged, so the Rule 5(a)\"unnecessary delay\" analysis should begin there.
