It is an alternative to the traditional \"design-bid-build\" method, which involves hiring an architect to design the project, requesting competitive bids based on the design, and having the winning bidder build the project.

The agreement comprised a master site lease and a master facilities lease. Under the master site lease, the School District agreed to lease the \"Project Sites,\" which are portions of the eight school sites, to Taber for one dollar. (This is the \"lease\" of the lease-leaseback agreement.) Under the master facilities lease, Taber agreed to construct the project for the \"Guaranteed Project Cost\" of $14,743,395. The master facilities lease included general construction provisions and construction schedules for each project site. The School District was to pay Taber $13,269,057 in \"Tenant Improvement Payments\" prior to \"taking delivery or occupancy of the Project.\" Later, six \"Lease Payment Amount[s]\" of $245,723 plus interest would be paid at 30-day intervals starting 35 days after the filing of a notice of completion of the project.

As will be seen,\n    section 17417 imposes competitive bidding requirements for school construction projects, but section 17406 exempts lease-leaseback agreements from the requirements of section 17417. Plaintiff contends defendants' lease-leaseback agreement is not a genuine lease-leaseback agreement under section 17406, and, therefore, defendants' agreement is illegal because the School District did not comply with section 17417 and obtain competitive bids. In addition, plaintiff contends that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, section 17406 does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    exempt school districts from the competitive bidding requirements of section 17417.

The instrument may provide for the means or methods by which that title shall vest in the\n    school district prior to the expiration of that term, and shall contain such other terms and conditions as the governing board may deem to be in the best interest of the school district.\" (Former \u00a7 17406, subd.

Section 17417 applies generally to 'a lease or agreement pursuant to this article.' Title 1, division 1, part 10.5, chapter 4, article 2 of the Education Code applies even more generally to leasing property. There would appear to be many ways in which section 17417 would be used, even if lease-leaseback arrangements are excluded from it.\" (\n    <em>\n     Los Alamitos\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 229 Cal.App.4th at p. 1230,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=178%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20355\">\n     178 Cal.Rptr.3d 355\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) As the School District responds, a lease-leaseback delivery method under section 17406\"is just one of the contemplated lease arrangements\" under article 2, which governs \"leases and agreements relating to real property and buildings to be used by the school district\" generally. (\u00a7 17400, subd.

Increasingly, districts are interpreting this code section to allow the award of a public works project without competitive bid.\" The report described the growing use of lease-leaseback agreements (without competitive bidding) and arguments in favor of, and concerns about, the use of this delivery method.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The 2004 SAB report then provided the staff's opinion of the school districts' use of lease-leaseback agreements without competitive bidding\n    under section 17406. \"It is the opinion of staff and SAB counsel that [the] ... interpretation [that section 17406 exempts lease-leaseback agreements from competitive bidding requirements] expands the meaning of [section] 17406 beyond its simple intent and ignores other requirements in the same article regarding competitive bid requirements for leases ( [section] 17417). There is no disagreement that [section] 17406 is clear in allowing districts to lease a district-owned site to a person, firm or corporation when the lessee agrees\n    to construct buildings for the use of the school district. However, the exemption from public bidding allowed in this section applies only to the property lease from the district to the developer. It does not address how the contract for the construction of the buildings is procured nor does it provide an exemption to competitive bidding for that contract.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    \"If the building to be constructed on the property let to the developer using [section] 17406 is to be leased to the district, Staff believes the provisions of [section] 17417... must be followed. [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] Nothing in [section] 17406 provides an exemption from this requirement or, when applicable, from the [Public Contract Code] requirements.

Section 17406 and to clarify, if necessary, the relationship of that section to the entire article on leases....\" Notably, the SAB did not accept this report, although legislative board members did express interest in proposed legislation to address the issues raised.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    We find the 2004 SAB report unpersuasive on the matter of statutory interpretation. It did not address the language of section 17406 specifying that the leasing \"instrument\" must also require the lessee to provide construction services. (\u00a7 17406, subd.

Instead, we view the report as raising policy concerns, which the SAB staff recognized might be addressed through legislation. In fact, the Legislature did attempt to amend section 17406 in the 2003-2004 session, but the proposed amendment was vetoed.

Therefore, the trial court properly sustained defendants' demurrers as to plaintiff's third cause of action, which was based on the claim that the School District was required to comply with section 17417 before entering into a lease-leaseback agreement under to section 17406.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Fifth Cause of Action: Section 17406 Does Not Require a School District to Engage in \"Genuine 'Financing' \"\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    In its fifth cause of action, plaintiff claimed the School District was barred from using a lease-leaseback agreement under section 17406 as a project delivery method because the School District has sufficient funds available to cover the immediate costs of construction of the project, and section 17406 requires \"genuine 'financing.' \" Following\n    <em>\n     Davis\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     McGee\n    </em>\n    , we reject this claim.

In the 2004 SAB report, the executive officer observed that a previous version of\n    article 2 \"is about financing.\" The report continued: \"Staff believes that virtually none of the projects currently using lease-leaseback arrangements actually have financing provided by the developer. If a 'lease agreement' other than the site lease exists at all, it serves no significant purpose other than as a construction contract. The full cost of the project is borne by the district using normal funds it has available for capital projects.... [\u00b6] Since no financing exists in the lease lease-back arrangement (or there is no lease agreement at all), the use of Article 2 appears to be inappropriate.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The 2004 SAB report does not support plaintiff's position.

This statute applies to contracts made by state agencies, not local government entities. (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 10335.) It provides in part: \"No person, firm, or subsidiary thereof who has been awarded a consulting services contract may submit a bid for, nor be awarded a contract for, the provision of services, procurement of goods or supplies, or any other related action which is required, suggested, or otherwise deemed appropriate in the end product of the consulting services contract.\" (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 10365.5, subd. (a).) Taber argues this statute demonstrates that Government Code section 1090 does not apply to consultants who later contract to perform related work because, if it did, the Legislature would not have needed to enact Public Contract Code section 10365.5 in 1990. Amicus curiae California Association of School Business Officials (CASBO) points to the \" 'settled rule of statutory construction that where a statute, with reference\n    to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different legislative intent existed with reference to the different statutes.' \" (\n    <em>\n     In re Jennings\n    </em>\n    (2004)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633024\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/34/254/#p273\">\n     34 Cal.4th 254\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 273,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20645\">\n     17 Cal.Rptr.3d 645\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20P.3d%20906\">\n     95 P.3d 906\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) CASBO argues that the fact Legislature enacted Public Contract Code section 10365.5 but did not amend Government Code section 1090 shows that the term \"employees\" in Government Code section 1090 should not be expanded to include independent contractors who provide consulting services.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The Court of Appeal in\n    <em>\n     McGee\n    </em>\n    responded to the identical argument as follows: \"If anything, Public Contract Code section 10365.5 suggests that the Legislature recognized the potential conflict inherent in the same entity serving as a consultant that plans a construction project and the contractor who carries out the project. The fact that Public Contract Code section 10365.5 applies specifically to consultants does not show that Government Code section 1090 cannot also apply to consultants as the two statutes are not mutually exclusive. In a proper case, arguably both could apply, but here the District is not governed by Public Contract Code section 10365.5.\" (\n    <em>\n     McGee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 247 Cal.App.4th at p. 250,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=202%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20251\">\n     202 Cal.Rptr.3d 251\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The fact that the Legislature passed Public Contract Code section 10365.5, which applies only to contracts with state agencies, but failed to provide a similar law for contracts with local government entities suggests that there is no blanket prohibition against consultants contracting with local government entities for work related to their consulting services (as there clearly is in the context of state contracting under Public Contract Code section 10365.5 ). But we fail to see how Public Contract Code section 10365.5 could mean that an independent contractor working for a local government entity could\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    be deemed an employee for purposes of Government Code section 1090. In other words, the existence of Public Contract Code section 10365.5 does not suggest to us that\n    <em>\n     Hanover\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     HUB City\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Davis\n    </em>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     McGee\n    </em>\n    were wrongly decided.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Finally, on the request of Taber, we have taken judicial notice of the legislative history of Assembly Bill No. 1059 (2013-2014), which died in the Assembly. This bill proposed amending Government Code section 1090 to apply to \"independent contractors who perform a public function.\" It further proposed adding a new statute providing that an independent contractor employed by government agency \"has a financial interest in a subsequent contract\" with that agency if he or she \"participates in the making of the subsequent contract.\" The existence of this bill does not change our analysis. As the\n    <em>\n     McGee\n    </em>\n    observed, \"The legislative history provided to us does not suggest the Legislature intended to modify the statute to overrule the analysis in\n    <em>\n     HUB City\n    </em>\n    , which was decided prior to the proposed amendment.\" (\n    <em>\n     McGee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 247 Cal.App.4th at p. 250, fn. 6,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=202%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20251\">\n     202 Cal.Rptr.3d 251\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    In sum, plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim of conflict of interest.
