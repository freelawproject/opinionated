INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant County of Monterey entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Monterey County Deputy Sheriffs Association (Sheriffs Association). The terms of the MOU included a longevity performance stipend that provided that a member of the Sheriffs Association who achieved 20 years of service with the County of Monterey and a satisfactory or outstanding performance evaluation could receive an additional stipend of up to eight percent. Plaintiffs are members of the Sheriffs Association who either received the longevity performance stipend prior to their retirement, are currently receiving the longevity performance stipend, or anticipate receiving it in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs brought the instant action against the County of Monterey and its Board of Supervisors (hereafter collectively\n   the County), the County of Monterey Sheriff's Office (Sheriff's Department)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and individual defendants, and also against defendants California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and CalPERS's Board of Administration. Plaintiffs sought peremptory writs of mandamus to compel the County to report the longevity performance stipend to CalPERS as an item of special compensation and to compel CalPERS to include the longevity performance stipend in calculating their retirement benefits. The trial court ruled as a matter of law that the longevity performance stipend was not reportable to CalPERS as an item of special compensation under California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 571, subdivision (a), and granted the County's motion for summary adjudication of issues and CalPERS's motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred because California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 571, subdivision (a) is properly interpreted to include the longevity performance stipend as a reportable item of special compensation. We recognize the importance of this CalPERS retirement benefit issue to the plaintiffs. However, as we will further explain, under the rules governing the interpretation of statutes and regulations we determine that the longevity performance stipend does not qualify as an item of special compensation that must be reported to CalPERS and included in the calculation of plaintiffs' retirement benefits. Therefore, we will affirm the judgments in favor of the County and CalPERS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2001 the County entered into a MOU with the Sheriffs Association. The terms of the MOU included a longevity performance stipend, which stated: \"Effective the first full period after July 1, 2000, unit members who have earned twenty (20) years of County service shall be eligible to receive a performance stipend of four percent (4%) upon receiving a satisfactory performance evaluation. Employees shall be eligible to receive up to four percent (4%) additional stipend for outstanding performance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A nearly identical longevity performance stipend was included in the 2006 to 2009 MOU, as follows: \"Unit members who have earned twenty (20) years of County service shall be eligible to receive a performance stipend of four percent (4%) upon receiving a satisfactory performance evaluation. Employees shall be eligible to receive up to four percent (4%) additional stipend for outstanding performance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   John DiCarlo and Richard Perez are retired peace officers who were employed by the County and the Sheriff's Department. DiCarlo retired in 2006 and Perez retired in 2002. Both DiCarlo and Perez were members of the Sheriffs Association. They each received a longevity performance stipend of eight percent during their employment with the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2008, James Bass and Michael Shapiro were employed as peace officers by the County and the Sheriff's Department. At that time Bass had 13 years of service with the Sheriff's Department. Shapiro was a member of the Sheriffs Association and began receiving an eight percent longevity performance stipend in 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   CalPERS provides pension fund retirement services for employees of the County\n   and the Sheriff's Department. The County has never reported the longevity performance stipend to CalPERS and therefore CalPERS has not included the longevity performance stipend as compensation in calculating the retirement benefits of the members of the Sheriffs Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Petition for Writ of Mandamus\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2008 DiCarlo, Perez, Bass, and Shapiro (hereafter collectively plaintiffs) filed a first amended verified petition for writ of mandamus on behalf of\n   themselves and others similarly situated against defendants the County, the Sheriff's Department, Lew Bauman (County's chief administrative officer), and Michael Miller (County's auditor-controller). Plaintiffs also named as defendants CalPERS and CalPERS's Board of Administration (hereafter collectively CalPERS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs alleged that representatives of CalPERS had advised the County in 2006 that the longevity performance stipend provided in the MOU between the County and the Sheriffs Association should be reported to CalPERS. However, Miller, the County's auditor-controller, advised DiCarlo that the longevity performance stipend was not subject to reporting to CalPERS because it was a combined benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Attorneys for the Sheriffs Association corresponded with CalPERS regarding the longevity performance stipend and requested an opinion as to whether the County was required to report payment of the longevity performance stipend to CalPERS. CalPERS responded in 2007 that the longevity performance stipend was not reportable because it was not available to all members of the group or class, since not all employees would receive a satisfactory performance rating. CalPERS then denied the Sheriffs Association's demand for an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs further alleged that the County had a ministerial duty to report the longevity performance stipend to CalPERS pursuant to California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 571, subdivision (a)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as incentive pay and as longevity pay. Based on these allegations, plaintiffs stated several causes of action generally asserting that the County had a duty to report the longevity performance stipend and make the appropriate retirement contributions to CalPERS, and CalPERS was obligated to include the longevity performance stipends that plaintiffs had earned or would earn in the future in calculating their retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a remedy, plaintiffs sought writ relief. On behalf of DiCarlo and Perez and similarly situated retired class members, plaintiffs sought a peremptory writ of mandate compelling the County to retroactively and prospectively\n   adjust their retirement contributions to include \"all compensation earned as part of their 'Longevity/Performance Stipend.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs also sought a peremptory writ of mandate on behalf of DiCarlo and Perez\n   and similarly situated retired class members compelling CalPERS to retroactively and prospectively adjust their retirement contributions and benefits to include \"all compensation earned as part of their 'Longevity/Performance Stipend.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On behalf of Shapiro and similarly situated class members who were currently receiving the longevity performance stipend, plaintiffs sought peremptory writs of mandate to compel the County to report the longevity performance stipend to CalPERS, and to compel CalPERS to include the longevity performance stipend as compensation and retroactively and prospectively adjust their retirement contributions and benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On behalf of Bass and similarly situated class members who were approaching 20 years of service, plaintiffs sought peremptory writs of mandate to compel the County to prospectively report the longevity performance stipend they may earn to CalPERS, and to compel CalPERS to ensure that the County reported the longevity performance stipend and to include the longevity performance stipend in adjusting their retirement contributions and benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Further, plaintiffs sought a declaration that the County was obligated to report all longevity performance stipends being earned by Shapiro and other deputy sheriffs to CalPERS and to also report to CalPERS all longevity performance stipends that may be earned by Bass and other deputy sheriffs in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   County demurred to the first amended verified petition for writ of mandate on the ground that plaintiffs had failed to state a cause of action as to plaintiff Bass and similarly situated class members because they would not be entitled to receive the longevity performance stipend before expiration of the 2006 to 2009 MOU. The trial court determined that plaintiffs' allegations showed that it was uncertain as to whether Bass would serve 20 years and whether an MOU including a longevity performance stipend term would be in effect at that time. For that reason, in the December 11, 2008 ruling the trial court sustained the demurrers to the sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action as to Bass and any others similarly situated without leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The County's Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The County filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication of issues on the ground that the longevity performance stipend did not qualify\n   as special compensation that was required to be reported to CalPERS under California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 571, subdivision (a) (hereafter, section 571 ), and therefore the County was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. CalPERS filed a joinder to the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   According to the County, the longevity performance stipend did not qualify as special compensation for several reasons: (1) the longevity performance stipend combined two elements, longevity and performance, into one stipend that was not included in section 571, subdivision (a)'s exclusive list of compensation items that qualify as reportable special compensation; (2) the longevity performance stipend required individualized, discretionary determinations and therefore was not available to all similarly situated members of the class, as required by Government Code section 20646, subdivision (c)(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   section 571, subdivision (b)(2); (3) determining that the longevity performance stipend qualified as special compensation at this late date would result in an unfunded liability for CalPERS; and (4) the County and employee representatives never agreed that the longevity performance stipend would be reported to CalPERS and included in CalPERS's retirement calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs opposed the motion for summary adjudication of issues, arguing that the County had a duty to report the longevity performance stipend as special compensation because it combined bonus pay and longevity pay, which are both listed as items of special compensation under section 571, subdivision (a). They pointed out that section 571 did not prohibit employers from combining two items of special compensation, and argued that any ambiguity in section 571 should be construed in favor of pensioners. Plaintiffs also rejected the County's contention that the longevity performance bonus was not available to all similarly situated members of the class, asserting that it was available to all employees who satisfied the condition precedents of 20 years of service and a satisfactory or outstanding performance evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Further, plaintiffs argued that summary adjudication could not be granted because there were several factual disputes: (1) whether the longevity performance stipend would create an unfunded liability for CalPERS; (2) whether CalPERS considered the longevity performance stipend to be special compensation because CalPERS representatives had stated during discovery that the stipend was reportable to CalPERS as special compensation; and (3) the intent of the parties who negotiated the longevity performance stipend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Order Granting Summary Adjudication\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In a ruling filed on July 28, 2010, the trial court denied the motion for summary judgment because the County had not complied with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(b) with respect to its separate statement of facts and because CalPERS's filing of a mere joinder was improper. The trial court then issued a minute order dated August 19, 2010, in which the court denied the motion for summary adjudication of issues as to second, third, fourth and fifth causes of action. The court took the County's motion for summary adjudication of the first cause of action under submission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On September 13, 2010, the trial court filed an order granting the County's motion for leave to file an amended answer and amended separate statement of facts. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a motion \"for clarification of ruling/reconsideration of ruling.\" The trial court heard the motion for clarification/reconsideration of ruling and issued a November 8, 2010 ruling on the issue of duty. The court found the County's interpretation of section 571, subdivision (a)(1), which precluded the reporting of the longevity performance stipend as special compensation to CalPERS, \"would produce the more reasonable result and therefore must be adopted. [Citation.] The legislature intended that there be a simple, clear list of what is PERSable and what is not.\" The trial court also found that there were triable issues of fact as to (1) \"Whether PERS has ever made a determination regarding the PERSability of this compensation\"; (2) \"Whether this compensation, if PERSable, would result in an unfunded liability\"; and (3) \"Whether the parties intended the compensation to be PERSable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On January 21, 2011, the trial court filed an order granting County's motion for summary adjudication only as to the following issue of duty: \"Monterey County's Longevity Performance Stipend (LPS) is not special compensation, in that [section 571 ] sets forth the exclusive list that identifies and defines what constitutes special compensation that must be reported to CalPERS, and there is no item on the list in [section 571 ] that combines longevity and performance elements as in the Monterey County LPS.\" The order also states that the \"motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication is denied on all other grounds raised by the County.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The County's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In December 2011 the County filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the trial court had ruled that the longevity performance\n   stipend did not qualify as special compensation under section 571. Plaintiffs filed opposition to the motion for judgment on the pleadings and also filed a motion for leave to file a second amended petition. The trial court denied the County's motion for judgment on the pleadings and granted plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a second amended petition in the July 18, 2012 order. The second amended verified petition for writ of mandamus added new causes of action for reformation of the MOU, rescission of the MOU, specific performance of the MOU, and breach of contract (MOU) as third party beneficiaries. Plaintiffs sought reformation and rescission of the terms of the MOU in order to separate the longevity and merit pay elements of the longevity performance stipend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     The County's Second Motion for Summary Adjudication of Issues\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After the second amended verified petition for writ of mandamus was filed, the County filed a second motion for summary adjudication of issues. The County contended that the first cause of action for writ of mandate compelling the County to report the longevity performance stipend to CalPERS, the third cause of action for declaratory relief, and the eighth cause of action for specific performance of the MOU lacked merit as a matter of law because the trial court had ruled that the longevity performance stipend did not constitute special compensation under section 571.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition, the County argued that as a matter of law plaintiffs lacked standing to assert the sixth cause of action for reformation of the MOU and the seventh cause of action for rescission of the MOU because only the Sheriffs Association and the County were parties to the MOU. Finally, as to the ninth cause of action for breach of contract, the County argued that the MOU did not require that the longevity performance stipend be reported to CalPERS and, even if it did, the breach would be excused since longevity performance earnings as a matter of law are not special compensation that must be reported to CalPERS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In opposition to the motion for summary adjudication of issues, plaintiffs reiterated their argument that the longevity performance stipend constituted reportable special compensation under section 571, subdivision (a). In addition, plaintiffs argued that they had standing to seek reformation of the MOU because they were third party beneficiaries of the contract as members of the Sheriffs Association. Plaintiffs conceded that the seventh cause of action for\n   rescission of the MOU lacked merit because they did not have standing to pursue that claim.\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Ruling on the County's Second Motion for Summary Adjudication of Issues\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The trial court filed a ruling on February 7, 2014, granting County's motion for summary adjudication of the first, third, fourth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action, and denying summary adjudication of the sixth cause of action for reformation of the MOU. The court found that triable issues of fact existed as to whether the MOU was intended to benefit plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On March 21, 2014, plaintiffs filed a request for dismissal without prejudice of the sixth cause of action for reformation. The dismissal was entered on March 26, 2014. As a result, no causes of action remained pending against the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    G.\n    <em>\n     CalPERS's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   CalPERS filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in April 2014. The motion was based on the trial court's January 21, 2011 ruling on the County's first motion for summary adjudication that the longevity performance stipend did not constitute special compensation under section 571, subdivision (a). CalPERS argued that pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (n)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court's ruling was binding in all subsequent proceedings, and therefore CalPERS did not have a duty to compel the County to report the longevity performance stipend to CalPERS as an item of special compensation. Alternatively, CalPERS argued that plaintiffs' claims against CalPERS were barred because the primary purpose of their petition for writ of mandamus was the payment of money in the form of higher retirement benefits and they had failed to allege that they had complied with the Government Claims Act, Government Code section 900 et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs opposed CalPERS's motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that their claims were not subject to the Government Code's claim filing requirements. However, plaintiffs conceded that they could not establish their claims against CalPERS without a finding that the longevity performance stipend constituted special compensation under section 571.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    H.\n    <em>\n     Order Granting CalPERS's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In a June 20, 2014 order the trial court granted CalPERS's motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the causes of action against CalPERS. The court included two rulings in the order: (1) \"Monterey County's Longevity Performance Stipend (LPS) is not special compensation pursuant to [section 571 ] and shall not be reported as special compensation to Defendant CalPERS\"; and (2) \"the type of claims asserted by Plaintiffs in this action\" are not subject to the Government Claims Act, Government Code section 900 et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the June 20, 2014 order granting CalPERS's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiffs also filed a notice of appeal from the February 7, 2014 ruling granting\n   the County's second motion for summary adjudication. This court directed plaintiffs to obtain a final judgment with respect to the ruling on the motion for summary adjudication and on September 25, 2015, a judgment was filed. This court on its own motion deemed the notice of appeal to be filed as of the date of judgment, September 25, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in granting the County's motion for summary adjudication and CalPERS's motion for judgment on the pleadings because section 571 is properly interpreted to include the longevity performance stipend as an item of special compensation that the County must report to CalPERS and that CalPERS must include in calculating their retirement benefits. Alternatively, plaintiffs contend there are triable issues of fact regarding the longevity performance stipend that preclude deciding the issue as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We will begin our evaluation of plaintiffs' contentions with the issue of whether the longevity performance stipend constitutes special compensation under section 571 as a matter of law, since we find that issue to be dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Special Compensation under Section 571\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Since section 571 is a regulation promulgated by CalPERS's Board of Administration, we begin with a brief overview of that system. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 20636, subd. (c)(6).) \"The Public Employees' Retirement Law (PERL, Gov. Code, \u00a7 20000 et seq. ) establishes PERS, a retirement system for employees of the state and participating local public agencies. PERS is a prefunded, defined benefit plan which sets an employee's retirement benefit\n   upon the factors of retirement age, length of service, and final compensation. [Citation.] Retirement allowances are therefore partially based upon an employee's compensation. An employee's compensation is not simply the cash remuneration received, but is exactingly defined to include or exclude various employment benefits and items of pay. ( [Gov. Code,] \u00a7 20022.) The scope of compensation is also critical to setting the amount of retirement contributions, because PERS is funded by employer and employee contributions calculated as a percentage of employee compensation.

Section 571 was implemented to serve that purpose by clarifying that the items of special compensation that are reportable to CalPERS for the calculation of retirement benefits are only those items included in the \"exclusive and specific list\" set forth in section 571. As CalPERS points out, \"[t]o allow a combination of items creates uncertainty and confusion and moves away from the clear and precise list [of special compensation items] specified by the Board [of Administration].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Moreover, where CalPERS's Board of Administration has affirmatively determined that a combination of different\n   forms of incentive pay qualifies as one item of reportable special compensation, that item has been expressly included in section 571, subdivision (a). For example, section 571 subdivision (a)(1) authorizes the following incentive pay as an item of special compensation: \"Master Police Officer-Compensation to local police officers, county\n   peace officers and school police or security officers who meet specified requirements, years of employment, performance standards, education, Peace Officer Standard Training (POST), and perform a specialty assignment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The legislative and rulemaking history therefore supports our determination that the longevity performance stipend does not qualify as special compensation that the County must report to CalPERS and that CalPERS must include in calculating plaintiffs' retirement benefits because the longevity performance stipend is not listed as an item of special compensation in section 571, subdivision (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Our determination is not altered by the evidence indicating that CalPERS's representatives provided discovery responses in 2009 indicating a belief that items of special compensation could be a combined benefit, and also provided correspondence in 2006 that could be interpreted as advising the County to report the longevity performance stipend as special compensation. CalPERS's current position is stated in its respondent's brief: \"Since 2000, CalPERS has held the position that the [longevity performance stipend], as drafted, is not a reportable item of 'special compensation' under section 571(a), as items of 'special compensation' cannot be combined.\" Even assuming that CalPERS has changed its position over time, \" 'an administrative agency may change its interpretation of a statute, rejecting an old construction and adopting a new.'

Consequently, we agree with the trial court that the County did not have a duty to report the longevity performance stipend to CalPERS. Since all of plaintiffs' claims as set forth in the second amended verified petition's requests for writ relief and\n   causes of action were based upon the allegations that the County had a duty to report the longevity performance stipend to CalPERS and make appropriate contributions so that CalPERS would include the stipend in calculating their retirement benefits, we further determine that the second amended verified petition lacks merit as a matter of law in its entirety and judgment was properly entered in the County's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     CalPERS's Judgment of Dismissal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that CalPERS's motion for judgment on the pleadings should have been denied for the same reasons that the County's motion for summary adjudication should have been denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In the June 20, 2014 order the trial court granted CalPERS's motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed all causes of action against CalPERS on the ground that \"Monterey County's Longevity Performance Stipend (LPS) is not special compensation pursuant to [section 571 ] and shall not be reported as special compensation to Defendant CalPERS.\" The causes of action against CalPERS in the second amended verified complaint all sought a peremptory writ of mandate compelling CalPERS to include the compensation earned by plaintiffs as a longevity performance stipend in both retroactively and prospectively adjusting their retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The applicable standard of review is well established: \" 'A motion for judgment on the pleadings, like a general demurrer, tests the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint, supplemented by any matter of which the trial court takes judicial notice, to determine whether plaintiff or cross-complainant has stated a cause of action.
