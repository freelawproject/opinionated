Code, \u00a7 476a) and found that he had suffered a prior conviction of felony. Defendant appeals from the ensuing judgment. As the sole ground for reversal he contends that an indigent defendant is entitled as a matter of constitutional and statutory right both to conduct his own defense <em>and </em>to be provided with the services of court-appointed counsel to advise and assist him in a subservient capacity in preparing for and during trial. We have concluded that the right to counsel does not include an absolute right to services of the character and capacity indicated; that the court should not appoint counsel to defend an indigent and require that in so doing the attorney surrender any of the substantial prerogatives traditionally or by statute attached to his office; that a defendant for whom counsel is appointed should not be permitted both to have counsel and to actively participate in the conduct of the case unless the court in its discretion determines that in the circumstances of the case the cause of justice will thereby be served and that the orderly and expeditious conduct of the court\u2019s business will not thereby be substantially hindered, hampered or delayed; that under the circumstances of this case there was no error in refusing to appoint counsel to act in a subservient capacity; and that for the reasons aforesaid and hereinafter developed the judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\"><em>The Evidence as to the Substantive Offenses. </em>On June 20 and 21, 1955, defendant, a resident of Louisville, Kentucky, made three purchases (a typewriter, a watch, and a camera) in three San Diego shops. Por each purchase he gave a check on the printed form of OK Auto Parts, signed by defendant and drawn on the Liberty National Bank and Trust Company of Louisville. Each seller deposited his check for collection and none of the checks was paid. OK Auto Parts, a firm owned by defendant\u2019s wife and managed by defendant, had had two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>checking accounts with the Louisville bank but those accounts were closed in 1947. Since 1947 neither defendant nor the firm had any account with that bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Defendant testified as follows: When he wrote the subject cheeks he was suffering from \u201chysterical amnesia.\u201d He has no knowledge of having been in San Diego in June, 1955, of having written the subject cheeks, or of having had the typewriter, watch, or camera. His wife gave him the printed forms of checks \u201cand the defendant was advised that there was an account at the Liberty National Bank.\u201d At the time defendant wrote the checks he \u201chad many thousands of dollars\u201d and \u201ccould have charged any of these items. I didn\u2019t have to write a check and steal them.\u201d (Defendant\u2019s property has since been \u201ctied up\u201d because of a divorce action by his wife.)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Defendant further testified confusingly as follows concerning the Louisville bank account; \u201c [D]uring May, 1955, just prior to the issuance of these cheeks, the defendant put in the bank of Louisville in one of the OK Auto Parts account [s], of his own money, over $1,000 in $100 bills\u201d yet \u201call during May, the account was closed.\u201d \u201cI put over $2,000 in the Bank of Louisville during the week just before I went on this trip [to San Diego], ... I was in the bank trying to give them trade acceptances for Mrs. Mattson and notes for collateral to be put into the account, and [a director and vice president of the bank] ... told me to send Mrs. Mattson in with them since he couldn\u2019t give me any information on the accounts since I was not the owner. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">A psychiatrist who had examined defendant testified for the People that \u201cthere was nothing presented by the defendant to convince me that at any time in the past that he had had a valid amnesia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\"><em>Defendant\u2019s Insistence upon Representing Himself and at the Same Time Being Afforded the Assistance of Counsel. </em>On August 21, 1957, defendant appeared in the superior court for arraignment. Proceedings on this and subsequent days through the time of trial (September 25 and 26, 1957), quoted and summarized in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> disclose the following situation:</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Defendant repeatedly refused to accept appointment of counsel to represent him and insisted upon representing himself. He asked and the court refused appointment of counsel to aid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>defendant in filing papers, preparing subpoenas, and obtaining documents. The court of its own motion gave defendant much legal advice. Defendant was mentally competent and alert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>and had some knowledge of law, but either did not understand or refused to recognize some rules of procedure, particularly rules of evidence. He clearly indicated that he did not wish to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>be represented by counsel because he correctly understood that if he were so represented counsel could control the presentation of the ease <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and defendant would have no right to participate actively in the conduct of the trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No attempt of the prosecution to take improper advantage of defendant appears and (leaving aside for the moment the question of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>right to the aid of an attorney) the record discloses no unfairness in his trial arid no miscarriage of justice in his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Although defendant in the superior court asked only for assistance of an attorney to prepare particular papers designated by defendant (that is, for aid in a quasi-clerical capacity), on appeal he urges that the superior court should have appointed an attorney to furnish legal advice as to the prepararation and presentation of his defense. No California ease has been found which discusses the question whether a defendant who insists upon representing himself has the right to have court-appointed counsel to assist and advise in preparation for or during the trial.  The following rules are pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-6\">The California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 13) provides that \u201cIn criminal prosecutions, in any court whatever, the party accused shall have the right... to appear and defend, in person and with counsel. \u2019 \u2019 This right is implemented by various statutory provisions, including the following: When defendant is brought before a magistrate on an arrest, the magistrate must inform him \u2018 \u2018 of his right to the aid of counsel in every stage of the proceedings.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 858.) The magistrate, and the superior court before arraignment, must ask defendant \u201cif he desires the aid of counsel,\u201d and if defendant desires and is unable to employ counsel, \u201cmust assign counsel to <em>defend </em>him.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 859, 987; italics added.) \u201cIn a criminal action the defendant is entitled: ... 2. To be allowed counsel as in civil actions, or to appear and defend in person and with counsel.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 686.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The foregoing sections accord the accused not only a right to counsel but also a right to represent himself if he so elects. Except in certain situations not here pertinent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>not force a competent defendant to be represented by an attorney. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rose </em>(1919), 42 Cal.App. 540, 553 [7] [183 P. 874]; see also <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1942), 317 TJ.S. 269, 279 [63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268, 143 A.L.B. 435].)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">As has been stated <em>{ante, </em>footnote 3), despite the constitutional (art. I, \u00a7 13) and statutory (Pen. Code, \u00a7 686) provisions that defendant has the right to appear and defend in person <em>and </em>with counsel, defendant is not entitled to have his case <em>presented </em>in court <em>both by himself and by counsel </em>acting at the same time or alternating at defendant\u2019s pleasure. <em>(Peoples. Northcott </em>(1930), <em>supra, </em>209 Cal. 639, 648-650 [6] 651; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mims </em>(1958), 160 Cal.App.2d 589, 595 [2] [325 P.2d 234].) So long as defendant is represented by counsel at the trial, he has no right to be heard by himself <em>(People </em>v. <em>McKinney </em>(1957), <em>supra, </em>152 Cal.App.2d 332, 336 [6]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Glenn </em>(1950), <em>supra, </em>96 Cal.App.2d 859, 868); conversely, when defendant has intelligently declined the aid of counsel he has no right to interrupt the trial with a demand for legal assistance <em>(In re Connor </em>(1940), 16 Cal.2d 701, 709 [8] [108 P.2d 10]).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">A fundamental reason for according to an accused the right to counsel is that without the aid of an attorney other protections which the law affords would often avail defendant little since it cannot be assumed that he is sufficiently articulate and adequately conversant with his constitutional and legal rights and his procedural duties to protect himself throughout the course of criminal proceedings.  Therefore, the federal courts, in determining whether a state\u2019s denial of counsel amounts to a denial of federal due process, and the California courts, in determining the extent of the right to counsel under state law, consider such matters as the intricacy of the aeeusa- ' tory pleading, the complexity of the law as to the offense charged and included offenses, defendant\u2019s intelligence, education, experience (including familiarity with the criminal law derived from prior prosecutions), youth, mental and physical health and emotional condition, the attitude of the court and the prosecuting officials and the existence of inflamed public opinion, and also the severity of the penalty. Considering the foregoing matters, the courts have developed familiar rules, stated in the margin, as to the scope of an accused\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>representation by counsel at the trial and in the antecedent proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Correlative to a defendant\u2019s California right to have counsel (whether employed or appointed) afforded opportunity to prepare so that he can intelligently advise and represent defendant, is the public defender\u2019s duty not merely to \u201cdefend\u201d the indigent accused in court but also to \u201cgive eoun-</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>sel and advice to such.person about any charge against him upon which the public defender is conducting the defense.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 27706, subd. (a).)  And even when a defendant represented by the public defender expresses the desire to plead guilty, \u201cIt is his [counsel\u2019s] task to investigate carefully all defenses of fact and of law which may be available to the defendant and confer with him about them before he permits his client to foreclose all possibility of defense and submit to conviction without a hearing by pleading guilty. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Avilez </em>(1948), <em>supra, </em>86 Cal.App.2d 289, 296 [5], citing <em>In re Hough </em>(1944), <em>supra, </em>24 Cal.2d 522, 529.)  But a defendant who elects to go to trial represented by out-of-state counsel has no right to the services of the public defender as an advisor concerning local law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Saltz </em>(1955), 131 Cal.App.2d 459, 470-471 [5a, 6, 5b] [280 P.2d 900].)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In the light of the foregoing rules we consider the construction of our Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 13) and statutes (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 686, 859, 987) urged by counsel appointed to represent defendant on this appeal. Counsel points out that the requirement (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 859, 987) that \u201cthe court [magistrate and trial court] must assign counsel to defend\u201d has only two expressed statutory prerequisites; i.e., an attorney must be assigned if defendant \u201c[1] desires and [2] is unable to employ counsel.\u201d Therefore, counsel says, we should not read into the statutes as a further prerequisite to the right to an assigned attorney the condition that defendant give up his right to represent himself. Furthermore, counsel points out, defendant has the constitutional (art. I, \u00a7 13) and statutory (Pen. Code, \u00a7 686) right \u201cto appear <em>and </em>defend in person <em>and </em>with counsel\u201d (italics added), yet this right does not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>a right of defendant both to represent himself and to be represented by an attorney. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Northcott </em>(1930), <em>supra, </em>209 Cal. 639, 648-649 [6].) It is counsel\u2019s position that the use of the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d in the just quoted provisions of Constitution and statute indicates that a defendant who elects to represent himself still retains some right to the services of counsel, and that since such right does not include representation it must include assistance and advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The People reply that the foregoing arguments overlook the normal, dictionary meaning of \u201cdefend.\u201d That word (as used generally with reference to the act of a party to a lawsuit) means \u201cTo deny or oppose the right of the plaintiff\u201d and (as used specifically in referring to the act of an attorney) means \u201cto act on behalf of (an accused person).\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Diet., 2d ed., 1958.) Therefore, the People urge, defendant\u2019s right to have counsel assigned \u201cto defend him\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 859, 987) is the right to have counsel \u201cact on [his] behalf\u201d; i.e., to appear for and represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The People\u2019s position is supported not only by dictionary definition but also by the sound concept that it is the duty of the court to safeguard and promote the orderly and expeditious conduct of its business and to guard against inept procedures and unnecessary indulgences which would tend to hinder, hamper or delay the conduct and dispatch of its proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">In this connection it is noted that Business and Professions Code, section 6068,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> declares in clear language certain duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>of an attorney in respect to courts of justice, judicial officers, and the conduct of proceedings before the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Common knowledge of judges and attorneys (and to some extent the transcript in the case at bar, as hereinafter pointed out) suggests that there are at least some persons who, although not members of the bar, undertake to act as their own attorney in presenting their cause or defense and who in so acting do not appear to feel bound to \u201cmaintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers\u201d (\u00a7 6068, subd. (b)) or to \u201cemploy, for the purpose of maintaining the causes . . . such means only as are consistent with truth, and never to seek to mislead the judge ... by an artifice or false statement of fact or law\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d)) or \u201cTo abstain from all offensive personality, and to advance no fact prejudicial to the honor or reputation of a party or witness, unless required by the justice of the cause\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f)) or \u201cNot to encourage either the commencement or the continuance of an action . . . from any corrupt motive of passion or interest\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">It is also a sound concept that the court-appointed attorney as well as the accused is entitled to fair consideration. An attorney at law is a member of an ancient, honorable and deservingly honored profession. He is regarded as an officer of the court, of any court in which he appears.  Whether appointed to represent an indigent or employed by a man of wealth or by the state, the diligence and quality of the lawyer\u2019s service and the ethical standards of his conduct are the same; his office and the prerogatives of that office, and the respect due to him in the discharge of his duties, are the same. The court should not appoint counsel\u2014whether to defend an indigent or otherwise\u2014and require of him that in so doing he surrender any of the substantial prerogatives traditionally or by statute attached to his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The right of an accused to the services of an attorney contemplates that the attorney will investigate possible defenses or alternative procedures and advise the accused of his conclusions, not, as this defendant requested, that the attorney will act as a mere subservient helper under the direction of the accused.  Neither the express provisions of California law nor general considerations of fairness require that an intelligent, competent defendant who obdurately insists upon controlling and conducting his own defense should be entitled as a matter of right to the services of counsel to act under defendant\u2019s control.  Where a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>charged with crime is unable to employ counsel, is not statutorily required to have counsel <em>{ante, </em>footnote 4), and is competent to decide whether he desires counsel, the defendant during the proceedings before the magistrate and the trial court has as a matter of absolute right but two choices in the matter of a court-appointed attorney: he can accept representation by counsel (as most defendants with the ability to employ counsel have the good sense to do) or he can elect to represent himself.  If he makes the latter election, he assumes for all purposes connected with his case, and must be prepared to be treated as having, the qualifications and responsibilities concomitant with the role he has undertaken; he is not entitled either to privileges and indulgences not accorded attorneys or to privileges and indulgences not accorded defendants who are represented by counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chessman </em>(1951), 38 Cal.2d 166, 174 [2] [238 P.2d 1001].)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">In the circumstances of this case, the superior court could not force defendant to accept representation of counsel, for he was intelligent and mentally competent and understood (although he did not agree with) the legal effect of his insisting upon representing himself. And in the circumstances defendant\u2019s refusal to accept rulings and suggestions of the superior court will not be regarded by this court as showing that defendant was incapable of protecting his rights and presenting his case, particularly in view of the trial court\u2019s conclusion, expressed hyperbolieally at the end of the proceeding, that \u201cI think, from my own observation, he knows more what he is doing than I know what I am doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Of course there might be circumstances in which a defendant, without being afforded the opportunity to consult privately with an attorney, could not arrive at an intelligent decision as to whether he should represent himself. The trial judge in discharging his serious and weighty responsibility ... of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver [of the right to counsel] by the accused\u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst </em>(1938), <em>supra, </em>304 U.S. 458, 465; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chesser </em>(1947), <em>supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 815, 821-822) has no duty to give defendant a legal education, and the judge has no right, in view of the privilege against self-incrimination, to ask defendant about his understanding of the facts of the case. If the judge\u2019s properly limited inquiry concerning the necessity for appointment of counsel suggests that defendant may not comprehend his position then the judge should assign an attorney to consult privately with defendant concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>latter\u2019s need for representation. Such an appointment of counsel, unlike the appointment sought by defendant here, would not require the attorney to surrender the prerogatives of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Our conclusion that a California defendant has no absolute right to the services of an attorney in a mere advisory capacity harmonizes with the federal law as to right to counsel. [21] It has been said that section 13 of article I of the California Constitution accords to California defendants \u201cthe same right\u201d as is accorded to federal defendants by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lanigan </em>(1943), 22 Cal.2d 569, 575 [140 P.2d 24, 148 A.L.R. 176].) Of course this does not mean that the California right to counsel is or must be identical with the federal right to counsel. Consonant with the federal Constitution the state right could be less comprehensive than the federal right. <em>(Betts </em>v. <em>Brady </em>(1942), 316 U.S. 455, 471 [62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595].) Actually, in some respects the California right is more comprehensive than the federal right.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But since the California right is substantially similar to the federal right, we may appropriately inquire whether the federal right includes the right to services of assigned counsel merely as an assistant and advisor and not as a legal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (effective March 21, 1946, 327 U.S. 866, 18 U.S.C.A., 1951 ed.) provides, \u201cIf the defendant appears in court without counsel, the court shall advise him of his right to counsel and assign counsel to <em>represent him </em>at every stage of the proceeding unless he elects to proceed without counsel or is able to obtain counsel.\u201d (Italics added.) According to the United States Supreme Court, rule 44 states \u201cThe view of this Court as to the practice best adapted to the needs of the federal courts and most responsive to the requirements of the Federal Constitution and statutes as well as to the decisions of this Court. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Bute v. Illinois </em>(1948), 333 U.S. 640, 662 [68 S.Ct. 763, 775 [15], 92 L.Ed. 986].)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">In <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>United States </em>(C.A. 5, 1953), <em>supra, </em>205 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>806, 812-813, defendant elected to represent himself but asked appointment of an attorney to assist him \u201coutside the court room ... in preparing suggested charges to the jury, etc. \u2019 \u2019 and to \u201cadvise me during the trial.\u201d The district court ruled, \u201cYou are either going to be represented by counsel or you are going to represent yourself. . . . [T]he court is not going to appoint a lawyer and have him occupy an inferior position in the defense of your case.\u201d The Court of Appeals upheld this ruling and determined that the right of the accused to \u201cthe Assistance of Counsel for his defense\u201d (U.S. Const., Amendment VI) does not include the right to court-appointed advisory counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">We recognize that in the California courts, under our holding in the case at bar (as in the federal courts, under the holding in Shelton, <em>supra), </em>a defendant who insists upon representing himself and who can employ an attorney may secure a quantum or type of legal assistance greater than or different from that which must be accorded a defendant who is unable to employ an attorney and who insists upon representing himself, for a defendant who can find private counsel willing to accept employment in \u201can inferior position in the defense\u201d <em>must </em>be allowed out-of-court consultation with such attorney. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 825.)  But the only reason the indigent does not have out-of-court consultation with an attorney is because he refuses to accept appointment of an attorney to represent <em>him; </em>i.e., to act within the traditional and statutory status of his office. This difference between the right to the aid of counsel of defendant\u2019s choice and the right to have counsel provided is not a denial of due process or equal protection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AzS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>We are not saying that the trial court may not in its discretion, upon what it may determine to be good cause shown, permit a party who is represented by counsel to participate in the conduct of the ease (see <em>ante, </em>footnote 3), or permit a defendant who appears in propria persona to employ an attorney to sit by him and advise him during the presentation of the case in court, or even appoint an attorney (with the latter\u2019s consent) to render such advisory services to an indigent defendant who wishes to represent himself (see e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Chessman </em>(1951), <em>supra, </em>38 Cal.2d 166, 174 [2]). These matters are within the sound discretion of the trial judge, who is in a position to appraise the courtroom situation and determine what procedure will best promote orderly, prompt and just disposition of the cause.  The court, however, should not permit a litigant both to have counsel and to actively participate in the conduct of the case (as by conducting examination of witnesses, interposing objections, arguing points of law or of fact, addressing the jury, etc.) unless the court on a substantial showing determines that in the circumstances of the case the cause of justice will thereby be served and that the orderly and expeditious conduct of the court\u2019s business will not thereby be substantially hindered, hampered or delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">In the case at bar, defendant\u2019s conduct in propria persona in connection with the prosecution of his appeal confirms the conclusion that the superior court was justified in determining that his requests for the services of counsel prior to trial were not made with any real intention to accept sound advice. On appeal, although defendant has been diligently represented by court-appointed counsel, he has persisted in presenting documents in propria persona which reflect his misconceptions of and refusal to accept established rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>law. In these documents he asks that the record be \u201caugmented\u201d to include matters which are not of record below; he asserts that the record is erroneous in unspecified respects and in specified immaterial respects (rule 12 (b) of the Rules on Appeal provides that \u201cIf any material part of the record is incorrect in any respect . . . the reviewing court . . . may direct that it be corrected\u201d); and he presents contentions which are without support in the record and contentions which were not made in the trial court. Furthermore, during the pendency of this appeal defendant has harassed this court with meritless <em>pro se </em>applications for writs attacking almost every step in the San Diego proceedings against him, beginning with unsupported complaints as to the prosecuting attorney\u2019s obtaining a requisition for defendant\u2019s extradition from Kentucky and ending with unsupported complaints as to the manner in which his court-appointed counsel presented the appeal.

Because of the undesirability of fruitlessly adding to the burdens of this court the time-consuming task of reading <em>pro se </em>documents which are not properly before us, and, if they be read, of consequently enlarging this opinion by a reeountal and discussion of the contentions made in propria persona, such documents filed in this appeal by defendant should be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">For the reasons above stated the documents filed in propria persona by defendant during the time when he has been represented by court-appointed counsel are stricken from the files and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Gibson, C.

He was permitted to do so after the court (in substance) explained, and defendant stated that he understood, that the allegation of the prior conviction, if denied, would be read to the jury and evidence to prove it received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoJ\">At the trial all admissible evidence and much irrelevant evidence offered by defendant was admitted. Defendant examined a police officer as to whether he took from defendant \u201cpapers . . . including certified deposits in the bank where this would have shown that . . . there was money in the account\u201d; the officer testified that he did not take any papers from, defendant; defendant made no further effort to prove that there were \u201ccertified deposits\u201d or \u201cmoney in the account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6g\">By examination of an attorney who had represented defendant, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>defendant\u2019s own testimony, and by cross-examination of the psychiatrist who testified for the People, defendant sought to show the contents of the report of another psychiatrist (a resident of Los Angeles) who had concluded in 1956 that defendant had suffered from amnesia. The trial court explained that if defendant wanted the Los Angeles psychiatrist\u2019s testimony he should have called him as a witness. Defendant said, <em>\u201cI </em>would like to do that, \u2019 \u2019 but he did not do so, although the appearance of other persons from Los Angeles who were subpoenaed as witnesses on defendant\u2019s behalf shows that defendant was not denied the opportunity to obtain the testimony of out-of-county witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8Cz\">The court of its own motion diligently sought to protect defendant when he insisted upon bringing out his entire past record of involvement with the law. When, at defendant\u2019s invitation, the prosecuting attorney inquired about prior convictions on other charges similar to the principal offenses for which defendant was being tried, defendant explained that he had \u201cmade deals\u201d with the prosecuting attorneys and judges whereby, in return for defendant\u2019s pleas of guilty, some charges were reduced and others were dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AST\">After the jury found against defendant on his plea of not guilty, he asked to withdraw his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. The court permitted defendant to do so only after it had fully advised him of his right to be tried on the insanity issue and had expressly found, on the basis of its own observation and of reports of the court-appointed psychiatrists who had examined defendant, that defendant had the capacity to withdraw the plea.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b811-9\">\u201cGenerally speaking, \u2018when the public defender is appointed to represent a defendant accused of a crime, he becomes the attorney for said defendant for all purposes of the ease and to the same extent as if regularly retained and employed by the defendant.\u2019 <em>(In re Hough </em>(1944), 24 Cal.2d 522, 528-529 [150 P.2d 448].) \u201d <em>(In re Atchley </em>(1957), 48 Cal.2d 408, 418 [3] [310 P.2d 15] ; see <em>In re Burroughs </em>(1957), 148 Cal.App.2d 800, 810 [2] [307 P.2d 709].)

In this connection we repeat and reemphasize the statement which we quoted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Chesser, supra, </em>p. 822 of 29 Cal.2d, from <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, supra, </em>p. 465 of 304 U.S.: <em>\u201cWhether there is a proper waiver should be clearly determined by the</em></p>\n<p id=\"ASu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>trial court, and it would he fitting and appropriate for that determination to appear upon the </em>record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAG\">In this connection it is noted that the California Legislature, recognizing that the appellate courts often had occasion to consider the contention that a plea of guilty implied a waiver of counsel and to emphasize that such waiver should not be accepted unless it is understanding^ made, in 1949 amended section 1018 of the Penal Code to provide that \"No plea of guilty of a felony for which the maximum punishment is death, or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, shall be received from a defendant who does not appear with counsel, nor shall any plea of guilty of any other felony be accepted from any defendant who does not appear with counsel unless the court shall first fully inform him of his right to counsel and unless the court shall find that the defendant understands his right to counsel and freely waives it,\u201d and by a 1951 amendment added to the foregoing sentence the following clause: \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>and then, only if the defendant has expressly stated in open court, to the court, that he does not wish to be represented by counsel.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6068: \u201cIt is the duty of an attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-9\">\u201c (a) To support the Constitution and laws of the United States and of this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-10\">\u201c (b) To maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-11\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>(e) To counsel or maintain such actions, proceedings or defenses only as appear to him legal or just, except the defense of a person charged with a public offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-12\">\u201c (d) To employ, for the purpose of maintaining the causes confided to him such means only as are consistent with truth, and never to seek to mislead the judge or any judicial officer by an artifice or false statement of fact or law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-13\">\u201c (e) To maintain inviolate the confidence, and at every peril to himself to preserve the secrets, of his client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-14\">\u201c(f) To abstain from all offensive personality, and to advance no fact prejudicial to the honor or reputation of a party or witness, unless required by the justice of the cause with which he is charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-15\">\u201c(g) Not to encourage either the commencement or the continuance of an action or proceeding from any corrupt motive of passion or interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-16\">\u201c(h) Never to reject, for any consideration personal to himself, the cause of the defenseless or the oppressed. <em>\u2019 \u2019</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b819-9\">E.g., at preliminary federal proceedings before a committing magistrate a defendant who is unable to employ counsel is not entitled to assigned counsel. (Fed. Bules Crim. Proc. prescribed by the United States Supreme Court, 327 U.S. 825 et seq., 18 U.S.O.A., 1951 ed., rule 5 (b), rule 40 (b) (2), and note 2 of Advisory Committee on the Buies to rule 44.) The California magistrate, on the other hand, must assign counsel at the preliminary examination if defendant desires and is unable to employ counsel. (Pen. Code, $ 859.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">E.g., in preliminary federal proceedings an accused is not entitled to assignment of counsel but he is entitled to employ counsel. (Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., cited <em>ante, </em>footnote 7.) And in a state prosecution federal due process accords defendant the \u201cunqualified\u201d right to be heard through his own counsel <em>(In re Groban </em>(1957), 352 U.S. 330, 332 [77 S.Ct. 510, 1 L.Ed.2d 376]; <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Fretag </em>(1954), 348 U.S. 3, 9 [75 S.Ot. 1, 99 L.Ed. 4]), whereas a state\u2019s failure to furnish the services of an attorney to a defendant who is unable to employ his own counsel is not a denial of federal due process unless it leads to \u201cfundamental unfairness\u201d <em>(Uveges </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1948), <em>supra, </em>335 U.S. 437, 440-441; <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Brady </em>(1942), <em>supra, </em>316 U.S. 455, 473).</p>\n<p id=\"A2G\">In this state there is a similar difference between the right to employ counsel on appeal and the right to be furnished counsel on appeal, although such difference has little practical effect. The convicted California defendant, without a showing of probable cause, has a right of appeal if the prescribed procedural steps are timely taken. But the appellate court need not appoint counsel for the indigent defendant except where its independent investigation of the record shows that such</p>\n<p id=\"Apf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>appointment would be helpful to defendant or the court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hyde </em>(1918), 51 Cal.2d 152, 154 [1] [331 P.2d 42]); see <em>Caritativo </em>v. <em>California </em>(1958), 356 U.S. 971 [78 S.Ct. 1133] [after the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari in a death penalty, <em>forma pauperis </em>case, and after counsel had briefed and argued the ease for petitioner, counsel\u2019s request for his own appointment was denied by minute order \u201cfor lack of a timely showing of a need for such appointment\u201d]). Private counsel, on the other hand, so long as he complies with the procedural rules, can brief and argue an appeal which is a waste of time and substance for defendant, the People, and the court. But the court can dismiss, as irregular, sham, or frivolous, an appeal which has no proper appellate objective <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shorts </em>(1948), 32 Cal.2d 502, 516 [2b] [197 P.2d 330]) and the attorney who prosecutes such an appeal can be disciplined (Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 13; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6077).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
