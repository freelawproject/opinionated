Bids had to be submitted before 8 p. m. Plaintiff testified that it was customary in that area for general contractors to receive the bids of subcontractors by telephone on the day set for bidding and to rely on them in computing their own bids. Thus on that day plaintiff\u2019s secretary, Mrs. Johnson, received by telephone between 50 and 75 subcontractors\u2019 bids for various parts of the school job. As each bid came in, she wrote it on a special form, which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>brought into plaintiff\u2019s office. He then posted it on a master cost sheet setting forth the names and bids of all subcontractors. His own bid had to include the names of subcontractors who were to perform one-half of one per cent or more of the construction work, and he had also to provide a bidder\u2019s bond of 10 per cent of his total bid of $317,385 as a guarantee that he would enter the contract if awarded the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Late in the afternoon, Mrs. Johnson had a telephone conversation with Kenneth R. Hoon, an estimator for defendant. He gave his name and telephone number and stated that he was bidding for defendant for the paving work at the. Monte Vista School according to plans and specifications and that his bid was $7,131.60. At Mrs. Johnson\u2019s request he repeated his bid. Plaintiff listened to the bid over an extension telephone in his office and posted it on the master sheet after receiving the bid form from Mrs. Johnson. Defendant\u2019s was the lowest bid for the paving. Plaintiff computed his own bid accordingly and submitted it with the name of defendant as the subcontractor for the paving. When the bids were opened on July 28th, plaintiff\u2019s proved to be the lowest, and he was awarded the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">On his way to Los Angeles the next morning plaintiff stopped at defendant\u2019s office. The first person he met was defendant\u2019s construction engineer, Mr. Oppenheimer. Plaintiff testified: \u201cI introduced myself and he immediately told me that they had made a mistake in their bid to me the night before, they couldn\u2019t do it for the price they had bid, and I told him I would expect him to carry through with their original bid because I had used it in compiling my bid and the job was being awarded them. And I would have to go and do the job according to my bid and I would expect them to do the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Defendant refused to do the paving work for less than $15,000. Plaintiff testified that he \u201cgot figures from other people\u201d and after trying for several months to get as low a bid as possible engaged L &amp; H Paving Company, a firm in Lancaster, to do the work for $10,948.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The trial court found on substantial evidence that defendant made a definite offer to do the paving on the Monte Vista job according to the plans and specifications for $7,131.60, and that plaintiff relied on defendant\u2019s bid in computing his own bid for the school job and naming defendant therein as the subcontractor for the paving work. Accordingly, it entered judgment for plaintiff in the amount of $3,817 (the differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>enee between defendant\u2019s bid and the cost of the paving to plaintiff) plus costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Defendant contends that there was no enforceable contract between the parties on the ground that it made a revocable offer and revoked it before plaintiff communicated his acceptance to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">There is no evidence that defendant offered to make its bid irrevocable in exchange for plaintiff\u2019s use of its figures in computing his bid. Nor is there evidence that would warrant interpreting plaintiff\u2019s use of defendant\u2019s bid as the acceptance thereof, binding plaintiff, on condition he received the main contract, to award the subcontract to defendant. In sum, there was neither an option supported by consideration nor a bilateral contract binding on both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Plaintiff contends, however, that he relied to his detriment on defendant\u2019s offer and that defendant must therefore answer in damages for its refusal to perform. Thus the question is squarely presented: Did plaintiff\u2019s reliance make defendant\u2019s offer irrevocable ?</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Section 90 of the Restatement of Contracts states: \u201cA promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. \u2019 \u2019 This rule applies in this state. <em>(Edmonds </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>40 Cal.2d 642 [255 P.2d 772]; <em>Frebank Co. </em>v. <em>White, </em>152 Cal.App.2d 522 [313 P.2d 633] ; <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Markwell &amp; Co., </em>118 Cal.App.2d 410 [258 P.2d 497, 37 A.L.R.2d 1363] ; <em>West </em>v. <em>Hunt Foods, Inc., </em>101 Cal.App.2d 597 [225 P.2d 978] <em>; Hunter </em>v. <em>Sparling, </em>87 Cal.App.2d 711 [197 P.2d 807] ; see 18 Cal.Jur.2d 407-408; 5 Stan. L. Rev. 783.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Defendant\u2019s offer constituted a promise to perform on such conditions as were stated expressly or by implication therein or annexed thereto by operation of law. (See 1 Williston, Contracts [3d ed.], \u00a7 24A, p. 56, \u00a761, p. 196.) Defendant had reason to expect that if its bid proved the lowest it would be used by plaintiff. It induced \u201caction . . . of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Had defendant\u2019s bid expressly stated or clearly implied that it was revocable at any time before acceptance we would treat it accordingly. It was silent on revocation, however, and we must therefore determine whether there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>conditions to the right of revocation imposed by law or reasonably inferable in fact. In the analogous problem of an offer for a unilateral contract, the theory is now obsolete that the offer is revocable at any time before complete performance. Thus section 45 of the Restatement of Contracts provides: \u201cIf an offer for a unilateral contract is made, and part of the consideration requested in the offer is given or tendered by the offeree in response thereto, the offeror is bound by a contract, the duty of immediate performance of which is conditional on the full consideration being given or tendered within the time stated in the offer, or, if no time is stated therein, within a reasonable time.\u201d In explanation, comment 6 states that the \u201cmain offer includes as a subsidiary promise, necessarily implied, that if part of the requested performance is given, the offeror will not revoke his offer, and that if tender is made it will be accepted. Part performance or tender may thus furnish consideration for the subsidiary promise. Moreover, merely acting in justifiable reliance on an offer may in some cases serve as sufficient reason for making a promise binding (see \u00a7 90).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Whether implied in fact or law, the subsidiary promise serves to preclude the injustice that would result if the offer could be revoked after the offeree had acted in detrimental reliance thereon. [Reasonable reliance resulting in a foreseeable prejudicial change in position affords a compelling basis also for implying a subsidiary promise not to revoke an offer for a bilateral contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The absence of consideration is not fatal to the enforcement of such a promise. It is true that in the ease of unilateral contracts the Restatement finds consideration for the implied subsidiary promise in the part performance of the bargained-for exchange, but its reference to section 90 makes clear that consideration for such a promise is not always necessary. The very purpose of section 90 is to make a promise binding even though there was no consideration \u201cin the sense of something that is bargained for and given in exchange.\u201d (See 1 Corbin, Contracts 634 et seq.) Reasonable reliance serves to hold the offeror in lieu of the consideration ordinarily required to make the offer binding. In a ease involving similar facts the Supreme Court of South Dakota stated that \u201cwe believe that reason and justice demand that the doctrine [of section 90] be applied to the present facts. We cannot believe that by accepting this doctrine as controlling in the state of facts before us we will abolish the requirement of a consideration in contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>cases, in any different sense than an ordinary estoppel abolishes some legal requirement in its application. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the defendants in executing the agreement [which was not supported by consideration] made a promise which they should have reasonably expected would induce the plaintiff to submit a bid based thereon to the Government, that such promise did induce this action, and that injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.\u201d <em>(Northwestern Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>Ellerman, </em>69 S.D. 397, 408 [10 N.W.2d 879] ; see also <em>Robert Gordon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co., </em>117 F.2d 654, 661; <em>cf. James Baird Co. </em>v. <em>Gimbel Bros., </em>64 F.2d 344.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">When plaintiff used defendant\u2019s offer in computing his own bid, he bound himself to perform in reliance on defendant\u2019s terms-. Though defendant did not bargain for this use of its bid neither did defendant make it idly, indifferent to whether it would be used or not. On the contrary it is reasonable to suppose that defendant submitted its bid to obtain the subcontract. It was bound to realize the substantial possibility that its bid would be the lowest, and that it would be included by-plaintiff in his bid. It was to its own interest that the contractor be awarded the general contract; the lower the subcontract bid, the lower the general contractor\u2019s bid was likely to be and the greater its chance of acceptance and hence the greater defendant\u2019s chance of getting the paving subcontract. Defendant had reason not only to expect plaintiff to rely on its bid but to want him to. Clearly defendant had a stake in plaintiff\u2019s reliance on its bid. Given this interest and the fact that plaintiff is bound by his own bid, it is only fair that plaintiff should have at least an opportunity to accept defendant\u2019s bid after the general contract has been awarded to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">It bears noting that a general contractor is not free to delay acceptance after he has been awarded the general contract in the hope of getting a better price. Nor can he reopen bargaining with the subcontractor and at the same time claim a continuing right to accept the original offer. (See <em>R. J. Daum Const. Co. </em>v. <em>Child, </em>122 Utah 194 [247 P.2d 817, 823].) In the present case plaintiff promptly informed defendant that plaintiff was being awarded the job and that the subcontract was being awarded to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Defendant contends, however, that its bid was the result of mistake and that it was therefore entitled to revoke it. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>relies on the rescission eases of <em>M. F. Kemper Const. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>37 Cal.2d 696 [235 P.2d 7], and <em>Brunzell Const. Co. </em>v. G. <em>J. Weisbrod, Inc., </em>134 Cal.App.2d 278 [285 P.2d 989], (See also <em>Lemoge Electric </em>v. <em>San Mateo County, </em>46 Cal.2d 659, 662 [297 P.2d 638].) In those eases, however, the bidder\u2019s mistake was known or should have been to the offeree, and the offeree could be placed in status quo.  Of course, if plaintiff had reason to believe that defendant\u2019s bid was in error, he could not justifiably rely on it, and section 90 would afford no basis for enforcing it. <em>(Robert Gordon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co., </em>117 F.2d 654, 660.) Plaintiff, however, had no reason to know that defendant had made a mistake in submitting its bid, since there was usually a variance of 160 per cent between the highest and lowest bids for paving in the desert around Lancaster. He committed himself to performing the main contract in reliance on defendant\u2019s figures. Under these circumstances defendant\u2019s mistake, far from relieving it of its obligation, constitutes an additional reason for enforcing it, for it misled plaintiff as to the cost of doing the paving. Even had it been clearly understood that defendant\u2019s offer was revocable until accepted, it would not necessarily follow that defendant had no duty to exercise reasonable care in preparing its bid. It presented its bid with knowledge of the substantial possibility that it would be used by plaintiff; it could foresee the harm that would ensue from an erroneous underestimate of the cost. Moreover, it was motivated by its own business interest. Whether or not these considerations alone would justify recovery for negligence had the case been tried on that theory (see <em>Biakanja </em>v. <em>Irving, </em>49 Cal.2d 647, 650 [320 P.2d 16]), they are persuasive that defendant\u2019s mistake should not defeat recovery under the rule of section 90 of the Restatement of Contracts.  As between the subcontractor who made the bid and the general contractor who reasonably relied on it, the loss resulting from the mistake should fall on the party who caused it.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\"><em>Leo F. Piazza Paving Co. </em>v. <em>Bebek &amp; Brkich, </em>141 Cal.App. 2d 226 [296 P.2d 368], and <em>Bard </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>19 Cal.2d 449 [122 P.2d 8, 139], are not to the contrary. In the Piazza ease the court sustained a finding that defendants intended, not to make a firm bid, but only to give the plaintiff \u201csome kind of an idea to use\u201d in making its bid; there was evidence that the defendants had told plaintiff they were unsure of the significance of the specifications. There was thus no offer, promise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>or representation on which the defendants should reasonably have expected the plaintiff to rely. The Bard case held that an option not supported by consideration was revoked by the death of the optionor. The issue of recovery under the rule of section 90 was not pleaded at the trial, and it does not appear that the offeree\u2019s reliance was \u201cof a definite and substantial character\u201d so that injustice could be avoided \u201conly by the enforcement of the promise. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">There is no merit in defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiff failed to state a cause of action, on the ground that the complaint failed to allege that plaintiff attempted to mitigate the damages or that they could not have been mitigated. Plaintiff alleged that after defendant\u2019s default, \u201cplaintiff had to procure the services of the L &amp; H Co. to perform said asphaltic paving for the sum of $10,948.60.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s uncontradicted evidence showed that he spent several months trying to get bids from other subcontractors and that he took the lowest bid. Clearly he acted reasonably to mitigate damages.  In any event any uncertainty in plaintiff\u2019s allegation as to damages could have been raised by special demurrer. (Code Civ. Proe., \u00a7 430, subd. 9.) It was not so raised and was therefore waived. (Code Civ. Proe., \u00a7 434.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Schauer, J., Spence, J., and McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
