The ease has now been tried four times and this appeal is from the judgment entered after the fourth trial. <em>(Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 615 [254 P.2d 919] ; <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>45 Cal.2d 804 [291 P.2d 25, 55 A.L.R.2d 1385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In May, 1944, Nick, Ernest and Charles Vangel, brothers, entered into an agreement for the purchase and operation of a 360-acre citrus ranch. The agreement provided that title was to be taken in the individual names of the three brothers, each of whom was to contribute his pro rata share of the purchase price and each to own a one-third interest in the ranch. The purchase of the ranch was consummated for $340,000, with a down payment of $120,000. Charles was unable to pay his full share of the down payment and borrowed $25,000 from Nick and Ernest to make up his share of $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">After operations had commenced a dispute arose among the brothers which culminated in an action by Nick and Ernest to dissolve the partnership. Inasmuch as our decision here must necessarily turn upon a construction of the opinion rendered by the District Court of Appeal in <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 615 [254 P.2d 919], and by this court on December 23, 1955, we will set forth in some detail the pertinent portions thereof. Unless otherwise noted, the emphasis is here added. In <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>45 Cal.2d 804, 806, 807, 808, 809, 810 [291 P.2d 25, 55 A.L.R.2d 1385], we held: \u201cBy the prior judgment, a dissolution was decreed effective as of June 15, 1950. The court found that Charles wrongfully caused the dissolution and concluded that Nick and Ernest were privileged to purchase his interest. The value of the ranch was fixed at $235,000, and a finding was made as to the value of Charles\u2019 interest in the partnership. According to another finding, he was entitled to participate in profits accruing between the date of dissolution and January 1, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u201cUpon the prior appeal <em>[Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>116 Cal.App. 2d 615 (254 P.2d 919)], findings as to the value of the ranch property and Charles \u2019 fault in causing the dissolution were approved. <em>It was held that the trial judge properly allowed the plaintiffs to purchase Charles\u2019 interest, hut that he erred in failing to include certain items in his valuation of it. </em>Furthermore, said the District Court of Appeal, <em>the right of Charles to participate in profits accumulated by joint use of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>the partnership assets should not have been terminated as of January 1, 1951. That period, it was determined, should extend so as to include the proceeds from fruit substantially matured and soon ready for marketing, </em>the final date to be left to the sound judgment of the chancellor. As to those matters, the judgment was reversed with directions for an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u201cThe amounts of profits from the operation of the ranch after dissolution of the partnership and of set-offs, claims and advances, as determined upon the retrial, are not now disputed. The value of Charles\u2019 interest in the partnership at the time of dissolution based upon those amounts, <em>was found to be 23.96 per cent </em>of the partnership net worth. <em>The court also declared that Charles is entitled to that percentage of the profits from the operation of the ranch accruing between the date of dissolution and the winding up of the partnership affairs. </em>Another finding is that \u2018whatever services defendant may have rendered toward the conduct of the partnership affairs, from the date of the dissolution of the partnership . . . was voluntary on his part and against the wishes and directions of the plaintiffs. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\u201cThe judgment gives Nick and Ernest, <em>inter alia, </em>the right to purchase Charles\u2019 interest in the partnership for its value as determined at the retrial, <em>plus interest on that amount from September 8, 1953. </em>Charles is allowed 23.96 per cent of the profits accruing prior to that date and the same percentage of certain proceeds from sales of crops. <em>He is denied any wages for services performed after the dissolution of the partnership </em>and must pay 23.96 per cent of the audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">\u201cCharles contends that the trial judge erred in his computations of the values at the time of the dissolution, of the respective partnership interests and of the partners\u2019 shares of the profits accruing between dissolution and the winding up of the partnership affairs. He also challenges the finding that his post-dissolution services were \u2018voluntary\u2019 and \u2018against the wishes and directions of the plaintiffs\u2019 as being without support in the evidence. Finally, he contends that he should not have been taxed any of the costs of conducting the audit upon the retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">\u201cWith regard to the value of the partnership interests, Charles argues that the trial judge erred in including in the partners\u2019 capital accounts items which properly are personal obligations of the partners <em>inter sese. </em>He objects particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>to the inclusion of an item of $25,000, advanced to him by the other partners upon the purchase of the ranch, and another one of $42,000, which his brothers assertedly withdrew improperly from partnership funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u201cUpon the former appeal, however, it was held that these items were, respectively, an obligation owing to the partnership and a distribution of profits. By including those items in his computations of the values of the partners\u2019 interests in the partnership, the trial judge followed the mandate of the District Court of Appeal: \u2018In ascertaining such interest not only is the value of the ranch to be considered as of that date [June 15, 1950] as well as other capital assets, liabilities and expenses, but also the claims which the partnership had against the brothers <em>and their set-offs among themselves </em>should have been computed as of June 15, 1950, with interest to that time. \u2019 (Emphasis added, 116 Cal.App.2d 629-630.) The court further said \u2018in determining the respective financial interests in the partnership business as of that date consideration must be given to the $25,000 which plaintiffs advanced for defendant, and to the $42,000 which plaintiffs improperly withheld and distributed, together with interest on said sums to date of dissolution. All other assets and liabilities of the partnership, together with any claims of the parties <em>inter se, </em>must be included in the ascertainment of the respective interests of the plaintiffs and the defendant. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u201cIn attacking the portion of the judgment limiting him to 23.96 per cent of the post-dissolution profits, Charles has presented several theories as justifying a larger amount. <em>It is unnecessary to consider all of them, however, because the computation of his share was made upon an erroneous basis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u201cUpon the former appeal it was held that the trial judge was correct in concluding that the partnership had been dissolved by reason of Charles\u2019 breach of the partnership agreement and that the remaining partners had exercised their privilege of continuing the partnership business. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15038, subd. (2b).) In that situation, Charles was entitled to have computed the value of his interest in the partnership, exclusive of his share of the good will of the business, and less any damages caused to his copartners. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15038, subd. (2e II).) For the use of his partnership assets in the continuing business, pending a settlement of the accounts, he was entitled to receive \u2018as an ordinary creditor an amount equal to the value of his interest in the dissolved partnership with interest, or, at his option ... in lieu of interest, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>profits <em>attributable to the use of his right in the property </em>of the dissolved partnership. \u2019 (Emphasis added; Corp. Code, \u00a7 15042.) Said the District Court of Appeal, <em>\u2018From the position defendant has taken on this appeal it is fair to say that he has elected to take profits rather than interest on the value of his share of the partnership.\u2019 </em>(116 Cal.App.2d 629.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u201cThe record presents the rather unusual situation of a partner, expelled from the partnership for cause and by judicial decree, continuing to participate with his former partners in the operation and management of the business. Charles contends that he is entitled to receive compensation for services so performed. In reply, his brothers rely upon the finding that his post-dissolution services were voluntary and against their wishes. However, the evidence does not support that finding. It appears that Charles continued to participate in the business in substantially the same manner as before the action for dissolution. There is no evidence of any protest by his brothers. On the contrary, they appear to have acquiesced fully in his continuing services.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\u201cSection 15042 of the Corporations Code fixes the right of one retired from a partnership for cause, or the personal representative of a deceased partner, to recover compensation for the use of his assets in the continuing business pending an accounting. In such case, he is entitled to \u2018the profits attributable to the use of his right in the property.\u2019 As a practical matter, his share of the profits usually is computed on the basis of the ratio that his share of the partnership assets bears to the whole of them. [Citations.] However, that division may not be equitable when the contribution to profits from capital is relatively minor in comparison to the contribution from the skills or services of one conducting the business. In such a case, the managing partner may be entitled to a greater share of the profits. [Citations.] Although such a method of dividing profits is usually spoken of in terms of providing extra compensation for the managing ex-partner, in reality it merely reflects the statutory requirement that the retired or deceased partner be allowed the profits attributable to his right in the assets used in the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">\u201cNo California case considers the right to compensation for services in a continuing business of one whose fault has caused the dissolution of the partnership. The authorities in other jurisdiction are in conflict. [Citations.] Those which deny recovery generally proceed upon a theory similar to the unclean hands principle; most of the decisions which allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>recovery are based upon the principle that one who seeks equity must do equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\n<em>\u201cIn the present case the balance of the equities favors the allowance of compensation based upon services rendered,. The type of operation here shown is one which involves a considerable amount of service and shill in the cultivation and harvesting of a citrus crop. Furthermore, it would be inequitable to deny Charles compensation for his services when his brothers acquiesced in them.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\u201cThe respondents [plaintiffs] take the position, however, that the requirement that profits be apportioned according to the values of the partnership interests without compensation to Charles for his post-dissolution services is the law of the case as established in <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, supra. </em>It is unnecessary to pass upon this contention. \u2018The doctrine of the law of the case is recognized as a harsh one . . . and the modern view is that it should not be adhered to when the application of it results in a manifestly unjust decision. \u2019 <em>(England </em>v. <em>Hospital of Good Samaritan, </em>14 Cal.2d 791, 795 [97 P.2d 813].) Even if the decision upon the former appeal be construed as limiting the apportionment of profits in the manner suggested, it would be unjust to do so, and the decision should not be followed to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\"><em>\u201cThe judgment, insofar as it determines the value of the partnership interests and the total amount of post-dissolution profits to be distributed among the ex-partners, is based upon findings which are supported by substantial evidence. However, those profits are divided solely upon the basis of the relative values of the partners\u2019 interests in the partnership property. The amount of profits attributable to the use of Charles\u2019 share of the assests </em>[sic] <em>and also those allocable to his services in the continuing business should have been considered in the apportionment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">\u201cNo error is shown in the award of costs. A proceeding to dissolve and liquidate a partnership is controlled by equitable principles [citations] and the trial judge has a broad discretion in fixing costs [citations].</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\"><em>\u201cThe judgment is reversed with directions to the trial court to determine, in accordance with this opinion, the respective share of the profits to which each partner is entitled. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed. </em>The costs upon this appeal shall be divided equally between the appellant and the respondents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Summary of Directions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">We Held (in addition to what had theretofore been adjudicated) :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">1.

It was provided that because of a stipulation entered into between the parties, defendant was to pay 23.96 per cent of $1,950 charged by an accountant employed by the parties. (Finding VIII.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">Charles contends that the trial court erred in terminating his right to profits as of May 12, 1953. In subheading 4, just set forth, we pointed out that Finding IV is to the effect that Judge Vicker\u2019s finding of the terminal date as May 12, 1953, was affirmed by this court. There is no such affirmation. In commenting upon the decision of the District Court of Appeal in <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 615 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>[254 P.2d 919], we said that Charles\u2019 right to participate in post-dissolution profits \u201cshould not have been terminated as of January 1, 1951. That period, it was determined, should extend so as to include the proceeds from fruit substantially matured and soon ready for marketing, the final date to be left to the sound judgment of the chancellor.\u201d <em>(Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>45 Cal.2d 804, 806 [291 P.2d 25, 55 A.L.R2d 1385].) In a memorandum ruling signed February 4, 1957, by Judge Clarence M. Hanson it is stated: \u201cThe findings of Judge Vickers, carried into the judgment he rendered, granted to the defendant 23.96 per cent of the value of the partnership property ($235,000) as of the date of dissolution on June 15, 1950, plus 23.96 per cent of the post-dissolution profits from June 15, 1950, to and including the 1953 crops harvested and unharvested on May 12, 1953, but as he did not include anything for the services rendered by the defendant from June 15, 1950, to that date, the judgment was reversed with instructions to ascertain the amount. <em>The Supreme Court did not suggest that the cut-off date was to be May 12, 1953, but that is probably what it had in mind. However, if a later date should be proper, as the defendant contends, it may not in any event go beyond November 10, 1953. </em>...\u201d The memorandum opinion then sets forth part of an affidavit signed by Charles wherein he states he has done no work on the ranch subsequent to November 10, 1953. November 10, 1953, was apparently the date judgment was entered after the third trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In the alternative, Charles argues that if he is not entitled to a share of the profits subsequent to May 12, 1953, that he is entitled to interest on the balance due him as of that date. Section 15042 of the Corporations Code provides that a partner in Charles\u2019 position is entitled to \u201can amount equal to the value of his interest in the dissolved partnership\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cIn lieu of interest the profits attributable to the use of his right in the property of the dissolved partnership.\u201d The District Court of Appeal noted (116 Cal.App.2d 629) that \u201cFrom the position defendant has taken on this appeal it is fair to say that <em>he has elected to take profits rather than interest on the value of his share of the </em>partnership.\u201d (See also <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>45 Cal.2d 804, 808 [291 P.2d 25, 55 A.L.R. 2d 1385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">By Charles\u2019 own admission, he performed no services after November 10, 1953, the date on which the trial court terminated any right to compensation for services. He does argue that his services had been found, on a prior trial, to be worth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>$750 per month, as compared with the $200 per month awarded him on the instant trial. It is sufficient to note that new evidence was adduced at the trial, the judgment of which is now under consideration, and that there is ample evidence in the record to substantiate the trial court\u2019s finding that Charles\u2019 services were worth $200 per month, or a total amount of $8,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Charles argues, as he has done before, that the 23.96 per cent figure is incorrect and seeks to relitigate the disposition of the two items of $25,000 and $42,000 which were discussed at length in <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 615, 629-630 [254 P.2d 919], and in <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>45 Cal.2d 804, 807 [291 P.2d 25, 55 A.L.R2d 1385], We did not say, in the latter ease, that the 23.96 per cent figure was incorrect because of the disposition of the two amounts, but that Charles \u2019 share of the post-dissolution profits was incorrect because his right to compensation had not been taken into consideration. There is no merit to this contention inasmuch as the matter is res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">There is no merit to Charles \u2019 contention that the trial court erred in applying the provisions of section 15038, subdivision (2b) of the Corporations Code. This was held to be correct and proper in <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 615, 628 [254 P.2d 919], and reaffirmed by this court in <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>45 Cal.2d 804, 808 [291 P.2d 25, 55 A.L.R. 2d 1385].</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">There is no merit to Charles \u2019 contention that he is entitled to share in what he claims is the present value of the ranch, the sum of $2,000,000. His claim is based on his argument that because of the location of the ranch it <em>will </em>have that value for subdivision purposes. In <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 615, 633 [254 P.2d 919], the court noted that the valuation of $235,000 placed on the ranch by the trial court at the date of dissolution of the partnership was \u201cdefinitive of that question.\u201d Furthermore, section 15042 of the Corporations Code provides that the retiring partner\u2019s interest <em>\u201cat the date of </em>dissolution\u201d shall be ascertained. (See <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 615, 627, 628, 629 [254 P.2d 919].)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Plaintiffs argue that the sum of $38,090.45 ($37,440.45 plus $650 interest) has been available to Charles since September 10,1953. This statement is substantiated by the record. Charles\u2019 Exhibit \u201cA,\u201d the Pritkin, Finkel and Company Accountants\u2019 Report, page 2, shows such deposits in escrow to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Charles \u2019 account. Plaintiffs also point out that the amount of the judgment ($67,115.68) after the fourth trial, has been in escrow since May 3, 1953. The record shows (Charles\u2019 Exhibit \u201cA\u201d) that from the $38,090.45 deposited in September, 1953, Charles has withdrawn the sum of $6,982.10. The record also shows (as reflected in the findings) that Charles had made other withdrawals in the sum of $75,017.35<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It was then found that Charles had a balance due him of $58,915.68 plus the sum of $8,200 as compensation for his services, making a total due Charles of $67,115.68, which has been deposited in escrow to Charles\u2019 account since May, 1957. It appears to us that the trial court correctly carried out the mandate of the District Court of Appeal and that of this court and that there has been no error. After the amounts due Charles as his original share of the partnership assets had been deposited to his order, it is obvious that no profits were due him from the use of such assets. Charles\u2019 interest in the real property had been adjudged to be $37,440.45; his interest as of June 15,1950 (the date of dissolution), is shown by his Exhibit \u201cA\u201d to be $48,600.55; his share of the post-dissolution profits from June 15, 1950 to May 12, 1953, as shown by Charles' Exhibit \u201cA\u201d amount to $45,849.39; and his share of the profits on the 1952-1953 crop which was apparently harvested by October 13, 1953, amount to $9,024.74, or a total balance of $140,915.13. Charles\u2019 withdrawals from this amount have been heretofore set forth. It will be recalled that in <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 615, 630 [254 P.2d 919], it was held that Charles should be entitled to his share of the proceeds of a \u201ccrop substantially matured and soon ready for market. While no formula or precise definition can be laid down to determine when such fruit has substantially matured, this determination can properly be left to the sound judgment of the chancellor.\u201d As heretofore noted, there was no petition for hearing after that decision, and our opinion in <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Vangel, </em>45 Cal.2d 804 [291 P.2d 25, 55 A.L.R.2d 1385], did not disturb that holding. While we did not, as found by the trial court during this trial, approve May 12, 1953, as a \u201ccut-off\u201d date, we did not hold otherwise and reversed only for the purpose of allowing Charles compensation for his post-dissolution managerial efforts on behalf of the partnership. Since the trial court has here, in its sound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>judgment, aided by the reports of several qualified accountants determined that Charles \u2019 interests are as have been heretofore set forth, and since there has been no judicial error, there appears to be no reason to disturb its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">From what has just been said it is clear that there is no merit to Charles\u2019 contention that his right to participate in the partnership profits should not have been terminated as of May 12, 1953, since it appears from the record that he was allowed profits on the 1952-1953 crop to October 13, 1953, which would be the latest date that any profits could have accrued from his interest in the partnership real property. As heretofore set forth, Charles\u2019 share of the value of the partnership real property was deposited in escrow to his account on September 10, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Charles also argues that he cannot be put to an election between interest and profits until the amount due him has been finally settled. This argument stems from the statement made by the District Court of Appeal, 116 Cal.App.2d 615, 630, that since the accounts of the partnership had not been \u201cproperly settled . ... he was not required to accept the offer made to purchase his share after the rendition of final judgment, since the accounting should have proceeded \u2018upon different principles than did the accounting which was actually taken.\u2019 <em>(Nuland </em>v. <em>Pruyn, supra </em>[99 Cal.App.2d 603 (222 P.2d 261)]).\u201d The same court pointed out, however, that \u201cFrom the position defendant has taken on this appeal it is fair to say <em>that he has elected to talce profits rather than interest on the value of his share </em>in the partnership.\u201d (116 Cal.App.2d 615, 629.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Charles also claims that he is entitled to interest on the amount found to be due him until that amount is either paid, or made available to him. From what has been heretofore said it is obvious that there is no merit to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Traynor, J., Schauer, J., Spence, J., and MeComb, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-6\">It appears from a letter written by Judge Hanson, dated April 11, 1957, to the attorneys of record, that defendant Charles had received this sum directly from the partnership.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
