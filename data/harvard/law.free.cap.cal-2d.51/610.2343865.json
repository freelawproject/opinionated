Consequently it related to enforcement of the judgment and was appealable as a \u201cspecial order made after final judgment.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 963.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">Defendant and plaintiff were formerly husband and wife. Plaintiff moved in the trial court \u201cThat an order be made charging defendant\u2019s interest in the partnership of J. H. Baum &amp; Sons, as provided in Section 15028[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] of the Corporations Code, with the sum of $1,055 [as accrued alimony] . . . and with the sum of $515 [as accrued child support] . . ., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>said sums being those with which said partnership interest was ordered impressed by order of December 7, 1956 . . .; and so charging said interest with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for services performed in this proceeding . . .; and so directing that a receiver be appointed, and that such lien be foreclosed, and that a sale of said interest be had, all as provided in said Section 15028 of the Corporations Code, and that such other orders be made with respect to said partnership interest as may be proper ...\u201d In plaintiff\u2019s written notice of motion the above motion for a charging order under section 15028 of the Corporations Code was entitled as being one \u2018<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To Appoint a Receiver of, and/or Order a Sale of Defendant\u2019s Partnership Interest, etc. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">By minute order entered September 5, 1957, the court, following argument, denied \u201cplaintiff\u2019s motion to appoint a Receiver and/or order a sale of defendant\u2019s partnership interest, etc. ...\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal recites that she appeals from the September 5 minute order denying her motion \u201cto appoint a receiver of, and/or order a sale of defendant\u2019s interest in the partnership of J. H. Baum &amp; Sons, charging said interest under Section 15028 of the Corporations Code ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">It is thus plain from the record that plaintiff\u2019s appeal is from a denial of her motion seeking a charging order and not merely from an order denying the appointment of a receiver. Defendant\u2019s suggestion that from the fact that, as recited in plaintiff\u2019s motion for a charging order, etc., the court had already ordered defendant\u2019s partnership interest \u201cimpressed\u201d with the sums owing to plaintiff, it follows that a charging order had already been granted and that therefore this appeal is only from an order refusing to appoint a receiver, is without merit.  The court has general power to make a support allowance a lien on property (see <em>Gaston </em>v. <em>Gaston </em>(1896), 114 Cal. 542, 546 [46 P. 609, 55 Am.St.Rep. 786]; 16 Cal.Jur.2d, 527, \u00a7 237, and cases there cited), and no showing has been made that it was not merely in the exercise of such general power that the order was made \u201cimpressing\u201d defendant\u2019s partnership interest in this case.  Further, it appears that an order making support payments a lien upon property does not constitute either the equivalent of a writ of execution (see <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1899), 123 Cal. 445 [56 P. 61] ; <em>Wellborn </em>v. <em>Wellborn </em>(1942), 55 Cal.App.2d 516, 523 [131 P.2d 48]) or of a charging order. As hereinafter shown charging orders on partnership interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>have replaced levies of execution as the remedy for reaching such interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">In <em>Sherwood r. Jackson </em>(1932), 121 Cal.App. 354 [8 P.2d 943], in which a separate judgment creditor had levied execution on defendant\u2019s interest in a partnership and purchased the interest at the execution sale, defendant\u2019s motion to recall the execution and to quash the sale was granted by the trial court. On appeal by plaintiff the order granting the motion was affirmed, with the holding that a separate creditor may no longer levy attachment or execution on a partner\u2019s right in specific partnership property (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15025, subd. (2) (e), formerly Civ. Code, \u00a7 2419) or on his interest in the partnership (see Corp. Code, \u00a7 15024, formerly Civ. Code, \u00a7 2418), but may only, after first obtaining judgment, pursue the statutory remedy of seeking a charging order under section 15028 of the Corporations Code (formerly Civ. Code, \u00a72422).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>However, the order in the Sherwood ease would appear to meet the requirement that to be appealable a \u201cspecial order made after final judgment\u201d must affect the judgment in some manner or relate to its enforcement. (See <em>Imperial Beverage Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1944), 24 Cal.2d 627, 632 [3] [150 P.2d 881]; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1939), 14 Cal.2d 656, 666 [9] [96 P.2d 334]; <em>Lake </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1926), 198 Cal. 85, 89 [3] [243 P. 417] ; <em>McCullough </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1871), 41 Cal. 298, 303; 3 Cal.Jur.2d 497-499, and cases there cited.)  Thus an order under section 685 of the Code of Civil Procedure granting or denying leave to enforce a judgment or to carry it into execution after the lapse of five years (now 10 years; Stats. 1955, chap. 754, p. 1248, \u00a7 2) from the date of its entry is appealable as a special order made after judgment (see <em>Faias </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1933), 133 Cal.App. 525, 529-530 [6, 8] [24 P.2d <em>567]; Belt Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1933), 129 Cal.App. 642, 644 [19 P.2d 25] ; see also the following eases, where no question appears to have been raised as to appealability, <em>Georgison </em>v. <em>Georgison </em>(1954), 43 Cal.2d 550 [275 P.2d 3] ; <em>Di Corpo </em>v. <em>Di Corpo </em>(1948), 33 Cal.2d 195, 197 [200 P.2d 529] <em>; John P. Mills Organization </em>v. <em>Shawmut Corp. </em>(1947), 29 Cal.2d 863 [179 P.2d 570] ; <em>Lohman </em>v. <em>Lohman </em>(1946), 29 Cal.2d 144, 146 [173 P.2d 657]), as is an order vacating an order that the execution issue and recalling it. (See <em>Demons </em>v. <em>Huene </em>(1928), 89 Cal.App. 748, 751-752 [2] [265 P. 389].) Appeals have also been entertained from orders granting or denying motions to recall or quash a writ of execution (see <em>Di Corpo </em>v. <em>Di Corpo </em>(1948), <em>supra, </em>33 Cal.2d 195, <em>197; Cozad </em>v. <em>Raisch Improvement Co. </em>(1929), 208 Cal. 496 [281 P. 1017] ; <em>Hulse </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1927), 200 Cal. 316 [253 P. 136] ; <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Meycrstein </em>(1924), 195 Cal. 37, 39 [231 P. 730]; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1940), 42 Cal.App.2d 19 [108 P.2d 47] ; 19 Cal.Jur.2d 377-378, \u00a7 39), as well as from orders staying the enforcement of judgments, or orders vacating orders staying such enforcement. (See <em>Macario </em>v. <em>Macario </em>(1929), 208 Cal. 601, 603 [283 P. 291] ; <em>Duke </em>v. <em>Levy </em>(1929), 208 Cal. 376, 377 [281P. 496] ; <em>Livermore </em>v. <em>Hodgkins </em>(1880),. 54 Cal. 637; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Bybee </em>(1943), 60 Cal.App.2d 564, 567 [141 P.2d 32] ; 19 Cal.Jur.2d 386-387, \u00a744; 3 Cal.Jur.2d 497-499, \u00a7 61; and eases there cited.)  Thus, it appears that an order made after final judgment which affects enforcement of the judgment, whether such order favors the</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>judgment creditor or the judgment debtor, is appealable.  Therefore an order either granting or denying a judgment creditor\u2019s motion for a charging order under the provisions of section 15028 of the Corporations Code would fall within this class of appealable orders. It follows that insofar as the ground of nonappealability is concerned defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal of plaintiff from the order denying her motion for a charging order, should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Defendant further urges as grounds of his motion to dismiss the appeal \u201cThat from an inspection of the record without extensive study it is clear that no relief can be given to the appellant on this Appeal,\u201d that the \u201cquestions so presented\u201d are \u201cso unsubstantial as not to require the printing of briefs,\u201d that \u201cNo substantial questions of law have been presented upon the record,\u201d and that \u201cThere is no showing upon this record . . . that there has been an abuse of discretion by the Trial Court in denying the motion made for the appointment of a receiver.\u201d These arguments appear to require determination of the matter on its merits rather than to constitute proper grounds for dismissal. We have made \u201can inspection of the record without extensive study,\u201d and have not been convinced that no \u201csubstantial questions\u201d are presented thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Gibson, C.
