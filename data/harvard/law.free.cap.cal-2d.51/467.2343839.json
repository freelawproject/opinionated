The officers contend that the increase became effective on February 1, 1958, as provided in the ordinance. The auditor contends that the California Constitution prevents the salary ordinance from becoming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>effective until after defendants\u2019 terms of office expire on January 5, 1959.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The Constitution provides that \u201cthe compensation of any county, township or municipal officer shall not be increased after his election or during his term of office, ...\u201d (art. XI, \u00a7 5.) This section was amended in 1944 to permit the Legislature to suspend the provision \u201cfor any period during which the United States is engaged in war and for one year after the termination of hostilities therein as proclaimed by the President of the United States. \u2019 \u2019 Pursuant to this amendment, the Legislature suspended the provision during \u201ctime of war\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 53071). \u201cWar\u201d is defined in section 53070 of the Government Code as \u201cthat period of time commencing: (a) When Congress declares war; or (b) When the armed forces of the United States are engaged in active military operations against any foreign power whether or not after war has been formally declared; . . . and ending one year after the termination of hostilities therein as proclaimed by the President of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The trial court found that beginning in 1950 the armed forces of the United States were engaged in active military operations in Korea that constituted \u201chostilities\u201d and a \u201cwar\u201d within the meaning of section 53070, subd. (b); that no proclamation has been issued by the President specifically terminating these hostilities; and that under section 53071, the constitutional prohibition against salary increases is still suspended. The court therefore held that the salary increases were effective February 1, 1958. Plaintiff contends that the termination of hostilities in the Korean conflict has been proclaimed by the President and that therefore the salary increases cannot become effective before January 5, 1959, the expiration date of the terms of office during which the salary ordinance was adopted. We agree with this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">On January 7, 1955, a presidential proclamation fixing the terminal date of eligibility for certain Korean veteran benefits declared that: \u201cWhereas the armistice between the United Nations Command, on the one hand, and the Korean People\u2019s Army and the Chinese People\u2019s Volunteers, on the other hand, effective July 27, 1953, has terminated hostilities in said conflict. . . .\u201d (Pres. Proc. No. 3080, 3 C.F.R. 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>On the same date the President issued Executive Order No. 10585, relating to income tax exemptions of the armed forces, in which he declared that \u201cJanuary 31, 1955, is designated as the date of termination of combatant activities \u2019 \u2019 in the Korean conflict. The fact that the immediate purpose of these declarations was to terminate certain veteran benefits does not make them any the less official public proclamations by the President of the termination of the Korean hostilities. The President could hardly be expected to make such declarations unrelated to some specific purpose simply to declare the termination of a formally undeclared war. (See Pye, <em>The Legal Status of the Korean Hostilities, </em>45 Geo. L. J. 45, 58-59; 27 Atty. Gen. Op. 295.) The United States Court of Military Appeals, relying on the foregoing presidential declarations, has held that for purposes of the military code the hostilities in the Korean conflict were at an end before June 4, 1955: \u201c[Tjaking into consideration all the circumstances existing on June 4, 1955, the date the offense in this case was committed, the inescapable conclusion is that a \u2018time of war\u2019 condition has ended.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>7 U.S.C.M.A. 21, 21 C.M.R. 147, 148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Since the presidential declarations of January 7, 1955, fulfilled the requirements of article XI, section 5 of the Constitution and sections 53070-53071 of the Government Code, the suspension of the provision prohibiting salary increases terminated on January 7, 1956, one year after the presidential declaration of termination of hostilities. It follows that the salary ordinance of December 31, 1957, did not become effective until after defendants\u2019 terms of office expired on January 5, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Carter, J., Schauer, J., Spence, J., and McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Th.e ordinance provides that if the provisions of law prohibit the salary increases from becoming effective on February 1, 1958, they should become effective on January 5, 1959, the date of the expiration of defendants\u2019 terms of office.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
