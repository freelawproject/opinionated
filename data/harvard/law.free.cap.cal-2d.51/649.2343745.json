On February 29, 1956, plaintiff, a licensed real estate broker, and defendant entered into the following contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-12\">\u201cFebruary 29, 1956</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-13\">\u201cMr. Wayland T Leonard</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-14\">Wayland T Leonard Co</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-15\">215 West Sixth St.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-16\">Los Angeles 14 California</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-17\">\u201cDear Mr. Leonard:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-18\">\u201cIn consideration of services rendered and to be rendered you are hereby granted the exclusive right to sell my property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>located at the northeast corner of Wilshire Blvd and Union in Los Angeles and described as Lots 14, 16 and 18 in Block 2 of the Fairview Tract, for a period of three weeks from the date of my signature.

On March 7, 1956, plaintiff ivrote a letter to defendant giving him a list of the parties contacted by him to that date, which list included the name of Morgan Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">iii. On March 8,1956, plaintiff obtained an offer of $200,000 from Gilbert and Rothschild for the property described in the contract, which offer defendant declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-17\">iv. On March 9,1956, plaintiff, who had previously contacted Mr. Adams relative to the property, again contacted Mr. Adams, who stated that he was not interested in the property at the price asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>v. On March 22, 1956, plaintiff\u2019s exclusive right to sell defendant\u2019s property expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">vi. On June 6, 1956, an escrow was opened between Mr. Adams and defendant, whereby Mr. Adams agreed to purchase defendant\u2019s property for the sum of $220,000, and defendant agreed to sell it to him. This sale was arranged through Mr. Jones, a real estate broker associated with Dunn &amp; Co. While the negotiations conducted by Mr. Jones were in progress, plaintiff telephoned Mr. Adams and was informed that he was then engaged in negotiations relating to the property. He told plaintiff, \u201cdon\u2019t upset my negotiations. Don\u2019t disturb this deal.\u201d He also informed plaintiff, \u201cEvery broker in town has submitted the property to me one time or another. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">vii. On July 6, 1956, the escrow was closed and the sale consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\"><em>Questions : </em>First. <em>Did plaintiff comply with the terms of his contract with defendantf</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\"><em>Yes. </em>These rules are here applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">1. The parties to a broker\u2019s contract for the sale of real property are at liberty to make the compensation depend upon any lawful conditions they see fit to place therein. <em>(Kimmell </em>v. <em>Skelly, </em>130 Cal. 555, 559 [62 P. 1067] ; <em>cf. Fleming </em>v. <em>Dolfin, </em>214 Cal. 269 [4 P.2d 776, 78 A.L.R 585].)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">2. Where an agreement provides that a real estate broker\u2019s commission is to be paid if the property is sold within a specified period to a person whose name is furnished to the owner by the broker, and the property is sold by the owner to such a party during the prescribed period, it is immaterial that the agent was not the procuring cause of the sale. <em>(Fleming </em>v. <em>Dolfin, supra; Gregory </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>135 Cal. 589, 592 [67 P. 1038] ; <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Libby, </em>72 Cal.App.2d 138,141 [3] et seq. [164 P.2d 21]; <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 352, 357 [3] et seq. [229 P.2d 456] ; <em>Delbon </em>v. <em>Brazil, </em>134 Cal. App.2d 461, 464 [1] [285 P.2d 710].)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">3. Where a landowner has agreed to pay a real estate broker a commission in the event of a sale, \u201ca sale\u201d means the making of an executory binding agreement by which the property is to be sold to a purchaser obtained by the broker. <em>(Twogood </em>v. <em>Monnette, </em>191 Cal. 103, 107 [2] [215 P. 542] ; <em>Coulter </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>203 Cal. 17, 25 [6] [262 P. 751]; <em>Wood</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>bridge Realty </em>v. <em>Plymouth Dev. Corp., </em>130 Cal.App.2d 270, 279 [6] [278 P.2d 713] ; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Van Wagenen, </em>90 N.J. Law 358 [101 A. 55, 56 [3, 4] ] <em>; Felleman </em>v. <em>Von Luckner, </em>253 N.Y.S. 567 [234 App.Div. 787] <em>; Klipper </em>v. <em>Schlossberg, </em>96 N.J. Law 397 [115 A. 345, 346].)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\"> Applying the foregoing rules to the facts of the present case, it is evident that the property was sold \u201cwithin 90 days after\u201d the termination of the contract between plaintiff and defendant to a person \u201cwhose name\u201d was registered with defendant by plaintiff in writing before the termination of the contract. Therefore, pursuant to the terms of the contract, plaintiff was entitled to his broker\u2019s commission from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\"><em>Wright &amp; Kimbrough </em>v. <em>Dewees, </em>52 Cal.App. 42 [197 P. 957], and <em>Hobson </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>59 Cal.App. 679 [211 P. 242], relied on by defendant, are not applicable to the facts in the present case. In <em>Wright &amp; Kimbrough </em>v. <em>Dewees, </em>it was held that the rule here relied on was not applicable, because the contract provided \u201c \u2018if sold to a party to whose attention said property was brought through the agency of said agent\u2019 the broker shall receive five per cent \u2018as a commission <em>for promoting said sale.\u2019 </em>\u201d (P. 46.) It was pointed out that in <em>Kimmell </em>v. <em>Shelly, </em>130 Cal. 555 [62 P. 1067], in which ease the rule was held to be applicable, the contract provided for a fixed compensation in the event of a sale by anyone during a specified period. The situation in the present ease is the same as in the Kimmell case.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">In <em>Hobson </em>v. <em>Hunt, supra, </em>the contract provided for a commission \u201cif the agent during the life of this agreement, shall find a purchaser ready, willing and able to buy the said property at the above price\u201d (p. 680), while in the present case, as pointed out <em>supra, </em>there was no requirement that the plaintiff find a purchaser ready, willing and able to buy defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Second. <em>Did the trial court err in not malting a finding (a) that plaintiff had abandoned the contract and (b) whether plaintiff had performed all the conditions of the contract?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\"><em>No. </em> This rule is here applicable: If findings are made upon issues which determine a cause, other issues become immaterial, and a failure to find thereon does not constitute prejudicial error. <em>(Merrill </em>v. <em>Gordon &amp; Harrison, </em>208 Cal. 1, 6 [3] [279 P. 996] ; <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Abeles, </em>88 Cal.App.2d 291, 299 [8, 9] [198 P.2d 927] ; <em>Mortgage Guarantee Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Cal.App.2d 618, 621 [4] [50 P.2d 835] ; see cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>cited in West\u2019s Ann. Cal. Code Civ. Proc., vol. 16, \u00a7 632, p. 533, n. 133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In the present case the trial court found \u201cthat plaintiff exercised diligence in performing his said contract; that plaintiff made contact with one Morgan Adams, also known as Morgan Adams Jr., in respect of the possible purchase by the said Adams of the said real property; that plaintiff under date of March 7th 1956, and on March 22nd 1956 by reference to the said letter of March 7th 1956, registered with defendant in writing the name of Morgan Adams (among others) as a prospective purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\u201cThe Court finds that before the expiration of the ninety days after March 22nd 1956 referred to in paragraph I of these findings, and on June 7th 1956, defendant sold to Morgan Adams, also known as Morgan Adams Jr., and to James H. Adams as nominee of Morgan Adams, the said real property for $220,000.00 through the agency of Charles J. Dunn &amp; Co., real estate brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">\u201cThe Court finds that it is unnecessary to make findings in respect of issues not expressly covered herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Clearly, the foregoing findings cover the material issues in the case, and there is an implied finding that plaintiff did not abandon the contract. Therefore, the above rule of law is applicable, and it was not prejudicial error for the trial court to fail to make additional findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Traynor, J., Schauer, J., and Spence, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b676-13\">In the present ease the language of the contract does not imply an obligation on the part of the broker to do anything more than list the name of the prospective purchaser with the owner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
