He was represented by a deputy public defender and pleaded guilty to the first count of forgery. The trial court denied probation, dismissed the other three counts of forgery and the two prior convictions, and sentenced defendant to the state prison for the term prescribed by law. Defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We ordered a hearing on our own motion since this case involved the same question presented in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hyde, ante, </em>p. 152 [331 P.2d 42], i. e., the appointment of counsel on appeal for an indigent defendant who has been convicted of a crime. Our discussion of that question in the Hyde case also applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his request to withdraw his plea of guilty. He made this request immediately following the pronouncement of sentence. At that time the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: May I speak?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: I was told by the District Attorney\u2019s office that I only had one charge left against me which was a misdemeanor, cut down to a misdemeanor, by my attorney; he told me that I only had $2.47 charge left against me. And he told me it was cut down to a misdemeanor, and when the probation officer saw me, he told me that it was up to the Court, that I should get probation, that he would grant it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">\u201cMr. Brill: Your Honor, that is a misstatement of the facts. We did not tell Mr. Doyle that this was a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">\u201cThe Defendant: Sir, are you my attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-13\">\u201cMr. Brill : I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-14\">\u201cThe Defendant: Didn\u2019t you tell me right to my face\u2014 your name was Mr. Briggs, and that I would-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-15\">\u201cMr. Brill: My name is \u2018Mr. Brill,\u2019 and I told you that you are pleading guilty to one count of forgery and it was not a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-16\">\u201cThe Defendant: One count and it was supposed to be cut down to a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-17\">\u201cThe Court: Do you want to discuss this with your client any further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-18\">\u201cMr. Brill: I don\u2019t know whether my client wants to discuss it with me. He is misstating the facts, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-19\">\u2018 \u2018 The Defendant : Sir, I want to rescind my plea, if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>that way; I want to go to a Court and have a trial. I can\u2019t go to the penitentiary at my age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">\u201cThe Court: Well, your age isn\u2019t going to save you, Mr. Doyle. If you feel that you have pled guilty to something that you are not guilty of-&gt;-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201cThe Dependant : Well, I am guilty of the one charge, I admit it, but I want to stand a court trial. I think I can get out of it, by gosh, the way I\u2019ve been treated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201cThe Court: Well, if you are guilty of the charge, then, the charge is forgery of one cheek although you acknowledged, as I recall, to the probation officer, or the officers have, that this is only one of many, and not only that but you were released on bail and when you were released on bail, you went to Seattle and were brought back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\u201cThe Dependant: Yes, sir, I admit that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well, if you are guilty of the offense, there is no way you are going to get out of it, that is for sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">\u201cThe former order will stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Defendant contends that the foregoing establishes that his plea of guilty was induced by the misrepresentation of a member of the office of the district attorney that the only charge remaining was a misdemeanor and that this ground was stated in open court and was not denied by the district attorney. Although the alleged misrepresentation was not denied by the deputy district attorney, it was contradicted by Mr. Brill, defendant\u2019s counsel. In each of the cases cited by defendant in support of his contention, <em>People </em>v. <em>Griggs, </em>17 Cal.2d 621, 624 [110 P.2d 1031], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Butterfield, </em>37 Cal.App.2d 140, 143-144 [99 P.2d 310], there was a substantial defense to the crime charged, whereas, in this case, defendant does not claim that he has any defense, and the record shows that when questioned by the trial court he readily admitted his guilt of the crime to which he pleaded guilty as well as others. Moreover, the record also shows that when defendant was arraigned to enter his plea, he was informed that he was charged with forgery, \u201ca felony,\u201d and was asked how he pleaded to count I, \u201c a felony. \u2019 \u2019 The record does not sustain defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court committed error in refusing to permit him to withdraw his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">Sehauer, J., concurred in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">Spence, <em>J., </em>did not participate herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
