An instrument which leaves the designation of the specific property resting exclusively in the minds of the parties fails to meet the fundamental and requirements of the' registry law. The description of property cannot be arrived at by applying the testimony of the parties to the descriptive matter in the deed.

E. 370, in which an opinion has just been handed down. Both cases arose under section 2462 of the Code, which provides for reservation of title to and liens on goods and chattels sold, and when such a reservation is to be void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers, etc. In the opinion just handed down the statute, so far as it applies peculiarly to these cases, was set out, and also the requisites of a contract intended as a reservation of title to goods and chattels sold; and it is therefore not necessary to repeat here the statute or these requisites, but we shall be content with a reference to said opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">In 1907 when appellee opened the hotel in the city of Norfolk known as the \u201cLynnhaven Hotel,\u201d it agreed to purchase from appellant six cash registers, one in a contract to itself at the price of $85.00, and five in another contract for $1,315.00, the terms on which the $85.00 register was sold being $15.00 cash on the arrival of the register, and $70.00 evidenced by notes payable in seven monthly installments of $10.00 each, to be executed by appellee upon its arrival, and the terms upon which the five machines named in the other contract were sold were $650 cash upon delivery of the machines, and $665 evidenced by a note payable in six months from the arrival of the machines, and executed by the purchaser upon their arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">These contracts were filed with the clerk of the Corporation Court of the city of Norfolk, to be docketed in a book in his office known as the memorandum docket, being the docket provided for by section 2462 of the Code, supra&gt; and in which conditional sales and reservations of title are docketed, and it is claimed by appellant that the said contracts were duly docketed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">A chancery suit was subsequently instituted by Calvin B. Taylor against the Norfolk City Realty Company, Incorporated, appellee here, for the enforcement of various liens and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>other debts against the real estate of the defendant known as the \u201cLynnhaven Hotel,\u201d in which suit receivers were appointed to take charge of the property of the defendant company, and the proceedings in that suit were such as to convert it into a creditors\u2019 proceeding to subject the property of the defendant company to the payment of its debts. The receivers of the court took charge of the property, including the cash registers here in question, and upon their refusal to deliver these registers to the appellant, it filed a petition in the cause, asking that the court direct the receivers to deliver to it the said registers; and, upon the hearing of that petition, the court entered an order refusing to direct the return of the cash registers to the appellant, holding that the docketing of the contracts under which they were claimed was insufficient, and that the registers were properly in the hands of the receivers to be sold, and the proceeds applied to the debts of the defendant company. From that decree this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">The first of these contracts consisted of a written order addressed to the appellant, dated April 20, 190\u2014\u2022, signed \u201cHenry DeWaters, By Henry DeWaters,\u201d and endorsed thereon are the words and figures, \u201cAccepted 4-24, 1907, 3001, The Rational Cash Register Company, By A.

C.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-27\">The sole question presented for our consideration is whether or not the docketing or recording of these contracts is such a compliance with section 2462 as to operate as constructive notice! to subsequent purchasers for value or encumbrancers. It is not claimed that the receivers of the court had actual notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>contracts, or of the lien upon the cash registers in question claimed hy appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"AeG\">In the case of <em>National Cash Register Co. </em>v. <em>Burrow and Martin, Trustees, supra, </em>it was held that contracts of this character, as well as deeds of conveyance of property, when registered or recorded, must, in order to he efficacious as constructive notice to subsequent purchasers or incumbrancers, afford to subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers the means of ascertaining with accuracy what property is conveyed or affected by a lien thereon for the reservation of title thereto by the instrument registered or recorded, and that the language employed in the instrument must be such that if a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer should examine the instrument itself he would ohtain thereby actual notice of all the rights which were intended to be created or conferred by it; and that if the instrument did not contain these essential requisites the.registry or recordation thereof would not operate as constructive notice to subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The decision of this court in <em>Florance </em>v. <em>Morien, </em>98 Va. 26, 34 S. E. 890, and the reasoning of the opinion in that case, apply with full force to the case here, and so does the case of <em>Hardaway </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>100 Va. 481, 41 S. E. 957. See also <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Chase &amp; Buck, </em>62 Vt. 206, 20 Atl. 198, 22 Am. St. Rep. 99, which was an action of <em>trover </em>for the conversion of- six cows; and it was held that while the description of a thing mortgaged in a chattel mortgage may not be sufficient to enable one to identify the property without inquiry, it must indicate the line of inquiry and furnish the basis for identification; and that a mortgage which leaves the designation of the specific property resting exclusively in the minds of the parties fails to meet the fundamental purposes and requirements of the law, that the result cannot be arrived at by applying their testimony to any descriptive matter in the deed; and that such evidence is not in aid of something which requires explanation, but is the supplying of something which is entirely wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>An examination of these contracts as recorded will disclose that they fail even to suggest an intelligent inquiry which might he made by a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer as to what goods or chattels were , covered by the contracts, and they certainly fail to afford notice of all the rights which were intended to be created or conferred by them. The appellant appears to have been more anxious to sell and place with purchasers the products of its enterprise than it was prudent and cautious in complying with the plain requirements of our statute, under which and by compliance with which alone can there be a reservation of title to goods or chattels operative against subsequent purchasers of such goods or chattels for value and without notice, or encumbrancers.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">We are of opinion that the decree of the circuit court is right, and it is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
