Co. </em>v. Pankey, 91 Va. 259, 21 S. E. 487; <em>Union Cent. L. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pollard, </em>94 Va. 146, 26 S. E. 421, 64 Am. St. Rep. 715, 36 L. R. A. 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Defendant in error relies on the last cited case as supporting his contention that if plaintiff in error desired to have more ' specific information he had the right to move the court to order defendant in error to file a statement of the particulars of his claim, and failing to do so, he is to be taken as electing to let the notice stand as it was, in order, thereafter, to object to the introduction of the note upon which the motion was made; but in that case a question arose as to the admissibility in evidence of certain foreign statutes, a question not raised by the demurrer to the notice, and what was said in the opinion neither sustains defendant in error\u2019s contention, nor militates against the settled- doctrine that the notice in such a case must set out sufficient matter to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">In this pase the action is against an endorser of the note alone, whose liability to the holder, or claimant, of the note was conditional only, as is not questioned; and yet the notice of the motion to be made against him for the amount of the note does not set out a single fact going to show that defendant in error had a right of action against him. As suggested in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>petition for this writ of error, every word in this notice may he true without any cause of action having arisen against the plaintiff in error as endorser of the note upon which the judgment would be asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">We are of opinion that the lower court should have sustained the demurrer to the notice, but with leave to defendant in error to amend the notice if he desired to do so. In the event that the case takes that course when remanded, there is a question presented and argued in the record now before us that will necessarily arise at the next trial. Therefore we deem it proper to consider and determine that question upon this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The note sued on fell due and became payable on Monday, March 2, 1908 (March 1, 1908, being Sunday), and it is not pretended that it was ever presented for payment at The Citizens Bank of Norfolk, Va., where it was made payable and should have been presented for payment, as shown upon the face of the note, but was only presented for payment to one Abbott Morris, and that, too, on March 5, 1908, three days after the day of the maturity of the note; this presentation being made by a \u201crunner\u201d for the First National Bank of Norfolk, Va., whereupon Morris wrote on the note the words, \u201cThe Virginia Medical Co. is indebted to the Security Loan and Trust Co. A. M. return,\u201d and handed the note back to the \u201crunner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The contention of the defendant in error is, in effect, that as Morris was president of both the Virginia Medical Co., the maker, and the Security Loan and Trust Co., the payee and \u25a0 blank endorser of the note, and made answer for both, putting a refusal to pay the note on the ground that the maker thereof was indebted .to the endorser already, this is to be taken as a waiver of the release of plaintiff in error from liability by reason of the failure of the holder of the note to present it at maturity to the Citizens Bank of Norfolk.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">We are of opinion that there is no merit whatever in this contention. In the first place, it is not pretended that Morris was the person to whom notice of the dishonor of the note should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>have been given, nor that anything was said or done by anybody prior to March 5, 1908, when a \u201crunner\u201d of one of the banks in Norfolk presented to Morris the note in question for payment, which could have been construed as a\u2018waiver of the non-liability of the plaintiff in erorr for the payment of the note. Therefore the waiver must have arisen, if at all, after plaintiff in error\u2019s release from liability. And it is also not pretended that Morris had any authority whatever to waive the non-liability of plaintiff in error and re-establish its liability in the manner it is claimed he did, or in any other mode or manner. It is a well recognized doctrine, as applicable to this case as it is to many others, that a waiver of legal rights will not be implied except upon clear and unmistakable proof of an intention to waive such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In Tardy, <em>Trustee </em>v. <em>Boyd\u2019s Admr., </em>26 Gratt. 637, this court said: \u201cAlthough a promise to pay by an endorser with full knowledge of all the facts and of the <em>laches </em>of the holder may be held in point of law to amount to a waiver of the right to notice, yet this rule must be taken with this qualification: The promise to be obligatory must be deliberately made in clear, explicit language, and must amount to an admission of the right of the holder, or of a duty and willingness of the endorser to pay. If, therefore, the conduct or acts of the endorser be equivocal, or the language used be of a qualified or uncertain nature, the endorser will not be held responsible. Story Prom. Notes, 363.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Other questions presented in this record may or may not arise at another trial of the case, if there be one, and therefore we do not deem it necessary to consider them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The judgment of the lower court will be reversed, the verdict of the jury set aside, and the cause remanded with leave to defendant in error to amend his notice of motion, if he be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">\n<em>jReversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
