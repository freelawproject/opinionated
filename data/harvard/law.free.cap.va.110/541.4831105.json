And when the wires, if properly insulated, would not be a source of danger, such person is only bound to look for patent defects, and not for latent defects.

Thornton, was of sufficient intelligence, capacity and experience to know the probable danger of coming in contact, while in a state of profuse perspiration, with the wires upon or near the pole on Craghead street in Danville, upon which he was alleged to have been at the time of his alleged injury, and if they further believe from the evidence that he was of sufficient intelligence, capacity and experience to know his duty to avoid them for his protection, and that he negligently failed to avoid them, then his contributory negligence will bar his recovery, and they must find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-8\">ISTo. 6. \u201cThe court further instructs the jury:</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-9\">\u201cThat if they believe from the evidence that the plaintiff, Thornton, on the day of the alleged accident, climbed the said pole of the Danville Railway and Electric Company, and voluntarily attempted to go in and among the wires of the defendant city, strung at or near the said pole, for the purpose of painting said pole, and attempted to go in and among said wires to a greater extent than was necessary, or if necessary so to go, failed at the time of the accident to exercise ordinary care to keep from coming in contact with said wires, and by the failure to exercise such ordinary care, came in contact with or fell upon said wires, and was thereby injured, then they are instructed that such failure to exercise ordinary care on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>his part will prevent plaintiff\u2019s recovery in this action, and they must find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-5\">ISTo. 7. \u201cThe court further instructs the jury:</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\">\u201cThat the pity is not an insurer against accidents from wires erected and maintained by it upon its streets for the purpose of conveying electric currents for light and power, and in order to hold it liable for said wires or any of them being improperly insulated, or for defects in the insulation \u25a0 of same, it must be shown that the city had actual or constructive notice of the defects or of the\u2019imperfect insulation of same whereby the accident is alleged to have been caused, and had reasonable time to repair or guard against any accident that might reasonably be expected to result from said defect in the \u2019 insulation of said wires, or from the imperfect insulation thereof, after having such notice, and, that by constructive notice is meant that the defect or imperfect insulation by which the injury is alleged to have been caused had been so open and notorious, and continued for such a length of time before the injury that the city, by its proper officers, exercising diligence and care commensurate with the danger, should have acquired knowledge of such defect. And if, therefore, the jury believe from the evidence that the city had no actual knowledge of such defect in such wires, or of the imperfect insulation thereof at or near the pole on Craghead street at which the accident to the plaintiff is alleged to have occurred, and that the defect in, or imperfect insulation of, said wires had not remained so open and notorious for a sufficient length of time as that the city, by the exercise of \u2022such diligence and care as were commensurate with the dangei&gt; should have known of their existence, and had time to repair the same or take such proper diligence and care to prevent such injury as might be expected from said defect in, or improper-insulation of, said wires, then they will find for the defendant.\u201d' ISTo. 8. \u201cThe court, instructs the jury:</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-7\">\u201cThat if they believe from the evidence in this case that the-defendant city had purchased and strung wires all along :Crag-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>head street at or near the point where the accident to the plaintiff is alleged to have occurred, of standard quality and efficiency, and that said wires were insulated according to the standard of electricians and electrical companies generally, and that \u25a0at the time of the accident alleged to have happened to the plaintiff said wires were properly insulated according to the standard of effective insulation generally in use and accepted by \u00abelectricians and electrical companies, and that the insulation on said wires with which said plaintiff is alleged to have come in contact is not defective and was in the condition of efficiency set by the standard adopted and used by electricians and electrical companies generally, that then the defendant city had performed the duties imposed upon it by law and they must find for the defendant, although they may further believe from the evidence that the wires of the said defendant passed at and near the said pole of the Danville Railway and Electric Com'jpany, and that the poles of the defendant city were not high enough above the pole at which the plaintiff, Thornton, was hurt, to cause the wires of the city to be above and beyond said pole, and although they may further believe from the evidence that the plaintiff, Thornton, exercised ordinary care and caution in protecting himself from contact with said wires.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\">Ro. 9. \u201cThe court further instructs the jury:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\">\u201cThat the defendant city is hot required under the law to use any particular methods and means of insulation, nor is it required to adopt any particular standard used by any particular company or corporation manufacturing and using electricity;

It is the duty of the company, under such conditions, to keep the wires perfectly insulated, and it must-exercise the utmost care to main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>tain them in this condition at such places. And the fact that it is very expensive or inconvenient to so insulate them will not excuse the company for failure to keep their wires perfectly insulated. So one, who in the course of his employment, is brought in close proximity to electrical wires, is not guilty of contributory negligence by coming in contact therewith, unless done unnecessarily or without proper precautions for his safety. And when the wires, if properly insulated, would not be a source of danger, such person is only obliged to look for patent defects and not for latent defects. And a person who touches an electric wire, from which the insulation is worn off, if he does it in ignorance of the nature and condition of the wire, is not negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The foregoing is a correct statement of the general rule, and is sustained by the authorities cited. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Raleigh Elec. Co., </em>129 N. C., 166, 39 S. E. 801, 85 Am. St. Rep. 735, 55 L. R. A. 398; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Wheeling E. Co., </em>54 W. Va. 395, 46 S. E. 217; <em>Thornbury </em>v. <em>City &amp; E. G. R. Co., </em>65 W. Va. 379, 64 S. E. 358; <em>Clements </em>v. <em>Louisiana Elec. L. Co., </em>44 La. Ann. 692, 11 South. 51, 32 Am. St. 348, 16 L. R. A. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Measured by that standard, the declaration states a good cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">With respect to the suggestion, that the declaration does not negative the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence, that is not necessary under our practice. <em>(Interstate R. Co. </em>v. <em>Tyree, ante, </em>p. 38, 65 S. E. 500.) But if the rule were otherwise, the declaration does contain the allegation that the inquiry was inflicted \u201cwithout any negligence on his part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">The second assignment of error is to the giving of plaintiff\u2019s instruction bTo. 1, the sole ground of objection being that it excludes from the consideration of the jury the defendant\u2019s theory of the case, and submits that of the plaintiff only.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">It appears that the instructions given on behalf of .the defendant cover every aspect of its case; and, finally, the jury are told that the instructions given in the case are the instructions of the court and must all be read together.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The third and last assignment is to the action of the court in overruling the motion of the defendant to set aside the verdict of the jury as contrary to the law and the evidence. The considerations to which our attention is invited under this assignment are threefold: (a) That the evidence shows that the defendant fully discharged its duty in establishing, maintaining and operating its wires; (b) that no notice, actual or constructive, was traced to the defendant of the defects which occasioned the plaintiff\u2019s injuries; and (c) that the evidence shows that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Of these contentions,- as a whole, it is sufficient to observe that they involve seriously controverted questions of fact, about which reasonable men might honestly differ; and where such is the case the rules applicable to a demurrer to the evidence must control and the verdict of the jury be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">For these reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
