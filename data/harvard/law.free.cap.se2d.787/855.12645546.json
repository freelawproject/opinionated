ARTHUR KELSEY\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The circuit court dismissed declaratory judgment complaints filed by two decedents' estates seeking to assert a private right of action for the production of documents under 12 VAC \u00a7 5-371-140(G). After consolidating these cases, the court held that the regulation did not require the production of documents requested by the estates and, on that basis, dismissed both complaints. We affirm but for a different reason. The governing statute does not imply a private right of action for the enforcement of this regulation, and thus, the estates' claims cannot be enforced in a declaratory judgment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Virginia Board of Health regulates certain medical facilities in the Commonwealth, including \"[n]ursing home[s]\" as defined by Code \u00a7 32.1-123. See 12 VAC \u00a7 5-371-10 (defining \"[n]ursing facility\" as \"any nursing home as defined in \u00a7 32.1-123 of the Code of Virginia \"). One condition of licensure requires nursing homes to have \"written policies and procedures\" and to make these \"policies ... available for review, upon request,\n   to residents and their designated representatives.\" 12 VAC \u00a7 5-371-140(A), (G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By statute and regulation, the Board may enforce this requirement through the imposition of \"administrative sanctions,\" which could include, among other things, petitioning a court to \"impose a civil penalty\" and \"[r]evoking or suspending\" the nursing home's license. Id. \u00a7 5-371-90(A), (B)(2)-(3); see also Code \u00a7 32.1-135(A). Under Code \u00a7 32.1-24, individual \"case decisions\" are then subject to the Administrative Process Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4000 to 2.2-4031. In addition, the State Health Commissioner may \"initiate court proceedings\" against non-compliant nursing homes, Code \u00a7 32.1-127.01, in the event that administrative remedies do not produce compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this consolidated case, the complaints alleged that Gerda A. Harvey and James Clifton Davis, Jr. were residents for brief periods at two different nursing homes operated by Virginia Health Services, Inc. After their deaths, their executors asked the nursing homes to provide copies of all written policies and procedures in effect during the decedents' stays. J.A. at 5, 12. When the nursing homes refused, the executors of both estates filed declaratory judgment actions seeking an order of \"specific performance\" compelling the nursing homes to provide the requested documents. Id. at 3, 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The circuit court dismissed the case, holding that only current residents, not former residents, could bring an enforcement action under 12 VAC \u00a7 5-371-140(G). The estates appeal, arguing that the better interpretation of this regulation is that it authorizes current and former residents of nursing homes to bring a private right of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We see no need to referee the dispute between the circuit court and the estates on whether to interpret 12 VAC \u00a7 5-371-140(G) narrowly or broadly. We thus do not address whether the term \"residents\" in this regulation encompasses former as well as current residents. That dispute presupposes that the governing statutes authorize parties other than the Commissioner to bring a regulatory enforcement action in circuit court. We hold that the statutes do not authorize a private right of action to enforce 12 VAC \u00a7 5-371-140(G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In Virginia, \"substantive law\" determines whether a private claimant has a right to bring a judicial action.

Substantive law includes the Constitution of Virginia, laws enacted by the General Assembly, and historic common-law principles recognized by our courts. A \"\n   <em>\n    right of action\n   </em>\n   \" is a legally recognized \"remedial right\" to \"enforce a\n   <em>\n    cause of action\n   </em>\n   ,\" which is simply the \"set of operative facts\" that causes a claimant to assert his claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20S.E.2d%20323\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added); see also Black's Law Dictionary 266, 1520 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"cause of action\" as a \"group of operative facts giving rise to one or more bases for suing\" and \"right of action\" as the \"right to bring a specific case to court\"). The distinction between a\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   of action and a\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   of action should not be dismissed as an odd, rhetorical anachronism. It factors into many modern legal doctrines, including res judicata, accrual for statute-of-limitations purposes, and, pertinent here, a party's right to seek judicial remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this case, the estates claim they have asserted a viable cause of action. In their view, the \"cause\" of their civil action is obvious: The nursing homes will not produce the requested documents, and the regulation requires them to do so. While that may or may not be true, it does not answer the threshold question of whether \"substantive law\" gives the estates the legal \"right\" to seek judicial enforcement of their claimed cause of action.

The existence of any viable right of action, therefore, must come from statutory law.

See generally Code \u00a7\u00a7 32.1-123 to 32.1-137.04, 32.1-138 to 32.1-138.5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nothing in title 32.1, chapter 5, however, authorizes a private party to bring a civil action to enforce regulations of the Board of Health. To the contrary, the governing statutes and regulations recognize only two methods of enforcing the Board's regulations: (i) administrative sanctions and adjudications subject to the Virginia Administrative Process Act and (ii) civil enforcement actions filed by the Commissioner in circuit court. See Code \u00a7\u00a7 32.1-24, 32.1-27(B), 32.1-27.1(B), 32.1-127.01 ; 12 VAC \u00a7 5-371-90(B) (authorizing the Commissioner to \"take such actions as are appropriate\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Private parties nevertheless play a role in this process. The regulations expressly grant interested parties the opportunity to file administrative complaints against a licensed nursing home. See 12 VAC \u00a7 5-371-70(B). Through its Office of Licensure and Certification, the Department of Health has the responsibility \"to investigate any complaints regarding alleged violations of the standards or statutes and complaints of the abuse or neglect of persons in care,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=722%20S.E.2d%20637\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 5-371-70(A), and to notify the complainant of the \"findings of the investigation,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=722%20S.E.2d%20637\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 5-371-70(C). The regulations obligate a nursing home under investigation to \"submit an acceptable plan of correcting any deficiencies found during a complaint investigation,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=722%20S.E.2d%20637\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 5-371-70(D), and to assure the Department that any \"plan of correction is implemented\n   and monitored so that compliance is maintained,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=722%20S.E.2d%20637\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 5-371-70(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We find in this statutory scheme multiple methods of enforcing the nursing homes' regulatory duties, including the document-production requirement of 12 VAC \u00a7 5-371-140(G). What we do not find is any clear statutory language expressly authorizing or implying that private parties can file a civil action in circuit court to enforce the regulation outside the administrative process. We thus conclude that no such right of action exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The estates next turn to the Declaratory Judgment Act, Code \u00a7 8.01-184 to Code \u00a7 8.01-191, as the statutory vehicle to give them a private right of action to enforce 12 VAC \u00a7 5-371-140(G). Again, their logic is straightforward: (i) The statute authorizes the Board's regulations; (ii) one of those regulations gives them a right to the requested documents; (iii) the Declaratory Judgment Act authorizes a court to \"declare\" that they have that right; and (iv) on remand, the trial court should follow up that declaration with an order compelling specific performance. See Appellant's Br. at 25 (addressing the requested remedy).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This simple syllogism, however, proves too much. If it were true, the Declaratory Judgment Act would operate as a roving statutory private right of action for anyone claiming to be injured by someone else's violation of any statute. The very concept of statutory standing, under this view, would no longer exist. Indeed, any aggrieved claimant, by virtue of claiming that his grievance involves a statutory violation, would have standing to assert a private right of action in court-not because the allegedly violated statute grants the right, but because the Declaratory Judgment Act grants the right for all statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This understanding of the Declaratory Judgment Act is wholly out of sync with the traditional view of the Act's purpose and function. \"The intent of the declaratory judgment statutes is not to give parties greater rights than those which they previously possessed, but to permit the declaration of those rights before they mature.\" Charlottesville Area Fitness Club Operators Ass'n v.
