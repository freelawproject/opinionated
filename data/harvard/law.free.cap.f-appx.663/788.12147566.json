After careful review of the briefs and relevant parts of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">This case arises out of a criminal indictment filed on December 18, 2013 charging that Hedrick engaged in a scheme and artifice to defraud by means of an internet website advertising various purported investment opportunities, including an investment into world gold markets, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. The indictment charged that, among other false representations, the website advertised that Hed-rick\u2019s corporation, Hedrick Consulting, Inc., bought gold in any quantity for cash in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Accra,. Ghana, and other places. As part of this scheme, Hedrick pitched a purportedly profitable international gold investment opportunity to a Confidential Source (\u201cCS\u201d) who held himself out as a principal of a charitable organization. Hedrick allegedly made numerous false representations to the CS, including that Hedrick regularly buys gold and has business relationships with gold mines and precious metals refineries throughout the world. Hedrick communicated with the CS via cellular telephone and email to discuss the proposed gold investment scheme and to send documents including a Promissory Note and a Purchase and Sales Agreement to attempt to consummate the CS\u2019s investment of $500,000.00, After meeting with the CS at a hotel in Jacksonville, Florida to close the deal, Hedrick was confronted by law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Hedrick\u2019s indictment led to a jury trial held October 20-23, 2014. Following the close of the Government\u2019s case-in-chief, Hedrick moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(a). The district court denied the motion without prejudice. At the close of evidence, Hedrick renewed his motion pursuant to Rule 29(a). The district court again denied the motion. The jury returned a verdict finding Hedrick guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">We evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. United States v. Jernigan, 341 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 2003). \u201cIf there is a lack of substantial evidence ... from which a reasonable fact-finder could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the conversion must be reversed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>United States v. Mieres-Borges, 919 F.2d 652, 656 (11th Cir. 1990). However, this Court \u201cwill affirm a conviction so long as <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d United States v. Croteau, 819 F.3d 1293, 1304 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting United States v. Hunt, 526 F.3d 739, 744 (11th Cir. 2008)). We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal <em>de novo. </em>United States v. Descent, 292 F.3d 703, 706 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">To prove' wire fraud in violation of \u00a7 1343, the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally (1) participated in a scheme or artifice to defraud; and (2) used the interstate wires to carry out that scheme. United States v. Langford, 647 F.3d 1309, 1320 (11th Cir. 2011). A scheme to defraud requires proof of material misrepresentations, or the omission or concealment of material facts. United States v. Hasson, 333 F.3d 1264, 1270-71 (11th Cir. 2003). A material misrepresentation is one having a natural tendency to influence, or capable of influencing, the decision maker to whom it is addressed. Id. at 1271 (citing Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 25, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999)). We have held that the mail fraud statute\u2014and hence the wire fraud statute\u2014prohibits <em>\u201cany </em>scheme or artifice to defraud,\u201d no matter how fanciful and without regard to whether a p\u00e9rson of ordinary prudence and comprehension would rely upon the misrepresentation. United States v. Svete, 556 F.3d 1157, 1169 (11th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (emphasis in original); see also United States v. Bradley, 644 F.3d 1213, 1239 n.57 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Hedrick argues on appeal that there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of committing wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. Specifically, while Hedrick admits that he used interstate wire transmissions for the purpose of communicating with the CS with regards to the proposed gold inyestment scheme at issue, he claims that the Government failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that that the transaction was fraudulent or that he possessed the requisite intent to defraud. In brief, Hedrick insists that he cannot be found guilty of committing wire fraud because he had full intention to carry through with the proposed gold investment scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">We disagree. The record contains ample evidence to support a finding that that Hedrick intentionally participated in a scheme to defraud in violation of \u00a7 1343. The record shows that Hedrick made numerous misrepresentations calculated at influencing the CS to invest in gold through his consulting firm. For instance, Hedrick represented himself as an established and successful international gold dealer who had completed \u201chundreds of joint ventures\u201d in various investment categories and that he had completed enough large-quantity gold deals to make gold-dealing his \u201cprimary\u201d business. In fact, Hedrick had completed no such deals. Indeed, Hedrick admitted that had never bought as much as a kilogram of gold. Hedrick also claimed to have an established banking relationship with Soleil Chartered Bank, off-shore earnings, a license, gold in Liberia, \u201cpeople on the ground\u201d in West Africa, his own plane, and a reputation for conducting \u201cground buys in Accra.\u201d All .of this was simply false. Even if we were to credit Hedrick\u2019s argument on appeal that he ultimately intended to go through with the proposed gold investment, the calculated use of these material misrepresentations to induce the CS to enter into the transaction was itself a scheme or artifice to defraud. We there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>fore have no difficulty holding that there was sufficient evidence to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\">.
