Moritz, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b718-16\">Raymond Anthony Lewis, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint relating to his incarceration as a pretrial detainee. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-18\">Lewis was a pretrial detainee in Natro-na County Detention Center (\u201cNCDC\u201d) in Wyoming from May to September, 2013. His \u00a7 1983 complaint alleges his constitutional rights were violated at NCDC, and he named as defendants Lieutenant Jerry Clark, then the Deputy Sheriff of Natrona County in charge of NCDC,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and numerous unnamed sheriffs deputies in their official and individual capacities. The district court dismissed Lewis\u2019s first complaint with leave to amend, then dismissed his second complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. On appeal, we affirmed in part and reversed in part, remanding several of Lewis\u2019s claims for further consideration. <em>Lewis v. Clark, </em>577 Fed.Appx. 786, 803 (10th Cir. 2014). The issues on remand related to a one-time denial of Lewis\u2019s request to use NCDC\u2019s law library, NCDC\u2019s ban on inmate-to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>inmate correspondence, and its ten-page limit on incoming mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The district court ordered the defendants to file a <em>Martinez </em>report.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After consideration of the report, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss all of Lewis\u2019s official-capacity claims. It also granted Clark\u2019s motion to dismiss' the individual-capacity claims against him. Finally, it dismissed the complaint in its entirety because Lewis never identified any of the unnamed officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">We review a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo. <em>Gee v. Pacheco, </em>627 F.3d 1178, 1183 (10th Cir. 2010). Because Lewis is proceeding pro se, we construe his pleadings liberally. <em>See Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Library-Access-Retaliation Claim. Lewis alleges that on August 7, 2013, at 10:00 p.m., an unknown deputy denied him access to NCDC\u2019s law library on the stated ground that Lewis didn\u2019t need to use it because he had an attorney. He says the deputy denied him access in retaliation for the numerous grievances he had filed against NCDC officials, in violation of his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">The district court dismissed Lewis\u2019s retaliation claim because he didn\u2019t allege the unnamed deputy acted in accordance with any Natrona County or NCDC custom or policy of retaliation. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690 n.55, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (holding that an official-capacity claim functions as a claim against the governmental entity itself). Rather, Lewis alleges only one act by an unnamed deputy under a vicarious-liability theory, which isn\u2019t a permissible basis under \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">A governmental entity can be held liable under \u00a7 1983 only for an action the entity officially sanctioned, for the actions of an official with final policymaking authority, or for \u201ca widespread practice that, although not authorized ..., is so permanent and well-settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law.\u201d <em>City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, </em>485 U.S. 112, 122-23, 127, 108 S.Ct. 915, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">On appeal, for the first time in his reply brief, Lewis suggests his retaliation claim isn\u2019t based only on the action of the unnamed deputy; he says that in the first complaint he filed\u2014later amended\u2014he attached grievances filed by other inmates which would show widespread retaliation by NCDC deputies. But his first complaint didn\u2019t allege any widespread policy of retaliation and, in any event, his amended complaint \u201csupersedes the original and renders it of no legal effect.\u201d <em>Davis v. TXO Prod. Corp., </em>929 F.2d 1515, 1517 (10th Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). Lewis\u2019s amended complaint very clearly based his retaliation claim on only the act of the one unknown deputy denying his August 7 library request. The district court correctly held this allegation fails to state a \u00a7 1983 official-capacity claim, and we affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">Due Process Denial of Access to Law Library. Lewis further alleges that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>one-time denial of library access on August 7 violated his procedural due process rights. He claims language in the NCDC handbook gave him a protected liberty and property interest in the use of the library that could not be denied without due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">To set forth a procedural due process violation, a plaintiff must first show \u201cthe deprivation of an interest in life, liberty, or property.\u201d <em>Elliott v. Martinez, </em>675 F.3d 1241,1244 (10th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the plaintiff must prove the procedures followed by the defendant didn\u2019t comport with due process of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The district court correctly ruled that language in prison handbooks, rules, and regulations can\u2019t be used to derive property or liberty interests in the prison context. <em>See Cosco v. Uphoff, </em>195 F.3d 1221, 1223-24 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding no liberty interest can arise from prison regulations); <em>Rapier v. Harris, </em>172 F.3d 999, 1005 (7th Cir. 1999) (holding the use of prison regulations to derive a liberty interest is \u201cno more valid in the context of pretrial detainees\u201d). \u201cLiberty interests can either arise from the Constitution or be created by state law.\u201d <em>Cordova v. City of Albuquerque, </em>816 F.3d 645, 656-57 (10th Cir. 2016). There is no right in the Constitution to unfettered use of a prison law library, <em>see Penrod v. Zavaras, </em>94 F.3d 1399, 1403 (10th Cir. 1996), and Lewis points to no state law giving him such an interest, <em>see Cordova, </em>816 F.3d at 657 (\u201c[A] State creates a protected liberty interest by placing substantive limitations on official discretion.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Thus, the district court correctly ruled Lewis\u2019s complaint fails to identify any constitutionally protected property or liberty interests which could support his claim that the one-time denial of library access deprived him of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Ban on Inmate-to-inmate Correspondence. Lewis alleges NCDC\u2019s absolute ban on inmate-to-inmate correspondence violates his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights because it doesn\u2019t allow an exception for family members. Lewis complains the ban prevents him from communicating with his son, an inmate at another prison. \u201c[W]hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates\u2019 constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\u201d <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). <em>Turner </em>held that restrictions on inmate-to-inmate communications pass constitutional muster if they are reasonably related to legitimate and neutral governmental objectives. <em>Id. </em>at 89, 93, 107 S.Ct. 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">To balance the guarantees of the Constitution with the legitimate concerns of prison administrators, courts use four factors set forth in <em>Turner:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2N\">(1) whether a rational connection exists between the prison policy [or] regulation and a legitimate governmental interest advanced as its justification; (2) whether alternative means of exercising the right are available notwithstanding the policy or regulation; (3) what effect accommodating the exercise of the right would have on guards, other prisoners, and prison resources generally; and (4) whether ready, easy-to-implement alternatives exist that would accommodate the prisoner\u2019s rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-11\"><em>Boles v. Neet, </em>486 F.3d 1177, 1181 (10th Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 89-91, 107 S.Ct. 2254). In ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court needn\u2019t assess or address all four factors, but need only assess as a general matter whether the regulation is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest. <em>Al-Owhali v. Holder, </em>687 F.3d 1236, 1240 (10th Cir. 2012). Lewis has the burden to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>\u201cplead facts from which a plausible inference can be drawn that the [restriction] was not reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The <em>Martinez </em>report noted that NCDC implemented its inmate-to-inmate correspondence ban to ensure safety, security, and orderly operation of the facility. <em>See Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 92, 107 S.Ct. 2254 (recognizing that \u201ccorrespondence between prison institutions facilitates the development of informal organizations that threaten the core functions of prison administration, maintaining safety and internal security,\u201d among other concerns). Assessing the <em>Timer </em>factors, the district court determined the inmate-to-inmate correspondence ban was rationally connected to NCDC\u2019s legitimate security concerns and didn\u2019t restrict other means of communication; and Lewis didn\u2019t allege any facts showing that any alternative to the ban would alleviate NCDC\u2019s safety and security concerns. It concluded the inmate-to-inmate correspondence ban was reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest and therefore valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The first <em>Turner </em>factor\u2014whether a rational connection exists between the prison regulation and a legitimate governmental interest\u2014\u201cis the most important,\u201d as \u201cit is not simply a consideration to be weighed but rather an essential requirement.\u201d <em>Al-Owhali, </em>687 F.3d at 1240 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Boles, </em>486 F.3d at 1181 (holding the first <em>Turner </em>factor isn\u2019t merely a factor, but a required element). On appeal, Lewis asserts that NCDC\u2019s \u201cfixation on safety and security\u201d with respect to the inmate-to-inmate mail ban is \u201cwithout merit.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 6. But in his amended complaint he conceded that the \u201cpolicy for no inmate-to-inmate mail\u201d is \u201cabsolutely\u201d \u201ca legitimate safety concern,\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. I at 259 (Am. Compl.); <em>see also id. </em>at 612 (Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss) (stating \u201c[tjhere is NO dispute that the prohibition of \u2018inmate-to-inmate\u2019 correspondence is reasonably related to a Governmental interest ... concerning safety &amp; security\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">We agree with the district court that Lewis\u2019s complaint fails to plead sufficient facts that would permit a court to plausibly infer that NCDC\u2019s inmate-to-inmate correspondence ban wasn\u2019t reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest and affirm the dismissal of this claim. <em>See id. </em>at 91-93 (upholding restrictions on inmate-to-inmate written correspondence as reasonably related to prison security and legitimate penological interests); <em>Al-Owhali, </em>687 F.3d at 1241 (affirming dismissal where the prisoner\u2019s complaint failed to allege facts indicating the prison\u2019s ban on communication with his nieces and nephews lacked a legitimate penological objective).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Ten-Page Limitation on Mailed Items. Lewis alleges NCDC rejected research materials his wife mailed him based on a ten-page limitation on mailed items. He argues this action deprived him of his property without due process because the ten-page limit rule isn\u2019t published in NCDC\u2019s regulation handbook. \u201c[M]inimum procedural safeguards must accompany the decision to withhold delivery or censor \u25a0incoming prison mail.\u201d <em>Jacklovich v. Simmons, </em>392 F.3d 420, 433 (10th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">The <em>Martinez </em>report showed that NCDC\u2019s handbook states prison employees may hold or return incoming mail if they deem it unacceptable in the exercise of their discretion, and if any mail is deemed unacceptable, it will be returned to the sender, and the prisoner will be notified of the violation. It is clear from Lewis\u2019s complaint that he received such a mail-violation notice, which prompted his grievance. The district court ruled that the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>tions in Lewis\u2019s complaint demonstrated that NCDC afforded Lewis adequate procedural safeguards by notifying him that mail may be withheld and providing him postdeprivation notice and the right to file a grievance, which process he indeed used.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Lewis\u2019s complaint merely alleges that he didn\u2019t receive advance notice of the ten-page limit. He asserted no facts, nor has he asserted any argument on appeal, suggesting he didn\u2019t receive adequate postde-privation notice and remedy. It is well settled that a deprivation of property doesn\u2019t violate the Due Process Clause if a meaningful postdeprivation remedy for the loss is available. <em>See Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). Because Lewis was afforded an adequate postdeprivation remedy, we affirm the dismissal of this due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Lewis also alleges the ten-page limit violates his constitutional free-speech and free-association rights. The district court conducted the four-factor <em>Turner </em>test, concluding all weighed in favor of the limit\u2019s constitutionality. It concluded NCDC\u2019s stated interests in orderly prison operations, reducing contraband, and reducing the number of pages mail officials must scan are legitimate governmental interests rationally related to the policy, and that Lewis hasn\u2019t pled any facts indicating otherwise. It further noted Lewis\u2019s complaint doesn\u2019t allege any facts plausibly suggesting an alternative to accommodate him with minimal effect on NCDC\u2019s resources and penological interests. Finally, the court noted that NCDC already offers an alternative, allowing unlimited daily mailings of less than ten pages. Thus, it ruled Lewis\u2019s complaint failed to state a constitutional claim. <em>See Gee, </em>627 F.3d at 1185 (holding a First Amendment claim of interference with the mail is not plausible absent factual allegations showing the alleged interference violated prison rules or the rule was invalid under <em>Turner)'.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">On appeal, Lewis asserts NCDC\u2019s safety concerns are exaggerated and asserts other types of mail pose greater concerns than mailings over ten pages. Again, we agree with the district court\u2019s analysis and conclusion that Lewis\u2019s complaint doesn\u2019t state facts that plausibly indicate the page limits lack a rational connection to a legitimate penological interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Waived Arguments. Lewis asks that we reverse the denial of his second motion to amend his amended complaint and his motion to compel interrogatories. In a nondis-positive pretrial order, the magistrate judge denied these motions. Lewis failed to file any objection or appeal from that order to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Magistrate judges are authorized to decide nondispositive pretrial matters pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), and it is well established that we can\u2019t review a magistrate judge\u2019s order under \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A) unless the party requesting review timely objected to the order. <em>Pippinger v. Rubin, </em>129 F.3d 519, 533 (10th Cir. 1997); <em>see also </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a) (requiring parties to file written objections to a. magistrate judge\u2019s order on a nondis-positive matter with the district court within fourteen days). In contrast to the notice and warning requirement that exists for pro se parties when a magistrate judge issues a report and recommendation regarding a dispositive matter under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(l)(B)-(C), <em>see Moore v. United States, </em>950 F.2d 656, 659 (10th Cir. 1991), it is immaterial that the magistrate judge\u2019s order didn\u2019t warn Lewis of the consequences of failing to file objections with the district court. <em>See Caidor v. Onondaga Cty., </em>517 F.3d 601, 604-05 (2d Cir. 2008) (noting that, in contrast to Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2), Rule 72(a) contains an express waiver provision that pro se liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>gants should be aware of, and holding that <em>\u201ca pro se </em>litigant who fails to object timely to a magistrate judge\u2019s order on a non-dispositive matter waives the right to appellate review of that order, even absent express notice from the magistrate judge that failure to object within ten days will preclude appellate review\u201d); <em>United States v. Schultz, </em>565 F.3d 1353, 1362 (11th Cir. 2009) (same). Accordingly, these arguments are waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Individual-Capacity Claims. Lewis didn\u2019t \u00f1le a response to the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss filed by Clark in his individual capacity. The district court ruled that Lewis\u2019s complaint fails to state any individual-capacity claim against Clark both because he didn\u2019t allege any personal participation by Clark in any of the alleged constitutional violations and because he hadn\u2019t plausibly stated any claim that his constitutional rights were violated. The district court also dismissed Lewis\u2019s claims against the remaining defendants, all of whom were unnamed deputies, because he failed to name any, despite the information in the <em>Martinez </em>report. We discern no error in the district court\u2019s analysis of these claims, and affirm the dismissal of the individual-capacity claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-17\">Lewis\u2019s motion for leave to file a second supplemental opening brief is denied. We also deny his request that we stay this appeal so that he may file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s order. We grant his request to proceed in forma pauperis, but we remind him that he is obligated to continue making partial payments until the entire fee has been paid. The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b718-12\"><em> </em>After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-20\">.
