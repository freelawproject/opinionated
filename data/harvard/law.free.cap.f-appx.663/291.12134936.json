Bostick, in his official capacity as Chief of the Engineers, relating to the Corps\u2019 authorization of a wetland-fill project in Louisiana\u2019s Atchafalaya Basin. Plaintiffs asserted that the Corps could not authorize the project under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Both parties subsequently moved for summary judgment. The district court ultimately granted summary judgment for the Corps, concluding that the Corps\u2019 authorization of the project did not violate the CWA or the NEPA, Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s decision citing newly discovered evidence. Finding that Plaintiffs presented the same evidence and arguments as they had in their summary judgment briefing, the district court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration. Plaintiffs timely appealed that denial. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the Order and Reasons denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">The instant appeal arises from a suit filed by Plaintiffs-Appellants Atchafalaya Basinkeeper and Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association-West (collectively, Plaintiffs) against Defendants-Appellees United States Army Corps of Engineers and Lieutenant General Thomas P. Bos-tick, in his official capacity as Chief of the Engineers (collectively, Corps) on March 20, 2014. The suit challenged the Corps\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>2012 decision to authorize Expert Oil &amp; Gas\u2019s (Expert Oil) request to build a ring levee and access road in the Atchafalaya Basin to facilitate Expert Oil\u2019s drilling of an oil well. Plaintiffs claimed that Expert Oil\u2019s project impaired their recreational, commercial, and aesthetic enjoyment of the Atchafalaya Basin by blocking navigation and fishing in the area. As relevant to this appeal, Plaintiffs argued that the project could not have been authorized under the NEPA or under the terms of a regional general permit issued by the Corps\u2014 pursuant to the CWA\u2014that regulated the construction of oilfield facilities in the wetlands of the Atchafalaya Basin (NOD-13 or the General Permit).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In particular, Plaintiffs alleged that the project did not meet special conditions set forth in the General Permit limiting the scope of work the Corps could authorize, because the project (1) involved work within a mile of a wildlife management area, (2) intruded upon a critical habitat of the Louisiana Black Bear, (3) would lead to the construction of a permanent road, and (4) was contiguous to a previously authorized project, namely a road built in 2000. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief and vacatur of the Corps\u2019 authorization on the grounds that the authorization was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law, in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on their claims on February 26, 2015, reiterating the arguments pressed in their Complaint. As part of their motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs proffered arguments and exhibits to bolster their assertions that Expert Oil\u2019s construction project was not authorized by the General Permit, Plaintiffs specifically adduced (1) a note allegedly showing that the Corps recognized Expert Oil\u2019s access road would be permanent; (2) maps showing that a wildlife management area was located within a mile of the project site; and .(3) affidavits attesting that the 2012 project was contiguous to a road built in 2000 that interfered with boat access in the area. The Corps subsequently filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that Plaintiffs lacked standing and, alternatively, that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by laches or unfounded as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">On June 19, 2015, the district court entered its order on summary judgment, concluding that Plaintiffs had standing and that their claims were not barred by laches but rejecting Plaintiffs\u2019 CWA and NEPA claims on the' merits. With respect the General Permit, the court found that the construction project did not violate the General Permit and rebutted a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. In particular, the court concluded that: (1) Expert Oil\u2019s allegedly permanent road could, in fact, be degraded and removed; (2) the Corps owned the portion of the wildlife management area near the project site; (3) the placement of Expert Oil\u2019s road contiguous to the 2000 road was permissible under the terms of the General Permit because it presented the \u201cleast damaging practicable alternative\u201d; and (4) the project site did not encompass the habitat of the Louisiana Black Bear. The district court entered judgment on July 1, 2015, dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 suit with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Plaintiffs initially filed their motion for reconsideration on July 30, 2015,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming that the Corps failed to inform the court that the contiguous road built in 2000 had never been broken down and that the Corps did not actually manage the portion of the wildlife management area near the project site despite owning that land. Plaintiffs also asserted that work on the Expert Oil project was affecting a nearby Louisiana Black Bear habitat. In support of their motion, Plaintiffs attached maps and pictures of the 2000 road work, a map showing the nearby wildlife management area, and a copy of a webpage stating that the Corps owned land in the Atchafalaya Basin but that the land was managed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The district court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration on September 23, 2015. The district court found that Plaintiffs did not adduce any previously unavailable evidence, demonstrate a manifest error of law or fact in the district court\u2019s original order, or provide evidence that the Corps actually misrepresented or withheld evidence. Moreover, the district court noted that the exhibits attached to the motion for reconsideration provided information similar to evidence that the district court had previously considered in ruling on summary judgment. Plaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s order denying their motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">In general, the. \u201cgrant or denial of a Rule 59(e) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Fletcher v. Apfel, </em>210 F.3d 510, 512 (5th Cir. 2000).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cUnder this standard of review, the district court\u2019s decision and decision making process need only be reasonable.\u201d <em>Templet v. HydroChem Inc., </em>367 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir. 2004). We have noted that Rule 59(e) motions \u201cserve the narrow purpose of allowing a party to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Waltman v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>875 F.2d 468, 473 (5th Cir. 1989) (internal quotation marks and eitation omitted). In light of this narrow purpose, we have further observed that \u201c[rjeconsideration of a judgment after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>its entry is an extraordinary remedy that should be used sparingly.\u201d <em>Templet, </em>367 F.3d at 479. Accordingly, a motion for reconsideration \u201cis not the proper vehicle for rehashing evidence, legal theories, or arguments that could have been offered or raised before the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">III. DENIAL OF THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">On appeal, Plaintiffs only challenge the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for reconsideration based on new evidence, not the underlying merits of the district court\u2019s summary judgment order. In particular, Plaintiffs argue that the district court failed to consider newly submitted evidence by Plaintiffs that showed that the Corps materially misrepresented various facts to the district court. We find, however, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Plaintiffs did not point to any \u201cmanifest errors of law\u201d in moving for reconsideration, but instead presented what they deemed \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d allegedly demonstrating that the Corps made material misrepresentations to the district court. <em>Wattman, </em>875 F.2d at 473. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments both at the district court and here on appeal are unavailing. A review of the evidence in question demonstrates that it was a recitation of information that Plaintiffs had already included in their summary judgment briefing and of which the district court was already made aware. On appeal, Plaintiffs assert that the newly discovered evidence shows that (1) a wildlife management area is near Expert Oil\u2019s project, (2) a permanent elevated road built in 2000 is near the project and blocks access for fishermen in the area, and (3) the project affects a critical habitat for the Louisiana Black Bear. Plaintiffs also point to maps, affidavits, and the Corps\u2019 own documents allegedly indicating that the Corps knew of\u2014but failed to inform the district court of\u2014problems with the permanence of Expert Oil\u2019s project and the road contiguous to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">This evidence is not new. Plaintiffs submitted similar maps and affidavits in support of their motion for summary judgment. And the district court was aware of and recognized the points raised by this evidence in its summary judgment order, addressing therein the alleged permanence of Expert Oil\u2019s project, the 2000 road contiguous to the project, and the nearby \u25a0wildlife management area. Moreover, while Plaintiffs assert that new evidence showed the project\u2019s effect on a critical habitat of the Louisiana Black Bear, Plaintiffs did not support this assertion with any evidence as part of their motion for reconsideration and do not do so now on appeal. It is clear then that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration did not seek to present new evidence but rather sought to rehash points and arguments already presented at summary judgment briefing. This is not enough to require a district court to exercise the \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d of reconsidering its order entering judgment. <em>Tem-plet, </em>367 F.3d at 479. The district court therefore did not abuse its' discretion in denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the Order and Reasons denying reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-5\">. Under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(e)\u2014a subsection of the CWA\u2014the Corps may issue what are known as \"generdl permits\u201d on a \"state, regional, or nationwide basis,\u201d which allow a category of activities that discharge dredged or fill material into the navigable waters of the United States, like the Atchafalaya Basin. 33 U.S.C, \u00a7 1344(e). General permits may only be granted where the Corps concludes, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, that the activities in question will have minimal adverse effects on the environment, both cumulatively and separately. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1344(e)(1). General permits are valid for five years, after which they may be revoked or modified upon another opportunity for public hearing. <em>Id. </em>The General Permit at issue here was first issued by the Corps\u2019 New Orleans District Office in 1981 and includes a number of special conditions on any approval of oil drilling associated work in the wetlands of the New Orleans District.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-10\">. Plaintiffs also asserted NEPA and CWA causes of action related to the Corps\u2019 alleged failure to hold a hearing or to provide public notice as to the authorization of Expert Oil\u2019s construction project. Because these claims are not relevant to the instant appeal, we do not discuss them further. .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-5\">. Plaintiffs refiled the motion on August 7, 2015, because of a deficiency in the initial motion. The district court looked at the date of the initial filing, however, and determined that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration was filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) rather than Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). <em>Compare </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) (dealing with motions filed within 28 days from the entry of judgment), <em>with </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (dealing with motions filed more than 28 days but less than one year from the entry of judgment), Neither party takes issue with the district court\u2019s characterization of the motion for reconsideration, so we accept that the motion was filed pursuant to Rule 59(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b314-10\">. However, \"if a party appeals from the denial of a Rule 59(e) motion <em>that is solely a motion to reconsider a judgment on its merits, de novo </em>review is appropriate.\u201d <em>Fletcher, </em>210 F.3d at 512 (first emphasis added). Plaintiffs\u2019 motion was not <em>solely </em>to reconsider the district court\u2019s judgment on its merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
