In 2011, Hicks was sentenced to 240 months of imprisonment, which sentence was (i) within the guidelines range then applicable to Hicks\u2019s offense, based on the sentencing court\u2019s finding that the offense involved 510 grams of crack cocaine and (ii) the mandatory minimum sentence applicable to offenders who, like Hicks, had a prior felony conviction. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). In denying Hicks\u2019s motion, the district court held that Hicks was \u201cnot eligible for a reduction in sentence due to the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment to which [he] was sentenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">On appeal, Hicks argues that he is eligible for a two-level reduction in his offense level, based on the retroactive application of the lowered offense levels, under the drug-trafficking guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5) (Nov. 2015), which were implemented through Amendments' 782 and 788 to the Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Supp. to App. C, Amends. 782 and 788. Hicks further argues that, although the sentencing court found that he was subject to a minimum mandatory sentence of 20 years of imprisonment, the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (FSA), applies to him under the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. 260, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). Because the FSA applies to him, he argues that his mandatory minimum sentence should be 10 years instead of 20 years, because \u201cthe amount of crack alleged in his indictment\u201450 grams or more\u2014subjected him to a recidivist minimum of 10 years, not 20 years.\u201d Hicks further argues that the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s finding that Hicks\u2019s relevant conduct involved 510 grams of crack did not alter the applicable mandatory minimum,\u201d because \u201c[t]he mandatory minimum is based on the amount alleged in the indictment, not the amount found by the sentencing court.\u201d As a result, Hicks maintains that he is eligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>for resentencing under the lowered offense levels set forth in amended \u00a7 2D1.1, which would result in a sentencing range of 168 to 210 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a defendant\u2019s sentence may be modified if he was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (2009). Section 3582(c)(2) applies only to retroactive guidelines amendments as set forth in \u00a7 lB1.10(a). <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Amendments 782 and 788 apply retroactively. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(d). The Supreme Court has prescribed a two-step inquiry for a district court that is considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683. The district court must first determine whether the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under' \u00a7 1B1.10 and then may proceed to consider whether a reduction is warranted in whole or in part under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing factors. <em>Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision \u201cwhether to reduce a sentence pursuant to ... \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, ... its interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA court abuses its discretion when the court makes an error of law or bases its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. When a court in applying its discretion fails to consider the factors as required by law, it also abuses its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines has the retroactive effect of reducing Hicks\u2019s base offense level and, by extension, his total offense level and guidelines range. However, Hicks is not eligible for a reduction in his sentence to the extent that the reduced sentence would be \u201cless than any statutorily required minimum sentence.\u201d \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir. 1994) (holding that a mandatory minimum statutory penalty overrides the retroactive application of a new guideline).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Dorsey, </em>the FSA applies to Hicks because he was sentenced after the FSA\u2019s effective date. 132 S.Ct. at 2329. Hicks argues that, by virtue of the fact that his indictment only alleged that he was responsible for 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, he does not meet the 280 gram threshold required for a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years under the FSA for offenders with a prior felony drug conviction. At the same time, however, the sentencing court found Hicks responsible for 510 grams of crack cocaine\u2014far in excess of the FSA\u2019s 280 gram threshold\u2014 which would mandate a minimum 20-year sentence regardless of the application of the FSA. Thus, crucial to Hicks\u2019s claim that the FSA applies to reduce Hicks\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence, is his argument that the drug quantity alleged in the indictment\u2014and not the drug quantity subject to judicial factfinding\u2014controls in his \u00a7 3582 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">In support of his argument that the drug quantity alleged in the indictment controls, Hicks cites the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), which was handed down while Hicks\u2019s appeal was pending. In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court held that any fact that increases a mandatory minimum sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>for a crime is an \u201celement\u201d of the crime that must be found by a jury. 133 S.Ct. at 2162-63. Thus, although Hicks grounds his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in the sentencing changes wrought by Amendment 782, his motion cannot succeed without this court\u2019s application of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Alleyne. </em>However, any reduction in Hicks\u2019s sentence based on an application of <em>Alleyne </em>here would impermissibly expand the limited scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings for two primary reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">First, while \u00a7 3582(c)(2) allows a defendant to file a motion to reduce his sentence based on appropriate retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, like Amendment 782, it does not allow a defendant to seek a reduction in his sentence based on new case law. Rather, the appropriate method to challenge a conviction or sentence which a defendant claims is unconstitutional under Supreme Court precedent is through a \u00a7 2255 petition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(a) (\u201cA prisoner ... claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States ... may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Second, any aspect of Hicks\u2019s sentence that was not affected by Amendment 782, such as his minimum mandatory sentence, is outside the scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683 (\u201c\u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a resentencing [and] instead, it permits a sentence reduction within the narrow bounds established by the Commission\u201d); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir. 1995) (\u201cA \u00a7 3582 motion is not ... a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir. 1994) (observing that a \u00a7\u25a0 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not the appropriate vehicle for relitigating a sentencing issue). Hicks\u2019s claim that he is eligible for resentencing because his sentence was based on a drug quantity not determined by a jury is not a claim based on a retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines and is therefore not cognizable under \u00a7 3582.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">For the foregoing reasons, Hicks has not established that the district court abused its discretion in denying Hicks\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and the district court\u2019s judgment is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-11\"> Pursuant to 5th CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
