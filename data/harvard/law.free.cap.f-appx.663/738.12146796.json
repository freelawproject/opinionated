Flores, Barzee Flores, Miami, FL, Lenzy Johnson, Co\u00edeman, FL, for Defendant-Appellant</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b758-20\">Before WILSON, ROSENBAUM, and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b758-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b758-22\">Lenzy Johnson appeals his 180 month sentence, claiming that his enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii)) was erroneously imposed because his underlying Florida controlled substance convictions were not \u201cserious drug offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">When appropriate, we will \u201creview <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction is a serious drug offense within the meaning of the ACCA.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir. 2009). Because Johnson failed to preserve the issue for appeal, however, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir. 2005). To establish plain error, Johnson must show that (1) there is an error, (2) that is plain or obvious, (3) affecting his substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>Further, the prior precedent rule holds that a prior panel\u2019s ruling is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is overruled by the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc. United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347,1352 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Under \u00a7 924(e), if a defendant is convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and he has three previous convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense, the mandatory minimum prison sentence increases from 10 years to 15 years, or 180 months. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e); <em>see id., </em>\u00a7 924(a)(2). Under the Guidelines, where the \u00a7 924(e) applies and another computation is not greater, the defendant\u2019s offense level is 33. In addition, under \u00a7 4B 1.4(c), a minimum criminal-history category of IV applies. <em>See id., </em>\u00a7 4B1.4(c)(l)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">A \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACL\">(i) an offense under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.), or chapter 705 of title 46, for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law; <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">(ii) <em>an offense under State law, involving </em>manufacturing, distributing, or <em>possessing with intent </em>to manufacture or <em>distribute, a controlled substance ..., for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(i)-(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Florida law punishes the sale, manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to sell, manufacture cocaine as a second degree felony. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l). Second-degree felonies are punishable by up to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 775.082(3)(d). The sale, manufacture, delivery, or possession, with intent to sale, of marijuana is a third degree felony. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2). Third-degree felonies are punishable up to five years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 775.082(3)(e). However, if a defendant commits qualifying underlying convictions, a sentence may be enhanced under the Florida habitual offender statute. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 775.084. A third degree felony is enhanced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, and a second degree felony is enhanced to thirty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 775.084(4)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">\u201cWhen determining whether a particular conviction qualifies as a serious drug offense under \u00a7 924(e), [this Court is] generally limited to a formal categorical approach, which looks \u2018only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense,\u2019 instead of the actual facts underlying the defendant\u2019s prior conviction.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>583 F.3d at 1295 (quoting <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2160, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">In <em>Descamps v. United States , </em>a defendant challenged his enhancement under the ACCA, arguing that his prior burglary offense was not a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2295, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). The Supreme Court held that courts may not apply the modified categorical approach to sentencing under the ACCA when the crime for which the defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of elements. <em>Id. </em>at-2281-82. Therefore, the Supreme Court found the defendant\u2019s California burglary conviction could not support enhancement under the ACCA because California\u2019s definition of burglary punished conduct outside of the generic definition of burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 2293.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>we faced a situation where a defendant argued that his prior Florida Statute \u00a7 893.13 convictions were not \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d under the ACCA. 775- F.3d 1262, 1266-67 (11th Cir. 2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2827, 192 L.Ed.2d 864 (2015). In finding that the convictions supported enhancement, we held that we \u201cneed not search for the elements of \u2018generic\u2019 definitions of \u2018seriops drug offense\u2019 \u201d because that term is \u201cdefined by a federal statute.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">In <em>Mellouli v. Lynch, </em>a defendant argued that his Kansas conviction for drug paraphernalia was not a qualifying conviction under the deportation statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227. \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1980, 1985, 192 L.Ed.2d 60 (2015). The Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction did not support deportation because no element of the defendant\u2019s Kansas conviction connected to an element under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 802. <em>Id. </em>at 1991. Significantly, the Court stated its application of the categorical approach in this case was reserved only for immigration cases. <em>Id. </em>at 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">Johnson\u2019s claim is foreclosed by the prior precedent rule and <em>Smith. </em>First, Johnson\u2019s reliance on <em>Descamps </em>is misguided because it was published prior to <em>i Smith </em>and thus <em>Smith </em>is presumed to have followed it. Further, under <em>Smith, </em>Johnson\u2019s prior \u00a7 893.13 convictions fall within the plain meaning of \u201cserious drug offense\u201d because his convictions were for possessing cocaine and marijuana, for which the maximum terms of imprisonment exceed 10 years. Johnson\u2019s reliance upon is <em>Mellouli </em>is also unwarranted. In that case, the defendant was a lawful permanent resident who was convicted of possession of drug paraphernalia. <em>Id. </em>at 1983. The case involved another state\u2019s statute (Kansas) being applied to an immigration statute, not the ACCA. The <em>Mellouli </em>decision is not on point both because it involves a state statute very different from Florida\u2019s \u00a7 893.13(l)(a), and also because it involves the immigration statute, again very different from the ACCA. <em>Mellouli </em>neither abrogates our <em>Smith </em>decision nor does it enable Johnson to surmount the hurdle of plain error review. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
