Kirkland, </em>627 Fed.Appx. 672, 678 (9th Cir. 2015) (unpublished disposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Our review is governed by the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Under AEDPA, we are limited to deciding whether the California Supreme Court\u2019s summary denial of habe-as relief was: (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d; or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2). When reviewing an ineffective assistance claim through the lens of habeas, our review is \u201cdoubly deferential.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 6, 124 S.Ct. 1, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003) (per curiam). \u201cThe pivotal question is whether the state court\u2019s application of the <em>Strickland </em>standard was unreasonable. This is different from asking whether defense counsel\u2019s performance fell below <em>Strickland's </em>standard.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 101, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Under this standard of review, we hold that the California Supreme Court did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland </em>in summarily denying Jenkins\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. Jenkins\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance is governed by the familiar two-part ineffective assistance of counsel test provided by the Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under that standard, Jenkins must first show that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Even if we assume that Jenkins\u2019s attorney undermined Jenkins\u2019s credibility (which the State contests), the California Supreme Court could have reasonably decided that counsel did not perform deficiently. <em>See Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 6, 124 S.Ct. 1, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003) (per curiam) (rejecting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim where an attorney called his client a \u201cbad person, lousy drug addict, stinking thief, [and] jail bird\u201d). Moreover, even if counsel performed deficiently, the California Supreme Court could have rejected Jenkins\u2019s claim because he failed to establish that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision denying Jenkins\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Jenkins\u2019s motion for leave to file his supplemental brief is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b574-12\">BYBEE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Amc5\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">At Petitioner Keelon Jenkins\u2019s murder trial, a vocal and dramatic dispute between Jenkins and his lawyer played out in front of the jury. Jenkins and his counsel agreed that Jenkins shot a Brink\u2019s truck guard after what he believed to be a staged robbery went awry,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but disagreed as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>the identity of the man who orchestrated that hold-up: Jenkins maintained\u2014and testified at trial\u2014that a man named Frank Valentine hatched the plot, while Jenkins\u2019s counsel repeatedly told the jury that a man named Anthony Young was responsible. Although I recognize that, under AEDPA, our review of Jenkins\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is \u201cdoubly deferential,\u201d <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. III, 123, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009), I nonetheless think Jenkins has shown that\u201cthe state court\u2019s application of the <em>Strickland </em>[v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) ] standard was unreasonable,\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 101, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). Accordingly, I would grant Jenkins\u2019s habeas petition and I respectfully dissent from my colleagues\u2019 decision holding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The conflict between Jenkins and his counsel over the identity of the man who masterminded the robbery repeatedly surfaced before and during the trial. For example, before his counsel could offer an opening statement to the jury, Jenkins objected and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">I\u2019ve repeatedly told counsel that I don\u2019t want him to give a statement that ... [accuses] someone I\u2019ve told him numerous times that has no involvement!.] ... What he\u2019s doing is contradicting my testimony which is going against me. Therefore, he\u2019s serving as the prosecution against my defense if he\u2019s going to do this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The court overruled Jenkins\u2019s objection and allowed his counsel to proceed with opening statements\u2014a statement counsel described to the jury as \u201cunconditionally unauthorized by [his] client who [did] not want [him] to make this statement.\u201d Jenkins\u2019s counsel then pointed the finger at Anthony Young, informed the jury that three witnesses would testify to Young\u2019s involvement in the staged hold-up, and explicitly prepared the jury to hear testimony from his client contradicting the theory that he had just laid out. As promised, Jenkins provided testimony at odds with his counsel\u2019s opening statement, explaining that Valentine masterminded the robbery-gone-wrong and denying that Young was involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Despite his representations to the contrary, however, Jenkins\u2019s counsel did not follow through with the presentation of evidence connecting Young\u2014rather than Valentine\u2014to the plot.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">By closing arguments, the prosecutor had keyed into this conflict, framing the trial as \u201call about credibility,\u201d and ripping into the disagreement between Jenkins and his counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-12\">And the problem I was having is that I\u2019m hearing too many masterminds. I\u2019m hearing Anthony Young, then I\u2019m hearing Frank Valentine, and then in [defense counsel\u2019s] opening statement he told you he proved several things that he was not able to prove [like] Anthony Young was the mastermind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5e\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-13\">[And that\u2019s] because somewhere midstream Frank Valentine came into the picture. And here\u2019s a simple question: How many innocent people have two different defenses? How many innocent people have different theories on how they got to that location? This is clearly a schism somewhere in the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhD\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9B\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>[Defense counsel] made a very interesting comment yesterday when he said he frankly didn\u2019t believe his client in that Frank Valentine was the mastermind. The reason why I find that interesting is because if Mr. Jenkins is going to lie to his attorney, what makes you think he\u2019s not willing to He to you because clearly they have different opinions as to how to beat this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">For his part, Jenkins\u2019s counsel doubled down during his closing argument on the discrepancy, reminding the jury once again that he thought his client was lying on the witness stand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">There are a number of theories of why [the defendants] went [to the scene of the robb\u00e9ry]. One is what they told you. Now, if you think that I believe everything that they said, you already know the answer to that because I started in my opening statement by telling you that I beHeve the person who set this up is someone other than the person about whom they testified. And I\u2019ve had disagreements with my client about that for years. Nonetheless, I believe that only because of the evidence in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The jury returned with a conviction for first-degree murder and the court sentenced Jenkins to life in prison without the possibihty of parole. In a summary denial, the California Supreme Court rejected Jenkins\u2019s habeas petition raising the ineffective assistance claim now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The majority holds that \u201cthe California Supreme Court could have reasonably decided that counsel did not perform defi-ciently,\u201d Mem. Dispo. 3. I disagree. Jenkins\u2019s counsel essentially called his client a liar in his opening and closing statements, and completely undermined Jenkins\u2019s testimony and credibiHty in front of the jury. And for what? As the prosecutor pointed out, Jenkins\u2019s counsel didn\u2019t even put up the evidence he promised to bring forward that would show that it was Young\u2014not Valentine\u2014who masterminded the staged robbery. It is one thing to defer to the good-faith strategic decisions of counsel; it is a very different thing to endorse counsel\u2019s decision to present a theory of defense that he did not prove and that explicitly contradicted the testimony put forward by his client. Because Jenkins\u2019s counsel impeached the credibility of his own client without offering alternative evidence to repair the damage he caused, I think counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">I also think it is clear that counsel\u2019s inadequate performance prejudiced Jenkins\u2019s defense. The Supreme Court has explained that to demonstrate prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d and defined \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d as \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Here, the jury required three days of deliberations' to reach a verdict on facts that\u2014save for the staged-robbery/felony-murder question\u2014 were relatively straightforward. Additionally, as outlined above, the prosecutor capitalized on the conflict between Jenkins and his counsel, repeatedly calling Jenkins\u2019s truthfulness into question and making \u201ccredibility\u201d the centerpiece of his case and his closing argument. Finally, because Jenkins\u2019s counsel decided to destroy his client\u2019s defense theory without providing an alternate theory in its place, he left Jenkins without much of a defense at all. Under these facts\u2014and even considering AEDPA\u2019s demanding standard of review\u2014 I think Jenkins has adequately demonstrated that his counsel\u2019s actions have \u201cun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>dermine[d] confidence in the outcome\u201d of his trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\">. The defense theory was that Jenkins had been informed by the man that coordinated the staged robbery that the Brinks guard was in on the plot and would help facilitate the theft of money from his truck in exchange for a cut of the loot. Because Jenkins believed that the robbery was staged, the defense team posited, he had not committed murder during the commission of a felony and was therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>not liable for first-degree murder under the felony-murder rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b575-14\">. Robert McDaniels, Jenkins\u2019s co-defendant, also testified that Young had no involvement and that Valentine planned the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b577-20\">. I concur, however, in the majority's deci-' sion to grant Jenkins's motion for leave to file his supplemental brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
