Rogers also appeals his 24-month sentence, imposed\u2014pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)\u2014upon revocation of his supervised release. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Rogers was convicted in 2003 of two federal sex offenses, for which he was sentenced to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release. After serving his term of imprisonment, Rogers moved into his brother\u2019s house in Alabama and began his term of supervised release. In May 2011, Rogers registered as a sex offender in Jefferson County, Alabama. On his registration form, Rogers listed his address as being his brother\u2019s house. Rogers also listed himself as unemployed. On 31 October 2011, Rogers updated his registration information, reflecting that he was then employed by CLP Resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">In mid-November 2011, Rogers moved out of his brother\u2019s house. Rogers failed to notify either his probation officer or Jefferson County of his move. Law enforcement officers were unable to locate Rogers during their initial investigation, but later learned in 2014 that Rogers was. living in Mexico. Rogers was arrested ultimately in March 2015, when he attempted to reenter the United States from Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Following a jury trial, Rogers was convicted of failing to update his registration under SORNA. The district court also revoked Rogers\u2019s supervised release based on Rogers\u2019s failure to submit monthly reports to his probation officer and based on Rogers\u2019s violation of Alabama\u2019s sex offender laws. Rogers was sentenced to 60 months for his SORNA-related offense and to 24 months for his supervised release violation. The sentences are to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">On appeal, Rogers contends that insufficient evidence exists to support his conviction under section 2250(a). Rogers also challenges his above-guidelines sentences as substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">We review de novo a defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cviewing] the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing] all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d United States v. Klopf, 423 F.3d 1228,1236 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201cThe evidence is sufficient to support a conviction if, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original) (quotations omitted). \u201cWhere the government relies on circumstantial evidence, reasonable inferences, and not mere speculation, must support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">At trial, the parties stipulated both that Rogers was a \u201csex offender\u201d for purposes of SORNA and that Rogers was required to register under SORNA. Thus, to obtain a conviction for violation of section 2250(a), the government had to prove only that Rogers knowingly failed to register or to update his registration as required by SORNA. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a). Under SORNA, a sex offender is required to register and to \u201ckeep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913(a). To keep his registration current, a sex offender must appear in person\u2014\u201cnot later than 3 business days after each change of name, residence, employment, or student status\u201d\u2014to update all changes to his registration information. Id. \u00a7 16913(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">Evidence introduced at trial demonstrates that (1) in May 2011, Rogers\u2019s reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>istration listed him as unemployed; (2) in October 2011, Rogers updated his registration to reflect that he was then employed by CLP Resources; (3) a recruiter with CLP Resources testified that Rogers worked for the company for about five or six months; (4) the recruiter testified that he last spoke with Rogers in Fall of 2011; and (5) in mid-November 2011 Rogers moved out of the house that he had listed as his place of residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The government contends this evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that Rogers remained in Alabama for some time after moving out of his brother\u2019s house and before moving to Mexico. As a result, the government asserts that Rogers\u2019s failure to update his change of residence violated SORNA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, it is reasonable to infer that Rogers began working for CLP Resources in October 2011 (when he updated his employment status on his registration) and that Rogers continued working for CLP Resources for five or six months. Under that construction of the evidence, Rogers remained employed within Alabama\u2014and thus, subject to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements\u2014until March or April of 2012: well after he moved his residence in mid-November 2011. Because a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Rogers failed to update his registration within three days of changing his residence, despite continuing to live and work in Alabama, sufficient evidence exists to support Rogers\u2019s conviction. See Klopf, 423 F.3d at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">On appeal, Rogers disputes the government\u2019s construction of the evidence. Rogers argues, instead, that the evidence could also support a reasonable alternative inference that he began working for CLP Resources in the summer of 2011, worked for five or six months until mid-November 2011, and then moved out of his brother\u2019s house and moved directly to Mexico. Rogers concedes, however, that under his alternative interpretation of the evidence, he failed to update his change of employment within three days of beginning work for CLP Resources. Thus, sufficient evidence still exists from which a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Rogers failed to comply with SORNA\u2019s registration requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Athough the evidence does not demonstrate conclusively when Rogers began working for CLP Resources or when Rogers in fact moved to Mexico, \u201c[t]he jury is free to choose between or among the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the evidence presented at trial.\u201d See United States v. Molina, 443 F.3d 824, 828 (11th Cir. 2006). \u201cThe prosecution need not rebut all reasonable hypotheses other than guilt.\u201d Id. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict, sufficient evidence exists to support Rogers\u2019s conviction under either reasonable construction of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">On appeal, Rogers also contends that the government failed to present adequately to the jury the theory that Rogers violated SORNA by failing to update his employment status. We have said that we will not affirm a criminal conviction based on a theory not contained in the indictment or not presented to the jury. United States v. Elkins, 885 F.2d 775, 782 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>1989). But \u201cthat simply means that a court cannot permit a defendant to be tried on charges that are not made in the indictment against him.\u201d United States v. Hill, 643 F.3d 807, 859-60 (11th Cir. 2011) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Here, the indictment charged Rogers with failing to update his registration as required by SORNA \u201cby failing to appear in person in at least one jurisdiction in which the defendant was required to be registered and inform that jurisdiction of all changes in the information required, including, but not limited to, the defendant\u2019s residence.\u201d (emphasis added). The indictment encompassed clearly both theories of guilt: that Rogers violated section 2250(a) by failing to update properly either his change of residence or his change of employment. Rogers was, thus, not convicted of a charge not contained in the indictment nor did the indictment fail to provide Rogers adequate notice of the charges against him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Because a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Rogers\u2014in violation of section 2250(a)\u2014 failed to update his registration under SORNA, we affirm Rogers\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence\u2014whether one inside or outside the guidelines range\u2014under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. United States v. Pugh, 515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">When a sentence is above the guidelines range, we \u201cmay consider the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d United States v. Williams, 526 F.3d 1312,1322 (11th Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted). \u2018We may vacate a sentence because of the variance only if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d United States v. Shaw, 560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted). \u201c[T]hat we might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">Rogers has failed to demonstrate that his above-guidelines sentences are substantively unreasonable. As an initial matter, Rogers\u2019s total sentence of 84 months is well below the total statutory maximum sentence of 144 months. See United States v. Valnor, 451 F.3d 744, 75152 (11th Cir. 2006) (affirming an upward variance in part because the ultimate sentence was appreciably below the statutory maximum sentence). That the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>court varied upward by 10 and 19 months over Rogers\u2019s advisory guidelines ranges of 8 to 14 months and 33 to 41 months, respectively, demonstrates no clear error of judgment: we have affirmed as reasonable upward variances of similar or greater degrees. See, e.g., United States v. Tome, 611 F.3d 1371, 1378-79 (11th Cir. 2010) (affirming a 24-month sentence where the advisory guidelines range for revocation of supervised release was 4 tolO months); United States v. Brown, 772 F.3d 1262, 1267 (11th Cir. 2014) (affirming a 240-month sentence where the advisory guidelines range was 78 to 97 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">About Rogers\u2019s sentence for violation of his supervised release, the district court explained that an above-guidelines sentence was necessary in the light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, Rogers\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need to protect the public from Rogers\u2019s future offenses. The record demonstrates that Rogers had prior convictions for receiving and attempting to receive child pornography, mailing obscene material, sexual battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping, and for armed robbery with a deadly weapon. Rogers also committed two separate violations of his supervis\u00e9d release, including committing a new criminal offense while on supervised release. On this record, the district court abused no discretion in determining that an above-guidelines sentence was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Rogers has also failed to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in imposing an above-guidelines sentence for Rogers\u2019s failure to update his SORNA registration. Rogers\u2019s criminal history supports the district court\u2019s characterization of Rogers as a \u201cviolent individual\u201d and \u201can absolute predator and sex offender.\u201d The conduct underlying Rogers\u2019s convictions for sexual battery, kidnapping, armed robbery, and armed robbery with a deadly weapon include that Rogers slashed the tires of a truck, struck a man with a glass bottle, and raped a woman. Rogers\u2019s later convictions for attempted receipt of child pornography and for mailing obscene material were based on Rogers having sent sexually explicit images to, and having requested similar images from, a person whom he believed was a 14-year old girl he had met in an online chatroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">The district court also explained that an upward variance was necessary in the light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, as well as Rogers\u2019s continued violation of the terms of his supervised release, his complete lack of remorse,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and his lack of respect for the law. The reasons articulated by the district court for imposing an upward variance are sufficient to permit meaningful review. See United States v. Suarez, 939 F.2d 929, 934 (11th Cir. 1991). Viewing the record as a whole, we cannot say that Rogers\u2019s above-guidelines sentence was unreasonable or that \u201cthe district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d See Shaw, 560 F.3d at 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-6\">. In the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Nichols v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1113, 194 L.Ed.2d 324 (2016), the government has abandoned expressly its argument that Rogers was required by SOR-NA to report to Alabama his change of residence to Mexico.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-11\">. Rogers presents no substantive argument challenging the variance between the dates charged in the indictment (charging Rogers with failing to update his registration beginning \"on or about\u201d 22 December 2011), and the date that Rogers allegedly failed to update either his change in residence (mid-November 2011), or his change in employment (summer of 2011), Arguments not raised \"plainly and prominently\u201d on appeal are abandoned. United States v. Jernigan, 341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n.8 (11th Cir. 2003), Moreover, the discrepancy in the date of Rogers\u2019s charged offense would not warrant reversal. See United States v. Harrell, 737 F.2d 971, 981 (11th Cir. 1984) (\u201cA variance between dates alleged and dates proved will not trigger reversal ... as long as the date proved falls within the statute of limitations and before the return date of the indictment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b890-6\">. We reject Rogers\u2019s argument that his lack of remorse was already accounted for in his guidelines range. In imposing a variance under section 3553(a), the court can permissibly consider conduct that already has been considered in calculating the guidelines range. See Williams, 526 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
