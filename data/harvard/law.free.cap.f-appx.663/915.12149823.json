On appeal, Defendant argues that he should not have been sentenced under the ACCA because neither his false imprisonment nor his manslaughter conviction is a valid ACCA predicate. We agree that, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551,192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), the ACCA enhancement is no longer applicable to Defendant. Accordingly, we vacate Defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for sentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">Defendant pled guilty in January 2014 to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The pre-sentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended that Defendant\u2019s sentence be enhanced under the ACCA based on his prior Florida convictions for: (1) false imprisonment in violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 787.02, (2) manslaughter with a firearm in violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 782.07(1), and (3) possession of cocaine with intent to sell. Based on the recommendation in the PSR, the district court applied the ACCA enhancement and sentenced Defendant to 180 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-16\">Defendant appealed the sentence. Subsequently, Defendant\u2019s prior appellate counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 745, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) and moved to withdraw from representing Defendant. Defendant submitted a <em>pro se </em>response to the <em>Anders </em>brief, in which he argued that he did not have three qualifying predicate convictions as required to support a sentence enhancement, under the ACCA. Specifically, Defendant argued that his Florida false imprisonment and manslaughter convictions did not qualify as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under the ACCA. Based on then-governing case law, we granted prior appellate counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>An-ders </em>and affirmed Defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-17\">Thereafter, Defendant filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted the petition, vacated this Court\u2019s decision, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of its intervening decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), invalidating the ACCA\u2019s residual clause as unconstitutionally vague. <em>Driver v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2943, 192 L.Ed.2d 963 (2015). On remand, this Court appointed the Federal Public Defender to represent Defendant and ordered supplemental briefing as to how the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson </em>impacted this appeal. The Court directed the parties to address in their supplemental briefing whether (1) Defendant\u2019s false imprisonment and manslaughter convictions qualified as predicates under the ACCA\u2019s \u201celements clause\u201d and (2) plain error or another standard of review applied to the district court\u2019s application of the ACCA enhancement under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">The parties responded to the Court\u2019s order with a joint letter brief indicating that they agreed the ACCA enhancement did not apply to Defendant following <em>Johnson </em>and requesting that Defendant\u2019s case be remanded to the district court for re-sentencing, However, the letter brief did not answer the questions posed to the parties and did not contain any argument or analysis as to why <em>Johnson </em>precluded the application of the ACCA. Thus, after reviewing the letter brief, the Court issued a second order requesting briefing on these issues. The Court noted in its second order that false imprisonment and manslaughter do not fall with the ACCA\u2019s list of enumerated violent felonies under the ACCA and, as a result of <em>Johnson, </em>cannot qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, but that they might nevertheless qualify as violent felonies under the elements clause if they are defined to include the use of physical force as a necessary element.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">The parties now have filed a second joint letter brief in which they again argue that Defendant is not subject to an ACCA-enhanced sentence because, in light of <em>Johnson, </em>neither Defendant\u2019s false imprisonment nor his manslaughter conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">The parties agree that we review Defendant\u2019s newly raised Johnson-based challenge to his ACCA sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018 (11th Cir. 2005) (stating that we review constitutional objections \u201cnot raised before the district court only for plain error\u201d). For an error to be plain, it must be \u201ccontrary to explicit statutory provisions or to on-point precedent in this Court or the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Hoffman, </em>710 F.3d 1228, 1232 (11th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Assuming there is plain error, we have discretion to correct the error if it implicates the defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights\u201d and \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>743 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">II. The ACCA</p>\n<p id=\"b937-15\">A defendant who has been convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and who has at least three prior convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is subject to a sentencing enhancement under the ACCA. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Defendant concedes that he has one prior conviction that qualifies as a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d The determinative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>question for this appeal is whether Defendant\u2019s convictions for false imprisonment and manslaughter in violation of Florida Statute \u00a7\u00a7 787.02 and 782.07(1) qualify as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under the ACCA. Both convictions must qualify in order for Defendant to have the three predicates necessary to support an ACCA-enhanced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The ACCA defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include any crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-5\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-6\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The first prong is known as the \u201celements\u201d clause. <em>United States v. Seabrooks, </em>839 F.3d 1326 (11th Cir. 2016). The second prong contains an \u201cenumerated crimes\u201d clause and a \u201cresidual clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither false imprisonment nor manslaughter fall within the enumerated crimes clause and, as indicated above, the residual clause is no longer valid as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s' decision in <em>Johnson. See Johnson, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2563 (concluding that the ACCA\u2019s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague). Thus, Defendant is only subject to an ACCA enhancement if false imprisonment and manslaughter, as those crimes are defined by Florida Statute \u00a7\u00a7 787.02 and 782.07(1), have as an element \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">We generally use a categorical approach to determine whether a state conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate. <em>United States v. White, </em>837 F.3d 1225, 1229 (11th Cir. 2016). \u201cUnder this approach, we are concerned only with the fact of the conviction and the statutory definition of the offense, rather than with the particular facts of the defendant\u2019s crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a divisible statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> covers some conduct that falls within, and other conduct that is broader than, a predicate offense as defined by the ACCA, we may use a modified categorical approach to determine whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies. <em>See Mathis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 2249, 195 L.Ed.2d 604 (2016) (clarifying that a statute enumerating \u201cvarious factual means of committing a single element\u201d is not divisible). Under the modified categorical approach, we look to a limited class of documents\u2014known as <em>Shepard </em>documents and including reliable materials such as indictments and jury instructions\u2014to determine which alternative element was the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction and whether that element is encompassed by the ACCA predicate offense. <em>See Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">III. Defendant\u2019s False Imprisonment Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">First applying the categorical approach, we agree with the parties that a conviction for false imprisonment under Florida Statute \u00a7 787.02 does not categorically satisfy the ACCA\u2019s elements clause. The statute defines \u201cfalse imprisonment\u201d to mean \u201cforcibly, by threat, or secretly confining, abducting, imprisoning, or restraining another person without lawful authority and against her or his will.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 787.02(l)(a). In <em>United States v. Rosales-Bruno, </em>676 F.3d 1017 (11th Cir. 2012), we held that this language does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>necessarily require the \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d to support a conviction. <em>Rosales-Bruno, </em>676 F.3d at 1020-22. As we explained in <em>Rosales-Bruno, </em>the statute\u2019s \u201csecretly confining\u201d language and the interpreting Florida case law make it clear that \u00a7 787.02 can be violated \u201cwithout employing the type of \u2018physical force\u2019 contemplated\u201d by the elements clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1022. <em>Rosales-Bruno </em>analyzed the Florida false imprisonment statute in the context of the elements clause of the Sentencing Guidelines, but the same rationale applies to the identically-worded elements clause of the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d 1246, 1248 (11th Cir. 2012) (noting that the elements clause of the Guidelines \u201cis the same as the elements clause of the ... ACCA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">We further agree with the parties that the modified categorical approach cannot be applied in this particular case because the Government failed to enter any <em>Shepard </em>documents into evidence at Defendant\u2019s sentencing. The parties dispute whether \u00a7 787.02 is divisible, and thus whether use of the modified approach would ever be appropriate when analyzing a conviction under the statute for ACCA purposes. We need not\u2014and do not\u2014resolve that dispute because, even assuming that \u00a7 787.02 is divisible and that some convictions under the statute might qualify as ACCA predicates under the modified categorical approach, there are no <em>Shepard </em>documents in the record that would enable us to apply the approach to the particular false imprisonment conviction at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">IV. Plain Error</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">As noted, we held in <em>Rosales-Bnmo </em>that the crime of false imprisonment as defined by Florida Statute \u00a7 787.02 does not categorically satisfy the elements clause. <em>See Rosales-Bruno, </em>676 F.3d at 1020-22. The Government.did not produce any <em>Shepard </em>documents that would have enabled the district court to conclude that Defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 787.02 satisfied the elements clause under the modified categorical approach, and false imprisonment does not fall within the ACCA\u2019s \u201cenumerated crimes\u201d clause. Presumably, then, the district court relied upon the residual clause to conclude that Defendant\u2019s false imprisonment conviction qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Schneider, </em>681 F.3d 1273, 1282 (11th Cir. 2012) (concluding, prior to <em>Johnson, </em>that Florida false imprisonment qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause because it \u201cproduces a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson, </em>that was plain error. <em>See Jones, </em>743 F.3d at 829-30 (\u201can intervening decision by ... the Supreme Court squarely on point may make an error plain\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). And because Defendant now lacks the three predicate convictions necessary to support an ACCA sentencing enhancement, the error warrants correction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 830 (vacating and remanding for resentencing where the defendant did not have the \u201cthree qualifying convictions necessary\u201d for the ACCA sentencing enhancement he received as a result of an intervening Supreme Court decisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">For the reasons discussed above, we VACATE Defendant\u2019s sentence and RE<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>MAND the case for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-9\">. A divisible statute \u201csets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative.\u201d <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b939-8\">. Because our ruling as to the false imprisonment conviction resolves this appeal, we do not consider Defendant's alternative argument that his manslaughter conviction also does not qualify as a \"violent felony\u201d under the elements clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
