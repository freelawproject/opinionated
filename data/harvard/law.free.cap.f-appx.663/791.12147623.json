He argues that the district court erred when it included a $45,000 check found on a co-defendant\u2019s computer in the loss amount attributed to him under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b). He also argues that the district court erred when it imposed a four-level enhancement for being an organizer or leader of the criminal activity under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a),'</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of loss. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1197 (11th Cir. 2011). Where a fact pattern gives rise to two reasonable and different constructions, \u201cthe factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Saingerard, </em>621 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2010). Also, \u201c[flor a finding to be clearly erroneous, [we] must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant is held responsible for the loss that he \u201cknew or, under the circumstances, reasonably should have known, was a potential result of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(iv)). \u201cA defendant may be held responsible for the reasonably foreseeable acts of his co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Baldwin, </em>774 F.3d 711, 727 (11th Cir. 2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1882, 191 L.Ed.2d 753 (2015). \u201cA district court must determine the scope of the defendant\u2019s criminal activity prior to considering all reasonably foreseeable acts of co-conspirators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To determine the scope of a defendant\u2019s criminal activity, the district court may consider any explicit or implicit agreement \u201cfairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">The undisputed facts support the district court\u2019s decision to attribute the $45,000 check to Bush: it was \u201cin furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and [was] reasonably foreseeable\u201d to him. <em>See id. </em>at 731. The scope of the conspiracy included the creation of fraudulent checks using computer software, and Bush\u2019s chief role was to provide expertise on how to fabricate the checks. The conspiracy involved the use of checks that were drawn on multiple sources using a variety of names, including\u2014in at least one instance\u2014the real name of one of the conspirators. It was therefore reasonably foreseeable to Bush that files containing fraudulent checks would exist on Bolton\u2019s computer, even if the check was drawn on an account that was not used before and used Bolton\u2019s actual name. That the check was not in a format that was usable as a check when it was found does not mean that the conspirators had no intention or plan to convert the check to a useable format at some point in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">Given all the circumstances, the district court did not clearly err when it attributed the $45,000 check on Bolton\u2019s computer to Bush.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">We review for clear error the factual finding that a defendant was an organizer or leader. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344,1355 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), a district court may increase a defendant\u2019s offense level by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>four levels where \u201cthe defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). The government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant played such a role in the offense. <em>United States v. Glinton, </em>154 F.3d 1245, 1260 (11th Cir. 1998). In determining the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the district court must consider these factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">(1) [T]he exercise of decision making authority, (2) the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, (3) the recruitment of accomplices, (4) the claimed right , to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-6\"><em>United States v. Jennings, </em>599 F.3d 1241, 1253 (11th Cir. 2010); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SB1.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">It is not required, however, that all these considerations exist in any one case. <em>Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d at 1356. Moreover, the defendant \u201cdoes not have to be the sole leader or kingpin of the conspiracy in order to be considered an organizer or leader within the meaning of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d 1154, 1169 (11th Cir. 2002). For the enhancement to apply, the defendant must only have been the organizer or leader of at least one other participant. <em>Jennings, </em>599 F.3d at 1253; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.2). A defendant\u2019s subordinate role to another conspirator does not absolve him of the supervisory role he played in the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>933 F.2d 1541, 1546-47 (11th Cir. 1991) (affirming an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">The evidence supports the district court\u2019s determination that Bush was an organizer or leader of the criminal group: Bush satisfies many of the six factors. <em>See Jennings, </em>599 F.3d at 1253. Bush received-a greater portion of the proceeds and helped recruit runners. The runners reported to both Bush and Bolton for their assignments, and Bush gave instructions to the runners about where to cash the checks. Bush helped secure the stolen identities that the runners would assume to cash the checks. He also provided key advice to Bolton on how to plan and organize the check fabrication and the check cashings to help the criminal activity run more effectively. That Bush was not the only leader does not preclude the use of the enhancement. <em>See Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err when it imposed the four-level enhancement for being an organizer or leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
