On appeal, he argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to properly convey and explain a plea offer by the State. After a careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Plummer is currently serving a 15-year sentence for aggravated battery of a pregnant woman. Plummer contends that his trial counsel, John Eagan, failed to properly convey to him a seven-year plea offer by the State. The trial court record reflects a colloquy regarding the State\u2019s plea offer, in which Plummer acknowledged to the judge that he understood that the State\u2019s final plea offer was for seven years. During that colloquy, Plummer indicated confusion related to the consequences of the plea offer. His confusion was based on the \u201cGreen case\u201d: a case he researched and thought applied to him. The colloquy reflected that in light of his research, Plum-mer was interested in the plea offer, but that he had previously counter-offered a six-year deal, which the prosecutor rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">The post-conviction trial court held an evidentiary hearing, finding that Plum-mer\u2019s misunderstanding stemmed from his own research and did not result from his counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance. Furthermore, Eagan provided testimony as to his role in the plea bargaining process, and the court found his testimony credible. The state appellate court also concluded that the evidentiary hearing clearly refuted Plummer\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. Subsequently, Plummer filed his present habeas petition in district court. The district court agreed with the state courts and found that Eagan was not ineffective in regards to the plea offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">In examining the denial of a petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, \u201cwe review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact de novo, and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>476 F.3d 1193, 1208 (11th Cir. 2007). When a state court denies relief on a federal constitutional claim, we \u201cpresume that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d <em>See Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 99, 131 S.Ct. 770, 784-85, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). \u201cA state court\u2019s determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as \u2018fairminded jurists could disagree\u2019 on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562 U.S. at 101,131 S.Ct. at 786. This deferential standard is demanded by \u00a7 2254(d). <em>See id </em>at 100-01, 131 S.Ct. at 785-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">To make a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that: (1) his counsel\u2019s \u201cperformance was deficient\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced his defense.\u201d <em>Strick</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number><em>land v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687,104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In considering an ineffective assistance claim, we must \u201crecognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient only if it falls below the wide range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. <em>See id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">\u201cEstablishing that a state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>was unreasonable under \u00a7 2254(d) is all the more difficult. The standards created by <em>Strickland </em>and \u00a7 2254(d) are both highly deferential, and when the two apply in tandem, review is doubly so.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at 105, 131 S.Ct. at 788 (internal quotation marks omitted). This court has stated that this \u201cdouble deference is doubly difficult for a petitioner to overcome, and it will be a rare case in which an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that was denied on the merits in state court is found to merit relief in a federal habeas proceeding.\u201d <em>Downs v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>738 F.3d 240, 258 (11th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The district court did not err in concluding that it was reasonable for the state court to determine that the performance of Plummer\u2019s counsel was not ineffective. The trial transcript reflects that Plummer understood that a seven-year plea offer had been offered, and he had countered with a request for six-years. Thus, Eagan clearly informed Plummer about the offer. Moreover, Eagan\u2019s approach to the \u201cGreen case\u201d was not unreasonable. Plummer asserts that Eagan was ineffective because he did not \u201cunderstand\u201d the Green case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and how it was relevant to Plummer\u2019s plea offer. However, the Green case was overruled by the Florida legislature in 1990,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> well-before Plummer\u2019s offenses. It was thus clearly inapplicable to Plummer. Plummer does not show that the district court\u2019s conclusions were unreasonable, and fails to overcome the double deference standard. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Plummer\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\">.
