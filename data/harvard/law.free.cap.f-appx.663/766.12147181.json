Code \u00a7 17-17-5) (\u201cAct 761\u201d). Act 761 \u201cprohibit[s] a state or local government employee from arranging \u2018by payroll deduction or otherwise\u2019 the payment of any contribution to an organization that uses any portion of those contributions for \u2018political activity.\u2019\u201d <em>Ala. Educ. Ass\u2019n v. State Superintendent of Educ., </em>665 F.3d 1234, 1235 (11th Cir. 2011) <em>(\u201cAEA </em>/\u201d). The Act has birthed numerous federal and state court opinions. <em>See In re Mike Hubbard, </em>803 F.3d 1298, 1302-05 (11th Cir. 2015) (setting forth the background of Act 761 and its litigious history). Athough the overall procedural history of the Act 761 cases is somewhat complex, the procedural history central to this appeal is not. We are reviewing the district court\u2019s order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Act 761 violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine. For the following reason, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b788-13\">Plaintiffs/Appellants, the Aabama Education Association and others (referred to collectively as the \u201cAEA\u201d), filed a pre-enforcement complaint challenging Act 761 on the basis that it violated the First Amendment, Equal Protection, and Due Process. Two days before the Act\u2019s effective date in 2011, the district court entered a preliminary injunction at the AEA\u2019s request, finding that the Act was likely over-broad in violation of the First Amendment and void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause. Athough the AEA asserted an unconstitutional conditions claim in its complaint, the district court\u2019s grant of the preliminary injunction was not based on this claim. Various defendants appealed the district court\u2019s grant of the preliminary injunction. In its initial opinion, this court certified questions to the Supreme Court of Aabama and modified the injunction in the interim. <em>See AEA I, </em>665 F.3d at 1238-39. The Aabama Supreme Court answered the certified questions, <em>see State Superintendent of Educ. v. Ala. Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>144 So.3d 265, 274-78 (Ala. 2013) <em>(\u201cAEA II\u201d) </em>(clarifying that the Act only reached government-facilitated payments), and this court entered a second opinion, reversing the district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction. <em>See Ala. Educ. Ass\u2019n v. State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number><em>Superintendent of Educ., </em>746 F.3d 1135, 1139-40 (11th Cir. 2014) <em>(\u201cAEA III\u201d) </em>(holding that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of either their overbreadth claim or their void for vagueness challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Meanwhile, during the pending preliminary injunction appeal, the district court allowed discovery to proceed on the AEA\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim, although the claim was not explicitly stated in the complaint. As part of the AEA\u2019s discovery request, the district court ordered nonparty state legislative leaders to produce their legislative files concerning Act 761. These individuals filed petitions for writs of mandamus in this court, challenging the district court\u2019s refusal to quash AEA\u2019s subpoenas requesting their legislative files. This court held that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to quash the AEA\u2019s subpoenas. <em>See In re Mike Hubbard, </em>803 F.3d at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Although the district court allowed the AEA to proceed on its First Amendment retaliation claim, it dismissed the remaining claims under Rule 12(b)(6). Pertinent to the present appeal, in its order of dismissal, the district court found that the AEA plaintiffs failed to state an unconstitutional conditions claim upon which relief could be granted. Under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, \u201cthe government may not deny, a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected freedom of speech even if he has no entitlement to that benefit.\u201d <em>Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., </em>547 U.S. 47, 59, 126 S.Ct. 1297, 1306-07, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006) (internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted). The AEA\u2019s claim is founded on the contention that Act 761 places unconstitutional conditions on the availability of the benefit, the state mechanism \u2022for payroll deduction, to public employee organizations. In its complaint,- the AEA asserted that \u201c[a] public employee organization that wishes to avail itself of this benefit must not only refrain from engaging in constitutionally protected \u2018political activity\u2019 but must submit a certification to the \u2018appropriate government entity\u2019 promising that it will not use any dues collected through payroll deduction for any \u2018political activity.\u2019\u201d In its dismissal order, the district court relied on its preliminary injunction order in which it rejected the AEA\u2019s assertion that Act 761 violated the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">The Defendants, the Madison County Board of Education and others, contend that the district court properly dismissed the AEA\u2019s unconstitutional conditions claim, and they urge us to affirm based on the law of the case doctrine. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">\u201cUnder the \u2018law of the case\u2019 doctrine, the findings of fact and conclusions of law by an appellate court are generally binding in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal.\u201d <em>This That &amp; The Other Gift &amp; Tobacco, Inc. v. Cobb Cnty., Ga., </em>439 F.3d 1275, 1283 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting <em>Heathcoat v. Potts, </em>905 F.2d 367, 370 (11th Cir. 1990)). This doctrine also bars the rehashing of issues that were decided \u201cexplicitly or by necessary implication\u201d in a prior appeal. <em>Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, </em>403 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir. 2005); <em>Klay v. All Defendants, </em>389 F.3d 1191, 1198 (11th Cir. 2004); <em>In re Justice Oaks II, Ltd., </em>898 F.2d 1544, 1550 n.3 (11th Cir. 1990). \u201cThe doctrine\u2019s central purposes include bringing an end to litigation, protecting against the agitation of settled issues, and assuring that lower courts obey appellate orders.\u201d <em>This That &amp; The Other Gift &amp; Tobacco, Inc., </em>439 F.3d at 1283. There are only two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>ways a party can overcome the law of the case doctrine: (1) \u201cif, since the prior decision, new and substantially different evidence is produced, or there has been a change in the controlling authority\u201d or (2) \u201cthe prior decision was clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Oladeinde v. City of Birmingham, </em>230 F.3d 1275,1288 (11th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">These prior decisions rejected the AEA\u2019s unconstitutional conditions claim by \u201cnecessary implication.\u201d <em>Schiavo, </em>403 F.3d at 1291. In reaching these decisions, this court was reviewing the district court\u2019s order granting a preliminary injunction on overbreadth and vagueness grounds. In its request for a preliminary injunction, the AEA raised the unconstitutional conditions claim as an alternative ground for affir-mance. Because this court reversed the district court\u2019s order granting the preliminary injunction, it implicitly rejected the AEA\u2019s argument that Act 761 violated their constitutional rights based on the doctrine -of unconstitutional conditions. This doctrine would have provided this court, upon review, with an alternative basis to affirm the district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction. Hence, this court\u2019s prior decision in <em>AEA III </em>\u201cimplicitly\u201d rejected the AEA\u2019s unconstitutional conditions argument. <em>See id. </em>On appeal, the AEA does not contend that either exception to the law of the case doctrine applies, and we discern no exception. Accordingly, we conclude that the law of the case doctrine applies, and we therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
