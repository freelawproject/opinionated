On appeal, Sanchez argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-24\">I. REASONABLENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b883-25\">\u201cWe review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abus\u00e9 of discretion using a two-step process.\u201d United States v. Cubero, 754 F.3d 888, 892 (11th Cir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted). We look first at whether the sentencing court committed any procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>and the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id. The party who challenges the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable. United States v. Alvarado, 808 F.3d 474, 496 (11th Cir. 2015). The weight given to any particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor is within the district court\u2019s discretion, and this Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the district court. Id. We will reverse a sentence only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d United States v. Pugh, 515. F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir. 2008) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">II. SANCHEZ\u2019S CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Sanchez does not raise any procedural error with respect to his sentencing or argue that his guidelines range was incorrectly calculated. As to substantive reasonableness, Sanchez contends the district court should have given him a more substantial downward variance because his criminal history category of IV, although correctly calculated, overstated the seriousness of his criminal history and because he re-entered the United States only to reunite with his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Sanchez has not shown that his 54-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. At sentencing, Sanchez conceded that his criminal history category IV was properly calculated, but argued it overstated his criminal history. In asking for a downward variance, Sanchez emphasized: (1) the passage of time between his 2005 Georgia conviction for conspiracy to commit methamphetamine trafficking and his 2013 California conviction for possession for sale of methamphetamine; (2) the fact that his 2013 conviction increased both his offense level (pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i)) and his criminal history category; (3) his difficult childhood in Mexico; and (4) his reason for illegally reentering, which was to see his six U.S.born children from whom he had been estranged. Sanchez asked for a 46-month sentence, the low end of the guidelines ranges that would have resulted if he had a criminal history category of III. Sanchez then addressed the court personally and asked for a fair sentence so he could return to Mexico and care for his three youngest children living there.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">The government suggested that a downward variance was appropriate to account for the time that Sanchez served in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) custody, but opposed any further variance based on Sanchez\u2019s criminal history. The government pointed out, inter alia, that Sanchez committed new criminal conduct upon reentering the United States and that Sanchez\u2019s offense level and criminal history category were properly increased based on his 2013 Georgia drug trafficking conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments and calculating the advisory guidelines range of 57 to 71 months, the district court agreed to vary downward by three months for Sanchez\u2019s time in ICE custody. Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>er, the district court rejected Sanchez\u2019s request for a variance based on his criminal history category, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-5\">Taking into consideration the [\u00a7 ]3553(a) factors, I am going to respectfully ... disagree with you on changing the criminal history category. In looking at this, Mr. Sanchez-Mata, you have prior drug convictions in this case to go along with the fact that you were previously deported and then returned to America.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The district court stated that \u201cwith that in mind,\u201d the appropriate sentence was 54 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sanchez\u2019s request for an additional 8-month downward variance based on Sanchez\u2019s criminal history. In addition to the two drug trafficking convictions in 2005 and 2013 that counted toward Sanchez\u2019s criminal history score of 8 and criminal history category of IV, Sanchez also had prior California convictions for possession or purchase of narcotics for sale in 1991 and public intoxication and vandalism in 1994, which did not receive any criminal history points. Further, Sanchez committed a second methamphetamine trafficking offense in the United States after having been deported and while still under his probationary sentence for his first methamphetamine trafficking offense. The district court considered Sanchez\u2019s mitigating personal circumstances, such as his obligations to his family and his difficult upbringing, but obviously concluded that they were outweighed by his history of drug convictions, both before and after his deportation, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that history implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Sanchez has given us no reason here to substitute our judgment for the district court\u2019s in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. See United States v. Dougherty, 754 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir. 2014). Under the circumstances, the district court was within its discretion to conclude that Sanchez\u2019s criminal history was not overrepresented and to refuse to vary downward any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with, needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
