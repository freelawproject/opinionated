Trigo\u201d and \u201cO. Trigo\u201d and collectively, \u201cthe Trigos\u201d) appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the City of Doral (\u201cDoral\u201d) on their employment discrimination and retaliation suit under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e~2(a), 2000e-3, and the Florida Whistle-blower\u2019s Act (\u201cFWA\u201d), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 112.3187. Among other things, the Trigos alleged that Doral retaliated against J. Trigo, a Lieutenant who worked in the Doral Police Department, because he had filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) and because his wife had made public records requests about certain police officers. On appeal, the Trigos argue that: (1) the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their Title VII and FWA retaliation claims; (2) the district court erred by granting summary judgment on their First Amendment retaliation claims; and (3) if remand is appropriate on their federal claims, their state law claim, over which the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction without the federal claims, would be properly before the 'district court. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. Kernel Records Oy v. Mosley, 694 F.3d 1294, 1300 (11th Cir. 2012). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 66(a). A factual dispute exists where a reasonable fact-finder could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the non-moving party is entitled to a verdict. Kernel Records, 694 F.3d at 1300. In determining whether evidence creates a factual dispute, a court should draw reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant, but \u201cinferences based upon speculation are not reasonable.\u201d Id. at 1301 (quotation omitted). A district court does not abuse its discretion by dismissing remaining state law claims when the federal claims have been disposed of prior to trial. Faucher v. Rodziewicz, 891 F.2d 864, 871-72 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">First, we are unpersuaded by the Trigos\u2019 claim that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the Title VII and FWA retaliation claims because the district court incorrectly used the date J. Trigo was suspended rather than the date he was terminated for purposes of assessing the adverse employment action, and because Doral\u2019s shifting and inconsistent reasons for J. Trigo\u2019s termination show that the reasons were pretextual. Title VII makes it illegal for \u201can employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). The FWA is generally equivalent to Title VII, and we have approved of the application of the Title VII burden-shifting standard to claims brought under the FWA. See Sierminski v. Transouth Fin. Corp., 216 F.3d 945, 950 (11th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, plaintiffs must prove that: (1) they engaged in statutorily protected conduct; (2) they suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse action was causally related to the protected expression. Trask v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, 822 F.3d 1179, 1193-94 (11th Cir. 2016). To prove adverse employment action, an employee must show a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Id. at 1195. The employee\u2019s subjective view of the significance and adversity of the employer\u2019s action is not controlling; the employment action must be materially adverse as viewed by a reasonable person in the circumstances. Id. The burden of causation can be met by showing close temporal proximity between the statutorily protected activity and the adverse employment action. Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007). But mere temporal proximity, without more, must be \u201cvery close.\u201d Id. When an employer contemplates an adverse employment action before an employee engages in protected activity, temporal proximity between the protected activity and the subsequent adverse employment action does not suffice to show causation. Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1308 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Once a plaintiff has made a prima facie case, it is the employer\u2019s burden to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action. Trask, 822 F.3d at 1194. The ultimate burden is on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the reason provided by the employer is a pretext for prohibited, retaliatory conduct. Id. To show pretext, a plaintiff cannot recast the reason but must meet it head on and rebut it. Holland v. Gee, 677 F.3d 1047, 1055 (11th Cir. 2012). The plaintiff must show \u201cweaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s rationale.\u201d Id. at 1055-56 (quotation omitted). But, we do not judge whether an employer\u2019s decisions are \u201cprudent or fair,\u201d and the sole concern is whether unlawful discriminatory animus motivated an employment decision. Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc\u201e 196 F.3d 1354,1361 (11th Cir. 1999). The inquiry into pretext centers on the employer\u2019s beliefs, not the employee\u2019s beliefs or \u201creality as it exists outside of the decision maker\u2019s head.\u201d Alvarez v. Royal Atlantic Developers, Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1266 (11th Cir. 2010). If the reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, the plaintiff cannot succeed by simply quarrelling with the wisdom of the reason. Id. at 1265-66. Additional, but undisclosed, non-discriminatory reasons for the employment action which are not inconsistent do not necessarily demonstrate pretext. Tidwell v. Carter Prod., 135 F.3d 1422, 1428 (11th Cir. 1998), Similarly, differing reasons that are not necessarily inconsistent do not show pretext. Zaben v. Air Prod. &amp; Chemicals, Inc., 129 F.3d 1453,1458-59 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">In this case, the district court did not err by granting summary judgment on the Trigos\u2019 Title VII and FWA retaliation claims. Even assuming the Trigos established a prima facie case, they failed to demonstrate that Doral\u2019s legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for J. Trigo\u2019s termination were pretextual. According to the City Manager, he terminated J. Trigo: (1) based on a December 17, 2011, memorandum from the Interim Police Chief, recommending that J. Trigo be terminated; (2) based on the City Manager\u2019s review of statements made by witnesses during a 2011 investigation into allegations of favoritism and corruption in Doral\u2019s Police Department; (3) because J. Trigo\u2019s tenure had been marked by unprofessional admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>istrative practices; and (4) because J. Trigo\u2019s tenure had a great cost in terms of department morale and efficiency. In order to show pretext, the Trigos argue that the City Manager\u2019s reasons for the termination varied.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">As the record reveals, when the City Manager initially met with J. Trigo and his attorney, he affirmed his decision to terminate J. Trigo based on the sources mentioned in the December 17, 2011, memorandum. In his later deposition, the City Manager later testified that the Interim Police Chiefs recommendation had great influence in the decision, and also said that he was concerned about the morale within the department, the preferential treatment shown J. Trigo previously, and the attitudes of witnesses involved in the 2011 investigation. He added that he had discounted parts of the 2011 report that J. Trigo had previously been punished for. He also admitted that he was concerned about \u201cthe dichotomy that existed within the department in terms of the \u2018cli[que].\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Notably, none of the City Manager\u2019s deposition testimony is directly inconsistent with the original December 17 memorandum. And, in any event, slightly differing reasons, or additional, undisclosed nondiscriminatory reasons for the termination, are insufficient to show pretext. Tidwell, 135 F.3d at 1428; Zaben, 129 F.3d at 1458-59. Because the Trigos failed to establish that Doral\u2019s legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for the termination were pretextual, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on the Title VII retaliation claim. Consequently, their FWA claim fails as well. Sierminski, 216 F.3d at 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">We also find no merit to the Trigos\u2019 argument that the district court erred by granting summary judgment on their First Amendment retaliation claims because 0. Trigo\u2019s public record requests were expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment and because J. Trigo was terminated in retaliation for his association with O. Trigo and her public record requests. To establish a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that (1) her speech or act was constitutionally protected; (2) she suffered adverse conduct that would likely deter a person of ordinary firmness fi'om engaging in such speech; and (3) there was a causal relationship between the adverse conduct and the protected speech. Bennett v. Hendrix, 423 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir. 2005). The Constitution guarantees the right to engage not only in \u201cpure speech,\u201d but also \u201cexpressive conduct.\u201d Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, 370 F.3d 1252, 1270 (11th Cir. 2004). To determine whether a particular act counts as expressive conduct, a court must determine (1) whether intent to convey a particularized message was present; and (2) in the surrounding circumstances the likelihood wa^ great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it. Id. However, a narrow, succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protection. Id. In determining whether conduct is expressive, we ask whether the reasonable person would interpret it as some sort of message, not whether an observer would necessarily infer a specific message. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The Constitution accords special protection to two different forms of association, \u201cintimate association\u201d and \u201cexpressive association.\u201d McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1562-63 (11th Cir. 1994). The right of expressive association\u2014the freedom to associate for the purpose of engaging in activities protected by the First Amendment, such as speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise of religion\u2014is protected by the First Amendment as a necessary corollary of the rights that the amendment protects by its terms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Id. at 1563. The state may not take a materially adverse action against its employee in retaliation for exercising First Amendment associational rights. Id. at 1568. A plaintiff can obtain special protection for an asserted associational right if he can demonstrate either that the asserted association closely enough resembles a family relationship to be protected by the right to intimate association, or that the purpose of the association is to engage in activities independently protected by the First Amendment. Id. at 1563. There is no First Amendment right of access to public information. Foto USA, Inc. v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Fla., 141 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Here, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on 0. Trigo\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim. As the record shows, O. Trigo lacked intent to convey a message with her public records requests; rather, she specified that her requests were to \u201cobtain information to protect [her] family.\u201d She further admitted that she sought information to \u201ceffectively or more effectively defend against false accusations!;] ... [e]xpose wrongful governmental conduct[;] ... expose violations of law[;] ... expose ... violations of [the Florida\u2019s Law Enforcement Officer\u2019s Bill of Rights;] ... [a]nd[ ] to redress grievances with [Doral].\u201d None of the reasons expressed by O. Trigo demonstrate an \u201cintent to convey a particularized message.\u201d Holloman, 370 F.3d at 1270. And contrary to her argument, 0. Trigo\u2019s subjective intent in making the requests is relevant to determine whether an intent to convey a particularized message was present. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Nor did the district court err by granting summary judgment on J. Trigo\u2019s First Amendment associational retaliation claims. While J. Trigo argues that his association with his wife constituted expressive association, we\u2019ve already concluded that 0. Trigo\u2019s public records requests were not conducted to convey a specific message, but were instead conducted to obtain information. In any event, the act of seeking to obtain the records themselves is not inherently protected by the First Amendment. Foto USA, 141 F.3d at 1035. Thus, on this record, the Trigos failed to demonstrate that the purpose of J. Trigo\u2019s expressive association was to engage in activities independently protected by the First Amendment. See McCabe, 12 F.3d at 1563.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">In short, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on the Trigos\u2019 First Amendment retaliation claims. Moreover, since the Trigos were not entitled to relief on their federal claims, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their remaining state law claim. See Raney v. Allstate Ins. Co., 370 F.3d 1086,1089 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
