Matheson, Jr., Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">William Young - appeals the district court\u2019s judgment revoking his supervised release and sentencing him to eight months of incarceration and an additional period of supervised release. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand with instructions to issue an amended judgment consistent with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">After being indicted in 2003, Mr. Young pled guilty to a single count of conspiring to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute five or more grams of cocaine base in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(iii); 846. In 2005, the United States District Court for the District of Kansas imposed a sentence of 151 months of imprisonment followed by four years of supervised release. The court ordered both standard and special conditions on Mr. Young\u2019s supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">Mr. Young was released from prison and began his supervised release in April 2015. In February 2016, the probation office filed a petition in the district court to revoke Mr. Young\u2019s supervised release. According to the petition, Mr. Young had used illegal drugs, failed to check in with his probation officer, and skipped treatment programs in which he was enrolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-16\">The district court held a heading in March 2016 and revoked Mr. Young\u2019s supervised release. It sentenced him to eight months of imprisonment and three more years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-17\">At this hearing, Mr. Young, through counsel, stipulated to the facts underlying the alleged violations and agreed the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>could impose between 8 and 14 months in custody. He asked the court not to impose any term of imprisonment, however, and instead to continue the hearing, order him to a halfway house, and reassess his progress after a few months in a structured environment. The Government opposed this request and argued Mr. Young should be incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Based on Mr. Young\u2019s numerous positive drug tests, the district court concluded it was \u201crequired to revoke and impose a sentence that includes a term of imprisonment\u201d unless it found there were \u201cappropriate substance abuse programs\u201d available for Mr. Young or that his \u201ccurrent or past participation in programs\u201d justified another course, in which case it could \u201cgrant[ ] an exception from the mandatory revocation and imprisonment.\u201d ROA Vol. 2 at 15.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The court decided Mr. Young was \u201cnot entitled to an exemption\u201d and that his violations \u201cpretty much sp[oke] for themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After Mr. Young had a chance to allocute, the court expressed its \u201cwish that [Mr. Young] had stuck with\u201d his treatment program. <em>Id. </em>at 21. The district court stated that \u201ceight months in custody would be appropriate\u201d because Mr. Young had not shown any reason why he should be exempt from the revocation requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 23. The court selected eight months from the non-binding policy statements of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d), which provided for a custody range of 8 to 14 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">In addition to the eight-month prison term, the court ordered three years of supervised release and specified that \u201call of the conditions that were previously imposed\u201d would again apply. <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">The court asked, \u201cIs there any comment, counsel, on the proposed sentence?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. Mr. Young\u2019s lawyer answered, \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">But when the district court entered its written judgment almost two weeks later, the terms of Mr. Young\u2019s new period of supervised release were not identical to the terms previously imposed. Mr. Young complains the written judgment added an entirely new condition requiring him to \u201creside at a residential re-entry center program, in the community corrections component allowing for work release, for up to 120 days, at the direction of the U.S. Probation Officer.\u201d ROA Vol. 1 at 34. He also argues the written judgment materially altered another condition: whereas the court previously required Mr. Young to \u201cparticipate in an approved program for mental health,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 21, the new judgment ordered him to \u201cparticipate as directed in a cognitive behavioral program,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">Mr. Young filed a timely notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. App. R. 4(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b749-14\">Mr. Young raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues the district court committed plain error during the March 2016 revocation hearing because it \u201cdid not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and gave no explanation whatsoever for the given sentence.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 9. We reject his argument and affirm because the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Second, Mr. Young argues we must remand for the district court to conform its written judgment to its oral sentence concerning his supervised release conditions. The Government agrees with Mr. Young that the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement controls. So do we, and we remand for correction of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">A. <em>Consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">1. Legal Background</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Section 3583 provides that a court may revoke a term of supervised release after considering certain factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe sentencing court, however, is hot required to consider individually each factor listed in \u00a7 3553(a), nor is it required to recite any magic words to show uS that it fulfilled its responsibility to be mindful of the factors that Congress has instructed it to consider before issuing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Cordova, </em>461 F.3d 1184, 1189 (10th Cir. 2006) (quotations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Kelley, </em>359 F.3d 1302, 1305 (10th Cir. 2004) (\u201c[I]t is enough if the district court considers \u00a7 3553(a) en masse and states its reasons for imposing a given sentence.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">2. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Whether the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is a question of procedural reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Vigil, </em>696 F.3d 997, 1001 (10th Cir. 2012). If a defendant preserves the issue, \u201cwe generally review the procedural reasonableness of that defendant\u2019s sentence using the familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez-Leon, </em>764 F.3d 1248, 1262 (10th Cir. 2014) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">Here, however, the parties agree that our review is for plain error because Mr. Young failed to object during the sentencing hearing. \u201cUnder the plain error standard, [Mr. Young] must demonstrate: (1) an error, (2) that is plain, meaning clear or obvious under current law, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Piper, </em>No. 15-3288, 839 F.3d 1261, 1266, 2016 WL 6211807, at *3 (10th Cir. Oct. 25, 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">3. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">Mr. Young asserts, \u201cThe district court gave no explanation, and no consideration to the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, when it imposed the eight-month term of imprisonment and three-year term of supervised release.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 13. He argues \u201c[t]he sentencing court must \u2018say <em>something </em>that enables the appellate court to infer that [the district court] considered [the relevant factors].\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>648 F.3d 858, 860 (7th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>2011)). The district court\u2019s failure to do so here, he argues, was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We disagree. The record clearly shows the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and provided sufficient reasoning for the sentence it imposed. The hearing transcript contradicts Mr. Young\u2019s assertion that the court gave no explanation. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">I do believe eight months in custody would be appropriate because you haven\u2019t shown me any reason, based on your personal circumstances or anything else, why you\u2019re entitled to an exception from the legal requirement that I revoke and sentence up to a term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">ROA Vol. 2 at 23. The court also described its familiarity with the treatment program Mr. Young had failed to complete and said it \u201creally wish[ed] that [Mr. Young] had stuck with\u201d the program and \u201chad a better attitude about it\u201d because it teaches participants skills for \u201ccop[ing] with issues that come up in daily life\u201d and about \u201ctaking ownership\u201d of decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 21-23. Mr. Young\u2019s track record in the program is part of \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The district court thus considered this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Mr. Young also overlooks the district court\u2019s consideration of his work, history, <em>id. </em>at 19, and his history of \u201canxiety, panic, [and] PTSD,\u201d topics he raised during his allocution, <em>id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Further, the court\u2019s statement that \u201cwe don\u2019t have available substance abuse programs which would appropriately respond to your treatment needs,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, demonstrates its consideration of the need \u201cto provide the defendant with .., correctional treatment in the most effective manner\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">\u201c[W]e have made it quite clear that the sentencing court is not required to consider individually each factor listed in \u00a7 3553(a) before issuing a sentence.\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>359 F.3d at 1305. The district court did not make express reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but we do not demand \u201cthat the district' court recite any magic words,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quotations omitted). Based on the record before us, we are confident the district court \u201cfulfilled its responsibility to be mindful of the factors that Congress has instructed it to consider.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">Mr. Young has failed to show the district court erred, let alone plainly so. We also note that, under the third element of the plain-error standard, Mr. Young has not shown how the district court\u2019s alleged failure to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors negatively affected his substantial rights because his eight-month sentence is, in his words, \u201cat the lowest end of the guidelines range.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 14, Finally, in affirming the district. court\u2019s decision on this point, we perceive no serious effect on \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Piper, </em>839 F.3d at 1265, 2016 WL 6211807, at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">B. <em>Variance of Written Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_S\">At the revocation hearing, the district court stated Mr. Young\u2019s new term of supervised release would be governed by \u201call of the conditions that were previously imposed,\u201d ROA Vol. 2 at 23, but the court\u2019s written judgment added a new condition and materially altered another, ROA Vol. 1 at 34. Because of this discrepancy, Mr. Young asks that we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"ANe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>The law is clear: \u201c[A]n orally pronounced sentence controls over a judgment ... when the two conflict. This rule ... has been the law in this circuit' since the 1930\u2019s.\u201d <em>United States v. Villano, </em>816 F.2d 1448, 1450-61 (10th Cir. 1987). (en banc) (footnote omitted); <em>see also id. </em>at 1451 (\u201cThe sentence orally pronounced from the bench is the sentence.\u201d). The Government does not argue otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">We agree with the parties that the written judgment must conform to Mr. Young\u2019s actual sentence. Rather than vacate Mr. Young\u2019s sentence to remedy this clerical error, we remand with instructions to the district court to issue an amended judgment. <em>See United States v. Bowen, </em>527 F.3d 1065, 1080 (10th Cir. 2008) (affirming sentence and remanding \u201cfor the district court to bring its written judgment into conformity with its previously imposed,, oral sentence\u201d); <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>169 F.3d 1255, 1280 (10th Cir. 1999) (declining to vacate judgment and allowing district court to correct clerical mistake where judgment failed to reflect defendant\u2019s acquittal on several murder charges); <em>see also </em>Fed. R. Crim. P. 36 (\u201c[T]he court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We affirm on the \u00a7 3553(a) issue, reverse on the written judgment issue, and remand this case to the district court with instructions to issue an amended judgment consistent with this order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The mandate shall issue forthwith without prejudice to appellant\u2019s filing a petition for rehearing should he decide to do so.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b748-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-19\">. Mr. Young appealed his sentence, but the plea agreement he signed contained a waiver of his appellate rights. We enforced the waiver and dismissed his appeal. <em>United States v. Young, </em>206 Fed.Appx. 779 (10th Cir. 2006) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\">. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(4) (requiring revocation of supervised release and imposition of a term of imprisonment \"[i]f the defendant ... tests positive for illegal controlled substances more than 3 times over the course of 1 year\u201d); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d) (\u201cThe court shall consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse treatment programs, or an individual's current or past participation in such programs, warrants an exception ... from the rule of section 3583(g)....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\">. Section 3583(e) requires consideration of a subset of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. As we said in <em>United States v. Cordova, </em>the relevant factors in the revocation context include: \"the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history and characteristics of the defendant; the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; pertinent guidelines; pertinent policy statements; the need to avoid unwanted sentence' disparities; and tire need to provide restitution.\" 461 F.3d 1184, 1188-89 (10th Cir. 2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b750-15\">. When imposing a sentence following revocation, district courts must also consider the policies articulated in Chapter 7 of the Guidelines, <em>see Cordova, </em>461 F.3d at 1188, but we have no need to address the Guidelines here because Mr. Young argues on appeal only that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b751-10\">. The court's explanation was not limited to the eight-month sentence. It also explained the additional term of supervised release, saying Mr. Young should have another opportunity to succeed under the previous terms: \"So basically I guess [you will] have [to] serve some time, wipe the slate clean, come out and try again.\u201d ROA Vol. 2 at 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\">. During the pendency of this appeal, Mr. Young filed an unopposed motion for a partial remand so the district court could correct the judgment while we considered the first issue he raises. In light of the foregoing, we deny appellant\u2019s motion for partial remand as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
