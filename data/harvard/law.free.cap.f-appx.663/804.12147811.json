He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">In October 2014 Rider began corresponding with an undercover officer of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police. Over the course of several days, Rider sent the officer pornographic images of multiple prepubescent children, including eleven images of Rider\u2019s own nine-year-old son in the bathtub. The majority of the images of Rider\u2019s son were close-up pictures of his son\u2019s penis. Rider also told the officer that he had sexually abused his son, and asked the officer for pictures of the officer\u2019s daughter. Rider was arrested for sending the images of child pornography and pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">The presentence investigation report (PSR) calculated Rider\u2019s base offense level at 22. It increased the offense level because the images involved a minor under the age of twelve (two levels), the offense involved distribution in return for the receipt of a thing of value (five levels), the offense involved the use of a computer (two levels), and the offense involved at least 10 but fewer than 150 images (two levels). Finally, the PSR reduced Rider\u2019s offense level three levels based on his acceptance of responsibility, and it calculated a criminal history category of I. That resulted in a guidelines range of 97 to 121 months imprisonment, followed by supervised release for five years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">\u25a0 At the sentence hearing the victim\u2019s mother, Heidi Garcia, testified about the impact of Rider\u2019s actions on their son. Garcia stated that when the son first came to live with her after his father\u2019s arrest, he appeared traumatized. He would often hide his face because he was crying, and he would become violent with his older brother. He was frequently sick, and nearly every night he had nightmares and wet the bed. Over time his condition improved, and Garcia eventually brought him to counseling. Through the help of counseling the son revealed some of the trauma that he had been through: his father had shown him pornographic videos and he had seen his father abuse a little girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">After Garcia\u2019s testimony the government argued for a 180-month sentence, contending that the impact of Rider\u2019s actions, charged and uncharged, on his young son warranted an upward variance. Rider requested a 97-month sentence\u2014the bottom of the guidelines range\u2014contending that he already faced the substantial punishment of losing any contact -with his son and that supervised release would be sufficient to protect society after his release. The court sentenced Rider to 144 months imprisonment with lifetime supervised release. That sentence was a twenty-three month upward variance from the guidelines range, but was ninety-six months below the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">We review the reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. United States v. Irey, 612 F.3d 1160, 1188-89 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc). We will vacate a sentence as substantively unreasonable \u201cif, and only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>ment in weighing the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d Id. at 1190 (quoting United States v. Pugh, 515 F.3d 1179,1191 (11th Cir. 2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Rider contends that his crime did not merit an upward variance because he did not take pictures of a \u201csexual act\u201d and because he did not intend to widely distribute the images. Put in \u00a7 3553(a) terms, he asserts that the court abused its discretion by not properly considering \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). But the district court properly accounted for the nature of Rider\u2019s actions. The district court found that Rider\u2019s exploiting his own son to produce child pornography justified an upward variance, even if his crimes could, hypothetically, have been even worse. It found that the impact on Rider\u2019s son especially warranted a heavier sentence. That was not a \u201cclear error in judgment.\u201d The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
