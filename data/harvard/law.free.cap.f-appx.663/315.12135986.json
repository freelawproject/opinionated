Because the operative complaint at the time Defendant-Appellee Suzy Sonnier was dismissed did not plead jurisdiction, and because the subsequent amended complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b336-17\">According to the complaint, in 2002, Dr, Glen Steeb performed surgery on Peter-Takang at the Touro Infirmary Hospital (Touro). At the time, Peter-Takang was pregnant with twins. She alleges that after the surgery, Dr. Steeb told her that the twins had died during surgery. Although not in her complaint, she asserts in her briefs (and in her briefs in the district court) that Dr. Steeb told her. days after the surgery that \u201cthere were no babies\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the first place, and that he had simply removed scar tissue from her abdomen during the surgery. She also claims, for the first time on appeal, that nurses at Touro told her in the surgery\u2019s immediate aftermath that her twins had <em>not </em>died and that Dr. Steeb had removed them during surgery and taken them out of the hospital alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Three years after the surgery, Peter-Takang read a story in the newspaper about twin toddlers found walking down a highway. Believing the children to resemble her husband, and therefore believing they may have been the twins with which she was pregnant in 2002, Peter-Takang sought to have the Louisiana Department 'of Children and Family Services (DCFS) genetically test the twins for a determination as to whether they were biologically hers. However, the DCFS refused to perform the requested maternity test. Peter-Takang further alleges that when she made the request, representatives of the DCFS initially told her that they had to first speak with Dr. Steeb and a representative at Touro and that when she returned a week later, she \u201cwas informed that Dr. Steeb told [the DCFS] that [her] children were born dead[,] and not to entertain [her].\u201d The DCFS has still not performed a maternity test despite Peter\u2014 Takang\u2019s continued requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Peter-Takang brought suit in federal district court against Touro, Dr. Steeb, and Suzy Sonnier, sued in her official capacity as Secretary of DCFS, seeking a maternity test from the DCFS and damages. She filed a first amended complaint before any party had filed a responsive pleading. Sonnier filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), which the district court granted. Peter-Takang then moved for reconsideration of Sonnier\u2019s dismissal and amended her complaint a second time. The district court denied Peter-Takang\u2019s motion for reconsideration, then granted Touro\u2019s and Dr. Steeb\u2019s motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Peter-Takang appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">Peter-Takang argues on appeal that the district court erred in granting Sonnier\u2019s motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) and in granting Touro\u2019s and Dr. Steeb\u2019s motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). We review dismissals under both Rules de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">With respect to the DCFS, the district court granted Sonnier\u2019s motion to dismiss before Peter-Takang amended her complaint the second time, when Peter-Takang\u2019s first amended complaint was the operative pleading. In the first amended complaint (written as a supplement to the original complaint, rather than a replacement), Peter-Takang did not plead any facts or legal claims that would support federal jurisdiction. She did not allege any federal causes of action nor diversity of citizenship. To the extent she now argues on appeal that the federal courts have diversity jurisdiction based on the DCFS\u2019s status as an arm of the Louisiana government, Peter-Takang, herself a resident of Louisiana, has offered no support for the argument that diversity may be invoked merely by pleading that the defendant is a state actor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Peter-Takang\u2019s complaint against Sonnier.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>We note that after Sonnier\u2019s dismissal, Peter-Takang\u2019s second amended complaint purported to add federal causes of action. In the second amended complaint, Peter-Takang alleged that Sonnier deprived her of her federal \u201crights to hold her children as babies, to hear them say-momma or daddy, to watch them grow,\u201d and generally to rear them. The district court appears to have considered these additional allegations in denying Peter-Takang\u2019s motion for reconsideration of Sonnier\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">However, even if we were to consider these post-dismissal claims asserted against Sonnier, the second amended complaint would nevertheless be subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). To the extent she alleges a substantive due process violation, and even if Peter-Takang has a substantive due process right to rear her biological children, or to have children tested for a determination as to whether they are her own (rights upon which she does not elaborate or offer- any authority), she has not set forth any facts that plausibly allege a denial of that right. Rather, even if those supposed rights were cognizable, her claim here is entirely speculative, because, among other reasons, she has failed to offer any plausible basis for concluding that the children at issue are biologically her own. Peter-Takang simply has not alleged facts that would support a constitutional right to have the twins allegedly in the DCFS\u2019s custody genetically tested. To the extent Peter-Takang is claiming that the DCFS has a staie-im-posed obligation to test the children at issue, there is no basis for concluding that the DCFS or Sonnier has waived sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court properly granted Sonnier\u2019s motion to dismiss and denied Peter-Takang\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">With respect to Touro\u2019s and Dr. Steeb\u2019s motions to dismiss, Peter-Takang argues on appeal that her complaint alleged sufficient facts to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. It is not clear what wrongdoing Peter-Takang alleges on the part of Touro or Dr. Steeb,.but reading her complaint liberally, it appears that she claims Dr. Steeb wrongfully instructed DCFS \u201cnot to entertain\u201d Peter-Takang\u2019s requests for DNA testing of the children at issue. The district court granted the motions to dismiss on the ground that they failed to allege any cognizable claim and that to the extent Peter-Takang attempted to assert negligence and malpractice claims in her opposition brief, those claims are prescribed under Louisiana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Peter-Takang\u2019s second amended complaint fails to state a claim for relief against Touro or Dr. Steeb. She fails to allege what duty either party had in her favor or how either breached any such duty, and in general she fails to set forth any cause of action she could possibly have against either based on Dr. Steeb\u2019s alleged conduct in instructing the DCFS \u201cnot to entertain\u201d her. She also does not press any negligence, malpractice, or fraud claims on appeal, so we need not address the district court\u2019s conclusions with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>to those allegations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any event, to the extent Peter-Takang\u2019s complaint could be interpreted as alleging a claim sounding in tort, her claims would be barred by Louisiana\u2019s prescription statute. Under Louisiana law, tort actions must be brought within one year.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Peter-Takang\u2019s allegations relate to conduct occurring, at the latest, in 2005, and she has not alleged any facts that would support a tolling of the deadline. Accordingly, the district court properly granted Touro\u2019s and Dr. Steeb\u2019s motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Finally, Peter-Takang asserts that the district court should have given her another opportunity to amend her complaint before dismissing her action with prejudice. However, Peter-Takang did not ask the district court for an additional opportunity to amend. Moreover, she has already amended her complaint twice, and she has not set forth what other facts she would allege if given another opportunity. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in declining to give Peter-Ta-kang another opportunity to amend her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"pADN\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Peter-Takang\u2019s motions to supplement the record with new evidence are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
