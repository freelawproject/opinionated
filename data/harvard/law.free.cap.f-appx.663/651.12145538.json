Moritz, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b672-15\">David Papadakos committed suicide after he was arrested for and charged with the alleged sexual abuse of his adopted son, B.P. After Papadakos\u2019 death, his estate and his parents (collectively, the Estate) brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against L. Vance Norton (a detective with the Vernal, Utah Police Department) and Lisa Jorgensen (a social worker with the Utah Division of Child and Family Services), alleging that they coerced B.P. into making false allegations against Papadakos. The distinct court granted Jor-gensen\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and Norton\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Estate appeals. Because we agree with the district court that (1) the Estate\u2019s malicious-prosecution claim fails as a matter of law; and (2) the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the Estate\u2019s Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b672-17\">Papadakos adopted B.P. in 2010. At the time, B.P. was twelve years old and had been in and out of foster care for more than half of his life. B.P. had also been the victim of repeated sexual abuse and suffered from numerous mental health problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-18\">In October 2012, B.P. ran away and went to a classmate\u2019s home after Papada-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>kos threatened to ground him. B.P. told his classmate that Papadakos had sexually-abused him. When Norton learned of this allegation, he attempted to interview B.P. at his classmate\u2019s home. But B.P. refused to speak with Norton.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The next day, Jorgensen interviewed B.P. at B.P.\u2019s school. After the interview, Norton arranged for B.P.\u2019s transport to the Children\u2019s Justice Center. Despite B.P.\u2019s protests, defendants questioned B.P. there for several hours over the course of multiple days. According to the Estate, both Jorgensen and Norton (collectively, the defendants) coerced and intimidated B.P. during these interviews and supplied him with the information that they wanted to hear until B.P. finally alleged that Papa-dakos sexually abused him on multiple occasions. For instance, B.P. alleged that while camping with Papadakos, B.P. awoke in their shared tent to find Papadakos\u2019 hand on B.P.\u2019s penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Based on these allegations, Norton questioned Papadakos. Papadakos told Norton that he remembered the camping incident. But he maintained that any contact with B.P.\u2019s penis was accidental and must have occurred while Papadakos was asleep. Pa-padakos also admitted that he and B.P. often slept together in Papadakos\u2019 bed at home and that Papadakos once awoke to find B.P. rubbing B.P.\u2019s erect penis on Papadakos\u2019 hand. Papadakos reported that on at least 30 different occasions, B.P. removed Papadakos\u2019 underwear while Pa-padakos slept. Finally, when Norton asked Papadakos if it was possible that Papada-kos was playing with B.P.\u2019s penis while Papadakos was asleep, Papadakos replied that he wasn\u2019t sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Norton arrested Papadakos without a warrant on October 25, 2012. That same day, Utah charged Papadakos with two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child and ten counts of forcible sexual abuse. As a result, Papadakos lost his job as the vice principal of a middle school, was expelled from a university graduate program, and was no longer allowed to participate in the Boy Scouts of America. Shortly before his preliminary hearing date, Papadakos committed suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">The Estate then sued the defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that they violated Papadakos\u2019 Fourth, Fifth,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Fourteenth Amendment rights by coercing B.P. into making false allegations of sexual abuse and by using those false allegations to arrest and charge Papadakos. The Estate also brought a malicious prosecution claim against both the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Jorgensen filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). In support, Jorgensen argued that she was entitled to qualified immunity on the Estate\u2019s constitutional claims. And she asserted that the Estate\u2019s malicious-prosecution claim failed as a matter of law because the criminal prosecution against Pa-padakos didn\u2019t terminate in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">Similarly, Norton filed a motion for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Like Jorgensen, Norton maintained that (1) he was entitled to qualified immunity on the Estate\u2019s constitutional claims, and (2) the Estate\u2019s malicious-prosecution claim failed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The district court granted both motions and dismissed' the Estate\u2019s action with prejudice. The Estate appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">We review the district court\u2019s decision granting Norton\u2019s motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standard as the district court and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Estate. <em>See Zisumbo v. Ogden Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>801 F.3d 1185, 1196 (10th Cir. 2015). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when \u2018there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Likewise, we review the district court\u2019s decision granting Jorgensen\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo, \u201c \u2018accepting] all facts pleaded by the non-moving party as true and granting] all reasonable inferences from the pleadings\u2019 in that party\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Sanders v. Mountain Am. Fed. Credit Union, </em>689 F.3d 1138, 1141 (10th Cir. 2012) (quoting <em>Park Univ. Enters. v. Am. Cas. Co., </em>442 F.3d 1239, 1244 (10th Cir. 2006)). \u201cJudgment on the pleadings is appropriate only when \u2018the moving party has clearly established that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Park Univ. Enters., </em>442 F.3d at 1244).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">I. We decline to consider the Estate\u2019s assertion that we should adopt and apply an exception to the favorable-termination requirement to save its malicious-prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">We begin with the Estate\u2019s malicious-prosecution claim. The district court concluded that this claim failed as a matter of law as to both the defendants because the underlying criminal prosecution didn\u2019t \u201cterminate[ ] in favor- of\u2019 Papadakos. <em>Novitsky v. City of Aurora, </em>491 F.3d 1244, 1258 (10th Cir. 2007) (listing \u201celements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution, as applicable in a \u00a7 1983 claim\u201d). Instead, Utah dismissed the case against Papadakos based on Papadakos\u2019 death\u2014a decision that, as the district court pointed out, didn\u2019t resolve the question of Papada-kos\u2019 guilt or innocence. <em>See M.G. v. Young, </em>826 F.3d 1259, 1262 (10th Cir. 2016) (\u201cWhere the case is disposed of in a manner that leaves the question of the accused\u2019s innocence unresolved, there generally can be no malicious prosecution claim by the accused.\u201d (quoting <em>Dobiecki v. Palacios, </em>829 F.Supp. 229, 235 (N.D. Ill. 1993))).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">On appeal, the Estate doesn\u2019t dispute that a plaintiff must generally satisfy the favorable-termination requirement in order to succeed on a malicious-prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983. Nor does it assert that a plaintiffs death typically satisfies that requirement, let alone cite any authority .that would support such an assertion. Instead, the Estate urges us to carve out an exception to the favorable-termination rule for circumstances in which a defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct allegedly caused the plaintiffs death \u201cbefore a favorable termination could take place.\u201d Aplt. Br. 31. Without such an exception, the Estate explains, defendants might \u201cbenefit from their wrongful conduct,\u201d thus undermining \u00a7 1983\u2019s goal of \u201cpreventing] ... abuses of power by those acting under the color of state law and compensat[ing] ... persons injured by deprivation of federal rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">But the only authorities the Estate offers to support this argument are <em>Berry v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>City of Muskogee, </em>900 F.2d 1489 (10th Cir. 1990), and <em>Robertson v. Wegmann, </em>436 U.S. 584, 98 S.Ct. 1991, 56 L.Ed.2d 554 (1978). And while we agree that these eases support the Estate\u2019s characterization of \u00a7 1983\u2019s underlying goals, <em>see Wegmann, </em>436 U.S. at 590-91, 98 S.Ct. 1991, <em>Berry, </em>900 F.2d at 1503, the Estate doesn\u2019t explain how these authorities\u2014or any others, for that matter\u2014might establish that applying the favorable-termination requirement in this case would be so contrary to \u00a7 1983\u2019s goals as to warrant an exception to the general favorable-termination rule as articulated in <em>M.G., </em>826 F.3d at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Accordingly, we find this argument insufficiently briefed and decline to address it. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A) (requiring argument section of appellant\u2019s brief to contain \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities ... on which the appellant relies\u201d); <em>Bronson v. Swensen, </em>500 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir. 2007) (explaining that court routinely declines to consider inadequately briefed arguments).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">II. The defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the Estate\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim because Norton had arguable probable cause to arrest Papadakos.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In response to the Estate\u2019s allegation that the defendants violated Papada-kos\u2019 clearly established Fourth Amendment rights, both the defendants asserted that they were entitled to qualified immunity. To defeat that assertion, the Estate must demonstrate that (1) the defendants violated Papadakos\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights; and (2) those rights were clearly established at the time that the defendants allegedly violated them. <em>See Mayfield v. Bethards, </em>826 F.3d 1252, 1255 (10th Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">According to the Estate, Norton relied on B.P.\u2019s coerced statements\u2014which Jor-gensen allegedly helped to obtain\u2014to arrest Papadakos. The Estate implies that the defendants knew those statements were false. And it points out \u201cthat false evidence cannot contribute to a finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>Wilkins v. DeReyes, </em>528 F.3d 790, 805 (10th Cir. 2008). Thus, it concludes, Norton lacked probable cause to arrest Papadakos, and Papadakos\u2019 arrest therefore violated his clearly established Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See Olsen v. Layton Hills Mall, </em>312 F.3d 1304, 1312 (10th Cir. 2002) (\u201cA police officer violates an arrestee\u2019s clearly established Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable seizure if the officer makes a warrantless arrest without probable cause.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">But the Estate acknowledges that \u201c[w]here false statements have been relied on to establish probable cause, \u2018the existence of probable cause [for \u00a7 1983 purposes] is determined by setting aside the false information.\u2019\u201d <em>Wilkins, </em>528 F.3d at 805 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Wolford v. Lasater, </em>78 F.3d 484, 489 (10th Cir. 1996)). Thus, even assuming that Norton knowingly relied <em>in part </em>on false statements to arrest Papadakos, the Estate ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>pears to recognize that the defendants only violated Papadakos\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights if, after \u201csetting aside\u201d those allegedly false statements, <em>see id. </em>Norton lacked probable cause to arrest Papada-kos.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Moreover, the Estate must do more than show that Norton lacked probable cause to arrest Papadakos to succeed on its Fourth Amendment claim. To defeat the defendants\u2019 assertion of qualified immunity, the Estate must show that Norton lacked even <em>arguable </em>probable cause to arrest Papadakos. <em>See Stonecipher v. Valles, </em>759 F.3d 1134,1141 (10th Cir. 2014) (\u201cIn the context of a qualified immunity defense on an unlawful search or arrest claim, we ascertain whether a defendant violated clearly established law \u2018by asking whether there was \u201carguable probable cause\u201d \u2019 for the challenged conduct.\u201d (quoting <em>Kaufman v. Higgs, </em>697 F.3d 1297,1300 (10th Cir. 2012))). And \u201c[arguable probable cause\u201d exists so long as an officer\u2019s \u201cconclusions rest on an objectively reasonable, even if mistaken, belief that probable cause exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the Estate\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim if, after removing B.P.\u2019s allegedly false statements from the calculation, \u201ca reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest or detain\u201d Papadakos. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Cortez v. McCauley, </em>478 F.3d 1108,1120 (10th Cir. 2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We conclude that' arguable probable cause existed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In addition to B.P.\u2019s allegedly false statements, Norton also relied on (1) B.P.\u2019s classmate\u2019s statement that B.P. said he ran away from home because Papadakos sexually abused him; and (2) Papadakos\u2019 own statements to Norton. For instance, Papa-dakos verified that he and B.P. often slept together in the same bed. Papadakos remembered the camping trip during which B.P. accused Papadakos of touching B.P.\u2019s penis, but maintained that Papadakos could have only initiated the contact while he was asleep. He described an incident in which he awoke to find B.P. rubbing his erect penis on Papadakos\u2019 hand. And he reported that on at least 30 occasions, he awoke to find that B.P. had removed Papa-dakos\u2019 underwear while Papadakos slept. Finally, when Norton asked Papadakos if it was possible that Papadakos played with B.P.\u2019s penis, Papadakos didn\u2019t deny that it was possible; he merely maintained that he couldn\u2019t be sure what he did in his sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Even assuming that B.P.\u2019s classmate\u2019s statement and Papadakos\u2019 own statements were insufficient to provide Norton with <em>actual </em>probable cause to arrest Papadakos, we conclude that those statements were sufficient to provide Norton with <em>arguable </em>probable cause to believe that Papadakos committed the offense of sexual abuse of a child. <em>See </em>Utah Code. Ann. \u00a7 76-5-404.1(2) (\u201cA person commits sexual abuse of a child if ... the actor touches the ... genitalia of any child ... with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person .... \u201d); <em>Kerns v. Bader, </em>663 F.3d 1173, 1188 (10th Cir. 2011) (explaining that probable-cause evaluation doesn\u2019t \u201crequire the suspect\u2019s guilt to be \u2018more likely true than false,\u2019\u201d but rather asks only \u201cwhether a \u2018substantial probability\u2019 existed that the suspect committed the crime\u201d (first quoting <em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 742,103 S.Ct 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983); then quoting <em>Taylor v, Meacham, </em>82 F.3d 1556, 1562 (10th Cir. 1996))).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">In other words, we conclude that after removing B.P.\u2019s allegedly false and coerced statements from the probable-cause calculation, \u201ca reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest or detain\u201d Papadakos for violating \u00a7 76-5-404.1(2). <em>Stonecipher, </em>759 F.3d at 1141 (quoting <em>Cortez, </em>478 F.3d at 1120). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Papadakos\u2019 arrest didn\u2019t violate his clearly established Fourth Amendment rights, and the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the Estate\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">III. The defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the Estate\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment claim because the Fourth Amendment\u2014 rather than the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014governs pretrial liberty deprivations.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Finally, we turn to the Estate\u2019s assertion that the defendants violated Pa-padakos\u2019 clearly established Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">First, the Estate suggests that the defendants violated Papadakos\u2019 clearly established Fourteenth Amendment rights by violating Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 62A-4a-202.1(l)(a). But even assuming that the defendants violated \u00a7 62A-4a-202.1(l)(a), \u201ca state\u2019s violation of its own laws does not create a claim under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Rector v. City &amp; Cnty. of Denver, </em>348 F.3d 935, 947 (10th Cir. 2003).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Next, citing <em>Clanton v. Cooper, </em>129 F.3d 1147 (10th Cir. 1997), the Estate asserts that the defendants violated Papadakos\u2019 clearly established Fourteenth Amendment rights by using B.P.\u2019s allegedly coerced statements to arrest Papadakos and to initiate criminal charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">In <em>Clanton, </em>we held that a government actor violated the plaintiffs clearly established due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by obtaining a third party\u2019s involuntary confession and then using that involuntary confession to arrest and imprison the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 1152, 1159. But we reached that conclusion without evaluating wh\u00e9ther such a substantive due process claim could survive the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Albright v. Oliver, </em>510 U.S. 266, 114 S.Ct. 807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994) (plurality opinion). And when we explicitly analyzed that question a decade after deciding <em>Clanton, see Becker v. Kroll, </em>494 F.3d 904, 917-19, 922-24 (10th Cir. 2007), we implicitly overruled <em>Clanton </em>to the extent it suggests that a plaintiff may bring a Fourteenth Amendment claim under these circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">In <em>Becker, </em>we concluded that \u201cthe unavoidable construction of <em>Albright </em>is that no \u00a7 1983 claim will arise from filing crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>nal charges without probable cause under the substantive due process protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id,, </em>at 918. Instead, \u201cthe Fourth Amendment govern[s] \u2018pretrial deprivations of liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Meacham, </em>82 F.3d 1556, 1560 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting <em>Albright, </em>510 U.S. at 274, 114 S.Ct. 807). And while we recognized that exceptions to this general rule might exist\u2014e.g., \u201cwhere some quantum of harm occurs in the interim period after groundless criminal charges are filed but before any Fourth Amendment seizure,\u201d <em>Becker, </em>494 F.3d at 922 (quoting <em>Albright, </em>510 U.S. at 291, 114 S.Ct. 807 (Souter, J., concurring)), such an exception wouldn\u2019t apply here because Papadakos was arrested and charged on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-15\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Albright </em>and our opinions in <em>Becker </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>we conclude that Papadakos had no substantive due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment to remain free from being arrested for, or charged with, a crime based on the allegedly coerced statements of a third party. <em>See Taylor, </em>82 F.3d at 1560 (concluding that \u201cFourteenth Amendment substantive due process standards ha[d] no applicability\u201d to plaintiffs allegation \u201cthat his wrongful arrest and seven-week detention constituted an unreasonable seizure and deprivation of his liberty, in violation of the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments,\u201d and proceeding to address plaintiffs claim solely under Fourth Amendment framework). Thus, the defendants didn\u2019t violate Papa-dakos\u2019 Fourteenth Amendment rights by obtaining and using B.P.\u2019s allegedly coerced statements to arrest Papadakos and initiate a criminal prosecution against him. And because the defendants didn\u2019t violate Papadakos\u2019 Fourteenth Amendment rights, they are entitled to qualified immunity on the Estate\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment claim. <em>See Mayfield, </em>826 F.3d at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"Axe\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Viewed from any angle, this case is a tragic one. But that fact cannot inform our legal analysis. The defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the Estate\u2019s constitutional claims because they didn\u2019t violate Papadakos\u2019 constitutional rights. And the district court correctly granted judgment in the defendants\u2019 favor on the Estate\u2019s malicious-prosecution claim because the underlying criminal prosecution didn\u2019t terminate in Papadakos\u2019 favor. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders granting Jorgensen\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and Norton\u2019s motion for summary judgment. As a final matter, we grant Norton\u2019s motion to maintain the seal on the video recordings of B.P.\u2019s interviews.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b672-10\"> This order and judgment isn\u2019t binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. But it may be cited for its persuasive value. <em>See </em>Fed. R, App. P. 32.1; 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\">. As the district court pointed out below, the Estate failed to cite any authority that might support its Fifth Amendment claim. Because the Estate neither disputes the district court\u2019s characterization of its Fifth Amendment claim below nor attempts to fully develop that claim on appeal, we confine our analysis to its Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims. <em>See Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>144 F.3d 664, 679 (10th Cir. 1998) (noting that \u201d[a]rgu-ments inadequately briefed in the opening brief are waived\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b673-14\">. To the extent that the Estate also asserted any state-law claims against Norton, the district court concluded that the Estate abandoned those claims below. And the Estate doesn\u2019t challenge that ruling in its opening brief. Accordingly, the Estate has waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>See Adler, </em>144 F.3d at 679.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\">. Because we ultimately conclude that Papa-dakos' arrest didn\u2019t violate his clearly established Fourth Amendment rights, we find it unnecessary to determine whether Jorgen-sen\u2019s alleged contribution to that arrest\u2014i.e., her participation in obtaining B.P.\u2019s allegedly false statements\u2014is sufficient to support a Fourth Amendment claim against her under \u00a7 1983. <em>Cf. Pierce </em>v. <em>Gilchrist, </em>359 F.3d 1279, 1293 (10th Cir. 2004) (concluding that forensic analyst who \"distorted] evidence to convince the prosecuting authorities to press charges\u201d couldn\u2019t \" \u2018hide behind\u2019 the fact that she neither initiated nor filed the charges against\u201d plaintiff).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\">. True, \"state statutes may create liberty interests that are entitled to the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Vitek v. Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 488, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980). But whether a state statute creates such a liberty interest turns on multiple factors, none of which the Estate even attempts to address here. <em>See Ky. Dep't of Corr. v. Thompson, </em>490 U.S. 454, 464-65, 109 S.Ct. 1904, 104 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989) (concluding that certain regulations didn\u2019t \"establish a liberty interest entitled to the protections of the Due Process Clause\u201d because they \u201clack[ed] the requisite relevant mandatory language\u201d). Because we find the single sentence that the Estate dedicates to this argument insufficient to adequately brief the issue, we decline to consider it. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A); <em>Bronson, </em>500 F.3d at 1104.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b677-13\">. A panel of this court lacks authority to overrule a previous panel\u2019s holding absent en banc rehearing or an intervening Supreme Court decision. <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>751 F.3d 1204, 1209 (10th Cir. 2014). But this general rule doesn\u2019t apply to \u201c[qpuestions which merely lurk in the record,\u201d and are \"neither brought to the attention of the [previous panel] nor ruled upon.\u201d <em>See United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 1564 v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>207 F.3d 1193, 1199 (10th Cir. 2000) (quoting <em>Webster v. Fall, </em>266 U.S. 507, 511, 45 S.Ct. 148, 69 L.Ed. 411 (1925)). Because we didn\u2019t explicitly address <em>Al-bright\u2019s </em>impact in <em>Clanton, </em>\"there [was] no holding on th[at] particular ... issue to which\u201d the <em>Becker </em>court had to \"defer,\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
