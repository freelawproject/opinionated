Warrior argues that the Commission erred in determining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny the petition and affirm the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Because we write for the parties, we assume their familiarity with the underlying record and facts, and recite only what is necessary to resolve this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">After detecting a potentially explosive concentration of methane gas in a roof cavity of a coal mine operated by Jim Walter Resources, an MSHA inspector issued an imminent danger withdrawal order that required the temporary cessation (for about twenty minutes) of coal mining activities. JWR contested the withdrawal order before an ALJ. Following an eviden-tiary hearing that included the testimony of several witnesses and review of the parties\u2019 briefs, the ALJ determined that the MSHA inspector had not abused his discretion in issuing the withdrawal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">In reaching his decision, the ALJ recognized that the \u201ccritical question in determining whether an accumulation of methane presents an imminent danger is whether there is an ignition source that might reasonably be expected to cause an explosion ...\u201d that could result in harm or serious injury to miners. <em>See </em>ALJ Decision, 36 FMSHRC 235, 240 (Jan. 2014). The ALJ noted that there was no dispute that there was a methane buildup in a roof cavity of the mine that was in the explosive range (above 5%). The ALJ then accepted only one of the four potential ignition sources identified by the inspector. Recognizing the conflicting testimony as to whether the ignition source\u2014a Lo Trac vehicle routinely used to transport mining materials\u2014could have entered the area near the roof cavity, the ALJ ultimately concluded that although the risk was remote, the inspector\u2019s decision to issue the withdrawal order was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Following the ALJ\u2019s decision, JRW petitioned for review before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. In a split decision, a majority of the five-member Commission affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, determining that it was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Secretary of Labor v. Jim Walter Resources, Inc., </em>37 FMSHRC 1968, 1969 (Sep. 2015). The two dissenting commissioners viewed the inspector\u2019s withdrawal order as premature because there was \u201cclearly time to consider whether there was a reasonable expectation of injury before abatement [of the methane concentration] could be completed _\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1982. JWR appealed the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">During the pendency of this appeal, JWR filed for bankruptcy and Warrior purchased JWR\u2019s assets at a bankruptcy sale. As the current owner of the coal mine at issue in this appeal, Warrior petitions this Court for review of the Commission\u2019s decision to affirm the ALJ\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">We have jurisdiction to review a decision of the Commission under \u00a7 106(a)(1) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(a)(1). We review <em>de novo </em>the legal conclusions of the ALJ and the Commission. <em>See Sumpter v. Sec\u2019y of Labor, </em>763 F.3d 1292, 1299 (11th Cir. 2014). Findings of fact, however, are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>See id. See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number><em>also </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(a)(1) (\u201cThe findings of the Commission with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive.\u201d)- Substantial evidence includes \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>See Sumpter, </em>763 F.3d at 1299 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). This limited review does not allow us to re-weigh the evidence or question an ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See id, </em>at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The Mine Act authorizes the Secretary of Labor, largely through MSHA inspectors, to take preventative or remedial actions when certain conditions arise in a coal mine. <em>See generally </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 813-817. This case concerns an inspector\u2019s authority to issue an imminent danger withdrawal order for mine workers under \u00a7 107(a) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Notably, the Act begins with Congress\u2019 declaration that \u201cthe first priority and concern of all in the coal or other mining industry must be the health and safety of its most precious resource\u2014the miner _\u201d30 U.S.C. \u00a7 801. In accordance with this purpose, \u00a7 107(a) of the Act authorizes an inspector to issue a withdrawal order upon detection of an imminent danger during a mine inspection until the inspector determines that the \u201cimminent danger and the conditions or practices which caused such imminent danger no longer exists.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 817(a). An \u201cimminent danger\u201d is defined as \u201cthe existence of any condition or practice in a coal or other mine which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before such condition or practice can be abated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 802(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">After reviewing the testimony of five witnesses and relevant provisions of the Mine Act regarding imminent dangers, the ALJ applied the two main factors for evaluating an \u201cimminent danger\u201d in a coal mine. The ALJ first highlighted the undisputed presence of methane gas in the explosive range. Next, the ALJ examined whether the inspector could identify a potential ignition source and agreed that the \u201cLo Trac [vehicle] [wa]s a mobile piece of machinery that can be reasonably expected to travel to various portions of the mine, including the [area where] ... the buildup of methane remained in unremediated condition.\u201d <em>See </em>ALJ Decision, 36 FMSHRC at 243. The ALJ \u2022 excluded three additional ignition sources based on their distance from the roof cavity and found (based on the mine operator\u2019s expert witness\u2019 testimony) that methane rapidly dissolves after it escapes from a roof cavity. <em>See id. </em>at 241-42. The ALJ nevertheless rejected the mine operator\u2019s argument that speed of methane dissolution alone negates the immediacy of a threat from an inspector\u2019s perspective. <em>See id. </em>at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">The ALJ then determined that there were sufficient objective reasons for the inspector to conclude that the Lo Trac vehicle could have entered the dangerous area and ignited the methane before it could have been diluted to a safe level. The ALJ noted the Lo Trac vehicle\u2019s mobility, the lack of enclosures to secure its electrical components, the proximity to the roof cavity, and the fact that the vehicle was \u201cin an operable condition at the time of the issuance of the imminent danger order.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 243. The ALJ further reasoned that \u201c[t]he fact that the Lo Trac had been \u2018tagged out\u2019 for repair (not by order of the inspector but by mine authorities) [was] not dispositive\u201d on the issue of whether it was likely that the Lo Trac vehicle could have entered the dangerous area. <em>See id. </em>In sum, the ALJ concluded that, from the inspector\u2019s perspective, nothing could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>prevented the Lo Trac vehicle from being used to transport materials to mine workers near the dangerous roof cavity.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">In reviewing the ALJ\u2019s opinion, a majority of the Commission began by recognizing two factors that influenced the inspector\u2019s decision. <em>See Jim Walter Resources, </em>37 FMSHRC at 1971-72. First, the Lo Trac vehicle was a \u201cnon-permissible\u201d piece of equipment\u2014meaning that it lacked safety enclosures to prevent an explosion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, the inspector \u201cknew that the Lo Trac [wa]s a mobile piece of equipment that commonly delivered materials\u201d throughout the area near the roof cavity. <em>See id. </em>The majority cited the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that although the Lo Trac vehicle was tagged out (to fix a minor leak), none of the evidence indicated that the vehicle could not have been put back into use before the methane could be diluted. <em>See id. </em>at 1970. Acknowledging the inspector\u2019s awareness that the surrounding area was the source of some mining activity, the majority concluded that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and that \u201c[i]t was reasonable for [the inspector] to surmise that the Lo Trac could wind up in a position where it could ignite the methane in the roof cavity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1972-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Warrior encourages us to adopt the dissent\u2019s position that the ALJ erred because he failed to focus on whether the inspector made an objectively reasonable investigation of the facts before issuing the withdrawal order. The dissent reasoned that, in light of the statutory definition for \u201cimminent danger\u201d requiring a reasonable potential for injury \u201cbefore such condition or practice can be abated,\u201d <em>see </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(j), the inspector acted prematurely \u201c[g]iven the obvious and nearby means for rapid abatement and the absence of any ignition source.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1982. We concur that the sufficiency of an inspector\u2019s investigation depends on the circumstances. We disagree, however, that the inspector\u2019s evaluation of the circumstances here was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Warrior also points to another case where a unanimous Commission panel determined that an MSHA inspector had abused his discretion in issuing two withdrawal orders based on a single criterion. <em>See Secretary of Labor v. Cumberland Coal Resources, </em>28 FMSHRC 545, 556 (Aug. 2006) (reversing an ALJ\u2019s decision because the inspector was advised to pre-write imminent danger orders \u201cif he found more than 4.5% methane ... precluding] the inspector from conducting a requisite reasonable investigation of the facts in exercising his discretion\u201d). That case, however, is not helpful here. Unlike the situation in <em>Cumberland Coal, </em>where the inspector relied on the methane readings alone, the inspector in this case looked beyond the methane reading and specifically considered whether there was an ignition source that could potentially ignite the methane and cause injury to miners. Moreover, it was unclear whether the inspector in <em>Cumberland Coal </em>had properly identified methane concentrations in the explosive range. <em>See id. </em>at 557 (explaining that the inspector admitted he was unsure about the methane concentration in one of the areas where he issued an imminent danger order). The inspector\u2019s methane reading is undisputed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Warrior\u2019s principal argument is that alternate inferences from the facts\u2014the mine\u2019s inactivity, lack of miners near the roof cavity, and the unlikelihood that the Lo Trac vehicle could have entered the area in time to ignite the methane\u2014are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>case dispositive. Given the substantial evidence standard, we disagree. The inspector testified that he observed at least eight workers at the mine and that he knew the Lo Trac vehicle was mobile. Three workers testified that they were in the area near the roof cavity, including one miner who was directed to move the Lo Trac vehicle to a washing station nearby. A safety supervisor and a miners\u2019 representative were with the inspector when he found the methane buildup in the roof cavity. The fact that no coal was being produced in the area, alone, does not rule out the possibility of an imminent risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Importantly, the ALJ did not ignore the alternative inferences; rather, he determined that the inspector was within his discretion\u2014by evaluating the circumstances at the time he issued the withdrawal order\u2014to ensure the safety of the workers at the mine. The ALJ understood that the Lo Trac vehicle\u2019s risk of ignition was remote. Citing clothing static as an example, the ALJ said that ignition sources are speculative in nature. The ALJ explained that \u201cwhen methane gathers in the explosive range, any spark is an ignition source ... [thus,] [t]he issue [wa]s whether the inspector\u2019s decision to consider the possibility that the Lo Trac could [have] enter[ed] the crosscut and a spark therefrom could [have] ignite[d] the methane is a reasonable one.\u201d <em>See </em>ALJ Decision, 36 FMSHRC at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The inspector\u2019s exercise of his discretion to issue a withdrawal order here caused mine operations to shut down for approximately twenty minutes until the methane inside the roof cavity was diluted to a safe level. The ALJ\u2019s decision demonstrates careful consideration of the factual circumstances in light of the witness testimony presented, and it supports the conclusion that the MSHA inspector did not abuse his discretion in issuing the withdrawal order. To hold otherwise would require us to reweigh conflicting evidence and the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations. We therefore agree with the Commission that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">iy</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">We affirm the Commission\u2019s decision and deny Warrior\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-8\">.
