Stevenson argues that there was insufficient evidence supporting her conviction. She also argues that the district court\u2019s jury instructions regarding the definitions of money laundering were plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">In a ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal, we must determine \u201cwhether there is substantial evidence from which a jury could reasonable find the defendant ] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Gregory, </em>730 F.2d 692, 706 (11th Cir. 1984). We review the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and making all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the government\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324,1349 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">. \u201cThe jury gets to make any credibility choices, and we will assume .that they made them all in the way that supports the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>473 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir. 2006). A defendant who chooses to testify runs the risk that the jury, if it does not find the testimony credible, might conclude that its opposite is true. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314 (11th Cir. 1995). The jury is free to choose between or among the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the evidence presented at trial, and the court must accept all reasonable inferences and credibility determinations made by the jury. <em>United States v. Molina, </em>443 F.3d 824, 828 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">To obtain a conviction for conspiracy to launder money, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) two or more persons agreed to launder money and (2) the defendant, knowing the unlawful plan, voluntarily joined the conspiracy to launder money. <em>United States v. Martinelli, </em>454 F.3d 1300, 1310 (11th Cir. 2006). The existence of an agreement may be proven by circumstantial evidence, including inferences from the conduct of the alleged participants or from circumstantial evidence of a scheme. <em>United States v. Azmat, </em>805 F.3d 1018, 1037 (11th Cir. 2015), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S. Ct. 2012, 195 L.Ed.2d 222 (2016). The government may establish knowledge of an illegal agreement by showing that the defendant knew the essential object of the conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>A central aspect of a money laundering conspiracy charge is that the defendant knew that the funds involved in the transactions represented the proceeds of unlawful activity. <em>See United States v. Awan, </em>966 F.2d 1415, 1434 (11th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">To obtain a conviction for the substantive offense of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, the government must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>that (1) the defendant conducted or attempted to conduct a financial transaction; (2) the transaction involved the proceeds of an unlawful activity; (3) the defendant knew the proceeds were from some form of illegal activity; and (4) either (a) the defendant engaged in the financial transaction with the intent to promote the carrying on of a specified unlawful activity, or (b) the defendant engaged in the financial transaction knowing that the transaction was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or the control of the proceeds. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i), (B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Here, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude that Stevenson knowingly and voluntarily joined a money laundering scheme. Witnesses testified that Stevenson delivered drugs, stored drugs, stored the cash proceeds of drug sales, and wired money for drug payments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stevenson testified that she knew of Wesley Tubbs\u2019 prior drug-related convictions. The government produced evidence of cash transfers into Stevenson\u2019s account and expert testimony that the pattern of transfers and withdrawals was indicative of the movement of drug proceeds. Additionally, Stevenson\u2019s own testimony that she did <em>not </em>know that the money transferred, into her account was the proceeds of drug trafficking could support the jury\u2019s conclusion that she did know this. <em>See Brown </em>53 F.3d at 314. There was also testimony that Stevenson asked Tubbs for money. Drawing all inferences in favor of the government, the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that there existed an agreement to launder money\u2014i.e. that Tubbs and his associates agreed to pay drug trafficking proceeds to Stevenson in order to assure her continued cooperation or to conceal their source\u2014 and that Stevenson knowingly and voluntarily joined that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Jury instructions that are challenged for the first time on appeal are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Felts, </em>579 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the \u201cplain error\u201d standard, the defendant must \u25a0 demonstrate that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1344. For an error to be plain, it must be one that is obvious and clear under current law. <em>United States v. Dortch, </em>696 F.3d 1104, 1112 (11th Cir. 2012). An error is not obvious and clear when no Supreme Court decision squarely supports the defendant\u2019s argument, \u201cother circuits ... are split\u201d regarding the resolution of the argument, and we have never resolved the issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">\u201cA district judge is vested with broad discretion in formulating a jury charge so long as the charge as a whole accurately reflects the law and the facts.\u201d <em>Felts, </em>579 F.3d at 1344 n.l. A conviction will not be reversed on the basis of an improper jury charge unless \u201cthe issues of law were presented inaccurately, the charge included crimes not in the indictment, or the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Turner, </em>871 F.2d 1574, 1578 (11th Cir. 1989) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">When a party \u201cinduces or invites\u201d the district court into making an error, the doctrine of invited error precludes the party from seeking review of that error on appeal. <em>United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Stone, </em>139 F.3d 822, 838 (11th Cir. 1998) (per curiam)). Merely failing to object to the jury instructions does not trigger the doctrine of invited error. <em>Dortch, </em>696 F.3d at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Stevenson alleges three inadequacies in the jury instruction: First, the jury instructions did not further define the term \u201cwith the intent to promote the carrying on of specified lawful activity.\u201d Second, the jury instructions did not define \u201cconcealment.\u201d Third, the jury instructions did not define the term \u201cproceeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">The doctrine of invited error bars Stevenson from challenging the jury instructions on the basis of their failure to define \u201cproceeds.\u201d A mere failure to object to a jury instruction does not trigger the doctrine. <em>See Dortch, </em>696 F,3d at 1112. But when a defendant specifically agrees to a particular instruction, the doctrine of invited error applies. <em>See United States v. Fulford, 267 </em>F.3d 1241, 1247 (11th Cir. 2001) (holding that defendant was barred from challenging specific supplemental jury instruction when the defendant\u2019s counsel had stated \u201cthe instruction is acceptable to us\u201d). Here, the trial judge explicitly asked Stevenson\u2019s counsel whether he wanted to include the very definition (of \u201cproceeds\u201d) whose omission is now alleged to be error, and he declined. Because Stevenson invited any error with regard to the omission of this definition, she cannot challenge it on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">The district court\u2019s omission of definitions of \u201cconcealment\u201d and \u201cwith the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\u201d was not plain error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the omission was erroneous, Stevenson must show that the error was plain\u2014that is, it is obvious and clear under current law. <em>See Dortch, </em>696 F.3d at 1112. An error is not plain if no Supreme Court precedent squarely supports the defendant\u2019s argument, \u201cother circuits ... are split,\u201d and we have not resolved the issue. <em>See id. </em>Stevenson has cited no case to support her position that the omission of these definitions was erroneous, and we can find none. Accordingly, the omission does not constitute plain error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Stevenson invited any error with regard to the district court\u2019s omission of further definition of the term \u201cproceeds\u201d and any error involving omission of the other definitions was not plain error. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-5\">. Stevenson's argument that the trial judge mentioned at sentencing that she found all but one of the government\u2019s lay witnesses not to be credible, is unavailing. Credibility determinations are for the jury. <em>See Thompson, </em>473 F.3d at 1142.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-6\"><em>. </em>Stevenson relies on language taken from <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999), to assert that a jury instruction omitting an element of the offense is subject to \"harmless error\u201d review. This is incorrect. In <em>Neder, </em>the defendant had timely objected to the jury instruction. <em>See id., </em>527 U.S. at 6, 119 S.Ct. at 1832. Where no objection is made to a jury instruction at trial, plain error review applies. <em>See Felts, </em>579 E.3d at 1343.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b855-7\">. Even if the doctrine of invited error did not apply to bar Stevenson\u2019s challenge to the omission of a definition of \"proceeds\u201d from the jury instructions, Stevenson\u2019s challenge would fail because any error was not plain. Stevenson argues that, in <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008), the Supreme Court defined \u201cproceeds\u201d to mean <em>profits, </em>rather than receipts. <em>Id., </em>553 U.S. at 513, 128 S. Ct. 2020 (plurality opinion). But the <em>Santos </em>holding is controlled by Justice Stevens' concurrence in the judgment, which limited the definition of proceeds to gambling operations, <em>see id., </em>553 U.S. at 528, 128 S. Ct. 2020, 2033-34 (opinions of Stevens, J.), and strongly suggested that \"proceeds\u201d should mean revenues in cases involving sales of contraband. <em>See id. </em>553 U.S. at 525-26, 128 S. Ct. 2020, 2031-32. We have consistently read <em>Santos </em>as applying only to cases involving gambling operations. <em>See United States v. Jennings, </em>599 F.3d 1241, 1252 (11th Cir. 2010) (\"The narrow holding in <em>Santos, </em>at most, was that the gross receipts of an unlicensed gambling operation were not 'proceeds\u2019 under section 1956.\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Demarest, </em>570 F.3d 1232, 1242 (11th Cir. 2009)). Further, we note that because Stevenson was charged with conspiracy to launder money rather than with the substantive offense, the government was not required to prove the actual nature of the money transferred. Thus, the omission of a definition of \"proceeds\" did not constitute plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b855-11\">. The government argues that Stevenson\u2019s challenges to the omission of these definitions are also barred by the doctrine of invited error. This is incorrect. Stevenson\u2019s counsel was asked if he had any objections to the jury instructions <em>in toto, </em>to which he responded in the negative (with one exception not relevant here). This cannot be said to have induced the district court into making the errors that Stevenson now alleges. Rather, Stevenson\u2019s statement that she had no objections to the jury instruction should be considered a failure to object. <em>See Dortch, </em>696 F.3d at 1112; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number><em>also United States v. Fuentes, </em>537 Fed.Appx. 921, 926 (11th Cir. 2013) (unpub.) (rejecting argument that defendant invited error by failing to object when asked if parties were \"satisfied with the reading of the instructions\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b856-8\">. The omission of the definitions, even if erroneous, does not meet the high bar of plain error. Stevenson provides little explanation of how further clarification of these terms would have affected the jury\u2019s verdict, The omitted definition of \"with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\u201d reads \"the Defendant must have [conducted] [attempted to conduct] the financial transaction for the purpose of making easier or helping to bring about the 'specified unlawful activity\u2019 as just defined.\u201d Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) 74.1 (2016). The omitted definition\u2014essentially, informing the jury that \"intent\u201d means \"purpose\u201d and \"promote\u201d means \"make easier or help\u201d\u2014is similar to the language that the court included in the jury instruction and does not omit any element of the money laundering offense. The pattern jury instructions do not include further definition of \u201cconcealment,\u201d and Stevenson does not suggest an alternative formulation. <em>See </em>id.74.2. Regardless, we are satisfied that the failure to further define this term did not amount to plain error. The omission of the definitions of \"concealment\u201d and \"intent to promote\u201d was not plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
