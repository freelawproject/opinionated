Moritz Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">Mike Kirkpatrick appeals from a district court order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits (DIB) and supplemental security income (SSI). Exercising jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b667-18\">Kirkpatrick has a twelfth-grade education and has worked as a tree trimmer and lawn mower. He suffers from left-eye blindness, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), depression, and substance abuse. He has also suffered from bladder cancer, which required a surgical procedure known as a radical cystectomy with ileal conduit formation. During that procedure, surgeons removed his bladder and used a piece of his intestine to create a tube running from his kidneys to his abdominal wall. A pouch worn on his abdomen collects excreted urine.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-19\">In 2010, Kirkpatrick applied for DIB and SSI, claiming disability since 2004, when he was forty-two. Unsuccessful, he obtained a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). There, he described his difficulty working: \u201cHaving ... a pouch greatly limits any kind of work I\u2019ve done before, and I\u2019m blind in the left eye, and COPD makes it ... where I can\u2019t really do anything very strenuous [bejcause of ... shortness of breath.\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. I at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>59. He also cited problems with arthritis and depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Regarding his left-eye blindness, he explained that he has little peripheral vision or depth perception. And while he is presently \u201cclear of cancer,\u201d the pouch, which must be worn all the time, makes it hard for him to bend over or \u201chave anything in contact ,.. with [his] waist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61. Nevertheless, he has been able to do \u201ca few odd jobs,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 64, such as \u201csweeping[ ] and picking up[ ] ... small items and putting them in the trash\u201d and \u201c[m]owing a few yards,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">A vocational expert (VE) also testified at the hearing. The ALJ queried whether Kirkpatrick\u2019s past work could be performed by a hypothetical claimant (1) who could perform a wide range of light work without exposure to unprotected heights or dangerous machinery; (2) who \u201cwear[s] a bag[ ] ... to accommodate some physical problems\u201d and thus can only occasionally stoop, kneel, and crouch; and (3) whose left-eye blindness precludes \u201coccupations that require . peripheral vision[ ] and ... extended reading of f\u00edne print.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68-69. The VE ruled out Kirkpatrick\u2019s past work, but he identified \u201csome entry-level light work,\u201d such as a cleaner, packing-line worker, and small-products assembler, that the hypothetical claimant could perform. <em>Id. </em>at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Afterward, the ALJ found Kirkpatrick not disabled. In doing so, the ALJ concluded that Kirkpatrick has the residual functional capacity (RFC)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to perform light work, so long as it does\u2019nt involve \u201cextended reading of f\u00edne print[,] ... extended exposure to unprotected heights or dangerous machinery,\u201d or anything more than occasional stooping, kneeling, and crouching. <em>Id. </em>at 42. The ALJ noted that no treating or examining physician had placed any permanent limitations on Kirkpatrick\u2019s ability to perform basic work. Further, the ALJ observed that Kirkpatrick had, at times throughout the disability proceedings, described activities of daily living-driving a car, shopping, \u201chelp[ing] a friend around his house,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 213, doing laundry, preparing meals\u2014\u201cthat are not limited to the extent one would expect, given the complaints of disabling symptoms and limitations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 47. The ALJ finally noted that while Kirkpatrick\u2019s RFC precluded his past relevant work, the VE had testified that other jobs existed in the national economy consistent with Kirkpatrick\u2019s RFC. The Appeals Council denied review, making the ALJ\u2019s determination the Commissioner\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Kirkpatrick challenged the denial of benefits in district court. Unsuccessful, he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine whether substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s factual findings and whether the agency applied the correct legal standards. But in reviewing the administrative decision, we neither reweigh the evidence nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency. <em>Vigil v. Colvin, </em>805 F,3d 1199,1201 (10th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">Kirkpatrick first argues his RFC is flawed because, despite finding that his COPD is a severe impairment, the ALJ did not consider his \u201cinability to be exposed to environmental pollutants such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>fumes, cleaning fluids, dusts, odors, gases, extreme heat or cold and/or poor ventilation.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 4. But Kirkpatrick doesn\u2019t identify, nor have we found, any evidence suggesting such pollutants and conditions affected his capacity to perform the physical and mental activities associated with light work. Indeed, at his disability hearing, Kirkpatrick described his COPD as precluding \u201cstrenuous\u201d work due to \u201cshortness of breath.\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. I at 59. The ALJ accounted for this limitation by fashioning an RFC for light work, which involves only minimally strenuous activities, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(b), 416.967(b). Because Kirkpatrick has not shown that environmental pollutants or other conditions degrade his functioning beyond that necessary for light work, we will not disturb the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination. <em>See Qualls v. Apfel, </em>206 F.3d 1368, 1372 (10th Cir. 2000) (stating that in assessing claimant\u2019s RFC, an ALJ isn\u2019t required to account for limitation belied by the record); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(c) (explaining, in context of DIB, that claimant bears responsibility for identifying or submitting evidence that relates to finding of disability); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 416.912(c) (same as to SSI).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Relatedly, we reject Kirkpatrick\u2019s assertion that the hypothetical the ALJ presented to the VE failed to precisely relate limitations caused by environmental conditions. Again, the limitations he complains of aren\u2019t borne out by the record. <em>See Decker v. Chafer, </em>86 F.3d 953, 955 (10th Cir. 1996) (holding that hypothetical question to VE need only include impairments supported by evidentiary record). Moreover, none of the jobs identified by the VE require exposure to temperature extremes, atmospheric conditions, or toxic caustic chemicals'. <em>See Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>323.687-014, 1991 WL 672783 (4th rev. ed. 1991) (cleaner); <em>id. </em>739.687-030, 1991 WL 680180 (small-products assembler); <em>id. </em>753.687-038, 1991 WL 680354 (packing-line worker). Thus, the alleged limitations are not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Citing his \u201climited depth perception and extreme loss of peripheral vision,\u201d Kirkpatrick next complains that his RFC doesn\u2019t fully account for his visual problems. Aplt. Opening Br. at 5. But in assessing Kirkpatrick\u2019s RFC, the ALJ noted that \u201chis peripheral , [vision] and depth perception is limited.\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. I at 43. Thus, the ALJ fashioned an RFC with limited fine-print reading and limited exposure to unprotected heights and dangerous machinery. Further, the ALJ presented a hypothetical to the VE that precluded jobs that involved \u201cexposure to unprotected heights[] or dangerous machinery\u201d and that \u201crequire[d] peripheral vision[] and ... extended reading of fine print.\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. I at 68-69. Kirkpatrick doesn\u2019t explain how these restrictions fail to account for his depth-perception and peripheral-vision deficits. And it isn\u2019t our obligation to search the record and construct a party\u2019s arguments. <em>See Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, </em>425 F.3d ,836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">In any event, Kirkpatrick contends that only two of the jobs identified by the VE (assembler and. packing-line worker) exceed his vision limitations. <em>See </em>Aplt. Opening Br. at 8. Thus, the third job identified by the VE, the cleaner job, is not precluded by his vision limitations. <em>See Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>323.687-014, 1991 WL 672783 (4th rev. ed. 1991) (stating that depth perception and field of vision limitations aren\u2019t present in cleaner job). Thus, even if the ALJ failed to fully account for Kirkpatrick\u2019s depth-perception and peripheral-vision limitations, that error is harmless. <em>Cf. Raymond v. Astrue, </em>621 F.3d 1269, 1273-74 (10th Cir. 2009) (declining to consider claimant\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>that ALJ erroneously relied on VE\u2019s testimony \u201cthat he was physically able to work as a sales attendant or an office helper\u201d because \u201csubstantial record evidence supported] the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that [claimant] [could] work as a rental clerk\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Kirkpatrick further suggests that anyone with vision in only one eye would have \u201cdifficulty with production or pace\u201d and \u201cseefing] things quickly or avoiding] fast moving people.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 5. He argues that these limitations \u201cshould have been accounted for in the ALJ\u2019s RFC\u201d and that he \u201ceven testified to his problems in his hearing before this ALJ.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But the citation to the record he provides is not supportive. <em>See </em>Aplt. App., Vol. I at 60 (stating only, \u201cI still don\u2019t have much peripheral or depth perception really, but I\u2019ve kind [of] learned to cope as best I can\u201d). Clearly, an ALJ doesn\u2019t commit error by omitting limitations not supported by the record. <em>See Qualls, </em>206 F.3d at 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Additionally, Kirkpatrick takes issue with the ALJ\u2019s use of the word \u201cextended\u201d in his RFC assessment. <em>See </em>Aplt. App., Vol. I at 42 (\u201c[T]he claimant has the [RFC] to perform light work[,] ... except due to left eye blindness he is not able to perform <em>extended </em>reading of fine print ... [and] should avoid <em>extended </em>exposure to unprotected heights or dangerous machinery.\u201d (emphasis added)). Kirkpatrick asserts that the word \u201cextended\u201d \u201cis not defined in vocational terms and it is not a proper social security term.\u201d Aplt. Opening' Br. at 6.'He doesn\u2019t explain, however, how the ALJ\u2019s use of this term has any bearing on whether his RFC is supported by substantial evidence. We don\u2019t consider \u201cissues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation.\u201d <em>Murrell v. Shalala, </em>43 F.3d 1388,1389 n.2 (10th Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Finally, Kirkpatrick complains that the only urinary limitation included in his RFC is that he can only \u201coccasionally stoop, kneel, and crouch due to [the] bag he wears to capture urine.\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. I at 42. He argues that the ALJ should have assessed a more restrictive RFC, claiming that he suffers from (1) \u201cchronic frequency dysuria and urgency\u201d due to urothelial carcinoma; (2) \u201cpain, urinary incontinence, constipation, or leaks inside his body\u201d due to \u201cthe persistence of the cancer and tumors\u201d; and (3) \u201ccontinually recurring bladder cancer.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 9. But as he did in the district court, Kirkpatrick misleadingly supports these' claims with citations to medical records that originated <em>before </em>the removal of his bladder. As the district court noted, \u201cit is disingenuous to present\u201d these claims as current or ongoing despite Kirpatrick\u2019s successful cystectomy, which has rendered him cancer free. Aplt. App., Vol. Ill at 674. Kirkpatrick also claims that his doctors \u201cfailed to repair\u201d a urinoma (an encapsulated collection of urine) that resulted from his cystectomy. Aplt. Opening Br. at 9. Yet the record shows that his doctors \u201cmanaged [the problem] conservatively,\u201d and it resolved. Aplt. App., Vol. Ill at 425.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Kirkpatrick also argues his RFC should have accounted for his use of a urinary catheter and catheter bag. But he cites no evidence showing he actually uses a cathe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>ter or catheter bag. Indeed, the record shows that Kirkpatrick wears a urostomy pouch on the outside of his abdomen to collect urine. And significantly, in regard to the limitations posed by that pouch, Kirkpatrick testified only that it makes it difficult for him to bend over or to have items come in contact with his waist. The ALJ accounted for those difficulties by fashioning an RFC permitting only occasional stooping, kneeling, and crouching \u201cdue to [the] bag he wears to capture urine.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Vol. I at 42. Kirkpatrick has failed to show his RFC is unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">. \"The RFC assessment is a fonction-by-function assessment based upon all of the relevant evidence of an individual's ability to do work-related activities.\u201d SSR 96-8p, 1996 WL 374184, at *3 (July 2, 1996).
