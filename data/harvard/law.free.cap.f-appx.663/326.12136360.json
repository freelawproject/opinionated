Before sentencing, the Government moved for a downward departure, pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 5K1.1, because Cathey provided substantial assistance. That section provides: \u201cUpon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">At sentencing, after the Government called a witness to testify in support of its \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-12\">I find that the defendant did provide substantial assistance to the government in the investigation and prosecution of the criminal activities of others, and that he would be eligible for a sentence below the bottom of the advisory guideline range. Of course, there are a lot of other factors that enter into it, and so I\u2019ll hear from [Cathey\u2019s attorney] on that subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7V\">After hearing from Cathey\u2019s attorney and Cathey, among others, the court reviewed Cathey\u2019s criminal history and the leniency of his prior sentences. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-15\">Were it not for the defendant\u2019s cooperation, ... I would be sentencing at the top of the advisory guideline range in this case, the 480 months of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-16\">I\u2019m going to reduce what I otherwise would have done to take into account his cooperation with the government, and the sentence I\u2019m going to impose also will take into account all of the factors the Court should consider in sentencing under 18 United States Code Section 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAHR\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-17\">I\u2019m going to sentence him at the bottom of the guideline range at ... 360 months, which is really a 120-month or 10-year reduction from what his sentence would have been had he not provided the cooperation to the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-18\">Cathey objected to the sentence as procedurally unreasonable, for \u201cfailing to follow the three-step process\u201d in <em>United States v. Malone, </em>828 F.3d 331, 340-41 (5th Cir. 2016). (The original version of <em>Malone </em>relied upon by Cathey, 809 F.3d 251 (5th Cir. 2015), was subsequently withdrawn and superseded. However, the portion upon which Cathey relies remains unchanged. <em>Compare </em>809 F.3d at 260-61 <em>with </em>828 F.3d 331 at 340-41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-19\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United, States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Cathey contends the court properly granted the Government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion but erred procedurally by simultaneously considering the extent of the \u00a7 5K1.1 departure and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In <em>Malone, </em>this- court held a district court in granting the Government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motions erred, albeit harmlessly, by conflating the determination of the extent of the departures warranted under \u00a7 5K1.1 with consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. 828 F.3d 331 at 340-41. Cathey asserts the court similarly granted the instant \u00a7 5K1.1 motion but erred by considering the \u00a7 5K1.1 depar-. ture and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors simultaneously, when it should have departed downward, before considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In the light of its comments, it is arguable the court did not grant a downward departure. In any event, <em>Malone </em>is distinguishable. There, the district court granted downward departures by sentencing defendants below their respective sentencing ranges; at issue was whether the court\u2019s procedure for determining those departures was erroneous. <em>See </em>828 F.3d 331 at 336-37, 340-41. Our court held the error harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 336-37. While Cath-ey attempts to distinguish <em>Malone\u2019s </em>harmlessness analysis, he ignores the court\u2019s explanation for why the sentence was appropriate for Cathey, despite his cooperation with the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">In addition, Cathey claims the portion of <em>Malone </em>holding the sentencing error harmless is no longer good law in the light of <em>Molina-Martinez v. United States. </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1338, 194 L.Ed.2d 444 (2016). There, however, the Court addressed only the showing a defendant must make, on plain-error review, to establish a Guidelines-calculation error affected his substantial rights; the Court did not address whether an error like the one claimed here may be deemed harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 1344-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Here, even if the court intended to grant the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, any error in imposing Cathey\u2019s sentence is harmless: the court recognized its authority to depart below the guidelines range, and the intended sentence was unambiguous. <em>See United States v. Hashimoto, </em>193 F.3d 840, 844-45 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-13\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00ede.
