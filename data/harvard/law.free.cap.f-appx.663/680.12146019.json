His amended complaint asserts that this conduct violated his rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and, apparently, his rights under the Fair Housing Act. All those served with process moved to have the amended complaint dismissed. The United States District Court for the District of Colorado dismissed it in its entirety. Mr. Carrillo appeals the dismissal and the order denying his motion for reconsideration. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">We first must assure ourselves of our appellate jurisdiction. Because Mr. Carrillo\u2019s notice of appeal was filed more than 30 days after entry of final judgment, this court issued an order requiring Mr. Carrillo to show cause why we should not dismiss the appeal as untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (stating the general rule that the notice of appeal \u201cmust be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\u201d). His response established that his notice of appeal had been timely filed under the prison-mailbox rule. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 4(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"A0L\">Our jurisdiction, however, is limited to review of the judgment. We cannot review the order denying Mr. Carrillo\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which was entered months after the notice of appeal was filed. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii) (\u201cA party intending to challenge an order disposing of [a postjudgment motion] .., must file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>notice of appeal, or an amended notice of appeal[,] ... within the time prescribed by this Rule measured from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.\u201d); <em>Coll v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., </em>642 F.3d 876, 885 (10th Cir. 2011) (\u201cto perfect an appeal from the district court\u2019s [post-notice-of-appeal] decision denying Plaintiffs\u2019 post-dismissal motion ..., Plaintiffs had to file a second notice of appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Carrillo\u2019s amended complaint, accepting his well-pleaded factual allegations, of which there are few, as true. <em>.See Howard v. Waide, </em>534 F.3d 1227, 1242-43 (10th Cir. 2008). Although we construe his pleadings liberally, in light of his pro se status, <em>see Ledbetter v. City of Topeka, Kan., </em>318 F.3d 1183, 1187 (10th Cir. 2003), we do not assume the role of his advocate, <em>see Northington v. Jackson, </em>973 F.2d 1518,1521 (10th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We discern four challenges to the judgment in Mr. Carrillo\u2019s appellate brief: (1) in dismissing the amended complaint, the district court \u201cfailed to give priority to superseding First, Fourteenth Amendment rights and Equal Civil Rights a superior importance over inferior, racially motivated state interests which if valid, must be resolved in civil proceedings,\u201d Aplt. Br. at 19; (2) the district court improperly referred various matters, including the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, to a magistrate judge; (3) the magistrate judge never held a hearing, so Mr. Carrillo could not submit additional evidence; and (4) the district court erred in not deeming his claims admitted when, instead of \u201caddressing] [his] genuine issues,\u201d the defendants filed motions to dismiss, <em>id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">To address the first challenge, we begin by summarizing the district court\u2019s rulings. It dismissed ten defendants because they had not been served with process; dismissed claims against Defendants Suthers, Brauchler, Chambers, Geigle, and Morrissey in their official capacities on standing and Eleventh Amendment grounds; dismissed claims against Brau-chler, Chambers, Geigle, and Morrissey in their individual capacities on the grounds that they were barred by the statute of limitations, prosecutorial immunity, and the <em>Heck </em>doctrine, <em>see Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (claim is barred if its success would imply the invalidity of a criminal conviction that has not been set aside); and dismissed claims against the Denver Sheriff Department and the three Sheriff Defendants in their official capacities for failure to allege a municipal policy or custom. The district court also dismissed a challenge to the validity of unidentified state statutes for failure to identify the statutes being challenged and dismissed a Fair Housing Act claim because the amended complaint\u2019s allegations failed to raise a plausible inference that the defendants\u2019 conduct was motivated by Mr. Carrillo\u2019s race or that the conduct constituted coercion or intimidation. And it rejected the remaining claims against the Sheriff Defendants and Defendant Chun in their individual capacities because Mr. Carrillo failed to allege any plausible constitutional claims against them (and further held that the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims were barred by <em>Heck). </em>The court denied Mr. Carrillo an opportunity to file a second amended complaint because he had said nothing to suggest that he would be able to cure the defects noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">On appeal Mr. Carrillo makes no intelligible argument challenging the district court\u2019s substantive rulings. Rather, he makes sweeping assertions of discrimination without providing specifics or making any attempt to point out errors in the grounds relied on by the district court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>dismissing his amended complaint. We \u201ccannot take on the responsibility of serving as [Mr. Carrillo\u2019s] attorney in constructing arguments.\u201d <em>Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, </em>425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Mr. Carrillo\u2019s three procedural challenges are equally meritless. First, we need not address his argument that the district court improperly referred certain motions and pleadings to a magistrate judge, because he forfeited this objection by not presenting it until his appellate brief. <em>See Varnell v. Dora Consol. Sch. Dist., </em>756 F.3d 1208, 1215 (10th Cir. 2014) (argument is forfeited if not raised below). In any event, there is nothing wrong with a district judge referring legal issues to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (\u201ca judge may ... designate a magistrate judge to ... submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition, by a judge of the court, of [a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted]\u201d); <em>First Union Mortg. Corp. v. Smith, </em>229 F.3d 992, 995 (10th Cir. 2000) (\u201cWhile magistrates may hear dispositive motions, they may only make proposed findings of fact and recommendations\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Second, the failure to hold a hearing at which Mr. Carrillo could present evidence did not prejudice him because the case was resolved on pure issues of law. And finally, Mr. Carrillo is incorrect in arguing that by filing motions to dismiss instead of answers, the defendants admitted all the claims in his amended complaint. Parties may assert the \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d by motion \u201cmade <em>before </em>pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court. Mr. Carrillo\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is DENIED'.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b702-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
