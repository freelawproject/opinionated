Moritz, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">Oklahoma state prisoner Tyler Mullins seeks' a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing Mullins\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred. Because reasonable jurists wouldn\u2019t find the correctness of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling debatable, we deny Mullins\u2019 request for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">On December 22, 2002, Mullins pled guilty to first-degree murder, a violation of 21 Okla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 701.7. On January 22, 2003, the state trial court sentenced Mullins to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In a letter to the trial judge that was (1) postmarked February 3, 2003; (2) received by the trial judge on February 5, 2003; and (3) filed with the clerk\u2019s office on February 18, 2003, Mullins expressed a desire to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-16\">The trial court denied Mullins\u2019 request, in part because Mullins failed to file his letter within 10 days of sentencing. Mullins then appealed his conviction and sentence to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA). The OCCA dismissed the appeal on May 7, 2003. In doing so, the OCCA cited Mullins\u2019 failure to file a timely motion to withdraw plea within 10 days of sentencing\u2014a prerequisite for appealing his conviction and sentence. <em>See </em>Okla. Ct. Crim. App. R. 4.2(A) (\u201cIn all cases, to appeal from any conviction on a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the defendant must have filed in the trial court clerk\u2019s office an application to withdraw the plea within ten (10) days from the date of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>pronouncement of the Judgment and Sentence .... \u201d)\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">More than a decade later, Mullins filed an application for post-conviction relief with the state trial court. Mullins asserted that he was \u201cdenied an appeal through no fault of his ... own,\u201d and was therefore entitled to an appeal out of time. <em>See </em>Okla. Ct. Crim. App. R. 2.1(E)(1). In support, Mullins noted that on the day after his sentencing hearing, he placed a letter expressing his desire to withdraw his plea in the bars of his cell for jail staff to pick up. And he maintained there was nothing more he could have done to comply with the 10-day filing deadline because he was incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The trial court denied Mullins\u2019 petition, and the OCCA affirmed. Approximately one year later, Mullins filed a \u00a7 2254 petition in federal district court, alleging that trial counsel was ineffective for, inter alia, \u201cabandon[ing] [Mullins] during the 10-day window of appeal time\u201d and thus depriving him of his right to a direct appeal. App. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Oklahoma moved to dismiss Mullins\u2019 petition as time-barred. It argued that Mullins\u2019 conviction became final 10 days after sentencing\u2014i.e., on February 1, 2003\u2014be-cause Mullins failed to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea within those 10 days. Thus, Oklahoma reasoned, Mullins had one year, or until February 2, 2004, in which to file a \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) (explaining that, absent certain circumstances, one-year filing deadline for \u00a7 2254 petition runs from date on which judgment became final by conclusion of direct review or by expiration of time for seeking such review).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Mullins didn\u2019t file his petition until June 24, 2015, Oklahoma argued, the petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">Mullins responded by insisting that he did, in fact, file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea within 10 days of sentencing. Mullins pointed out that, just one day after his sentencing hearing, he placed his letter to the trial judge in the bars of his jail cell for jail staff to pick up and mail. Besides, Mullins argued, even if he didn\u2019t file his motion within 10 days of sentencing, trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to \u201ccommunicate with [Mullins] during that 10-day period.\u201d App. 50. Thus, Mullins reasoned, he\u2019s entitled to an appeal out of time. And because \u00a7 2244(d)(l)(A)\u2019s one-year clock would restart upon the conclusion of that appeal, <em>see Jimenez v. Quarterman, </em>555 U.S. 113, 119, 129 S.Ct. 681, 172 L.Ed.2d 475 (2009), Mullins argued that his \u00a7 2254 petition isn\u2019t time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">Alternatively, Mullins asserted that he\u2019s entitled to equitable tolling of \u00a7 2244(d)(l)\u2019s one-year period. <em>See Loftis v. Chrisman, </em>812 F.3d 1268, 1272 (10th Cir. 2016) (\u201cThe statutory limitations period may be equitably tolled if the petitioner \u2018diligently pursues his claims and demonstrates that the failure to timely file was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond his control.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir. 2000))). But rather than providing specific facts or legal authorities that might support this assertion, Mullins merely asked for an evidentiary hearing where he could \u201cpresent facts showing diligence and extraordinary circumstances.\u201d App. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">The federal district court granted Oklahoma\u2019s motion to dismiss Mullins\u2019 petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>as untimely. First, the court ruled that Mullins isn\u2019t entitled to equitable tolling because Mullins \u201cprovided no specificity regarding the alleged lack of access and the steps he took to diligently pursue his federal claims.\u201d App. 60 (quoting <em>Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir. 1998)). Second, it ruled that Mullins \u201cfailed to make a \u2018substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60-61 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2)). Thus, the district court dismissed Mullins\u2019 petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, because the district court found that reasonable jurists wouldn\u2019t debate whether Mullins\u2019 \u201cpetition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d or \u201cwhether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling,\u201d it also refused to grant Mullins a COA. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595,146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Mullins now seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 2254 petition. But first, he must demonstrate that he is entitled to a COA. And because the district court dismissed Mullins\u2019 petition on both substantive and procedural grounds, we may grant Mullins a COA only if he demonstrates that (1) \u201creasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong\u201d; <em>and </em>(2) \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Mullins first challenges the district court\u2019s procedural ruling, i.e., its finding that Mullins\u2019 petition is time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). In support, Mullins advances two general arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">First, Mullins asserts that he is entitled to an appeal out of time, either because he filed a timely motion to withdraw plea by placing his letter in the bars of his jail cell on the day after sentencing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or because he \u201creceived ineffective assistance of counsel in handling his right to a direct appeal in state court.\u201d Aplt. Br. 21. And the conclusion of such an out-of-time appeal, Mullins points out, would restart \u00a7 2244(d)(l)(A)\u2019s one-year clock under <em>Jimenez, </em>555 U.S. at 119, 129 S.Ct. 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">Bqt even assuming that trial counsel was ineffective, this argument conflates the 10-day period for filing Mullins\u2019 motion to withdraw plea, <em>see </em>Okla. Ct. Crim. App. R. 4.2(A), with the one-year time period for filing his \u00a7 2254 petition, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1). If trial counsel was ineffective, that might provide an explanation for Mullins\u2019 failure to file a motion to withdraw plea within 10 days of sentencing. But it doesn\u2019t provide an explanation for his failure to file his federal habeas petition within a year after his Oklahoma conviction became final. And it\u2019s Mullins\u2019 failure to comply with \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A)\u2014not his failure comply with Okla. Ct. Crim. App. R. 4.2(A)\u2014that triggered the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Mullins\u2019 habeas petition as time-barred. Thus, Mullins\u2019 reb-anee on <em>Jimenez </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Second, Mullins argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling or, in the alternative, an evidentiary hearing. Aplt. Br. 30-32. But Mullins fails to point to any specific facts that would entitle him to such tolling. True, he alleges that he went \u201cthrough at least five lawyers, one of whom sat on the case for many years and was eventually disbarred.\u201d Aplt. Br. 31. Yet Mullins doesn\u2019t say when he hired these lawyers. And even assuming he hired them before \u00a7 2244(d)(l)\u2019s one-year time limit expired, Mullins doesn\u2019t articulate how that satisfies <em>Loftis\u2019 </em>two-part test. <em>See </em>812 F.3d at 1272. Nor does he cite any authority that indicates a district court must hold an evidentiary hearing if, even assuming the truth of a petitioner\u2019s factual allegations, the petitioner still wouldn\u2019t be entitled to relief. Accordingly, we find Mullins\u2019 tolling argument inadequately briefed and decline to address it. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A) (requiring argument section of appellant\u2019s brief to contain \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d); <em>Bronson v. Swensen, </em>500 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir. 2007) (explaining that court routinely declines to consider inadequately briefed arguments).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">In short, we agree with the district court that Mullins\u2019 petition is time-barred. And because reasonable jurists wouldn\u2019t debate the correctness of this procedural ruling, we need not address whether reasonable jurists would debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s assessment of Mullins\u2019 constitutional claims. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Accordingly, we deny Mullins\u2019 request for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-11\">This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 32.1; 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">. February 1, 2003, was a Saturday. Thus, Mullins actually had until Monday, February 3, 2003, in which to timely file a motion to withdraw plea. <em>See </em>O\u00edda. Ct, Crim, App. R. 1.5. Contrary to Oklahoma\u2019s assertion and the district court\u2019s finding, Mullins had until February 4, 2004\u2014not February 2, 2004\u2014to file his \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See Harris v. Dinwiddie, </em>642 F.3d 902, 907 n.6 (10th Cir. 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-6\">. The district court didn\u2019t address Mullins' argument that trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness entitled him to an appeal out of time and a new one-year clock under <em>Jimenez, </em>555 U.S. at 119, 129 S.Ct. 681.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b651-7\">. To the extent that Mullins asserts he timely filed his motion to withdraw plea, he is essentially arguing that the OCCA erred in concluding he failed to comply with Okla. Ct. Crim. App. R. 4.2(A)\u2019s 10-day filing deadline. But a \"state court\u2019s interpretation of state law ... binds a federal court sitting in habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Richey, </em>546 U.S. 74, 76, 126 S.Ct. 602, 163 L.Ed.2d 407 (2005). Accordingly, the OCCA\u2019s resolution of this question is controlling. <em>Cf. Loftis, </em>812 F.3d at 1272 (holding that federal district court correctly deferred to \"OCCA\u2019s conclusion that [p]eti-tioner\u2019s state post-conviction appeal was untimely as a matter of state law\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
