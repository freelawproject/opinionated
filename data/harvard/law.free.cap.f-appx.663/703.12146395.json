Matheson, Jr., Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b724-19\">Christine Warren appeals from two district court orders. In one, the court set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>aside a clerk\u2019s entry of default and denied as moot Ms. Warren\u2019s motion for a default judgment against Green Tree Servicing, LLC. In the other, the court granted summary judgment to Green Tree on Ms. Warren\u2019s claim under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\u201cRESPA\u201d), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601-17. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">I. RESPA</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Under RESPA, the servicer of a \u201cfederally related mortgage loan\u201d may be liable for damages if it does not adequately respond to a borrower\u2019s qualified written request (QWR). 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(e)-(f). A QWR is \u201ca written correspondence\u201d that includes either \u201ca statement of the reasons for the belief of the borrower ... that the account is in error or provides sufficient detail to the servicer regarding other information sought by the borrower.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(1)(B). When a servicer receives a QWR, it has five days to send written acknowledgment of receipt. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(1)(A); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35(d), 1024.36(c). It also has 30 days to investigate and either make appropriate corree-: tions, provide the requested information, or explain in writing why the servicer believes the account is correct or the information is not available to it. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(2); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35(e)(1), (3)(i)(C), 1024.36(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Under RESPA\u2019s implementing regulation, Regulation X, a servicer may establish a specific address for receiving QWRs (\u201cQWR address\u201d) by sending written notice to the borrower stating that the borrower must use the established address. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35(a), (c), 1024.36(a), (b). \u201c[R]eceipt at the designated address is necessary to trigger RESPA duties.\u201d <em>Berneike v. CitiMortgage, Inc., </em>708 F.3d 1141, 1149 (10th Cir. 2013). \u201cCommunication failing to meet the requirements of RE SPA and its implementing regulation amounts to nothing more than general correspondence between a borrower and servicer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">Bank of America initially serviced Ms. Warren\u2019s mortgage loan. In a three-page \u201cwelcome letter\u201d dated March 21, 2013, Green Tree informed her that effective April 1, 2013, it would be the new servicer. Page two contained a \u201cNOTICE ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS\u201d under RESPA, Aplt. App., Vol. 1 at 178, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-13\">Section 6 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605) gives you certain consumer rights.... A \u201cqualified written request\u201d is a written correspondence, other than notice on a payment coupon or other payment medium supplied by the servicer, which includes your name and account number, and your reasons for the request. If you want to send a \u201cqualified written request\u201d regarding the servicing of your loan to your new servicer, it must be sent to this address: Green Tree, PO Box 6176, Rapid City, SD 57709-6176.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak9\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We shall refer to the designated QWR address as \u201cBox 6176.\u201d On page three, Green Tree informed Ms. Warren that \u201c[a]ny questions, complaints or inquiries you have regarding your loan may always be directed in writing to our Customer Service Department at ... PO Box 6172[,] Rapid City, SD 57709-6172.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179 (emphasis added). We shall refer to this address as \u201cBox 6172.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-14\">Ms. Warren wrote a letter to Bank of America and Green Tree, also dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>March 21, 2013, and addressed to Green Tree in St. Paul, Minnesota (\u201cFirst Letter\u201d). After expressing her understanding that Green Tree was taking over the servicing as of April 1, Ms. Warren asked for written confirmation that her mortgage payments were paid through February 2014. About a month later, Green Tree sent a letter acknowledging receipt of the First Letter, stating that her inquiry was under review, and informing her that if she had \u201cany questions or comments,\u201d she could contact customer service at Box 6172. <em>Id. </em>at 181. The letter also provided customer-service telephone and fax numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">On May 9, 2013, Green Tree responded substantively to Ms. Warren\u2019s request. The only address on the response was Box 6172, which was printed on the letterhead as Green Tree\u2019s return address along with telephone and fax numbers. Green Tree told Ms. Warren to call if. she had \u201cany questions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Vol. II at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Over the next year, Ms. Warren sent four more letters (the last authored by her attorney) to Box 6172 alleging continued errors in her account. Each time, Green Tree responded with an acknowledgment letter substantially identical to the first and informing Ms. Warren that she could contact customer service at the address in its letterhead\u2014Box 6172\u2014if she had \u201cany questions or comments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 228, 229, 263. Green Tree also provided a substantive response to Ms. Warren\u2019s second, third, and fourth letters. Each one, like the first substantive response, set forth only the Box 6172 address in the letterhead and told her she could call the listed number if she had \u201cany further questions or concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 232, 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In addition to this correspondence, Green Tree sent Ms. Warren Monthly Informational Statements. Twelve of them, covering the period from May 9, 2013 through August 9, 2014, appear in her appellate appendix. These statements contained different mailing addresses for different types of correspondence a borrower might send. On the front, the statements listed Box 6172 as the \u201ccorrespondence address\u201d to which Ms. Warren could send \u201cinquiries.\u201d <em>E.g., id., </em>Vol. I at 182. The Box 6172 address was also listed on the back under the heading \u201cCorrespondence/Complaints.\u201d <em>E.g., id. </em>at 183. And immediately below that address, the first six statements provided: \u201cFor First Lien Mortgage Loan Customers Only: Pursuant to \u00a7 6 of RESPA, a \u2018Qualified Written Request\u2019 regarding the servicing of your loan must be sent to [Box 6176].\u201d <em>E.g., id. </em>Similarly, the last six statements provided, also immediately below the \u201cCorrespondence/Complaints\u201d address on the back: \u201cDesignated Address for Qualified Written Requests, Notices or [sic] Error and Requests for Information: Green Tree has designated the following address where mortgage loan customers must send any Qualified Written Request, Notice of Error or Request for Information: PO Box 6176....\u201d <em>E.g., id., Vol. </em>II at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">Ms. Warren sued Bank of America and Green Tree, asserting five claims. She obtained a clerk\u2019s entry of default against both defendants. After Ms. Warren moved for a default judgment, Green Tree moved to set aside the entry of default. While those, motions were pending, Ms. Warren settled with Bank of America and stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of all claims except her RESPA claim against Green Tree. The district court concluded that the proper method for dismissing all but the RESPA claim was for Ms. Warren to file an amended complaint, so the court converted the dismissal stipulation into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>motion for leave to amend under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15. .</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Ms. Warren amended her complaint to allege one claim\u2014that Green Tree had not complied with its RESPA obligation to provide adequate responses within 30 days to each of her five letters, all of which she characterized as QWRs. The district court concluded that the clerk\u2019s entry of default was directed at a superseded pleading (the original complaint) and therefore directed the clerk to set aside the entry of default. The court also denied as moot Ms. Warren\u2019s motion for default judgment and Green Tree\u2019s motion to set aside the entry of default. Green Tree then moved for summary judgment. The district court granted that motion based on its conclusion that there was no genuine dispute of material fact that Green Tree had properly established Box 6176 as the exclusive address for receiving QWRs and that Ms. Warren had not sent any QWRs to that address. Ms. Warren appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Ms. Warren\u2019s primary argument is that the district court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment. In the alternative, she contends the court should not have set aside the clerk\u2019s entry of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">A. <em>The district court properly granted summary judgment to Green Tree.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVl\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards that the district court should have applied.\u201d <em>Fields v. City of Tulsa, </em>753 F.3d 1000, 1008 (10th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). A \u201ccourt shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \u201c[W]e examine the record and all reasonable inferences that might be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Fields, </em>753 F.3d at 1009 (internal quotation marks omitted),</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Ms. Warren argues that Green Tree established Box 6172 as a QWR address. She claims that Green Tree\u2019s five acknowledgment letters listed only Box 6172 as the address to which she could send \u201crequests for information or notices of error about her loan servicing.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 12. She also contends that she sent the First Letter before Green Tree sent her any notice designating a specific address for receipt of QWRs. She points to the statement in the welcome letter indicating that she could \u201calways ... direct[ ]\u201d \u201c[a]ny questions, complaints or inquiries\u201d to Box 6172. Aplt. App., Vol. I at 179. And she directs our attention to the front of the Monthly Informational Statements, where she was told she could send \u201cinquiries\u201d to Box 6172. <em>E.g., id., </em>Vol. I at 182. She also maintains that Green Tree\u2019s notices about where she was required to send QWRs were not \u201cclear and conspicuous,\u201d as required under 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.32(a)(1), and that Green Tree\u2019s substantive responses to four of her letters provide further evidence of Green Tree\u2019s intent to establish Box 6172 as its QWR address.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We address Ms. Warren\u2019s arguments as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">First, as to when she received notice of the QWR address, the welcome letter was dated March 21, 2013, the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>date listed on her First Letter to Green Tree, and Ms. Warren testified that she received it \u201cbn or about\u201d that date. <em>See </em>Aplt. App. at 151-52. Even if we credit her allegation that she sent the First Letter before receiving any notice from Green Tree establishing a QWR address, Green Tree was not yet the servicer, and RES-PA\u2019s response obligations are triggered when the <em>\u201cservicer </em>of a federally related mortgage loan receives a [QWR].\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(e)(1) (emphasis added). Ms. Warren has not suggested that Green Tree received the First Letter after it took over as the servicer, nor has she offered any relevant authority for her implied argument that a successor servicer has an obligation under RESPA to respond to a QWR sent before it actually takes over servicing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Second, the welcome letter clearly and conspicuously established a QWR address. According to the Official Bureau Interpretations of Regulation X, the notice of an.exclusive QWR address \u201cis subject to the clear and conspicuous requirement\u201d of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.82(a)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 12 C.F.R. Pt. 1024, Supp. I, Subpart C, \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35(c), 1024.36(b). Even accepting Ms. Warren\u2019s view that the inquiry- must be made from the perspective' of an ordinary consumer,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we see no genuine issue of fact concerning whether the notice in the welcome letter was clear and conspicuous. When read in isolation, the statement in the welcome letter indicating that Ms. Warren could \u201calways .., direct[ ]\u201d \u201c[a]ny questions, complaints or inquiries\u201d to Box 6172, Aplt. App., Vol. I at 179, might suggest that Green Tree agreed to receive QWRs at Box 6172. But the welcome letter also contained the express designation of Box 6176 as the address to which Ms. Warren must send any QWRs. This designation appeared on its own page inside a box titled \u201cNOTICE ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS,\u201d and it specifically referenced RESPA and defined a QWR. <em>Id. </em>at 178. When read in the context of the entire welcome letter, the statement that Ms, Warren could always direct any inquiries to Box 6172 did not establish Box 6172 as an address for receipt of QWRs.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Third, the acknowledgment letters did not inform Ms. Warren or even imply that, as she puts it, she could send \u201crequests for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>information or notices of error\u201d to Box 6172. Aplt. Opening Br. at 12. Instead, they told her she could send \u201cquestions or comments\u201d to Box 6172. <em>See, e.g., </em>Aplt. App., Vol. I at 181. To establish a QWR address, a loan servicer must tell the borrower that she must send \u201cnotices of error\u201d or \u201crequests [for] information\u201d to the designated address. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35(c), 1024.36(b). The acknowledgment letters only referred to \u201cquestions or comments.\u201d We therefore conclude the acknowledgment letters indisputably did not establish Box 6172 as a QWR address.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In <em>Steele v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, </em>No. 3:09-CV-0603-D, 2010 WL 3565415 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 7, 2010) (unpublished), the Northern District of Texas reached a similar conclusion in a case involving materially identical language contained in a welcome letter and later correspondence indicating the borrowers could contact Green Tree at a different address. In granting summary judgment to Green Tree on the borrowers\u2019 RESPA claim, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">Green Tree designated in the notice of transfer an exclusive address for sending qualified written requests. Although subsequent correspondence sent to the Steeles indicated that they could contact Green Tree or its attorneys at other addresses, Green Tree did not indicate that it would receive qualified written requests at any other address. Rather, through the other addresses and telephone numbers, Green Tree provided the Steeles with informal avenues to obtain other information. Because a reasonable trier of fact could only find that Green Tree established an exclusive location at which it would accept qualified written requests, and that the Steeles never sent a proper request to that address, Green Tree had no duty under RESPA to respond to the Steeles\u2019s letters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-7\"><em>Id. </em>at *3. As we did in <em>Bemeike, </em>708 F.3d at 1147, we find the <em>Steele </em>court\u2019s analysis persuasive and in accord with our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Fourth, we reject Ms. Warren\u2019s argument that the Monthly Informational Statements established Box 6172 as a QWR address. The front page of the statements stated only that she could send inquiries to Box 6172, not notices of error, requests for information, or QWRs. Likewise, the back page of the statements told her she could send correspondence or complaints to Box 6172, but immediately below the statements instructed that QWRs must be sent to Box 6176. Contrary to Ms. Warren\u2019s argument, the fact that the QWR notice was titled \u201cFor First Lien Mortgage Loan Customers Only\u201d does not create a disputed fact issue regarding whether an ordinary consumer would be confused about where she must send a QWR. An ordinary consumer, faced with the \u201cCorrespondence/Complaints\u201d address (Box 6172) immediately adjacent to the QWR address (Box 6176), could not justifiably believe she could send a QWR to Box 6172.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Finally, we find unavailing Ms. Warren\u2019s suggestion that Green Tree\u2019s responses to her letters show that Green Tree also established Box 6172 as a QWR address. We rejected a similar argument in Bemeike\u2014that a lender \u201cwaived its statutory right to receive all future QWRs at its specified address because it responded [to the borrower\u2019s correspondence] without asserting [the] correspondence was sent to the wrong address.\u201d 708 F.3d at 1149. <em>Accord Roth v. CitiMortgage Inc., </em>756 F.3d 178, 182 (2d Cir. 2014) (per cu-riam) (holding that \u201c[a]s long as a servicer complies with the [regulatory] notice requirements ... for designating a QWR address, a letter sent to a different address is not a QWR, even if an employee at that address (who may not have training in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>RESPA compliance) in fact responds to that letter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">B. <em>The district court did not err in setting aside the entry of default.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Ms. Warren alternatively contends that the district court erred in setting aside the clerk\u2019s entry of default against Green Tree. Our review is for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ashby v. McKenna, </em>331 F.3d 1148,1152 (10th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In her opening brief, Ms. Warren\u2019s only contention is that Green Tree made no good-cause showing in its motion to set aside the entry of default. This argument overlooks both the district court\u2019s denial of Green Tree\u2019s motion as moot and the court\u2019s reasoning that the entry of default must be set aside because it was directed at a superseded pleading (the original complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">In her reply, Ms. Warren states that she was given no alternative to filing an amended complaint and suggests that the district court ordered her to do so \u201cfor no apparent reason other than to allow the Court to rule her motion for default judgment moot.\u201d Reply Br. at 7. But the district court ruled that filing an amended complaint was the necessary procedural course arising from Ms. Warren\u2019s own action in stipulating to the dismissal, purportedly under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a), of less than all claims against Green Tree. <em>See </em>Aplt. App., Vol. I at 110-11.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She has not argued otherwise. We therefore discern no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s order directing the clerk to set aside the entry of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b724-9\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-9\">. Ms. Warren makes this argument on page 16 of her opening appellate brief but appears to disclaim it in her reply brief, stating that her focus- is not on Green Tree\u2019s responses to her letters but on \"its actions in directing her where to send her correspondence,\u201d Reply Br. at 6. We will nonetheless consider this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-5\">.Ms. Warren relies on <em>Catalan v. GMAC Mortgage Corp., </em>629 F.3d 676 (7th Cir. 2011), but <em>Catalan </em>offers no obvious support for her point. In <em>Catalan, </em>a borrower sent a letter to the United States Department of Housing and . Urban Development (\"HUD\u201d) detailing alleged errors in the servicing of a mortgage loan. <em>Id. </em>at 682. HUD forwarded the letter to the loan servicer. <em>Id. </em>The Seventh Circuit reasoned that the servicer was obligated to treat the letter as a QWR because HUD was acting on behalf of the borrower when it forwarded the letter. <em>Id. </em>at 688. The court pointed to RESPA\u2019s requirement that QWRs must be \"received 'from the borrower (or an agent of the borrower).' \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(e)(1)(A)). Here, Ms. Warren sent a copy of the First Letter directly to Green Tree (although not to Box 6176), so we fail to see how <em>Catalan </em>applies. Moreover, even assuming Bank of America had some obligation to treat the letter as a QWR and forward it to Green Tree in anticipation of the servicing transfer, Bank of America was not acting as Ms. Warren\u2019s agent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\">. The regulation provides: \"Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, disclosures required under this subpart must be clear and conspicuous, in writing; and in a form that a recipient may keep.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.32(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b728-10\">. Ms. Warren did not make this \"ordinary consumer\u201d argument in the district court. Although we do not decide that RESPA\u2019s \"clear and conspicuous\u201d requirement ' must be viewed from this perspective, her arguments fail to convince us that an ordinary consumer would be confused as to whether Green Tree designated Box 6176 as its only QWR address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\">. In reaching that conclusion, the district court relied in part on <em>Gobbo Farms &amp; Orchards v. Poole Chemical Co., </em>81 F.3d 122, 123 (10th Cir. 1996), for the proposition that Rule 41(a) does not apply to the \"dismissal of less than all claims in an action,\u201d and on <em>Ethridge v. Harbor House Restaurant, </em>861 F.2d 1389, 1392 (9th Cir. 1988), for the same principle and for its view that amendment is the appropriate mechanism for dismissing less than all claims against a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b730-22\">. In view of our disposition, we decline to consider Green Tree\u2019s request that we affirm on the alternate ground of judicial estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
