The prosecution\u2019s delay in providing a witness statement containing exculpatory material until the night prior to the commencement of trial constituted a violation of the principles enunciated in <em>Brady v Maryland </em>(373 US 83). <em>(Giglio v United States, </em>405 US 150; <em>People v Cwikla, </em>46 NY2d 434; <em>Application of Kapatos, </em>208 F Supp 883; <em>People v Tranchina, </em>64 AD2d 616; <em>People v Clausell, </em>182 AD2d 132; <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>States v Wilkins, </em>326 F2d 135; <em>United States v Agurs, </em>427 US 97; <em>United States v Bagley, </em>473 US 667; <em>People v Vilardi, </em>76 NY2d 67; <em>People v Velez, </em>118 AD2d 116.) II. The prosecution\u2019s failure to provide exculpatory information regarding the alleged victim\u2019s status as a police informant constituted a violation of the principles enunciated in <em>Brady v Maryland.

We conclude that the People were required to disclose this information pursuant to <em>Brady v Maryland </em>(373 US 83) and therefore reverse defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Defendant met Fred Washington at the Bottom\u2019s Up bar in Albany. They talked and had several drinks before going to defendant\u2019s apartment. From this point forward, their testimony differed markedly.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">According to Washington, he and defendant had been hugging, kissing and holding hands at the bar. Upon arriving at her apartment, they entered defendant\u2019s bedroom, where Washington undressed in her presence and placed his clothing on the floor next to the bed. Washington sat on the bed, and defendant left the bedroom. She returned wielding a knife, shouted at him, lacerated his penis and stabbed him in the chest. Washington then picked up his clothing, dressed and, after throwing a flower pot at the bedroom door, left the apartment with a radio. He flagged down a car and asked the driver to take him home. The driver, however, drove Washington to the hospital, over his protestations.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">According to defendant, as she prepared to leave the bar she noticed that her jacket was missing. Washington told her that his friend had it and offered to call him, but not from the bar. Defendant agreed to let him call from her apartment. At her apartment, she showed Washington the phone in the living room, and she went to the bedroom to hide her purse. While she was in the bedroom Washington entered, naked. As he approached her, Washington told defendant, 'T want to * * * you.\u201d Fearing rape, defendant grabbed a knife she kept on her dresser and stabbed him in the groin and chest. She forced Washington out of the bedroom and called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Police Officer Douglas Walczak stated in his police report that he recovered a pair of boxer shorts, a shoe and a hat from defendant\u2019s apartment that night, <em>outside </em>the bedroom. At trial, however, Walczak testified that the shoe and boxer shorts were found <em>inside </em>the bedroom, and that the hat was discovered at the threshold to the bedroom. Detective Sean Keane recorded in his police report that, on the evening of the incident, Washington had stated that he had been attacked by defendant <em>as he entered her bedroom without any clothes. </em>At trial, although Keane acknowledged the contents of his report, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>he was unable to recall whether Washington had in fact made that statement. During deliberations, the jury asked to hear Walczak\u2019s testimony regarding where he found Washington\u2019s clothing. Defendant was acquitted of the first-degree assault counts and convicted of one count of second-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Defendant subsequently filed a motion to vacate the judgment of conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10. In his affirmation, her new counsel alleged that, following defendant\u2019s conviction, he learned that Washington was an informant for the Albany Police Department. Defendant argued that the People\u2019s failure to disclose this information to the defense required a new trial on both newly discovered evidence grounds and <em>Brady </em>grounds. The People did not dispute defendant\u2019s factual allegation that Washington had acted as an informant for the Albany Police Department on prior occasions. Instead, they responded that Washington was not an informant \"in this case,\u201d and that the trial prosecutor had no personal knowledge of prior instances in which Washington provided information to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The motion court summarily denied defendant\u2019s motion, holding that Washington\u2019s status as a police informant did not constitute newly discovered evidence. Defendant appealed from both the denial of her CPL 440.10 motion and the judgment of conviction, and the Appellate Division affirmed. Neither the motion court nor the Appellate Division addressed whether Washington\u2019s history as a police informant constituted <em>Brady </em>material. Because we conclude it does, we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">In <em>Brady v Maryland </em>(373 US 83), the Supreme Court held that the prosecution has an affirmative duty to disclose to the defense evidence in its possession that is both favorable to the defense and material to guilt or punishment. New York has long recognized this prosecutorial duty <em>(see, e.g., People v Savvides, </em>1 NY2d 554), and the failure to disclose <em>Brady </em>material violates a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">As a preliminary matter, defendant sufficiently apprised the motion court of the nature of her <em>Brady </em>claim by urging that Washington\u2019s newly discovered status as a police informant was exculpatory material that should have been disclosed in response to her pretrial request for all <em>Brady </em>and impeachment material, citing <em>Giglio v United States </em>(405 US 150) and <em>United States v Bagley </em>(473 US 667). Having failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>dispute defendant\u2019s factual allegation that Washington operated as a police informant, the People have impliedly conceded the truthfulness of that allegation <em>(see, e.g., People v Ciaccio, </em>47 NY2d 431, 438; <em>see also, People v Gruden, </em>42 NY2d 214, 216 [\"(n)ormally what is not disputed is deemed to be conceded\u201d]). Consequently, if Washington\u2019s status as a police informant constituted <em>Brady </em>material, the trial court was obligated to grant defendant\u2019s CPL 440.10 motion <em>(see, </em>CPL 440.30 [3]; <em>People v Gruden, supra, </em>at 215-216).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Manifestly, Washington\u2019s status as a police informant was evidence favorable to the defense here. Specifically, the reports prepared by Detective Keane and Officer Walczak confirmed defendant\u2019s claim that Washington was already undressed when he entered her bedroom. Nevertheless, at trial both officers supported Washington\u2019s version of events\u2014 Walczak contradicted his report and testified that Washington\u2019s boxer shorts and shoe were discovered inside defendant\u2019s bedroom, and Keane could no longer recall whether Washington had stated that he entered defendant\u2019s bedroom without any clothing. Had defendant been armed with the knowledge that Washington was an informant for the same police department that employed Keane and Walczak, she could have presented the jury with a motive for them to favor Washington. Like evidence tending to affect credibility, evidence establishing such a motive for prosecution witnesses to corroborate the complainant falls within the ambit of the <em>Brady </em>rule <em>(see, Giglio v United States, </em>405 US 150, 154, <em>supra; People v Novoa, </em>70 NY2d 490, 496). Additionally, that Washington had previously operated as a police informant would have provided the defense with an explanation for the decision by the police to disbelieve, and subsequently to arrest, defendant \u2014 who promptly notified 911 following the incident \u2014 as opposed to Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The People\u2019s failure to disclose this favorable evidence to the defense requires reversal, however, only if the evidence was material. Defendant argues that her pretrial request for \"any deals, promises or agreements entered into by the People or any agent thereof and any prosecution witness\u201d encompassed the giving of information by a prosecution witness to an agent of the People and implicitly included agreements unrelated to defendant\u2019s case. Thus, defendant contends that it constituted a specific request for the undisclosed evidence at issue, thereby triggering the less stringent \"reasonable possibility\u201d materiality standard articulated in <em>People v Vilardi </em>(76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>NY2d 67). Even assuming that this is not a \"specific request\u201d case, however, the undisclosed evidence must be deemed material because there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different <em>(People v Chin, </em>67 NY2d 22, 33; <em>People v Smith, </em>63 NY2d 41, 67, <em>cert denied </em>469 US 1227).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The outcome of this case turned on whether the jury believed Washington\u2019s account of an unprovoked attack or defendant\u2019s claim that Washington entered the bedroom naked planning to rape her. Whether Washington undressed inside or outside the bedroom constituted a critical issue in this close credibility contest. Washington\u2019s status as a police informant provided the defense with an explanation for Keane\u2019s and Walczak\u2019s switch to a version of the facts that supported Washington\u2019s contention that he undressed <em>inside </em>the bedroom. Tellingly, during deliberations the jury focused on this aspect of Walczak\u2019s trial testimony \u2014 it asked for a readback of his testimony regarding where Washington\u2019s clothing was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Also of central importance to the defense in this case was the argument that Washington\u2019s reluctance to go to the hospital or the police after he was allegedly brutally victimized by defendant evidenced his consciousness of guilt and undermined his credibility. In summation, the prosecutor explained Washington\u2019s behavior by arguing that, because of his criminal record, Washington did not \"expect justice from the system\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\"[M]aybe [Fred Washington] didn\u2019t want to go to the hospital because he\u2019s thinking the cops are going to think I did something wrong, this looks bad. You know, I didn\u2019t do anything but hey, the cops know me and maybe once a criminal, always a criminal, and you know, I didn\u2019t do anything, but hey, I\u2019ve done things in the past</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">\"You know, I\u2019ve been on the other side of the criminal justice system. I\u2019ve been arrested and <em>the cops aren\u2019t my friends\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">Evidence that Washington had, in fact, provided the police with information on prior occasions would have effectively refuted the prosecutor\u2019s proffered justification for Washing<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>ton\u2019s behavior. Indeed, had the jury been aware that Washington had a relationship with the local police, his efforts to circumvent police discovery might have appeared even more suspicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Under these circumstances, Washington\u2019s history as a police informant was both favorable and material to the defense, and the People\u2019s failure to disclose this information to the defense violated defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process. The People\u2019s reliance in their opposition papers on the trial prosecutor\u2019s lack of personal knowledge regarding any instances in which Washington had operated as an informant is unavailing. The mandate of <em>Brady </em>extends beyond any particular prosecutor\u2019s actual knowledge <em>(see, e.g., Giglio v United States, </em>405 US 150, <em>supra </em>[nondisclosure of promise made to witness by another prosecutor in trial prosecutor\u2019s office, which promise was not known to trial prosecutor]). Furthermore, \"the individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case, including the police\u201d <em>(Kyles v Whitley, </em>514 US \u2014, 115 S Ct 1555, 1567). The People therefore were not relieved of their obligation to turn over <em>Brady </em>material by the trial prosecutor\u2019s failure to discover that the police were in possession of exculpatory information <em>(see, People v Simmons, </em>36 NY2d 126, 132 [\"(n)egligent, as well as deliberate, nondisclosure may deny due process\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In light of our conclusion that the People\u2019s nondisclosure of Washington\u2019s status as a police informant violated defendant\u2019s right to due process, we need not reach defendant\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the indictment dismissed without prejudice to an application by the People for leave to resubmit the charge of , assault in the second degree <em>(People v Mayo, </em>48 NY2d 245).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Judges Simons, Titone, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine and Ciparick concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
