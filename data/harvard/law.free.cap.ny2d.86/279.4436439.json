II. The demonstrated worsening of circumstances since 1982 supports the conclusion that the school finance system now violates the State Constitution\u2019s Education Article. <em>(Baker v Carr, </em>369 US 186.) III. If <em>Levittown </em>is now read to require proof that some minimum level of education has been denied, rather than proof of sufficiently changed conditions, the 12-year-old decision should be modified or overruled. IV. Should the school finance scheme, with its escalating inequities, somehow pass muster under the Education Article, this Court should find that it violates the State Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, modifying or overruling <em>Levittown </em>if necessary. <em>(San Antonio School Dist. v Rodriguez, </em>411 US 1; <em>Matter of Levy, </em>38 NY2d 653, 429 US 805; <em>Papasan v Attain, </em>478 US 265; <em>People v Barber, </em>289 NY 378; <em>Immuno AG. v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>Moor-Jankowski, </em>77 NY2d 235; <em>People v Dunn, </em>77 NY2d 19; <em>People v Harris, </em>77 NY2d 434.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-5\"><em>Dennis C.

Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as to the disparities in the educational opportunities offered by wealthier and poorer school districts do not state a claim for relief under the Education Article of the State Constitution. <em>(Judd v Board of Educ., 278 </em>NY 200.)

The great disparities in levels of resources available among the school districts for support of educational programs and facilities satisfy <em>Levittown\u2019s </em>\"gross and glaring inadequacy\u201d proviso. II. There are great disparities among schools with respect to student needs; schools with high concentrations of poverty and minority populations, including those in small cities, have much greater educational and social burdens which are not adequately funded; that failure results in loss of educational opportunities particularly for those students with the greatest needs; this failure constitutes a gross and glaring inadequacy in the State\u2019s system of financing education. <em>(McInnis v Shapiro, </em>293 F Supp 327, <em>affd sub nom.

III. Because the Legislature has abdicated its responsibility to remedy the inequities in the State educational finance system, this Court should now provide relief.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Ao0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b341-4\">Levine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In this action for declaratory judgment we are asked to determine whether plaintiffs have stated a cause of action in their pleadings and supporting papers in which they seek a declaration that New York\u2019s system for financing its public elementary and secondary schools is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Plaintiffs, Reform Educational Financing Inequities Today (R.E.F.I.T.), a not-for-profit membership organization suing on behalf of itself and 40 member school districts, the Boards of Education of 21 Long Island school districts participating individually, individual taxpayers, parents, and public school students residing in participating school districts, allege in their complaint that the statutory scheme by which New York finances its public schools violates the Education Article of the New York Constitution (art XI, \u00a7 1), and the Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Supreme Court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to state a cause of action (152 Misc 2d 714), and the Appellate Division modified, on the law, by adding a provision to the Supreme Court judgment declaring New York\u2019s school financing scheme constitutional and, as so modified, affirmed (199 AD2d 488). We agree with the courts below.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Our State Constitution requires that \"[t]he legislature shall provide for maintenance and support of a system of free common schools, wherein all the children of this state may be educated\u201d (art XI, \u00a7 1). In <em>Board of Educ., Levittown Union Free School Dish v Nyquist </em>(57 NY2d 27) (hereinafter <em>Levittown), </em>this Court held that this constitutional provision does not mandate that all educational facilities and services be substantially equal throughout the State. Rather, article XI, \u00a7 1 was intended to require the Legislature to provide a State system of free schools availing all of the State\u2019s children of a \"sound basic education\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 48).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Plaintiffs in this action do not claim that students in their district are receiving something less than a sound basic education. Rather, their pleadings and supporting papers demonstrate that there now exists a greater disparity in the amount of money spent per pupil in property-poor as compared to property-rich school districts than the disparity in existence at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the time <em>Levittown </em>was decided. Plaintiffs now claim that this disparity demonstrates a gross and glaring inadequacy in the State\u2019s school financing scheme, and that this showing of great disparity calls into question the constitutionality of the financing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument rests on their assertion that <em>Levittown </em>left the door open for a challenge to the constitutionality of the educational financing structure on the basis of gross and glaring inadequacy in the funding of education and that such inadequacy can be demonstrated by extreme disparities in funding. However, even a claim of extreme disparity cannot demonstrate the \"gross and glaring inadequacy\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 48) we referred to in <em>Levittown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The Education Article does not by its express terms contain an egalitarian <em>component. Nor </em>does a study of the history of the Article reveal an intent to preclude disparities in the funding for education or in relative educational opportunities among the State\u2019s school districts. Instead, \"the evident purpose of [the Education Article] was to deprive the legislature of discretion in relation to the establishment and maintenance of common schools, and to impose on that body the absolute duty to provide a general system of common schools\u201d (3 Lincoln, Constitutional History of New York, at 554). Thus, the primary aim of the legislation was to constitutionalize the established system of common schools rather than to alter its substance <em>(see, e.g., </em>Report of Comm on Education and Funds Pertaining Thereto, 2 Documents of NY Constitutional Convention of 1894, Doc No. 62, at 3; <em>Judd v Board of Educ., </em>278 NY 200, 210). That system consisted of 11,778 local school districts with varying amounts of property wealth which offered significantly disparate educational opportunities (Fortieth Ann Report of State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 6 NY Assembly Documents of 1894, Doc No. 42, at 76-83, 88-95). Clearly, equal educational opportunity was not the intended result of the amendment \u2014 an adequate education was. Thus, it was anticipated that the amendment would only affect places in the State where the common schools were not adequate (3 Revised Record at Constitutional Convention of 1894, at 695).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Therefore, even accepting plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of gross disparities between the amount of money spent on students in property-poor school districts and property-rich school districts, their cause of action based on a violation of the Educa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>tian Article due to such disparities cannot survive this motion to dismiss. Giving plaintiffs\u2019 submissions the benefit of every favorable inference, they simply do not state a claim that these disparities have caused students in the poorer districts to receive less than a sound basic education, which is all that they are guaranteed by our Constitution. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as it affirmed dismissal of the cause of action based on the Education Article of our State Constitution, should be affirmed, without prejudice, however, to the plaintiffs, if so advised, to apply at the trial court for leave to amend the complaint (CPLR 3211 [e]; <em>see, People v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>59 NY2d 343, 350).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Moreover, neither in their pleadings and other submissions on this motion to dismiss, nor in their argument before this Court have plaintiffs advanced a legal or factual basis for us to overrule <em>Levittowris </em>equal protection analysis under the State and Federal Constitutions. In <em>Levittown </em>and again in <em>Campaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New York </em>(86 NY2d 307 [decided today]), we have made clear that the State educational financing system will be upheld if it is supported by a rational basis. The desire to provide local control of education provides such basis. As plaintiff\u2019s other equal protection arguments are dependent upon this Court adopting a more exacting standard, those equal protection challenges must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Finally, rather than affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s broad and definitive declaration of the constitutionality of the State educational financing system, we modify to declare that the school financing scheme of the State of New York has not been shown in this case to be unconstitutional <em>(see, Campaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New York, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, with costs to defendants, in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Titone, Bellacosa, Smith and Ciparick concur; Judge Smith concurring only in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\"> Unlike in <em>City of New York v State of New York </em>(86 NY2d 286 [decided today]), the defendants have not raised lack of capacity to sue as a defense. Thus we do not reach that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
