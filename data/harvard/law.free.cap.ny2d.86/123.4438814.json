Associates\u2019 applications were neither \"complete\u201d nor \"ready to proceed through\u201d Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) without the 1992 restrictive declaration and, hence, their approval violated ULURP. <em>(Falbros Realty v Michetti, </em>200 AD2d 85; <em>Connor v Cuomo, </em>161 Misc 2d 889; <em>Matter of Long v Adirondack Park Agency, </em>76 NY2d 416; <em>Community Bd. 7 v Schaffer, </em>84 NY2d 148; <em>Chinese Staff &amp; Workers Assn. v City of New York, </em>68 NY2d 359; <em>Matter of Trump-Equitable Fifth Ave. Co. v Gliedman, </em>62 NY2d 539.) II. The late delivery of the 1992 restrictive declaration violated the specific terms of the 1982 restrictive declaration. <em>(Republic Natl. Bank v Zimmcor U.S.A.

The 1992 restrictive declaration is at variance with the rationale for all respective declarations. <em>(Church v Town of Islip, </em>8 NY2d 254; <em>Collard v Incorporated Vil. of Flower Hill, </em>52 NY2d 594; <em>Cohalan v Lechtrecker, </em>84 AD2d 775, 56 NY2d 861; <em>Matter of Flushing Prop.

The 1992 environmental impact statement on disposal of the project\u2019s sewage concealed, rather than identified, the impact of sewage by misrepresenting the capacity of the North River sewage treatment plant. <em>(H.O.M.E.S. v New York State Urban Dev.

V. The failure of the 1992 environmental impact statement to disclose the 1982 restrictive declaration\u2019s $31.5 million commitment to mitigate the project\u2019s impact on neighboring subway stations precluded it from determining the \"maximum practicable mitigation\u201d of such impact. VI. The failure of the 1992 environmental impact statement to disclose the project\u2019s finances precludes it from determining the \"maximum practicable mitigation\u201d of its environmental impact. <em>(Matter of Town of Henrietta v Department of Envtl.

There is no statutory authority for petitioners\u2019 claim that community boards are entitled to drafts of restrictive declarations at the start of their 60-day ULURP review period, or, for that matter, at any time during the ULURP period. Moreover, this claim was recently laid to rest by this Court in a case brought by the same Community Board that petitioners here argue was entitled to receive a draft of the 1992 restrictive declaration. In any event, since the Community Board in this case was, indeed, provided with a draft of the 1992 restrictive declaration months before its execution by the developer, the Board had more than ample time to review and comment upon the document. <em>(Community Bd. </em>7 <em>v Schaffer, </em>84 NY2d 148; <em>Starhurst Realty Corp. v City of New York, </em>125 AD2d 148, 70 NY2d 605; <em>Mauldin v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>64 AD2d 114; <em>Lai Chun Chan Jin v Board of Estimate, </em>92 AD2d 218, 62 NY2d 900.) II. Restrictive declarations have no land use impact separate and apart from the underlying zoning and land use actions which they are designed to ameliorate (which actions are subject to full ULURP review). The terms of the 1982 restrictive declaration are inapplicable here because that restrictive declaration was executed in conjunction with the previously approved Lincoln West project which was never built. The 1992 restrictive declaration, executed in connection with the new and entirely different Riverside South project at issue in this case involved new zoning and land use actions, which triggered, anew, full ULURP review. The 1982 restrictive declaration was thus superseded by the new ULURP process out of which the 1992 restrictive declaration was born. In any event, even if the 1982 restrictive declaration applied, the procedural requirements of its article X were not violated here. III. The terms of the 1992 restrictive declaration are in all respects lawful, reasonable and proper. <em>(Matter of Friends of Shawangunks v Knowlton, </em>64 NY2d 387; <em>Collard v Incorporated Vil. of Flower Hill, </em>52 NY2d 594; <em>Church v Town of Islip, </em>8 NY2d 254; <em>Cohalan v Lechtrecker, </em>84 AD2d 775, 56 NY2d 861; <em>Matter of Mobil Oil Corp. v Syracuse Indus.

The City Planning Commission\u2019s and the City Council\u2019s approvals of the Riverside South project fully complied with the substantive requirements of SEQRA, and were rationally based. <em>(Matter of WEOK Broadcasting Corp. v Planning Bd., </em>79 NY2d 373; <em>Akpan v Koch, </em>75 NY2d 561, 76 NY2d 846; <em>Chinese Staff &amp; Workers Assn. v City of New York, </em>68 NY2d 359; <em>Matter of Jackson v New York State Urban Dev.

The New York City Council granted special use permits to respondent developer, Penn Yards Associates, and amended the City Map and the Zoning Map to allow for construction of the Riverside South project, a large scale mixed-use development on a 74-acre parcel located on the west side of Manhattan along the Hudson River. The petitioners seeking to invalidate the three authorizing resolutions of the New York City Council include Coalition Against Lincoln West, a corporation of tenants residing on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, as well as other cooperative apartment corporations and tenant associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The primary issues concern the scope and timing of local Community Board 7 review and involvement under both the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) and a restrictive declaration entered into by the City with other parties in 1982. Specifically, petitioners claim that: (1) under ULURP, a land use application may not be deemed \"complete\u201d by the Department of City Planning if the application does not contain the proposed superseding restrictive declaration of 1992; (2) the modification/cancellation restrictions of the 1982 restrictive declaration run with the land and accord the local community board a 30-day review period which is linked to the 60-day ULURP review period; and (3) late delivery of the 1992 restrictive declaration denied Community Board 7 this 30-day review opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">We agree with the courts below that ULURP contains no legal requirement for a superseding restrictive declaration to be included in order to deem an application \"complete,\u201d and that the City Planning Department\u2019s \"completeness\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>determination is rational and not arbitrary or capricious <em>(see, Matter of Frishman v Schmidt, </em>61 NY2d 823, 825). Moreover, the 30-day review period established in the 1982 restrictive declaration is independent of the 60-day ULURP review period and, in any event, the Community Board had ample time to review the superseding restrictive declaration before the City Council finally acted. Consequently, we affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The subject property consists of a cluster of parcels covering 74 acres, bordered by the Hudson River on the west, 72nd Street on the north, a vertical embankment near West End Avenue on the east, and 59th Street on the south. In the early 1980s, Lincoln West, the former owners of the property, had planned a large-scale development project. In 1982, the developers executed a restrictive declaration containing a combination of promises, proposed agreements and covenants in exchange for the required approvals, zoning changes and permits from City and State agencies. The plans and preliminary work on the Lincoln West project collapsed in 1984. The permits also lapsed and alterations to the City Map were never filed. The acreage was then acquired by respondent developer, Penn Yards Associates, an affiliate of the Trump Organization. In conjunction with various organizations and City agencies, Penn announced an agreement to develop the somewhat scaled back multiuse Riverside South project, the 74-acre assemblage at issue in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In December 1991, Penn applied for an amendment to the City Map pursuant to ULURP. In February 1992, Penn filed an application for an amendment to the City Zoning Map and an application for special use permits. On May 15, 1992, the Department of City Planning and the Department of Environmental Protection, acting as co-lead agencies under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), issued a notice of completion of the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS). The DEIS had been prepared by Penn\u2019s consultant, and the substantive content was framed by scoping documents prepared by the co-lead agencies <em>(see, </em>6 NYCRR 617.10 [c]; <em>see also, </em>6 NYCRR 617.7, 617.8, 617.9).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">On May 19, 1992, respondent Department of City Planning, pursuant to ULURP, certified the application \"complete\u201d and forwarded it, together with the DEIS, to Community Board 7 for review and advisory comment. At that point, a superseding restrictive declaration had neither been filed with Penn\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>application to the Department of City Planning, nor forwarded to the Community Board. On July 10, 1992, the Community Board received the draft superseding restrictive declaration. After numerous public hearings, on July 27, 1992, Community Board 7 issued its 71-page report analyzing the project. In a 17-page resolution, it recommended disapproval of the Riverside South project by a 35-to-l vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Additional public hearings on the ULURP application were held in August and September 1992. Public hearings on the DEIS were held in September, with the co-lead agencies issuing a notice of completion of the 2,500-page final environmental impact statement in October 1992. After the relevant parties reached agreement as to appropriate and practicable mitigative measures, in December 1992, the City Council approved the final conditions on the project. These conditions were incorporated into the 1992 superseding restrictive declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Penn\u2019s application for the project, together with applicable restrictions and necessary authorizations, were thereafter officially approved and adopted in three City Council resolutions. The official resolutions (1) approved changes in the City Map; (2) amended the Zoning Map to allow for the project\u2019s development; and (3) approved special use permits for the project and incorporated modifications to the prior restrictive declaration, including sewage output limitations and payment of $10 million for local subway system improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Petitioners sued to annul the three resolutions on grounds that: (1) the ULURP application could not be deemed \"complete\u201d because the superseding restrictive declaration was not included; (2) delivery of the 1992 restrictive declaration to the Community Board with only 18 days remaining of the 60-day ULURP review period violated the 30-day review period of the 1982 restrictive declaration\u2019s modification provision; (3) the 1992 restrictive declaration was illegal because it denied petitioners\u2019 members enforcement rights; and (4) SEQRA had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit. It found that the restrictive declaration \"is not one of the documents required under sec[tian] 197-c [of the New York City Charter]\u201d for a completeness determination. The court also accorded \"great weight\u201d to the City Planning Commission\u2019s decision not to include the restrictive declaration as a necessary component of a \"complete\u201d application. The court further concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the modification/cancellation provisions of the 1982 restrictive declaration did not run with the land and, therefore, had no impact on the approval of developer Penn\u2019s land use application and the superseding restrictive declaration. Finally, Supreme Court concluded that there was no infirmity with respect to the legality of the 1992 restrictive declaration or the adequacy of the SEQRA process. The Appellate Division affirmed (208 AD2d 472), essentially reiterating the reasoning of Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"> We, too, reject petitioners\u2019 arguments and conclude that (1) the superseding restrictive declaration is not a legal prerequisite to a municipal determination of application \"complete[ness]\u201d under ULURP (New York City Charter \u00a7 197-c [a], [b], [c]), and (2) under the facts presented here, the City agencies acted rationally and within their discretionary authority in making the \"complete[ness]\u201d-of-application determination <em>(see, Appelbaum v Deutsch, </em>66 NY2d 975, 977 [applying deferential \"irrational, unreasonable\u201d judicial review standard to decisions by agency charged with administering zoning resolution]; <em>accord, Matter of Frishman v Schmidt, </em>61 NY2d 823, 825, <em>supra). </em>Neither the New York City Charter provisions (\u00a7 197-c [a], [b], [c], [i]) nor the implementing regulations (62 RCNY 2-02 [a] [5] [iv], [v]) make the filing of a superseding restrictive declaration a prerequisite to a municipal entity\u2019s deeming an application complete for ULURP notification and processing purposes. Moreover, the City determined that given the nature of a restrictive declaration, which would evolve to definiteness over the course of project discussions and negotiations, it would not be feasible to officially fix or set a superseding restrictive declaration at the initial application stage of the process. Therefore, the City agencies reasonably concluded that the superseding restrictive declaration was not a necessary component of a \"complete\u201d application. We, thus, uphold the City\u2019s determination in this respect as correct and neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Petitioners hypothesize that if the superseding restrictive declaration is not required at the initial application phase, then the Department of City Planning is, in essence, exercising \"unfettered discretion\u201d in determining \"complete[ness]\u201d of a land use application. They argue further that this theorem produces an irrational and unreasonable result because it would eviscerate meaningful Community Board advisory involvement in the ULURP process. These contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The New York City Charter directs that \"the department of city planning shall be responsible for certifying * * * [ULURP] applications complete and ready to proceed\u201d in accordance with other express statutory provisions (\u00a7 197-c [c]). These provisions (1) specify with particularity the indispensable minimum inclusions for a ULURP application <em>(see, </em>NY City Charter \u00a7 197-c [b]); and (2) direct the City Planning Commission to promulgate regulations concerning what constitutes a complete application for ULURP purposes (NY City Charter \u00a7 197-c [i]). These regulations were indeed promulgated and, like the authorizing statute, they do not require inclusion of a restrictive declaration for completeness-of-application certification <em>(see, </em>62 RCNY 2-02 [a] [5] [iv], [v]).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The regulations are, themselves, reasonable, as is the City\u2019s application of them in the instant case. The regulations comprehensively define the required components of a complete application as: (1) a standard application form (62 RCNY 2-02 [a] [5] [i]); (2) accompanying documents, maps, plans, and drawings (62 RCNY 2-02 [a] [5] [ii]); (3) jurisdictional information (62 RCNY 2-02 [a] [5] [iii]); (4) completed reviews, reports, and sign-offs by involved State and City agencies (62 RCNY 2-02 [a] [5] [iv]); and (5) a determination of negative declaration or notice of acceptance of a DEIS (62 RCNY 2-02 [a] [5] [v]). Under the implementing regulations, then, an application cannot be deemed \"complete\u201d until all potential negative environmental impacts have been identified and are, thus, brought to the attention of all interested parties for meaningful review and comment. That was done and followed to the letter in this case. The municipal respondents and the land use developer applicant met the prescriptions of the statute and the regulations. Consequently, the City officials cannot be said to have acted beyond their powers and authority, and there is, thus, no basis for the courts to nullify their resolutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">We are fortified in our view and analysis of this case by <em>Community Bd. 7 v Schaffer </em>(84 NY2d 148). There, we held that the Community Board lacked capacity to challenge the Department of City Planning\u2019s action in denying the Community Board\u2019s demand, under the Freedom of Information Law, for a draft restrictive declaration and related correspondence concerning a different project \u2014 Trump City \u2014 which was later abandoned <em>(id., </em>at 152, 157-159). The reasoning of that case is cogently apt in that we noted the Community Board\u2019s \"limited role in the land use planning process\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 157). Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>analysis was also rooted in the relevant express statutory and regulatory requirements <em>(id., </em>at 159). Significantly, in concluding that the Community Board\u2019s advisory mission could be accomplished without its having access to the restrictive declaration, this Court relied on the fact that the New York City Charter and the attendant regulations were silent as to restrictive declarations being part of the ULURP application review process <em>(id., </em>at 159; <em>see, </em>NY City Charter \u00a7 197-c [b], [i]; 62 RCNY 2-02 [a] [5] [i]-[v]). The <em>Schaffer </em>dispositional analysis is telling in the resolution of the instant controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Next, we find unavailing petitioners\u2019 arguments that the 30-day modification/cancellation provisions of the 1982 restrictive declaration (art X) are relevant here and that they were violated. Article XI, \u00a7 11.05 of the 1982 restrictive declaration provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\"><em>\"Except for the purpose of amending, cancelling, or modifying this Declaration pursuant to Article X </em>[which accords the local community board 30 days to review the proposed modification], references * * * to 'Declarant\u2019 shall be deemed to include Declarant\u2019s heirs, successors, assigns and legal representatives in respect of the Subject Property\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Thus, while other provisions of the 1982 restrictive declaration may run with the land, the modification/cancellation provisions of article X do not, by virtue of its explicit exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Even were the 30-day period applicable to Community Board 7\u2019s review of the superseding restrictive declaration, petitioners\u2019 argument still falters. Nothing in the 1982 restrictive declaration links its 30-day window to the 60-day ULURP application review period. So long as Community Board 7 had 30 days in which to consider the superseding restrictive declaration prior to the City\u2019s final action on it, the 30-day provision of the 1982 restrictive declaration is satisfied. That opportunity was available to Community Board 7. It received the superseding restrictive declaration on July 10, 1992. The City did not act to accept and adopt the new restrictive declaration in final form under the pertinent resolution until December 1992. Community Board 7 held several public hearings after receiving the draft superseding restrictive declaration. In its advisory report, it included extensive commentary on the superseding restrictive declaration and Riverside South as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>whole, concluding with its negative recommendation that the project should not be built. Nothing is found in the record showing that the City failed to accept any Community Board input on the new restrictive declaration during the entire preapproval period, which far exceeded the 30-day review window. Consequently, petitioners\u2019 asserted procedural violation, based on the Community Board\u2019s receipt of the 1992 restrictive declaration at a point in time when only 18 days remained on its 60-day ULURP application review period, is of no legal or practical import. The legality of the municipal approval processes has been tested and found satisfied in all the courts. No further legal impediments, within the framework of this litigation, would appear to block Riverside South being built.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We have considered petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Titone, Smith, Levine and Ciparick concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
