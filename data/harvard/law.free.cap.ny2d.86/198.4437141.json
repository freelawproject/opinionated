The Court below correctly concluded that Education Law \u00a7 3107 is not ambiguous and does not exclude managerial employees from its coverage. <em>(Matter of Daniman v Board of Educ., </em>306 NY 532; <em>Matter of Smathers, </em>309 NY 487; <em>Eaton v New York City Conciliation &amp; Appeals Bd., </em>56 NY2d 340; <em>Doctors Council v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>71 NY2d 669; <em>Bender v Jamaica Hosp., </em>40 NY2d 560; <em>People v Floyd J, </em>61 NY2d 895; <em>Matter of Kleefeld, </em>55 NY2d 253; <em>Matter of McLaughlin v Spinnato, </em>106 AD2d 253.)

We conclude that it does under the statute\u2019s plain language, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Respondent Board of Education of the City of New York formerly employed petitioner Arthur Auerbach as Assistant Superintendent, petitioner Edward Aquilone as Executive Director of Personnel and petitioner Patricia Stryker as Director of Legislation. Each petitioner was a member of the Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (TRS), had previously held nonmanagerial and pedagogical positions with respondent, and at the time of retirement held a nonpedagogical managerial title. Upon retirement from service, petitioners respectively applied for retirement leave benefits pursuant to Education Law \u00a7 3107, which entitles members of TRS to payment of one half of their accrued but unused sick leave at their current full pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Respondent Board of Education notified petitioners that, pursuant to Chancellor\u2019s regulations which were adopted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>administer the salary and leave plans for managers,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> they would be paid for unused sick leave accrued while holding nonmanagerial employment at the salary level of those former titles and they would receive payments for one third of the sick leave accrued while employed as a manager. Additionally, to be eligible for the one-third payment, the regulations require the manager to maintain an accrued balance of at least 60 days. The justification for the less-generous sick leave payments is that managers receive greater remuneration and superior benefits than nonmanagerial employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Petitioners Auerbach and Aquilone together, and petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Stryker, separately, commenced CPLR article 78 proceedings, seeking a judgment directing that they be granted an increase in the amount of termination pay disbursed for unused sick leave and declaring that respondents\u2019 calculations violated Education Law \u00a7 3107. In three separate decisions, Supreme Court dismissed the petitions, concluding that their benefits were properly calculated pursuant to the Chancellor\u2019s regulations and not under the Education Law because they were managerial employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The Appellate Division reversed and granted the respective petitions. The Court ruled that Education Law \u00a7 3107 is unambiguous as to its application to all members of the New York City Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, and does not exclude members holding managerial positions. The Court rejected respondent School Board\u2019s claim that the statute\u2019s reference to the school calendar to limit the number of accruable sick days created an ambiguity suggesting that only school teachers are eligible for the statute\u2019s benefits and warranting resort to legislative history. Specifically, the Court stated that \"[t]he mere fact that a measure was used that was most conveniently applied to the vast majority of members who are teachers hardly renders ambiguous the straightforward language applying the statute to all system members.\u201d (204 AD2d 85, 86.) The Court also noted that even if the legislative history were consulted, nothing therein indicated that managerial employees who are members of TRS are not covered by Education Law \u00a7 3107. Two Justices dissented in each proceeding \"for the reasons stated by\u201d the respective trial courts. The double dissent on the law forms the predicate for each of these appeals as of right to this Court <em>(see, </em>CPLR 5601 [d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Education Law \u00a7 3107 provides that \"employees of the board of education who are members of the New York city teachers\u2019 retirement system\u201d shall be entitled to at least 10 days of sick leave for personal illness per year which may be accumulated to a maximum of 200 days. The statute then states that \"[m]embers shall upon application be granted a retirement leave of absence with full pay consisting of one-half of their accumulated unused sick leave, up to a maximum of one <em>school term </em>or the equivalent number of <em>school days\u201d (id. </em>[emphasis supplied]). It is undisputed here that petitioners are all members of TRS. The sole dispute is whether the statute applies to all members of TRS, or only to nonmanagerial, pedagogical members. Specifically, respondent Board of Educa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>tian argues that the references in the statute to the \"school term\u201d and \"school days\u201d indicate that the section covers only those members of TRS who work a school calendar, and excludes coverage for managerial employees who work year-round. Alternatively, respondent argues that the use of those terms creates an ambiguity as to eligibility warranting resort to legislative history, and that the legislative history reveals that section 3107 was intended only to apply to classroom teachers. Neither argument withstands scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Where the terms of a statute are clear and unambiguous, \"the court should construe it so as to give effect to the plain meaning of the words used\u201d <em>(Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v City of New York, </em>41 NY2d 205, 208). Resort to legislative history will be countenanced only where the language is ambiguous or where a literal construction would lead to absurd or unreasonable consequences that are contrary to the purpose of the enactment <em>(Doctors Council v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>71 NY2d 669, 674-675).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Here, the statute plainly affords sick leave benefits to \"members of the New York city teachers\u2019 retirement system.\u201d Those \"critical eligibility words * * * are nowhere limited or qualified\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 675). \"[Membership [in TRS] shall consist of * * * [a]ll teachers\u201d (Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 13-503 [1]), and the term \"teacher\u201d is broadly defined by regulation to include numerous nonpedagogical, managerial employees \u2014 such as superintendents, department heads, and members of the board of examiners \u2014 as well as \"all regular and special teachers\u201d of the City\u2019s public schools (Administrative Code \u00a7 13-501 [7] [a]; <em>see also, </em>Education Law \u00a7 3101).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Clearly, the distinction between classroom and nonclassroom teachers that respondent reads into the statute is belied by the statute\u2019s unqualified extension of sick leave benefits to TRS \"members.\u201d Importantly, section 3107 contains express language limiting its coverage for members of other pension systems to those who are also \"members of the permanent instructional staff\u201d of either the Board of Higher Education or a community college. The absence of an express qualification for members of TRS indicates that the statute does not create a similar distinction between instructional and noninstructional staff for Board of Education employees. Additionally, the statute\u2019s reference to the school term relates solely to accrual limitations and has no relevance to the universe of employees eligible for the benefit. Accordingly, to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>that the Chancellor\u2019s regulations deviate from section 3107 by reducing the amount of sick leave benefits to be paid to TRS members who hold managerial positions, they contravene a legislative enactment and may not be given effect <em>(Doctors Council v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>71 NY2d 669, 676, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Even assuming that the references to the school calendar created an ambiguity as to those eligible for section 3107\u2019s sick leave payments upon retirement, resort to the statute\u2019s legislative history does not lead to a different result. Although, as respondent notes, many of the documents contained in the Bill Jacket refer to \"teachers\u201d as the target group of the legislation <em>(see, e.g., </em>Sponsor\u2019s Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1960, ch 894), that term is broadly defined in the Education Law and related regulations to include both classroom and managerial personnel of the Board of Education (Education Law \u00a7 3101; Administrative Code \u00a7 13-501 [7] [a]). Additionally, references to the word teacher may simply reflect the fact that the legislation logically would have its broadest impact on classroom teachers who constitute the majority of TRS\u2019 members. The legislative history\u2019s silence as to the statute\u2019s effect on members of TRS who hold managerial positions, and who apparently constitute the statistical minority in terms of membership, does not indicate an intent to exclude such employees from the statute\u2019s beneficial sweep.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">That application of Education Law \u00a7 3107 to managerial members of TRS may confer benefits upon some managerial employees but not upon others who are non-TRS members does not support the conclusion urged by respondents that the statute is only meant to cover nonmanagers. The Legislature saw fit to provide a special sick leave benefit for all members of TRS \u2014 managers and nonmanagers alike. Thus, any employee \u2014 manager or nonmanager \u2014 who is not a member of TRS will be excluded from the statute\u2019s beneficial reach. In other words, all TRS members get the \"windfall\u201d in the sense that they, unlike nonmembers, receive raises throughout their careers and accumulated sick leave payments based on a higher rate of pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Accordingly, in each proceeding, the determination appealed from and the order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine and Ciparick concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In each proceeding, determination appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Chancellor\u2019s Regulation D-605 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u201d9.
