The Court below\u2019s reduction, elimination, and/or vacating for remand of Trial Term\u2019s abatement awards was improper because such actions (1) did not have evidentiary support on the record, and (2) were premised upon an overly narrow interpretation of Real Property Law \u00a7 235-b. <em>(Park W.

Tenants are entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees, as they proved the landlord\u2019s warranty breach (denied by him), and were successful in obtaining the central relief sought; furthermore, the standard articulated by the Court below for determining attorneys\u2019 fees liability is improper. <em>(Eaton v New York City Conciliation &amp; Appeals Bd., </em>56 NY2d 340; <em>Lynch v Leibman, </em>177 AD2d 453; <em>Solovieff Gallery Co. v Langston, </em>167 AD2d 325; <em>Park W.

The conditions which existed in the premises during the period in question were detrimental to the tenants\u2019 life, health and safety, constituted significant breaches of the warranty of habitability, and justified the abatements awarded by the trial court. <em>(Park W.

Following a pervasive rent strike, the landlord commenced summary nonpayment proceedings to recover unpaid rent for the period October 1987 through May 1988. In a joint trial before the Civil Court the tenants conceded the landlord\u2019s prima facie case of rent nonpayment but asserted as an affirmative defense and counterclaim the landlord\u2019s breach of the implied warranty of habitability (Real Property Law \u00a7 235-b). The tenants also counterclaimed, <em>inter alla, </em>for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The trial court interpreted Real Property Law \u00a7 235-b as requiring that \"the premises * * * be maintained in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the tenant\u201d (150 Misc 2d 642, 650). Accordingly, because these tenants resided in a uniquely designed building on Manhattan\u2019s \"fashionable\u201d upper east side and paid comparatively high rents, the court concluded that the reasonable expectations against which the landlord\u2019s performance would be measured \"encompassed more than the minimal amenities\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 650, 651). Applying this standard to the evidence before it, the court held that the landlord had breached the implied warranty of habitability and awarded the tenants a 10% abatement for the common area problems and additional abatements of from 1 to 11% for individual apartment complaints for the portion of each tenancy that fell within the six-year Statute of Limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Because of the various rent abatements awarded,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the land<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>lord received significantly reduced judgments on his unpaid rent claims and, in some cases, judgment was entered in the tenant\u2019s favor. Additionally, the trial court held that the tenants as a group were entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees as the prevailing parties and that prejudgment interest should be denied the landlord on an estoppel theory but awarded to those tenants who received a judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">On appeal to the Appellate Term the landlord challenged the propriety of the warranty of habitability abatements. Following its legal and factual review of Civil Court\u2019s disposition of the case <em>(see, </em>CPLR 5501 [d]), that court rejected the trial court\u2019s use of a heightened warranty standard and found that under the proper standard only one of the building-wide conditions \u2014 elevator service problems \u2014 warranted an abatement <em>(see, </em>154 Misc 2d 737). Appellate Term thus reduced the common area abatement to 5% and limited it to the period May 1987 through May 1988. As to the conditions of the individual apartments, Appellate Term concluded that with respect to 16 of the apartments the evidence did not support an additional abatement and that with respect to the remaining apartments, a remand for recalculation under the appropriate standard and for specific findings as to the nature and duration of the defects was necessary. In light of its remand order, Appellate Term declined to make a final determination on the issues of attorneys\u2019 fees and prejudgment interest <em>(id., </em>at 744).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The Appellate Division granted the tenants\u2019 motions for leave to appeal, and upon review, modified Appellate Term\u2019s remand direction only to the extent of deleting the requirement that Civil Court make specific findings as to the amount of offset attributable to each apartment-specific defect, and as modified, otherwise affirmed (205 AD2d 339). That same panel of the Appellate Division subsequently granted the tenants\u2019 motions to appeal to this Court, certifying the following question for our review: \"Was the order of this Court, which modified the order of [the Appellate Term of] the Supreme Court, properly made?\u201d We now answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Pursuant to Real Property Law \u00a7 235-b, every residential lease contains an implied warranty of habitability which is limited by its terms to three covenants: (1) that the premises are \"fit for human habitation\u201d, (2) that the premises are fit for \"the uses reasonably intended by the parties\u201d, and (3) that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>occupants will not be subjected to conditions that are \"dangerous, hazardous or detrimental to their life, health or safety\u201d (Real Property Law \u00a7 235-b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Park W. Mgt. Corp. v Mitchell </em>(47 NY2d 316, 327, <em>cert denied </em>444 US 992), this Court described the statutory warranty as creating an implied promise by the landlord that the demised premises are fit for human occupancy. We specifically rejected the contention that the warranty was intended to make the landlord \"a guarantor of every amenity customarily rendered in the landlord-tenant relationship\u201d and held that the implied warranty protects only against conditions that materially affect the health and safety of tenants or deficiencies that \"in the eyes of a <em>reasonable person </em>* * * deprive the tenant of those <em>essential functions </em>which a residence is expected to provide\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 327, 328 [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">While Civil Court based its finding of a breach of the warranty of habitability in part on conditions reasonably related to health and safety and essential functions, it did not limit the implied warranty to such matters. Instead, the court interpreted the second prong of the statutory covenant \u2014 that the premises are fit for \"the uses reasonably intended by the parties\u201d \u2014 as encompassing the level of services and amenities that tenants reasonably expect to be provided under the financial and other terms of their individual leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">We reject Civil Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute. As discussed, the implied warranty of habitability sets forth a minimum standard to protect tenants against conditions that render residential premises uninhabitable or unusable. Thus, the statutory reference to \"uses reasonably intended by the parties\u201d, rather than referring to a broad spectrum of expectations arising out of the parties\u2019 specific contractual arrange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ment, reflects the Legislature\u2019s concern that tenants be provided with premises suitable for residential habitation, in other words, living quarters having \"those essential functions which a residence is expected to provide\u201d <em>(Park W. Mgt. Corp. v Mitchell, supra, </em>at 328). This prong of the warranty therefore protects against conditions that, while they do not render an apartment unsafe or uninhabitable, constitute deficiencies that prevent the premises from serving their intended function of residential occupation. Thus, for example, Appellate Term correctly concluded that operable elevator service is an essential attribute of a high-rise residential apartment building because a reasonable person could find that it is indispensable to the use of the demised premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The trial court\u2019s contrary interpretation, based on expectations arising from the terms of the lease, would make the statutory implied warranty of habitability coextensive with the parties\u2019 lease agreement. However, the statute\u2019s non-waiver clause (Real Property Law \u00a7 235-b [2]) indicates a legislative intent to insure the independence of the warranty of habitability from the specific terms of a lease. Moreover, as we noted in <em>Park W. Mgt., </em>section 235-b was intended to provide an objective, uniform standard for essential functions, while the trial court\u2019s standard creates an individualized subjective standard dependent on the specific terms of each lease. Furthermore, grafting the tenant\u2019s contractual rights onto the implied warranty would unnecessarily duplicate other legal and equitable remedies of the tenant <em>(see, </em>3 Warren\u2019s Weed, New York Real Property, Leasing of Residential Property: Rights and Obligations of Landlords and Tenants \u00a7\u00a7 6.03, 7.01 [4th ed]).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Appellate Term thus correctly rejected the trial court\u2019s application of the warranty of habitability. We also agree with Appellate Division\u2019s determination that in light of the order remitting the case to Civil Court for recalculation of the abatement awards, it was premature to review Civil Court\u2019s determination of the tenants\u2019 counterclaim for attorneys\u2019 fees. Likewise, because Appellate Term\u2019s remittal order vacated the existing judgments, it was premature for the appellate courts below to review the parties\u2019 entitlement to prejudgment interest. We note, however, that entitlement to prejudgment interest is not dependent on prevailing party status, but rather, where, as here, the action is based on a claim of default on the lease agreement <em>(see, </em>RPAPL 711) and involves counterclaims for breach of the warranty of habitability and rent over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>charges, the action sounds in contract and any party is thus entitled to prejudgment interest upon recovery of a money judgment <em>(see, </em>CPLR 5001 [a]; Siegel, NY Prac \u00a7 411, at 623 [2d ed 1991]).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Titone, Bellacosa and Ciparick concur; Judge Smith taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-10\">. In addition to the breach of warranty of habitability abatements, certain tenants received an additional rent offset representing rent overcharge damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\">. Real Property Law \u00a7 235-b provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">\"1. In every written or oral lease or rental agreement for residential premises the landlord or lessor shall be deemed to covenant and warrant that the premises so leased or rented and all areas used in connection therewith in common with other tenants or residents are fit for human habitation and for the uses reasonably intended by the parties and that the occupants of such premises shall not be subjected to any conditions which would be dangerous, hazardous or detrimental to their life, health or safety. When any such condition has been caused by the misconduct of the tenant or lessee or persons under his direction or control, it shall not constitute a breach of such covenants and warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">\"2. Any agreement by a lessee or tenant of a dwelling waiving or modifying his rights as set forth in this section shall be void as contrary to public policy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
