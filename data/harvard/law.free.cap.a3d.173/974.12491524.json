The defendant elected a jury trial on the murder charge and a court trial on the firearms charges.

The defendant notes that Newton arrived at the scene of the shooting with the defendant, while Cole arrived with the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the defendant relies on a security camera video of the shooting that was admitted into evidence and played for the jury several times at trial, which depicts Cole and Newton in a circle with the victim and other unidentified individuals moments before the shooting. In that video, the defendant claims that \"[a]s the shooter stepped toward the victim raising a gun, Cole faced east and Newton faced west, watching both directions as the crime occurred.\" The defendant also argues that \"Cole remained present instead of riding away on his bicycle when the shooting started and ... he stayed looking up the street away from the commotion\" at\n   a time when \"[e]veryone else [had] immediately run away.\" In light of the foregoing, the defendant argues that the evidence was sufficient to establish that Cole and Newton were accomplices to the murder of the victim. As such, the defendant maintains that the court was obligated to furnish an accomplice credibility instruction to the jury regarding their testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We disagree that the court's failure to sua sponte provide an accomplice liability instruction under the\n   particular circumstances of this case was plain error.

Significantly, the defendant never suggested, at trial or in closing argument, that Cole and Newton were his accomplices. Rather, the defendant steadfastly argued that the evidence did not support a finding that he was at the scene of the shooting. In such instances, we cannot conclude that the court's failure to sua sponte provide a special accomplice credibility instruction was plain error on the part of the trial court. Indeed, furnishing that instruction to the jury arguably would have contravened the defendant's well established right to control the conduct of his own defense,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   as an accomplice credibility instruction, by its very nature, would have implicated the defendant in the victim's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To prevail under the first prong of a plain error analysis, an appellant must demonstrate that the alleged error is \"obvious in the sense of not debatable....

Newton further acknowledged that, pursuant to the terms of that plea, the state agreed to permit him to apply for a sentence modification that would reduce his sentence from thirty-eight years to thirty-three years if he testified truthfully in the defendant's criminal proceeding. Newton testified that, if he did so, he \"would get thirty-three years to serve.\" On the same day that he entered that plea before the court, Newton provided a statement to the police, in which he identified the defendant as the person who shot the victim on June 4, 2007.

As counsel stated: \"He also told you that he's in jail for thirty-eight years, which may very well be reduced to thirty-three years just for testifying in this case. That's a deal he cut with [the prosecutor].... Which story of [Newton's] do you believe?

During closing argument, the defendant's counsel noted that Cole had testified at trial that he was incarcerated when a police detective interviewed him regarding the victim's murder. Counsel then asked the jury to consider Cole's motivation for providing his statements to police, stating in relevant\n   part: \"Why is he doing that? Maybe he's just a poor observer of things. Does he have no idea that the guy he is trying to place at the scene of a murder some five years ago is nearly half a foot taller than he's claiming? Was he even telling the truth when he said he had known [the defendant] for two years prior to the shooting .... [During his testimony, Cole] volunteered ... that he was incarcerated, volunteered that. Why did police seek him out? These are\n   fair questions, all of them, and they go right to the heart of [Cole's] reliability.\" The plain import of that argument was that, as an incarcerated individual, Cole's cooperation with law enforcement officials investigating the victim's murder might have been motivated by self-interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition, the jury was provided with a general instruction on credibility, which we presume it followed.

Furthermore, during closing arguments, the defendant's counsel encouraged the jury to carefully scrutinize the testimony of Newton and Cole due to their potential motivation and interest in cooperating with the state.
