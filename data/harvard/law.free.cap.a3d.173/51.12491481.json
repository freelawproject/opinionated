Garvey, appeals from the judgment of the trial court sustaining the emergency ex parte custody order entered pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56f\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   denying the plaintiff visitation with the parties' child. The order was entered pursuant to the application of the defendant, Stanley M. Valencis. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that: (1) the court improperly entered and extended the emergency\n   ex parte custody order in violation of \u00a7 46b-56f, Practice Book \u00a7 4-5, and the plaintiff's constitutional right to due process, and (2) there was insufficient evidence to conclude, as the court did, that the incident giving rise to the emergency ex parte order constituted an immediate and present risk of psychological harm to the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The parties, who never married one another, lived together for a short period of time during the plaintiff's pregnancy but separated after the birth of their child in 2002. The parties have litigated custodial, support, and visitation rights throughout the child's life. Notably, the defendant was awarded, and has maintained, sole legal and primary physical custody of the child since 2005 pursuant to a Massachusetts judgment. The file in the present matter was opened on June 8, 2007, by action of the plaintiff, who sought to register and enforce the foreign child custody determination in this state. Emily Moskowitz, an attorney, was\n   appointed\n   guardian ad litem for the child on May 20, 2010. On January 14, 2013, the parties stipulated to a gradual increase in the plaintiff's visitation with the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 10, 2015, a physical confrontation occurred between the child and the plaintiff during a regularly scheduled visit at the plaintiff's home. Believing that his mother was recording a conversation with him regarding a prior missed visit, the child texted the defendant stating that he was not okay and wanted to return home. Shortly thereafter, the defendant received a phone call from the child, but the child did not respond when the defendant answered the phone. Instead, the defendant heard a \"significant disturbance.\" Specifically, the defendant heard the child say: \"Let me go. You're hurting me. Stop.\" The defendant's wife and the guardian ad litem also listened to the disturbance. After conferring with the guardian ad litem, the defendant drove to the plaintiff's home to pick up the child. The police were notified of the situation and arrived at the plaintiff's home shortly after the defendant. The police, after interviewing the plaintiff and the then twelve and one-half year old child, and consulting with the guardian ad litem, concluded it was in the child's best interest for him to return home with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 12, 2015, the defendant filed an application for an emergency ex parte order of custody pursuant to \u00a7 46b-56f. That same day, the court found that an immediate and present risk of physical or psychological harm to the child existed and granted the defendant's ex parte application. The court suspended the plaintiff's visitation rights and denied her any contact with the child. The court scheduled a hearing on the matter to be held nine days later, on May 21, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the ex-parte application over several days: May 21, June 16, June 24, and September 1, 2015. Both parties were\n   represented by counsel. Numerous witnesses testified, including the parties and the guardian ad litem. On September 2, 2015, the court issued a memorandum of decision on the ex parte order of custody, finding \"by clear and convincing evidence that the orders of May 12, 2015, were appropriately entered and that a current, immediate and present risk of psychological harm to the child exists.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following oral argument before us, we ordered the court to articulate the factual basis for its conclusion that a current, immediate, and present risk of psychological harm to the child existed. The court articulated, among other things, that several days after the incident, the child was still visibly upset and stated to the guardian ad litem that the plaintiff had \"hit him, pushed him, and threw him to the ground,\" and that \"he never wanted to see [her] again.\" The child's therapist recommended that the child not see the plaintiff at that time. According to the child's tutor, the child was upset, aggravated, and agitated. His ability to stay focused and complete his work had decreased drastically. Academically, the child had regressed by two to three years. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the court improperly entered, and extended, the emergency ex parte custody order in violation of \u00a7 46b-56f(c), Practice Book \u00a7 4-5, and the plaintiff's constitutional right to due process under the fourteenth amendment of the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 10, of the constitution of Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we identify our standard of review and the general legal principles relevant to our analysis. \"The interpretation and application of a statute, and thus a Practice Book provision, involves a\n   question of law over which our review is plenary.\"\n   <em>\n    Wiseman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305117\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/94/#p99\">\n    295 Conn. 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20A.2d%201027\">\n    989 A.2d 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). \"When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature....

Specifically, the plaintiff argues that such relief was improper because \u00a7 46b-56f(c)\"requires an effort to hear from the other party,\" and that she was available, desired to participate, and was present in the courthouse when the court entered the ex parte order. The defendant argues that \u00a7 46b-56f(b) does not require the court to hear from the respondent. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In accordance with \u00a7 1-2z, we begin with the relevant text of \u00a7 46b-56f. Section 46b-56f(b) provides that: \"The application [to the Superior Court for an emergency ex parte order of custody] shall be accompanied by an affidavit made under oath which includes a statement (1) of the conditions requiring an emergency ex parte order, (2) that an emergency ex parte order is in the\n   best interests of the child, and (3) of the actions taken by the applicant or any other person to inform the respondent of the request or, if no such actions to inform the respondent were taken, the reasons why the court should consider such an application on an ex parte basis absent such actions.\" Section 46b-56f(c) provides in relevant part that: \"The court shall order a hearing on any application made pursuant to this section. If, prior to or after such hearing, the court finds that an immediate and present risk of physical danger or psychological harm to the child exists, the court may, in its discretion, issue an emergency order for the protection of the child ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The text of \u00a7 46b-56f(b) does not require that the court provide a respondent with the opportunity to be heard prior to ordering emergency ex parte relief. See\n   <em>\n    Kinsey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pacific Employers Ins.

Section 46b-56f(b) merely provides that the applicant submit an affidavit detailing the conditions requiring an emergency ex parte order, stating that the emergency ex parte order is in the best interests of the child, and stating the actions taken to notify the respondent, or if no actions were taken to inform the respondent, explaining why the court should consider such an application on an ex parte\n   basis absent such notification efforts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 46b-56f does not require the court to hear from the respondent before\n   granting the application for emergency ex parte order of custody and issuing appropriate ex parte orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff next claims that \u00a7 46b-56f (c) mandates that a hearing be\n   <em>\n    completed\n   </em>\n   within fourteen days after the ex parte emergency order is issued. We disagree. Section 46b-56f(c) provides in relevant part: \"The court shall order a hearing on any application made pursuant to this section. If, prior to or after such hearing, the court finds that an immediate and present risk of physical danger or psychological harm to the child exists, the court may, in its discretion, issue an emergency order for the protection of the child .... If relief on the application is ordered ex parte, the court shall\n   <em>\n    schedule\n   </em>\n   a hearing not later than fourteen days after the date of such ex parte order.

The court's fundamental objective in construing a statute \"is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.... In other words, [the court] seek[s] to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply....

We do not agree. The statute provides that a hearing must be scheduled no later than fourteen days after the ex parte emergency order is issued. It\n   does not provide that the hearing must be scheduled and completed within that time period. We reject the plaintiff's invitation to read words into a statute that are not there. If the legislature wanted the hearing completed within fourteen days, it knows how to enact legislation consistent with its intent. See\n   <em>\n    Fedus\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665863\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/278/751/\">\n    278 Conn. 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 771 n.17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=900%20A.2d%201\">\n    900 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When \u00a7 46b-56f(c) is read together as a consistent whole, it is obvious that the statute contemplates that the hearing may not be completed within fourteen days of the emergency ex parte order. The statute specifically provides for a postponement and continuance under certain conditions. To require the hearing to be completed within fourteen days may lead to an absurd result if all parties are unable to present evidence within that time period. The statute promotes the best interest of the child by establishing an expeditious procedure by which the court can promptly protect the child from physical and psychological harm and protect the due process right of the child's parent. The notion that a hearing concerning the custody of a minor child can invariably be completed within fourteen days of the date the emergency ex parte order is issued is unrealistic in light of the schedules of the court and counsel. Common sense would dictate that the hearing continue until all parties have been given an opportunity to present their respective cases. For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff's claim fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiff next claims that the court's ex parte order expired \"automatically\" after thirty days pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4-5. The plaintiff argues that because the order expired, the court lost jurisdiction over the ex parte application, and the order entered pursuant to the court's memorandum of decision was \"a nullity.\" We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 4-5(b) provides in relevant part that: \"When an application for a temporary injunction is granted without\n   ... a hearing, the court shall schedule an expeditious hearing as to whether the temporary injunction should remain in effect. Any temporary injunction which was granted without a hearing shall automatically expire thirty days following its issuance,\n   <em>\n    unless the court, following a hearing, determines that said injunction should remain in effect.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 46b-56f(c) provides in relevant part: \"If relief on the application is ordered ex parte, the court shall schedule a hearing not later than fourteen days after the date of such ex parte order. If a postponement of a hearing on the application is requested by either party and granted, no ex parte order shall be granted or continued except upon agreement of the parties or by order of the court\n   <em>\n    for good cause shown\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the present case, the court scheduled and commenced a hearing on the ex parte emergency order within fourteen days from the date that the order was issued. On the first day of the hearing, the plaintiff was permitted to present testimony from some of her witnesses during the time allotted to the defendant to\n   accommodate the schedules of some of the plaintiff's witnesses. At the conclusion of the first day of the hearing, the court stated: \"So what I'll do at this time ... the current orders remain in place as to the ex parte order. I will order the parties to go down and see [the scheduling coordinator] in regards to a new schedule.... I know [that the guardian ad litem], based on other cases I had with her, is on vacation next week.... So, I'll try and, you know, schedule you in.\" Counsel for the plaintiff, Martha Dean, stated, \"okay.\" In other words, the plaintiff did not object to the court's continuing the emergency ex parte order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The hearing continued on June 16, 2015. The following colloquy transpired between the court and Dean:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[Attorney] Dean: I'm going to move again in the short term to have the normal parenting plan restored immediately. This child has a therapist. [The child] has sole custody with [the defendant]. He lives with [the defendant]. We're talking only about visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"We've heard no testimony of any substantial, significant injury. In fact, we heard testimony to the contrary from the police and from the [guardian ad litem], and we move, again, on the spot, right now, asking the court to put the current orders in place until we can get to the end of this hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"The Court: Attorney Dean, you're out of line. The evidence that I've heard really is not as you say it, and again, I'm giving you, still, the opportunity to put on your witnesses. But [I do not], based on what I've heard here so far, have the same mindset that you have. My orders remain in place.\" The plaintiff did not further object to the continuance of the emergency ex parte order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The hearing reconvened on the afternoon of June 24, 2015, at which time the court stated, in part: \"So, all\n   right, folks, look, we're reaching our third day of hearings on the emergency ex parte order.... So, I'd like to move this along as quickly as we can.\" Immediately thereafter, Dean asked that one of the plaintiff's witnesses be taken out of order. The court granted the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing on the afternoon of June 24, 2015, the court indicated to counsel that there would be a two month continuance due to the schedules of two other judges. The court stated: \"I will have to do what I need to do based on the evidence that's presented when the hearing finally concludes. But by then, three and one-half months will have passed since the original incident date. It will be, I\n   believe, appropriate if the parties determine it to be in the child's best interest that [the parties] perhaps have a conversation with the guardian ad litem between now and September 1, [2015], two months from now, in regards to current orders and/or what may be the future of this particular case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"[Attorney] Dean: Your Honor, the important thing to know-we can't get into discussions, but on something as incredible as this, that this mother's ability to see her child has been conditioned on (indiscernible) the removal action of the guardian ad litem. That is so unethical and unscrupulous [that] I have to bring it to your attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"The Court: Attorney Dean, I have had the opportunity to listen to all the testimony so far. I don't see your concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"[Attorney] Dean: I don't get how (indiscernible) schedules....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"The Court: [A]s I've stated, there is going to be a two month continuance because of the scheduling of\n   the two judges. So, I believe if it's something the attorneys wish to do, they should discuss the matter with the guardian ad litem, and see if there is any middle road here that would be appropriate. If not, we just continue, and we'll see you back here September 1, [2015].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"[Attorney] Dean: Your Honor, could I ask one last request, and that is because we are so close to the close of the moving party's evidence, that if even for an hour or so, this could be concluded, we could at least move for the failure to make out a prima facie case on the evidence and allow ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"The Court: Counsel, there is no way that I'm going to listen to that type of motion based on what I've heard.

Therefore, the order did not automatically expire and remained in effect until September 2, 2015, when the final orders were entered. Accordingly, the court retained jurisdiction over the orders and properly rendered judgment in its September 2, 2015 memorandum of decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The plaintiff's fourth claim is that the court violated her constitutional right to procedural due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 10 of the constitution of Connecticut by entering and extending the ex parte custody order. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that a postdeprivation hearing spanning 112 days following the entry of an ex parte emergency order is unreasonable, and that \u00a7 46b-56f(c) should be invalidated as\n   applied to the facts of her case. In response, the defendant argues that the plaintiff had her opportunity to be heard and \"caused much of the delay ... by her own requests and motions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we identify our standard of review and the general legal principles relevant to our analysis.

The evidentiary hearing began on May 21, 2015, with the plaintiff's counsel being permitted to call three of her witnesses out of order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 16, 2015, before continuing with testimony, the court addressed the plaintiff's pending motion in limine to preclude certain evidence and the testimony from the guardian ad litem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The motion was summarily denied. On June 24, 2015, the hearing began with the plaintiff's counsel calling another witness out of order. Additionally, the plaintiff expanded the scope of evidence by introducing testimony concerning a missed visitation on May 6, 2015, an event which did not give rise to the ex parte proceeding. The May 6, 2015 visitation topic was at issue during each of the four days of the hearing on the ex parte emergency order. On the last day of hearing, the court admonished the plaintiff's counsel for her \"protracted litigious presentation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The record, when taken as a whole, indicates that the plaintiff was given ample opportunity to be heard on the matter. The plaintiff called seven witnesses, many of whom were called out of order, delaying the defendant's case-in-chief. Additionally, the plaintiff filed a number of motions that needed to be addressed during the hearing. Furthermore, the court granted the plaintiff wide latitude in litigating the validity of the order, including expanding the scope of testimony. On the basis of the foregoing facts, we conclude that the plaintiff contributed to the delayed resolution of this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"At some point, a delay in the post-termination hearing would become a constitutional violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Board of Education\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Loudermill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/#p547\">\n    470 U.S. 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/#p547\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/#p547\">\n    84 L.Ed.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985) ; see also\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/#p547\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that nine month adjudication is not \"unconstitutionally lengthy per se\").

The\n   plaintiff did not object. The record indicates that the parties then reported to case flow and agreed to continue the hearing to June 16, June 24, and September 1, 2015. The record reveals that the court had a date available prior to June 16, 2015, but the plaintiff or her counsel were unavailable. On June 16, 2015, the plaintiff raised concerns about the length of the hearing, as it became apparent that the hearing would likely conclude on September 1, 2015. On June 24, 2015, the plaintiff asked that the hearing be concluded sooner than September 1, 2015. After this request was denied by the court, she then asked for an extra hour so that the defendant could conclude his case-in-chief, and the plaintiff could move to dismiss on the ground that the defendant had failed to make out a prima facie case. The court denied the plaintiff's request, stating that it would not consider such a motion on the basis of the facts established. On September 1, 2015, the plaintiff, without prior notice to the court or the defendant, moved to terminate the hearing pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4-5, claiming for the first time that her constitutional right to due process had been violated by continuing the hearing. Following oral argument, the court denied the plaintiff's motion. The plaintiff then objected to proceeding with the hearing, but was forced to proceed by order of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"Our Supreme Court has long held that [a party] may not pursue one course of action at trial for tactical reasons and later on appeal argue that the path he rejected should now be open to him.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"210612\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/64/659/#p669\">\n    64 Conn.

The police interviewed the child at the plaintiff's home following the May 10, 2015 incident. They\n   noted that he was \"extremely upset; his face was flushed, his eyes were red, and was crying with tears running down his face.\" The child repeatedly stated that he wanted to go home. The police provided the child with his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and stated that this might have contributed to the child's emotional state. The court, however, found the reading of the child's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights \"to be less significant in comparison to the overall events of the day in question.\" After speaking with the plaintiff, the defendant, the child, and the guardian ad litem, the police concluded that \"it would be appropriate and in the child's best interest [for him] to go home with [the defendant] because they did not believe that there would be a civil visitation past that point.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The guardian ad litem testified as a fact witness and in her legal capacity at the June 16 and September 1, 2015 hearings. Specifically, she testified that she over-heard a portion of the May 10, 2015 altercation via telephone and that she heard the child say \"don't hit me ... don't touch me ... don't push me.\" The guardian ad litem also met with the child a couple of days after the incident. At that meeting, the child was still visibly upset and told the guardian ad litem that the plaintiff had \"hit him, pushed him and threw him to the ground\" and that \"he never wanted to see [her] again.\" The guardian ad litem spoke with the child's therapist, who recommended that the child not see the plaintiff \"at this time.\" She also spoke with the child's tutor, who indicated that the child was now very upset, very aggravated, and agitated. The tutor also indicated that the child's ability to stay focused and complete his work had decreased drastically, and he\n   had regressed back to where he was two or three years ago. The defendant and his wife similarly testified that the child's\n   academics had regressed. In addition, the child wet his bed directly following the incident. On the basis of the evidence presented, the court concluded, by both a fair preponderance of the evidence and by clear and convincing evidence, as was set forth in detail in its articulation, filed on May 22, 2017, that there existed an immediate and present risk of psychological harm to the child. Therefore, the court concluded it was in the child's best interest to grant the defendant's application and order that the child's visitation with the plaintiff cease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the court's conclusion of an immediate and present risk of psychological harm to the child as a result of the incident on May 10, 2015, at the plaintiff's home. Although \u00a7 46b-56f does not contain explicit criteria for the court to consider when analyzing an \"immediate and present risk of psychological harm,\" we cannot conclude that the court's finding was clearly erroneous in light of the evidence presented, which revealed that the child was deeply affected by the May 10, 2015 incident. He was visibly upset immediately following the incident and expressed his desire to never see the plaintiff again. There was evidence of a decline in the child's psychological well-being following the incident, including evidence of his academic and behavioral regression. The evidence is sufficient to support the court's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    General Statutes 46b-56f(a) provides: \"Any person seeking custody of a minor child pursuant to section 46b-56 or pursuant to an action brought under section 46b-40 may make an application to the Superior Court for an emergency ex parte order of custody when such person believes an immediate and present risk of physical danger or psychological harm to the child exists.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Our review of the record revealed that on January 5, 2017, the court reopened the proceedings and ordered the child to call the plaintiff once a week and permitted the child to call her more often, if the child so desired.
