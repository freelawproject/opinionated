In this certified appeal, the defendant Jeffrey S. Pasiak\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenges the Appellate Court's determination that such liability fell under the business pursuits exclusion to coverage under his personal umbrella policy. The plaintiffs, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company, contend that coverage not only is barred under the business pursuits exclusion, but also that (1) coverage is barred under policy exclusions for workers' compensation obligations and for mental abuse, (2) construing the policy to provide indemnification for common-law punitive damages arising from intentional wrongdoing violates public policy, and (3) the trial court improperly limited the scope of discovery and the declaratory judgment trial, depriving the plaintiffs of a trial de novo on coverage issues that they could not litigate in the underlying tort action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We hold that the case must be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings, limited to the issue of whether the business pursuits exclusion applies. We conclude that neither the Appellate Court nor the trial court employed the correct standard for determining whether the defendant's tortious conduct was an occurrence \"arising out of\" the business pursuits of the insured and that further factual findings would be necessary to determine whether this exception applies\n   under the correct standard. We further conclude that the plaintiffs cannot prevail on their alternative grounds regarding the other exclusions and public policy as a matter of law. Finally, we conclude that the plaintiffs are not limited to the evidentiary record in the underlying tort action to establish that the business pursuits exclusion barred coverage. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court with direction to remand the case to the trial court for a trial de novo on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Appellate Court's opinion summarized the facts that the jury reasonably could have found in the underlying tort action; see\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pasiak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20Conn.%20App.%2086\">\n    161 Conn. App. 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90-91,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.3d%20346\">\n    127 A.3d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ; which we have supplemented with the limited additional facts found by the trial court in the declaratory judgment action, also gleaned from the evidence in the underlying action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the incident in question, the defendant operated a construction company, Pasiak Construction Services, LLC. The sole office for\n   the company was a room located on the second floor of the defendant's home in Stamford; the company's construction equipment was stored at another site. Sara Socci was hired by the defendant to perform duties as an office worker for the construction company and worked at that office in the defendant's home. Her work hours were from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., four days a week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During Socci's second week of employment, while she was alone at the office performing her duties, a masked intruder carrying a gun entered the office and\n   demanded that she open the safe. Unaware that a safe existed in the home, Socci could not provide the intruder with the safe's combination. The intruder led Socci into a bedroom, where he tied her hands, gagged her, and blindfolded her. At one point, he pointed a gun at her head and threatened to kill her family if she did not give him the combination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant returned home during the incident and was attacked by the intruder. During an ensuing struggle, the defendant pulled off the intruder's mask, revealing him to be Richard Kotulsky, a lifelong friend of the defendant. The defendant began talking to Kotulsky and inquired about Socci. Kotulsky led the defendant to Socci, who was crying and hysterical. After the defendant made Kotulsky untie Socci, the three of them returned to the office, where a discussion continued between the defendant and Kotulsky about a woman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Socci asked to leave, but the defendant told her to stay and sit down. After further discussions with Kotulsky, the defendant allowed him to leave the house. Socci then told the defendant about the threats that Kotulsky had made to her and her family, but the defendant would not call the police. He told Socci to stay with him and refused to let her call the police or to discuss the incident further. She remained with the defendant for several hours, in fear that, if she left, she or her family might be harmed by Kotulsky. Only after he drove Socci to Greenwich to discuss the incident with a mutual friend, Denise Taranto, who advised them to call the police, did he allow Socci to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The police were not contacted until later that day, after Socci and her husband, Kraig Socci, went to the\n   defendant's home and learned that he had not yet contacted them. In the presence of the Soccis and the police, the defendant telephoned Kotulsky and told him that \"the girl\" had identified him to the police. Some days later, Kotulsky was arrested and eventually convicted of various criminal offenses in connection with this incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The safe was never opened, and its contents were never divulged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a result of the incident, Socci developed post-traumatic stress disorder, requiring extensive therapy, and was unable to return to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The record reveals the following additional undisputed facts and procedural history. Socci and Kraig Socci commenced a tort action against the defendant (Socci action), alleging (1) false imprisonment, (2) negligence, (3) negligent infliction of emotional\n   distress, (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (5) loss of consortium as to Kraig Socci.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first two claims related to the defendant's conduct in preventing Socci from leaving until she and the defendant returned from their meeting with Taranto. The third and fourth claims related to the entirety of the defendant's conduct leading up to his comments on the telephone to Kotulsky implicating Socci as the police informant. The complaint alleged that Socci had sustained permanent physical and emotional injuries and requested compensatory and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the time of the relevant events, the defendant was covered by insurance policies issued by the plaintiffs, including a homeowners policy covering bodily injury and a personal umbrella policy covering bodily injury\n   and personal injury. He did not have a separate commercial liability policy. The plaintiffs provided the defendant with an attorney to defend him in the Socci action, but notified him by letter that they were reserving their right to contest coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In accordance with that reservation, the plaintiffs commenced the present action seeking a declaration that they had no duty to defend or indemnify the defendant in the Socci action. The plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment, and the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment solely as to the duty to defend. The court concluded that the allegations of the complaint were sufficiently broad to obligate the plaintiffs to provide the defendant with a defense under both his homeowners policy and his personal umbrella policy. The court deemed it improper at that juncture to determine the plaintiffs' duty to indemnify the defendant. Accordingly, it granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to the duty to defend and denied the plaintiffs' motion seeking a declaratory judgment in their favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Socci action proceeded to trial with the plaintiffs providing defense counsel to the defendant. At the conclusion of evidence, the parties agreed not to submit special interrogatories to the jury. The jury returned a general verdict in favor of the Soccis. It awarded Socci $628,200 in compensatory damages and $175,000 in punitive damages, and awarded Kraig Socci $32,500 in compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following judgment in the Socci action, the plaintiffs filed a second motion for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action regarding their duty to indemnify the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of their motion,\n   the plaintiffs argued that the defendant's policies did not provide coverage for his liability in the Socci action because those policies cover accidents, not intentional acts, and do not cover claims for emotional distress. The plaintiffs further contended that any coverage would be barred under policy exclusions for intentional acts, wilful violations of law, business pursuits, workers' compensation, and mental abuse. Finally, they contended that indemnification for the punitive damages would contravene public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court framed its decision on the motion in three parts: (1) the\n   effect of the general verdict; (2) the duty to indemnify under the homeowners policy; and (3) the duty to indemnify under the umbrella policy. The court concluded that the general verdict rule\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   precluded the plaintiffs' arguments premised on characterizing the defendant's conduct as exclusively intentional and, therefore, not a covered accidental occurrence. The court reasoned that the absence of jury interrogatories created an ambiguity as to the counts on which the verdict rested, and that because the\n   <em>\n    plaintiffs\n   </em>\n   had failed to afford themselves of the opportunity to seek such interrogatories, the verdict must be construed to rest on both intentional and negligent conduct as alleged in the complaint. The court did not, at this stage, explain\n   how the plaintiffs could have availed themselves of this opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With regard to the duty to indemnify, the court concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to summary judgment under the homeowners policy, but were not entitled to judgment under the broader umbrella policy. Specifically, the court pointed to the homeowners policy coverage limited to \"bodily injury,\" which was defined to exclude emotional distress unless caused by a physical injury, and the lack of evidence in the Socci action establishing such physical injury. Although the umbrella policy contained a similar definition for bodily injury, that policy also covered \"personal injury,\" a term defined by reference to specified injuries/acts, including \"false imprisonment.\" In light of that express coverage, the trial court concluded that many of the policy exclusions on which the plaintiffs relied were inapplicable. The court also concluded that the requisite facts to support other exclusions on which the plaintiffs relied were not supported by evidence or jury interrogatories in the Socci action. The court rejected the plaintiffs' public policy argument regarding the punitive damages. Accordingly, it granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the trial court clarified that its decision on the motion for summary judgment was not a final judgment for purposes of appeal, a dispute arose over the scope of evidence, and, hence, discovery, that would be permitted in the declaratory judgment trial. In a written decision addressing that dispute, the trial court cast the parties' positions as polar opposites, with the plaintiffs contending that they were entitled to a trial de novo regarding the issue of indemnification, unfettered as to what evidence may be proffered on that issue, and the defendant contending that the trial must be limited to the evidence presented in the Socci action. Ultimately the court concluded that \"[i]t was [the plaintiffs'] choice\n   in the [Socci] action to not actively pursue in greater detail the issues affecting the exclusions in the policy,\" that the plaintiffs could have submitted interrogatories to the jury to determine the basis of its decision, and that they should not be permitted to have a second bite at the apple. The court suggested that the plaintiffs could have requested interrogatories through defense counsel, with whom they were in close contact, or through their intervention as a party. Accordingly, it denied the plaintiffs'\n   request to permit unrestricted evidence. However, a week before the trial commenced, the court permitted the plaintiffs to obtain certain limited discovery related to the workers' compensation exclusion, and they were able to depose the defendant on that matter. At the conclusion of that deposition, the plaintiffs stated for the record that the trial court had precluded discovery on matters other than those on which they questioned the defendant that the plaintiffs believed were relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thereafter, the declaratory judgment trial proceeded with only documentary evidence submitted to the court, largely originating from the Socci action, except as to certain matters related to workers' compensation. Following argument, the court issued a decision declaring that the plaintiffs were obligated to indemnify the defendant for his liability in the Socci action. In setting forth the procedural history of the case, the court cast its earlier ruling on the scope of discovery as precluding new evidence relating to the basis of liability in the Socci action, and not that relating to the issue of coverage under the policy. In analyzing the substantive issue, the court largely followed its prior reasoning when denying the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, it rendered judgment for the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment to the Appellate Court. They challenged the trial court's limitations on discovery, the scope of the declaratory judgment\n   trial, the court's determinations regarding the policy exclusions, except the intentional acts and wilful violation of law exclusions, and its rejection of the public policy argument. The Appellate Court determined that the trial court improperly had concluded that the business pursuits exclusion of the policy did not apply. Therefore, it reversed the trial court's judgment on that basis without reaching the other issues raised by the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mutual Ins.

Consistent with our rules of construction, we construed this ambiguity in favor of the insured to provide coverage for the intentional acts specified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See id., at 330-31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=714%20A.2d%201230\">\n    714 A.2d 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Our prior construction of those provisions has particular significance to the present case. As the trial court emphasized in its decision on the second motion for summary judgment regarding indemnification, \"the provision within the umbrella policy that includes coverage for false imprisonment is crucial in the determination of whether the policy provides coverage\n   for the plaintiffs' verdict entered in the underlying Socci [action].\" The trial court identified the injury of false imprisonment, and no other, as covered under the policy at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   With that focus in mind, we turn to the certified issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   BUSINESS PURSUITS EXCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The defendant contends that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the false imprisonment of Socci was \"[a]n occurrence arising out of the business pursuits ... of an insured.\" As we explain subsequently in this opinion, although we agree with the defendant that the Appellate Court's analysis was flawed, we conclude that the trial court's analysis also was flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The trial court made no separate factual findings with regard to this exclusion. However, its analysis referred to critical testimony in the Socci action regarding certain\n   statements the defendant purportedly made to Socci after Kotulsky left as to reasons why they should not call the police. The defendant purportedly cited his long, close friendship with Kotulsky and the ruinous effect on his business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The trial court framed its analysis in terms of two related issues. First, it noted that \"the real issue is whether the actions of [the defendant] in response to the robbery arose out of the business pursuits for the Pasiak Construction business\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   [arose] as the defendant contends because he was trying to protect a lifelong friend.\" (Emphasis added.) Second, it considered whether the defendant's actions evidenced the continuity and profit motive necessary under the business pursuits test. The court rejected the plaintiffs' reliance on Socci's testimony indicating that the defendant had claimed (at the time of the incident) that the incident would ruin his business, reasoning that this argument ignored the testimony reflecting Kotulsky's friendship with the defendant, and the lack of proof of any impact on the defendant's business had the robbery succeeded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Appellate Court determined that the trial court's analysis reflected a misapplication of the business pursuits exclusion.\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mutual Ins.

He also contends that the Appellate Court improperly found facts insofar as it concluded that Socci's acquiescence in obeying the defendant's commands was a function of their employer-employee relationship. He claims that the trial court properly focused on whether his actions met the continuity and profit motive test for a business pursuit articulated by this court.

A supporting factor cited in harassment cases in which the exclusion applied was that the conduct directly impacted the employee's employment.

The trial court's continuity and profit motive test conflated the test for determining whether a business pursuit exists with the one for determining whether the act giving rise to the injury arose out of such a pursuit. It appears to have compounded that misstep in two ways. First, the court focused on Kotulsky's actions as they may have related to the actual profitability of the defendant's business, rather than considering the defendant's\n   purported statements to, and actions toward, Socci as they may have related to his business and/or the employment relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second,\n   the court's analysis indicated that an act could satisfy the exclusion only if it was exclusively in furtherance of the business pursuit; consequently, any personal motive for that act would negate application of the exclusion. However, equating \"arising out of\" with exclusively \"in furtherance of\" would render the former clearly more restrictive than the descriptive terms used in\n   <em>\n    Hogle\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, such an interpretation would render most tortious conduct (even accidental) outside the scope of the business pursuits exclusion, as such conduct rarely actually furthers a business purpose. Moreover, an employer's misuse of the employer-employee relationship to accomplish an end, whether partially or wholly motivated by personal reasons, could satisfy the expansive definition in\n   <em>\n    Hogle\n   </em>\n   of \"arising out of.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the trial court's approach was too restrictive, the Appellate Court's was too expansive. The Appellate Court's \"but for\" approach relied too heavily on Socci's employment status and the work based location at which she sustained the injury. We agree with the Appellate Court that the requisite standard could be met if, in addition to these facts, the false imprisonment was a function of, or facilitated by, the employer-employee relationship. See\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pasiak\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20Conn.%20App.%2086\">\n    161 Conn.

However, this is a factual finding on which the trial court expressed no view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Indeed, we cannot say on the basis of the limited facts found by the trial court or the evidentiary record whether the business pursuits exclusion applies as a matter of law. There was additional evidence in the Socci action relating to the matter raised by the Appellate Court on which the trial court made no findings, which that court may consider on remand. See footnote 12 of this opinion. We express no view as to whether the court must credit this evidence or the weight that such evidence should be given if the court elects to credit it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   ALTERNATIVE GROUNDS FOR AFFIRMANCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Because our conclusion entitles the plaintiffs only to reconsideration of whether the business pursuits exclusion bars indemnification, not judgment in their favor, we consider the plaintiffs' alternative grounds for affirming in whole or in part the Appellate Court's judgment directing the trial court to enter such a judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We disagree that any of these grounds requires a directed judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Workers' Compensation Exclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The plaintiffs contend that indemnification is precluded under the umbrella policy's exclusion for \"[a]ny insured's obligation, including benefits required to be paid under ... workers' compensation ... [or] any similar law.\" They contend that the trial court improperly equated this issue with the question of whether the defendant had injured Socci in furtherance of his business pursuit, when the proper focus should have been on whether the Workers' Compensation Act; General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. ; applied to Socci. The plaintiffs claim that the act applied because (1) it was uncontroverted that Socci was an employee of the construction company and was injured at work, and (2) Socci did not fall under an exclusion to employees covered under the act, as the defendant contended. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (9) (B) (\" 'Employee' shall not be construed to include ... (iv) [a]ny person engaged in any type of service in or about a private dwelling provided he is not regularly employed by the owner or occupier over twenty-six hours per week\"). Even if we accept both of these contentions, the plaintiffs have failed to prove that this exclusion applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The plaintiffs assume that this exclusion is satisfied if the insured\n   <em>\n    would have been obligated\n   </em>\n   under the act to pay workers' compensation benefits\n   <em>\n    had a claim for such benefits been made\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   They have not established, however, that any such obligation exists in the present case. By their own admission, the construction company was Socci's employer, a fact evidenced by the\n   paychecks issued to Socci by the construction company that were admitted into evidence at the declaratory judgment trial. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (10) (defining employer to include limited liability corporation). As such, the defendant, the insured, presumably would not personally incur any obligation to pay a compensable workers' compensation claim had Socci timely filed a notice of claim. Even if the defendant could be deemed legally obligated for the workers' compensation obligations of the construction company, an argument the plaintiffs have not made; cf.\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Flexo Converters U.S.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%2052\">\n    309 Conn. 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20A.3d%201162\">\n    68 A.3d 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (discussing when high ranking person may be deemed alter ego of corporation); the plaintiffs have proffered no authority to establish that Socci's injuries would have been compensable under the act. In order for Socci's emotional distress injuries to have been compensable, they would have had to have been caused by physical injury or occupational disease. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii). The trial court found to the contrary. See footnote 9 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Abuse Exclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The plaintiffs also claim that indemnification is barred under the umbrella policy exclusion for \"personal injury resulting from acts or omissions relating directly or indirectly to ... physical or mental abuse ....\" They contend that the defendant's conduct and its effect on Socci satisfied the common meaning of mental abuse, pointing to the construction of abuse under a similar policy exclusion in\n   <em>\n    Safeco Ins. Co. of America\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vecsey\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 3:08cv833 (JBA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203925126\">\n    2010 WL 3925126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *9-10 (D.

The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut assumed that a permanent eye injury sustained by the insured's wife when her eye had been struck by a carrot thrown by the insured, after he had yelled and cursed at her, was a covered occurrence, but concluded that it fell under the abuse exclusion. Id., at *3-4, *7. After consulting dictionaries, the court concluded that abuse means the improper use or maltreatment of another \"that deviates from a baseline societal understanding of what is appropriate conduct,\" that the act need not be motivated by a subjective expectation that bodily injury will occur, and that there need not be a pattern of conduct.

Accordingly, in the absence of a public policy reflected in our laws against providing such coverage, we conclude that, under the facts of the present case, the plaintiffs are bound to keep the bargain they struck, which includes\n   coverage for common-law punitive damages for false imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   SCOPE OF DISCOVERY AND TRIAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, we turn to the plaintiffs' claim that the trial court improperly deprived them of a full and independent hearing on all of the issues relevant to coverage of the defendant's liability. Specifically, they contend that the trial court improperly determined that they were bound by the general verdict in the Socci action and limited to the evidence adduced in that case because, in the trial court's view, the plaintiffs had an opportunity in that action (1) to intervene to submit interrogatories to ascertain the basis of the jury's verdict, and (2) to develop a factual record relating to the policy exclusions. The plaintiffs make the related claims that, as a result of these improper determinations, the trial court improperly denied them the opportunity to develop their coverage defenses in discovery and at trial and then improperly construed evidentiary gaps against them. The plaintiffs acknowledge that the trial court did not preclude all discovery, but contend that the belated\n   and limited basis on which discovery was permitted was too little, too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We observe that the record is not a model of clarity or consistency regarding either the plaintiffs' claims or the trial court's rulings relating to them. However, our conclusions in the preceding sections of this opinion make it unnecessary to resolve some of the thornier questions raised by the plaintiffs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as the defendant's\n   responsive procedural arguments. We have concluded that, with the possible exception of the business pursuits exclusion, none of the exclusions raised on appeal negates the plaintiffs' duty to indemnify the defendant for liability incurred as a result of Socci's false imprisonment, an act that both parties agree the evidence and verdict support. Our conclusions rest solely on legal grounds, not on deficiencies in the evidence. The business pursuits exclusion remains the only policy exclusion on which a factual basis could exist to negate the plaintiffs' indemnification obligation. Accordingly, the sole issue remaining is the proper procedure on remand on this issue. We conclude that the plaintiffs are entitled to litigate the business pursuits issue without being limited to the evidentiary record in the Socci action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   We begin with the question of what coverage matters may be litigated by an insurer following judgment against its insured, and then turn to the question of\n   what evidence may be used to adjudicate such matters. The general rule regarding the effect of a judgment against an insured on an insurer who has an independent duty to defend its insured is set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments. It provides: \"(1) When an indemnitor has an obligation to indemnify an indemnitee (such as an insured) against liability to third persons and also to provide the indemnitee with a defense of actions involving claims that might be within the scope of the indemnity obligation, and an action is brought against the indemnitee involving such a claim and the indemnitor\n   is given reasonable notice of the action and an opportunity to assume its defense, a judgment for the injured person has the following effects on the indemnitor in a subsequent action by the indemnitee for indemnification:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \"(a) The indemnitor is estopped from disputing the existence and extent of the indemnitee's liability to the injured person; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \"(b) The indemnitor is precluded from relitigating\n   <em>\n    those issues determined in the action against the indemnitee as to which there was no conflict of interest between the indemnitor and the indemnitee\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   \"(2) A 'conflict of interest' for purposes of this Section exists when the injured person's claim against the indemnitee is such that it could be sustained on different grounds, one of which is within the indemnitor's obligation to indemnify and another of which is not.\" (Emphasis added.) 2 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 58 (1982).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   A leading treatise further elaborates on the circumstances under which an insurer will not be collaterally estopped from relitigating issues relating to coverage in a subsequent declaratory judgment action. One such circumstance occurs \"[w]hen, because of a conflict of interest, the insurer hires an independent counsel, who\n   does not also represent the company's interests, to defend the insured ....\" (Footnote omitted.) 1 A. Windt, Insurance Claims &amp; Disputes: Representation of Insurance Companies and Insureds (6th Ed. 2013) \u00a7 6:22, p. 6-266.

Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Devine Brothers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. CV-00-0374721,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2021958391\">\n    2003 WL 21958391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *5 (Conn. Super. July 30, 2003) (citing cases); see also 1 A. Windt, supra, \u00a7 4:22, p. 4-214 and \u00a7 6:27, p. 6-291 (independent counsel hired by insurer should not be asked to comment on coverage issues, let alone be made aware of such issues). Consequently, it has been held that defense counsel hired by an insurer could not request special interrogatories or special verdicts concerning coverage issues because of counsel's exclusive duty to represent the insured. See\n   <em>\n    Universal Underwriters Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    East Central Alabama Ford-Mercury, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7508528,7508693\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/574/716/\">\n    574 So.2d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 723 (Ala. 1990). Second, facts pertaining to insurance coverage may have no relevance to the issues of liability and damages that the trier of fact must decide in the underlying action. See\n   <em>\n    Chenkus\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dickson\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 282007,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1990%20WL%20283216\">\n    1990 WL 283216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1 (Conn. Super. September 7, 1990) (noting that, because case pertains to negligent and intentional assault, it had nothing to do with whether those acts are covered under contract of insurance). A related third reason is that courts must exercise care not to allow evidence that would indicate that the defendant tortfeasor is insured against liability, as the availability of insurance is generally inadmissible due to its potential to prejudice the trier of fact. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-10 and commentary;\n   <em>\n    Cromer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sefton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11043918\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/471/700/#p704\">\n    471 N.E.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704 (Ind. App. 1984) (\"Clearly the policy of the law is to keep the issue of insurance out of personal injury litigation. ... To permit intervention by the insurer to litigate coverage in the principal tort case against its insured would distract the trier and literally force the plaintiff to become embroiled in a matter in which she does not yet have an interest.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Stated broadly then, an insurer may litigate coverage issues previously litigated on which it had a conflict of interest with its insured or coverage issues on which material facts were not litigated and necessary to the\n   underlying judgment. The next question is what evidence may be considered to decide such issues.\n   When the coverage issue previously was litigated, one treatise argues that the issue should be resolved only by reference to the record in the underlying case.

There was no privity between the plaintiffs and the defendant as to that issue because they did not share an interest in proving that the defendant's false imprisonment of Socci arose out of his business pursuits. Indeed, it was in the interest of both the defendant and Socci to minimize or avoid the presentation of facts that could have established a connection between the defendant's interests as the owner of his construction company and the wrongful actions he was alleged to have undertaken. More fundamentally, whether that causal connection existed was neither actually litigated nor necessarily determined. Socci's claims were in no way dependent on proving that the defendant's wrongful acts arose out of his business pursuits. The fact that some evidence relevant\n   to this issue was presented in the Socci action is immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   It also is of no consequence that the plaintiffs did not seek permission to intervene in the Socci action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Even if an unexercised right to intervene could be relevant; but see\n   <em>\n    Mount Vernon Fire Ins.

Instead, I would conclude that the trial court properly limited the scope of discovery and properly limited the scope of the declaratory judgment trial, and that, on the basis of the record in the present case, the trial court properly determined that the business pursuits exclusion set forth in the umbrella policy does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   APPLICABILITY OF BUSINESS PURSUITS EXCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   On appeal to this court, the defendant Jeffrey S.

I agree.\n   I agree with the standard of review explained by the majority, but emphasize that insurance policy exclusions should be read narrowly.

It does not, however, answer the question of whether the conduct from which the injury arose in the present case was connected to a business pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   There are, of course, obvious cases in which the injury occurs as a result of risk created by acts or omissions in the course of performing employment duties.

On the morning of May 9, 2006, Kotulsky's attempted robbery of the defendant's home while Socci was present in the home set off a series of actions that are wholly separate from the business pursuits of the defendant. The defendant's actions, which a jury found injured Socci, were those that occurred after the defendant arrived home from his morning routine. The record, as found by the trial court, demonstrates that these actions were not in furtherance of a business interest of the defendant; rather, his motivation was purely personal-to protect Kotulsky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The allegations of the complaint in the underlying tort action demonstrate that the \"occurrence\" that forms the basis of Socci's claims is the act of false imprisonment. Socci testified that Kotulsky barged in to the defendant's home while the defendant was not home, but Socci was there working. The defendant later walked in and was confronted by Kotulsky. Socci testified that she \"heard Kotulsky say, 'I loved you. How could you do that? I loved you. I loved her.' ... I realized that this was about a girl. They were fighting over a girl.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The sole focus of Socci's claim was the events that occurred after Kotulsky's attempted robbery had ended. Socci sought damages for the distress that she suffered due to the defendant's actions, not Kotulsky's attempted robbery. In finding in favor of Socci on her claim, the jury held the defendant liable for his own actions after returning home. Those actions formed the basis for the damage award. Any activities which preceded the defendant returning home, including interactions between Socci and Kotulsky, were not part of the plaintiffs' claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   It is evident from the record that the defendant's goal after Kotulsky's attempted robbery was to shield Kotulsky from the consequences of his actions by preventing\n   Socci from calling the police. It was the defendant's perfervid desire to\n   protect his friend. Socci testified that the defendant explained that they \"couldn't call the police [because] they had been friends for years and years since high school [and] that Pasiak was ... godfather to [Kotulsky's] children ....\" While still at the defendant's house, the defendant pulled pictures of Kotulsky off of the walls to show Socci how close the two were to \"make [her] understand\" why she could not call the police. When asked at trial whether the defendant was protecting her, Socci stated that Pasiak was \"protecting his friend.\" For his part, the defendant said in a statement to the police that the decision whether to inform the police \"was a hard decision because of [his] relationship with [Kotulsky].\" Additionally, very soon after the police were finally notified, the defendant, rather than follow the police's instructions to help facilitate Kotulsky's arrest, informed Kotulsky that the police were notified and \"it's over.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The plaintiffs claim, and the majority appears to agree, that it was clearly erroneous to conclude that the defendant's actions were not, at least in part, motivated by business interests. The record evidence supporting the theory that concern for the reputation of the business animated the defendant's conduct is equivocal at best. To be sure, Socci testified that the defendant made some statements expressing concern that the events of that day could somehow result in harm to his business. Nevertheless, the trial court's conclusion was not clearly erroneous given that substantial, detailed evidence supported the finding that the defendant desired to protect his friend. There was no evidence to connect the defendant's statements about his business to his actions preventing Socci from leaving his home. While Socci testified that she understood the defendant to be protecting his friend, she did not testify\n   that he was protecting his enterprise. Additionally, given the lengths the defendant had gone to protect his friend, it would not be unreasonable to infer that the defendant's expressions of concern for his business were merely attempts to persuade Socci to not call the police by suggesting there would be effects beyond merely criminal consequences for Kotulsky-consequences Socci almost certainly would welcome. Accordingly, I reject the plaintiffs' claim that the trial court's finding regarding the defendant's motivation for preventing Socci from leaving was clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Appellate Court and the majority also rely upon the flawed premise that Socci's acquiescence with the defendant's demands was, to some extent, a function of the employee-employer relationship. This is unsupported by the record. Socci testified that she did no additional work that day and testified that she would never be coming back to work. All the while, the defendant repeatedly stated that Socci could not leave because he felt she would call the police. Socci testified that she repeatedly asked the defendant if she could leave and assured him \"I just want to be alive, I am not going to tell anyone,\" to which he replied, \"you're not going anywhere until I know you're not going to run out of here freaking out telling everybody.\" She emphasized that the defendant was adamant about it. By not assuring Socci of her personal safety were she to depart or call the police, he preserved Socci's apprehension that Kotulsky could still cause physical harm to her or her family. Indeed, Socci testified to her apprehension of consequences for disobeying the defendant, stating that she feared if she left without permission \"it was like if I had a bomb strapped around my chest and [the defendant] had the button and [if] I ran, he could still press the button. He was using [Kotulsky]. He could completely contact [Kotulsky] at any time: She's run. And it was an instant kill for me and my family. I couldn't\n   do that. That would be\n   insane.\" In Socci's mind, the prudent course of action was to simply acquiesce to the defendant. This was a function of a fear based relationship, not an employment relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Appellate Court held, and the plaintiffs assert on appeal to this court, that \"the sine qua non of the defendant's tortious conduct was ... Socci's presence at his business office fulfilling her responsibilities as his employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pasiak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20Conn.%20App.%2086\">\n    161 Conn.

Specifically, the plaintiffs assert that Socci was only present at the defendant's home because she worked for his company and that, but for her employment by the defendant's company, she would never have been exposed to Kotulsky or to the defendant's actions thereafter. I disagree. As discussed previously herein, the mere fact alone that an injury occurred in the workplace is insufficient to trigger the business pursuits exclusion. The fact that Socci was working at some point before the defendant committed the tortious actions at issue has nothing to do with the defendant's conduct. Indeed, Socci would have suffered this injury whether she was an employee of the business or not. This was not an\n   internal \"workplace altercation\" between the defendant and Socci. Indeed, \"if the injury arises out of an independent act not performed for employment purposes, the business pursuits exclusion may not apply under those circumstances.\" 9A S. Plitt et al., Couch on Insurance (3d Ed. Rev. 2015) \u00a7 128:17, pp. 128-54 through 128-55. In this circumstance, the actions of the defendant must be considered as independent acts because, as the trial court found, the defendant's actions limiting Socci's ability to leave were motivated by his desire to protect Kotulsky, and not motivated by any business or employment purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The cause-in-fact, or \"but for\" cause, standard of causation applied by the Appellate Court stretches the meaning of \"arising out of\" too far. It is, of course, true that had Socci not been an employee of the defendant, she would not have been present when Kotulsky attempted to rob the defendant's home. Such a broad standard of causation was, however, rejected in\n   <em>\n    Misiti, LLC\n   </em>\n   . In that case, but for the tavern patron's use of the tavern that evening, she would not have been injured when she detoured off the path to the parking lot, but the injury did not flow from, or have its origins in, her patronage of the tavern. See\n   <em>\n    Misiti, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Travelers Property Casualty Co. of America\n   </em>\n   , supra, 308 Conn. at 159-60,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%20485\">\n    61 A.3d 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Edelman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pacific Employers Ins.

Likewise, in the present case, Socci would not have been injured but for being in the employ of the defendant, but the injury did\n   not flow from, or have its origin in, her employment. Rather, her injury flowed from the defendant's decision to protect Kotulsky by preventing her, as a victim of an attempted armed robbery, from calling the police.\n   In sum, I disagree with the Appellate Court's conclusion that the plaintiffs carried their burden in proving the business pursuits exclusion in the present case. Rather, I would agree with the majority that the Appellate Court used the wrong standard. I disagree, however, with the majority that the trial court used the wrong standard. In my view, the trial court used the correct standard as established by our case law. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   RIGHT TO A FULL HEARING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The plaintiffs claim, as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court, that the trial court incorrectly refused to conduct a full evidentiary hearing on all issues relevant to the coverage claims. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court narrowly defined the issues it would consider, prohibited the plaintiffs from calling witnesses at trial, and gave preclusive effect to the findings in the underlying Socci action and, thereby, violated the plaintiffs' due process rights. The plaintiffs claim that, because they were denied a basic right to be heard, they are entitled to de novo review. They argue that because the plaintiffs were \"not a party to the Socci action, nor in privity with any party to that action, [they] could not obtain a full and fair hearing on the coverage claims in the [declaratory judgment] action without the freedom to fully develop the record and obtain the court's independent review.\" Essentially, the majority agrees with this position and remands the case for a full trial on the business pursuits exclusion. I disagree and would conclude that the trial court properly defined the scope of the trial in this declaratory judgment action. Essentially, the claim is no different than any other ruling by\n   a trial judge concerning the admissibility of evidence.

On July 9, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a memorandum of law regarding the scope of the declaratory judgment trial. The plaintiffs claimed that they were \"entitled to ... de novo fact finding\" in the present case. The defendant claimed that the trial was to be based \"solely and completely on the facts presented\" in the underlying civil trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   On August 9, 2012, the trial court denied the plaintiffs' request for a trial de novo. The trial court framed the matter as one of collateral estoppel and concluded that the plaintiffs \"cannot now ask the court to relitigate what has already been fully and fairly litigated.\" The trial court noted that the plaintiffs did not convey to the court precisely what evidence it sought to present to the court that had not already been presented in the Socci action. The trial court criticized the \"complacency\" of the plaintiffs for, in the underlying action, not \"actively [pursuing] in greater detail the issues affecting the exclusions in the [umbrella] policy.\" The trial court noted that issues regarding intentional acts, wilful violation of the law, and workers' compensation were properly raised and necessarily determined in the underlying action \"as not applicable to negate liability.\" The trial court concluded that it would deny the\n   plaintiffs' request \"for a de novo hearing to permit unrestricted testimony and evidence of the issues [already] litigated in the underlying trial ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The trial was held on August 30, 2012. On the day of the trial, the plaintiffs filed a \"trial brief\" with the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In their brief, the plaintiffs requested findings of fact and conclusions of law on seven listed issues. The issues listed can be separated into two categories. First, the plaintiffs sought an allocation of liability found on the general verdict by the jury in the underlying action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the plaintiffs sought findings on the applicability of certain enumerated exclusions. The trial court indicated to plaintiffs' counsel that it would allow the presentation of evidence and testimony and consider any objection in turn. The plaintiffs submitted a number of exhibits, including the complaint, transcript, jury charge, and verdict form of the Socci action, the defendant's pleas of nolo contendere to certain criminal charges, limited deposition testimony from the Socci action, certain expert testimony, and response to a request for production of documents regarding Socci's employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   After the submission of exhibits, the plaintiffs' counsel attempted to call Socci as a witness to testify. Upon inquiry by the trial court, counsel for the plaintiffs explained that he intended for Socci to testify to the issues enumerated in the brief so that the court could make a finding as to whether the defendant engaged\n   in intentional conduct to cause emotional distress or false imprisonment and a finding on negligence. Counsel for the defendant objected and sought clarification as to what additional evidence the plaintiffs sought from Socci that was not already elicited in the underlying trial. Counsel for the plaintiffs responded that he wanted the court to assess the credibility of Socci's testimony. The court rejected this proffer, reasoning that the jury made that determination in the underlying action. The court emphasized that the general verdict in the underlying action meant that there was a finding in favor of Socci on every issue. The court clarified that the plaintiffs had been restricted to presenting evidence on issues that were in addition to those raised in the underlying action, i.e., issues pertaining to exclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Moving to exclusion issues, the counsel for the defendant demanded to know precisely what additional testimony the plaintiffs sought from Socci. Other than asking Socci questions that would elicit legal conclusions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   counsel for the plaintiffs indicated\n   that he would not elicit any additional testimony not already presented in the underlying action with respect to the business pursuits exclusion. Socci did not testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel for the plaintiffs did not proffer any other testimony as to any of the other exclusions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   After the trial, the parties submitted posttrial memoranda. In their brief, the plaintiffs \"incorporated by reference\" arguments made in their motion for summary judgment. In detail, the plaintiffs raised coverage issues\n   pertaining only to the applicability of exclusions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs did not make any argument as to the allocation of liability in their posttrial brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court emphasized that it gave the plaintiffs the opportunity to present evidence on coverage issues. Although the plaintiffs did not address the issue in their posttrial brief, the trial court discussed the allocation of liability and determined that the \"jury verdict consist[ed] of a finding of personal injury for negligent as well as intentional acts, all of which may be subject to indemnification.\" In other words, the court concluded that the defendant's actions that caused damages to Socci were an \"occurrence\" within the meaning of the umbrella policy. As previously discussed herein, the court further determined that none of the exclusions asserted by the plaintiffs applied to the defendant's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Against this procedural backdrop, I turn to whether the plaintiffs were entitled to a trial de novo on the coverage issue in this declaratory judgment action. The trial court correctly, albeit for the wrong reasons, concluded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to retry the underlying case in the present declaratory judgment trial. The trial court correctly defined the scope of the presentation of evidence in the trial. Contrary to the plaintiffs' claim, they had a fair opportunity to present their case with respect to the disputed coverage issues. While I agree with the majority on the scope of the new hearing and the standard for such cases, I disagree, respectfully, that a new hearing is necessary in the present case. The plaintiffs, as determined by the trial court, were allowed to present evidence on the exclusion issues, however, they never formally indicated to\n   the trial court what evidence they intended to present. In my view, the plaintiffs are now being given a \"second bite at the apple\" and their position constitutes an ambuscade of the trial court. Unfortunately, through its ruling, the majority now condones the plaintiffs' actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The issue of whether the plaintiffs have a duty to indemnify is a contractual one. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    New London County Mutual Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nantes\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174572\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/737/#p759\">\n    303 Conn. at 748-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20A.3d%20224\">\n    36 A.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the umbrella policy, the plaintiffs agreed to \"pay for damages an insured is legally obligated to pay due to an occurrence\" subject to certain exclusions. There is no doubt that the defendant in the present case owes damages that he is legally obligated to pay to Socci. The issue for the trial court was whether and to what extent the damages were due to an occurrence, and, if so, whether and to what extent coverage was precluded by a relevant exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   With respect to the question of whether the damages the defendant caused Socci were due to an occurrence as defined by the terms of the umbrella policy, the plaintiffs were, in essence, seeking an allocation of liability among the counts in the complaint in the underlying tort action to determine to what extent the defendant's liability is covered by the umbrella policy. As the trial court noted in its memorandum of decision, the general verdict in the underlying action greatly adds to the difficulty in allocating liability. Indeed other courts have observed the difficulty of allocating liability in cases where the liability is determined by general verdict. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Automax Hyundai South, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zurich American Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057807\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/798/#p809\">\n    720 F.3d 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 809 (10th Cir. 2013) (noting an \"epistemological barrier to determining the jury's grounds for judgment\");\n   <em>\n    Board of County Supervisors\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Scottish &amp; York Ins.

Nevertheless, courts are skeptical about retrying the underlying case. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    TranSched Systems Ltd.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Federal Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193475\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/523/#p534\">\n    67 F.Supp.3d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534 (D.R.I. 2014) (describing relitigating the underlying tort action as \"uneconomical\" and ordering mediation). Indeed, the plaintiffs have not cited a single case that supports the contention that in circumstances such as the present case the insurer is entitled to retry the underlying case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   One treatise has specifically rejected retrial on the issue of liability. 1 A. Windt, Insurance Claims &amp; Disputes: Representation of Insurance Companies and Insureds, \u00a7 6:26, pp. 6-280 through 6-282 (6th Ed. 2013). \"When the dispute is over which causes of action or allegations were found to be meritorious, only one question should be addressed: the factual and legal grounds on which the prior judgment was entered.

Indeed, these principles are not inconsistent with Connecticut law. \"[T]he duty to indemnify depends upon the facts established at trial and the theory under which judgment is actually entered in the case.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    DaCruz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458359\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/268/675/#p688\">\n    268 Conn. 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=846%20A.2d%20849\">\n    846 A.2d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) ; see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=846%20A.2d%20849\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the duty to indemnify arises only if the evidence adduced\n   at trial establishes that the conduct\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   was covered by the policy\" [emphasis in original] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Counsel for the plaintiffs' own representation to the trial court as to the nature and purpose of Socci's anticipated testimony in the trial in the present case supports my conclusion that permitting relitigation on the issue of liability is unwarranted. Counsel for the plaintiffs sought to present Socci's testimony initially on the issue of liability. When pressed, the counsel for the plaintiffs could not articulate precisely what testimony he sought to present that had not already been presented in the underlying trial. Rather, the plaintiffs' counsel stated that it sought \"the court's determination as to credibility and the weight to be given the testimony ....\" To present Socci or other witnesses to testify a second time to the very issues at the\n   heart of the underlying tort action would simply be an exercise in presenting cumulative evidence not needed for resolution of the issue of whether, or to what extent, damages were caused by an occurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Contrary to the reasoning of the trial court, the rationale for limiting the scope of trial is not grounded in the doctrine of collateral estoppel. \"The common-law doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, embodies a judicial policy in favor of judicial economy, the stability of former judgments and finality. ... Collateral estoppel ... prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was actually litigated and necessarily determined in a prior action between the same parties [or those in privity with them] upon a different claim. ... For an issue to be subject to collateral estoppel, it must have been fully and fairly litigated in the first action. It also must have been actually decided and the decision must have been necessary to the judgment.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Wilcox\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Webster Ins., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768228\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/206/#p223\">\n    294 Conn. 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=982%20A.2d%201053\">\n    982 A.2d 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Collateral estoppel does not apply to the plaintiffs in this case for two reasons. First, the plaintiffs in the present case were not in privity with the defendant in the underlying tort action. Second, because the general verdict in that case renders the basis of the jury's determination unclear, it cannot be said that the relevant factual issues were necessarily determined and, therefore, such issues cannot have preclusive effect in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The principal inquiry is whether the plaintiffs were in privity with the defendant in the underlying action. \"Privity is a difficult concept to define precisely. ... There is no prevailing definition of privity to be followed automatically in every case. It is not a matter of form or rigid labels; rather it is a matter of substance. In determining whether privity exists, we employ an analysis that focuses on the functional relationships of the parties. Privity is not established by the mere fact that persons may be interested in the same question or in proving or disproving the same set of facts. Rather, it is, in essence, a shorthand statement for the principle that collateral estoppel should be applied only when there exists such an identification in interest of one person with another as to represent the same legal rights so as to justify preclusion.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Mazziotti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

First, although this court has not decided the issue until today, there is broad consensus in our Superior Court and other jurisdictions that an insurer cannot intervene as of right for any purpose because their interest was contingent until a verdict had been rendered for a covered claim. See\n   <em>\n    Seaco Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Devine Bros., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. CV-00-0374721-S (July 30, 2003) (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20235\">\n    35 Conn.

I agree with these cases.

Even if the decision not to request special interrogatories could somehow be imputed to the insurer in these circumstances, such a decision does not convert the general verdict into a sword applied against the insurer.

The record in the underlying tort action likely will not adequately speak to exclusion issues. In the present case, the plaintiffs did indeed submit additional evidence regarding the exclusions. Again, the trial court provided counsel for the plaintiffs' an opportunity to explain what additional testimony he intended to present in support of their claims that coverage was excluded. Counsel for the plaintiffs did not seek to present any other oral testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   All in all, the trial court gave the plaintiffs a fair hearing in this declaratory judgment action. It properly weighed the burden on judicial resources, and the parties, in declining to permit the plaintiffs to present evidence already submitted in the underlying action. The trial court permitted\n   the plaintiffs to present new or additional evidence related to issues not relevant in the underlying tort action. Accordingly, I would conclude that the trial correct correctly established the scope of the trial in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   PLAINTIFFS' OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP THEIR CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The plaintiffs claim, as an additional ground for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court, that they\n   were denied the opportunity to develop their case, in particular their coverage defenses, through both discovery and trial evidence. Because this ground appears to be very similar to the previous issue, although it may encompass rulings on discovery, I again review it under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dehaney\n   </em>\n   , supra, 261 Conn. at 354-55,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=803%20A.2d%20267\">\n    803 A.2d 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that if permitted to conduct appropriate discovery, they might have established that the defendant's motivations in detaining and threatening Socci were business related. Similarly, they might have learned whether Socci's hours were ultimately to be increased beyond the twenty-six hour threshold, where workers' compensation insurance is required, even for a domestic employee. Instead, the plaintiffs assert they were left with a record that did not fully address all of the coverage issues and included a general verdict. As a result, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court's \"limiting decisions were inherently unfair to [them], and fundamentally against the interests of justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   While the plaintiffs assert that they were denied \"virtually every form of discovery it sought,\" they never identify a discovery request or ruling with specificity. They claim that they were not allowed to depose \"key witnesses\" such as the defendant and Socci. The plaintiffs deposed the defendant on the eve of trial on issues regarding his business, workers' compensation, and Socci's employment. Counsel for Socci sought a protective order and the plaintiffs failed to explain to the court why it needed further information when it had her trial testimony. Thereafter, the court issued a protective order. Nothing prevented the plaintiffs from calling the defendant as a trial witness. There were also lengthy discussions about Socci testifying. Her counsel sought an order of protection due to the fragility of her mental state with respect to these events, but she agreed to a\n   stipulation of facts. The plaintiffs refused to do so. Because the plaintiffs could not articulate why it needed live testimony, the court was unwilling to allow the testimony and issued a protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In view of the plaintiffs' failure to identify a specific ruling of the trial court regarding discovery, other than the testimony of both the defendant and Socci, my review of the record leads me to conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in this matter. There was no ruling that constituted an abuse of discretion. I, therefore, would reject the plaintiffs' claims in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   To summarize, I would conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the business pursuits, abuse, and workers' compensation exclusions did not apply in the present case. Additionally, I believe that the trial court correctly determined that the plaintiffs were not entitled to a de novo fact finding hearing on all issues in the present declaratory judgment action. Finally, I would conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying certain discovery requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the\n   matter to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   I respectfully concur and dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    The complaint in the declaratory judgment action also named three other defendants: Pasiak Construction Services, LLC, the company owned and operated by Pasiak; and Sara Socci and Kraig Socci, the plaintiffs in the underlying tort action. The claims in the present action arise under a policy issued to Pasiak as the sole policyholder, and the Soccis have not participated in this appeal. Accordingly, we refer to Pasiak throughout this opinion as the defendant and to the remaining defendants by name. Because Kraig Socci's only claim is derivative of Sara Socci's claims, any reference to Socci is to Sara Socci.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    The same judge presided over both actions.

However, the ambiguity identified in\n    <em>\n     Imperial Casualty &amp; Indemnity Co.\n    </em>\n    would dictate that the policy coverage extends to both types of acts, not that the exclusion does not apply to either type of act.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    Socci's emotional distress (whether negligently or intentionally inflicted) is not an enumerated personal injury. Nor is it a covered bodily injury because bodily injury is defined to exclude emotional distress unless caused by a physical injury, and the trial court found that the evidence established at most the converse-that Socci's emotional distress may have caused or exacerbated existing physical symptoms. Socci's claim of negligence would not give rise to a covered bodily injury for similar reasons. Although in submissions to the court, the defendant occasionally referred to the claim of negligence as a claim for \"wrongful detention,\" which is a type of personal injury specified in the policy, the trial court characterized wrongful detention as an intentional act. The defendant has provided no analysis regarding the meaning of the wrongful detention provision or its relationship to the exclusions at issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    Cases from other jurisdictions must be critically examined because the business pursuits exclusion is often accompanied by an exception for activities that are ordinarily incident to nonbusiness pursuits.

After the incident, the defendant anxiously and repeatedly expressed a concern to Socci that Kotulsky's actions would \"ruin\" his business, and did so as part of a two-pronged argument as to why she should not report the incident to the police. When she told the defendant that she wanted to leave the office, he told her, \"It's business as usual.\" Although Socci was too distraught to perform any of her usual tasks, she viewed her presence in acquiescence to the defendant's demands as having \"worked all day.\" When he and Socci left the office to meet with Taranto to discuss the incident, the defendant directed Socci to leave her personal effects at the office. The defendant stopped at a construction site on the way to the meeting with Taranto and spoke with two workers there. Socci announced to the defendant that she could no longer work for him, and he relayed that concern to Taranto when the three met. Taranto was instrumental in Socci's hiring and training, and she was intimately involved in the defendant's business affairs. Socci and Taranto knew each other from having previously worked for the same employer for several years, but never had any relationship outside of work.

We note that resolution of these questions is complicated by the conflicting substantive and procedural approaches taken in various jurisdictions, as well as by the varied factual permutations that bear on whether the issue is one on which the insured or the insurer bears the burden of proof. See generally 17 L. Russ &amp; T.
