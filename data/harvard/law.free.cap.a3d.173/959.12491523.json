Lond\u00e9 and Jeffrey Ryan (intervenors) appeal from the judgment of the trial court rendered when the court,\n   <em>\n    Vacchelli, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied their respective motions to intervene that were filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a) (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the intervenors claim that it was improper for the court to deny their motions to intervene on the ground that there was no pending proceeding because (1) the plaintiff and the defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   manipulated the timing of the short calendar proceedings to their detriment, (2) they were denied their vested statutory rights under \u00a7 22a-19 to be heard, and (3) the stipulated judgment at issue was not rendered in compliance with General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (n). Under the somewhat unusual\n   procedural circumstances\n   of this case in which our rules of practice were violated, we agree with the intervenors and, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court denying the motions to intervene and remand the matter for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before we consider the intervenors' claims, we must determine whether this court has jurisdiction to consider the appeal. \"Subject matter jurisdiction is the power of the court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong....

We conclude that there is no jurisdictional infirmity to our resolving the merits of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendants claim that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the appeal because the intervenors failed to file a petition for certification to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ). Section 8-8 (\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) requires that a party obtain certification from the Appellate Court in order to appeal from the judgment of the trial court. There is no requirement, however, that a party obtain certification to appeal from the trial court's judgment in a zoning enforcement action brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the present appeal, the intervenors challenge the court's denial of their motions to intervene in a consolidated proceeding that involved both a \u00a7 8-8 zoning\n   appeal and a \u00a7 8-12 zoning enforcement action. The intervenors may intervene in the zoning enforcement action as a matter of right; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (n) and (p) ; and that right is inextricably intertwined with the zoning appeal. See\n   <em>\n    Santorso\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bristol Hospital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20338\">\n    308 Conn. 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 354 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20A.3d%20940\">\n    63 A.3d 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (jurisdiction where factual and legal arguments of appeals inextricably intertwined). We therefore conclude that we may consider the appeal without a grant of certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The second jurisdictional question is whether the matter is moot because the underlying action had gone to judgment at the time the motions to intervene were filed and there is no relief that can be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the matter is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Mootness implicates [this] court's subject matter jurisdiction and is thus a threshold matter for us to resolve.... It is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction .... When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001083\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/87/537/#p542\">\n    87 Conn.

The zoning enforcement officer of the plaintiff town issued a cease and desist order to cease operation of the asphalt facility on the property. The original defendants contended that the asphalt facility is a legally existing non-conforming use and appealed from the cease and desist order to the zoning board of appeals, which sustained the order. The town also commenced an action against the original defendants seeking an injunction and statutory damages, claiming that the original defendants were in violation of its zoning regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The original defendants appealed from the cease and desist order to the Superior Court, where the appeal was consolidated with the town's zoning action. Before trial, however, the parties settled their disputes by way of a stipulated judgment that was accepted by the court,\n   <em>\n    Handy, J.\n   </em>\n   , on August 4, 1997.\n   The following timeline is relevant to the present appeal. In 2014 and 2015, the town received numerous complaints about the asphalt facility and that its operation did not comply with the 1997 stipulated judgment. On October 28, 2015, the estate of Pasquale Camputaro (estate), filed a motion to cite in American Industries, Inc., (business) as a party defendant in the consolidated action that had gone to judgment in 1997, and a second motion to substitute Pasquale Camputaro, Jr., as executor of the estate, as a party defendant. See footnote 4 of this opinion. The motion to cite in states that the business operates the \"aggregate processing and bituminous concrete manufacturing facility,\" located on the\n   property, and \"has been an integral party responsible for the compliance with the orders set forth in the stipulation to judgment in the above entitled matter dated June 20, 1997, and therefore should be added as a party defendant.\" At the time, the motions were filed, there was no action pending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The clerk scheduled the motions to be heard at short calendar on November 23, 2015, and the calendar was posted on the Judicial Branch website. On November 5, 2015, the matter was transferred from the Superior Court for the judicial district of Norwich to the Superior Court for the judicial district of New London.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At 10:30 a.m., on Monday, November 9, 2015, the town board of selectmen (board) held a special meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The minutes of the meeting state that the board immediately adjourned the public meeting to go into executive session with the parties and their counsel to discuss ongoing litigation. The executive session ended at 10:46 a.m. When the meeting was reconvened, a motion was made, seconded, and carried unanimously \"to authorize and delegate to the First Selectman with the assistance of the Town Attorney, to negotiate and approve on behalf of the Town of Griswold, modifications to the Stipulated Judgment dated June 20, 1997, in the case of the Town of Griswold v. Camputaro.\" The meeting was adjourned at 10:49 a.m. The desired negotiated modifications to the stipulated judgment are not contained in or attached to the minutes of the board's November 9, 2015 meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 12, 2015, the plaintiff, Pasquale Camputaro, Jr., and American Industries, Inc.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a joint\n   motion to open and modify the judgment; a fee of $125 was also paid at that time. In addition, on that date, Harry Heller, counsel for the defendants, filed a caseflow request, stating in relevant part \"by consent of the parties, the request is made to be added to [the] Monday, November 16, 2015 short calendar in order to expedite judicial approval of a stipulated judgment modification.\" The court,\n   <em>\n    Cosgrove, J.\n   </em>\n   , approved the request by order of November 16, 2015. Also, on November 16, 2015, Judge Cosgrove granted the motion to open and modify the 1997 stipulated judgment. At that time, Judge Cosgrove ordered that on or before December 17, 2015, the complaint be amended to state facts showing the interest of the plaintiff. He also ordered that the plaintiff summon the business to appear as a defendant in the action\n   on or before the second day following December 29, 2015. In other words, the court opened the judgment, granted the motion to cite in, and accepted a stipulated judgment involving an entity that had not yet been served with process. An amended complaint and return of service were filed on December 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Lond\u00e9, relying on the calendar posting on the Judicial Branch website, appeared at short calendar on November 23, 2015, prepared to file her motion to intervene pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 (a) (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, she learned that Judge Cosgrove had accepted the stipulated judgment on November 16, 2015. Lond\u00e9 nonetheless filed her motion to intervene to raise claims of environmental harm. On December 9, 2015, Ryan also filed a motion to intervene pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 (a) (1). The parties\n   filed joint objections to the motions to intervene. On January 19, 2016, Judge Vacchelli heard argument from the intervenors and the parties regarding the motions to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The following colloquy between Judge Vacchelli and Attorney Heller is significant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Q: I'm just trying to understand what the window is and how you analyze that. The intervenors are alleging that the window was-that you had a very tiny window within which to act and the parties made it even smaller by their manipulation of the system. Is it your position that there's no proceeding pending now that they can intervene in because the court entered judgment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"A: That's correct, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Q: Okay. And the court-you moved to open the judgment on November 12, [2015,] okay. The case wasn't opened yet but the matter was scheduled for a hearing on November [16, 2015].

It was opened and then a new judgment entered and closed; is that right? ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"A: Yes, correct, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Q: So there was really nothing open until the court opened it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"A: No, but there was a motion pending.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Q: Okay. The filing of the motion didn't open the case though and make it-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"A: Correct. Only the court can open the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"Q: So it was almost instantaneous. It was opened and closed.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In his memorandum of decision, Judge Vacchelli stated that the court was \"not persuaded that the parties unfairly manipulated the court's calendar to avoid notice to and participation by the [intervenors]. The court agrees with the [intervenors] that a hearing on the motion to open and modify judgment was necessary, as it was in the nature, at least in part, of a settlement of a land use appeal.

The intervenors had no notice that the subject motions in the present matter were to be heard on November 16, 2015, rather than on November 23, 2015. Moreover, as Judge Vacchelli stated during the hearing on the motions to intervene, the opening and closing of the\n   action was almost instantaneous, hardly the sort of \"hearing\" our law contemplates. He also stated during the course of the hearing that a case is not opened merely by filing a motion to open. A case is not opened until the motion to open is granted by the court. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The defendants argue that the parties agreed to have the motions considered on November 16, 2015. That well may be, but \u00a7 22a-19 (a) permits\n   <em>\n    any person\n   </em>\n   to intervene. Without accurate notice of the date the motion to open and modify the stipulated judgment was to be heard, the intervenors were deprived of the right to file motions to intervene in a pending action. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court stated that the hearing on the motion was public. That finding is factually correct, but legally inaccurate in the context of the present appeal. If any person or other legal entity did not have notice that the modified judgment was being presented for judicial review, the public nature of the hearing was not adequate for the purposes of \u00a7 22a-19 (a). We therefore conclude that because the intervenors did not have timely notice of a pending action in which they could intervene, the case on remand should be reopened and the intervenors permitted to file their motions to intervene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The intervenors also claim that because their motions to intervene were denied they could not participate in the hearing on the stipulated settlement that failed to conform to \u00a7 8-8 (n).
