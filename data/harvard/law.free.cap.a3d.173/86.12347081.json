Butler\u2019s petition for reinstatement, the report and recommendation of the Board on Professional Responsibility Ad Hoc Hearing Committee concluding that Mr. Butler has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he .is entitled to reinstatement pursuant to D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 16 (d), this court\u2019s August 30, 2017, order directing petitioner to show cause why this court should not enter an order denying his petition for reinstatement, and Mr. Butler\u2019s response to the order to show cause, it is</p> <p id=\"b120-14\" pgmap=\"120\">ORDERED that the petition for reinstatement is hereby denied. The bar rule governing contested petitions for reinstatement, which states that \u201c[u]pon the filing of the Hearing Committee\u2019s findings and recommendation, the Court shall schedule the matter for consideration,\u201d allows the court to decide the merits of the reinstatement petition with or without briefing. See D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 16 (d)(2). Additionally, unlike the provisions of the bar rules governing proceedings on misconduct charges brought by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, the reinstatement rules do not provide for the filing of exceptions to the Hearing Committee or Board\u2019s report, see, e.g., D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 9 (e), and do not direct the court to enter the recommended discipline in the event no exceptions are timely filed, see, e.g., D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 9 (h)(2). In this case, the existing record is sufficient for us to resolve the petition without additional briefing and without \u201ca recommendation by the Board concerning reinstatement.\u201d See D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 16 (d)(2) (permitting the court, \u201c[i]n its discretion,\u201d to request the Board\u2019s view).</p> <p id=\"b120-16\" pgmap=\"120(217) 121(85)\">\u201cIn a disciplinary case, this court accepts the [Hearing Committee\u2019s] .findings of fact unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence of record.\u201d In re Samad, 51 A.3d 486, 495 (D.C. 2012) (quoting In re Shariati, 31 A.3d 81, 86 (D.C. 2011)); see also D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 9 (h)(1). Although we place \u201cgreat weight\u201d on the Hearing Committee\u2019s recommendation, \u201cthis court has the ultimate authority to decide whether to grant a petition for reinstatement.\u201d In re Sabo, 49 A.3d 1219, 1224 (D.C. 2012) (quoting In re Bettis, 644 A.2d 1023, 1027 (D.C. 1994)). Here, the Hearing Committee carefully considered each of the five factors that this court has designated for consideration in the disposition of petitions for reinstatement. In re Roundtree, 503 A.2d 1215, 1217 (D.C. 1985). Based upon the Hearing Committee\u2019s report, which found deficiencies in all five of the Roundtree factors, and based upon the record in this matter, we conclude that Mr; Butler has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that he is.fit to resume the practice of law. D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 16 (d)(1) (a) &amp; (b) (stating that an attorney seeking reinstatement must establish by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthe attorney has the moral qualifications, competency, and learning in law required for readmission\u201d and that \u201cthe resumption of the practice of law by the attorney will not be detrimental to the integrity and standing of the Bar, or to the administration of justice, or subversive to the public interest\u201d). Lastly, we direct Mr. Butler to D.C. Bar R. XI \u00a7 16 (g), which states that in the event a petition for reinstatement is denied, \u201cno further petition for reinstatement may be filed until the expiration of at least one year following the denial[.]\u201d</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
