Mickens, Jr., administrator of the estate of Janet Mickens (Mickens). The plaintiff claims that the court, in granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment, erred by (1) failing to consider the pleadings, affidavits and other proof submitted in deciding that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) considering facts outside the confines of this case; (3) violating her right to due process of law by failing to allow her to review evidence from other cases that the court utilized in deciding the motion for summary judgment; (4) failing to apply the \"test\" set forth in\n   <em>\n    Sanzone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Police Commissioners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"524005\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/179/\">\n    219 Conn. 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=592%20A.2d%20912\">\n    592 A.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991), when determining if there was a chain of causation that included the defendant's negligence in sequence with a highway defect; and (5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   denying her postjudgment motions to amend her revised complaint and to reargue the motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts underlying this action, which the plaintiff commenced on January 2, 2015, are neither complicated nor, for purposes of summary judgment, in dispute. The action arises out of injuries that the plaintiff sustained while she was walking on a public sidewalk in Meriden on May 14, 2013. The sidewalk was adjacent to premises owned by Mickens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her revised complaint of April 29, 2015, the plaintiff alleged that, \"a dangerous, defective and unsafe condition existed on the aforementioned sidewalk ... namely, a broken and cracked concrete sidewalk and adjacent curb with grass growing wildly through the crack and broken sections.... [The plaintiff] was walking on the aforementioned sidewalk when she came in contact with the defective, dangerous and unsafe condition, that being the broken and cracked concrete and a section of the broken concrete under her foot did break away from the curb causing her to slip and fall and causing her injuries and damages ....\" The plaintiff alleged that the sidewalk \"is used by the public to transgress over.\" The plaintiff alleged that she sustained physical injuries, principally to her right leg, that necessitated medical treatment and that interfered with her employment and normal life pursuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff alleged that Mickens was negligent in that she \"allowed and permitted the ... [defect] to exist and remain\n   ... failed to repair and or remedy the ... [defect] in a timely manner ... allowed and permitted individuals to use the sidewalk although she\n   knew or reasonably should have known of the presence of the ... [defect] ... failed to properly maintain the ... premises including the sidewalk and curb ... failed to inspect the premises including the sidewalks and curbs ... failed to warn those upon said premises, including the plaintiff, of the presence of the aforementioned [defect] ... failed to place devices, signs and or tape, so that as to make the [defect] visible and readily apparent to individuals ... she failed to place devices, signs and or tape, so as to physically prevent individuals from using said sidewalk ... failed to cut the grass on the sidewalk and/or remove any grass that was hiding defects on the sidewalk ... [and] failed to have the curb properly constructed ... pursuant to building ordinances in ... Meriden.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following discovery, the defendant moved for summary judgment. In his memorandum of law in support of his motion, the defendant argued that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because, under the facts as alleged by the plaintiff, Mickens owed no duty to the plaintiff to maintain the sidewalk. The defendant asserted that \"Connecticut law is clear that an abutting landowner is not liable for the unsafe condition of an adjacent public sidewalk unless the unsafe condition is actually caused by the abutting landowner. See\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cianfarani\n   </em>\n   ... 314 Conn. [521, 529,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20A.3d%20375\">\n    107 A.3d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) ] ....\" The defendant observed that because the plaintiff did not assert in her complaint that Mickens caused the sidewalk defect by any \"positive actions,\" Mickens did not owe a duty to the plaintiff to repair or warn of the defect. The defendant further reasoned that to the extent that Meriden ordinances imposed responsibilities on abutting landowners to maintain sidewalks, in the absence of state statutory authority, such ordinances cannot be interpreted as\n   having shifted liability from Meriden and onto the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if the city of Meriden could shift liability by ordinance, the defendant argued, those ordinances did not sufficiently express the intent to shift liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In her memorandum in support of her objection to the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff argued that the defendant's motion for summary judgment addressed only one of the causes of the plaintiff's injuries, specifically, the crack in the sidewalk. She argued that grass growing on the sidewalk, as alleged, was not a defect under our municipal defective highway statute, General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, therefore, it was \"the responsibility of the landowner to remove ... [it] and to make the property safe for pedestrians ....\" The plaintiff argued \u00a7 180-42 of the Meriden City Code, which requires the abutting landowner to keep grass or weeds properly cut or removed in the area of the\n   sidewalk, was controlling and that it shifted the burden of sidewalk maintenance to Mickens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff also asserted that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant's failure to remove the \"wildly growing grass\" on the sidewalk was a proximate cause of her injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court agreed with the defendant and granted the motion for summary judgment. The court reasoned that Mickens owed no duty to the plaintiff because \"the positive act exception to the general rule absolving property owners of liability for defective sidewalks cannot be established in the case of growing grass, since grass grows by itself.\" The court also observed that the \"Meriden grass-cutting ordinance [on which the plaintiff relied] ... does not shift liability to the individual with the specificity required by\n   <em>\n    Willoughby\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Haven\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1550348\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/123/446/#p451\">\n    123 Conn. 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=197%20A.%2085\">\n    197 A. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1937), and [that, in any event, the plaintiff] ... expressly abandoned her reliance on the ordinance at argument.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff thereafter filed motions to amend her revised complaint and to reargue the motion for summary judgment, the contents of which we discuss in part III of this opinion. The court denied the motion to reargue. The record does not reflect that the court rendered a disposition on the motion to amend the revised complaint. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We first address the plaintiff's related claims that the court erred in granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment (1) by failing to consider the pleadings, affidavits and other proof submitted in deciding\n   that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact, and (2) by failing to apply the definition of a highway defect as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Sanzone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Police Commissioners\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"524005\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/179/\">\n    219 Conn. at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=592%20A.2d%20912\">\n    592 A.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , when determining whether there was a chain of causation that included the defendant's negligence in sequence with a highway defect.

First, the plaintiff claims\n   that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the wildly growing grass that concealed the crack in the sidewalk hindered her ability to safely use the sidewalk and that, if it did not hinder her, the condition of the sidewalk did not meet the definition of a highway defect so as to confer liability exclusively on the city of Meriden. Whether the plaintiff was injured because the grass\n   <em>\n    obstructed\n   </em>\n   her view of the crack, or whether, for instance, the grass came into contact with her foot, causing her to slip and fall, however, is simply not material to a disposition of the motion for summary judgment in this case. See\n   <em>\n    DiPietro\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Farmington Sports Arena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    LLC\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20107\">\n    306 Conn. at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20951\">\n    49 A.3d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (fact is material if it makes difference in outcome of case). In part I B of this opinion, we discuss why the issue is not material and is therefore not a barrier to granting summary judgment in the defendant's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, the plaintiff asserts that a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to whether the grass was a proximate cause of her alleged injuries. She argues that there is a genuine dispute as to whether \"the wildly growing grass prevented the plaintiff from seeing the broken part of the sidewalk and this caused her to step on the broken sidewalk because she could not see it and it gave way causing her to fall.\" The defendant, however, for purposes of summary judgment, did not dispute that the plaintiff was injured after falling on the public sidewalk adjacent to Mickens' property, or that her fall was caused by \"a broken and cracked concrete sidewalk and adjacent curb with grass growing wildly through the crack and broken sections.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Accordingly, the claim that the trial court failed to consider the pleadings and other proof submitted in determining that there were no genuine issues of fact is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The plaintiff next argues that the court erred as a matter of law by failing to apply the definition of a highway defect as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Sanzone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Police Commissioners\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"524005\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/179/\">\n    219 Conn. at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=592%20A.2d%20912\">\n    592 A.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As previously mentioned, the defendant argued, and the trial court agreed, that, absent proof of a positive act by Mickens that caused or contributed to the plaintiff's fall, Mickens owed no duty to the plaintiff to maintain the sidewalk, specifically, by keeping it free of wildly growing grass. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"The essential elements of a cause of action in negligence are well established: duty; breach of that duty; causation; and actual injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    RK Constructors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fusco Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"740781\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/231/381/#p384\">\n    231 Conn. 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 384,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=650%20A.2d%20153\">\n    650 A.2d 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). Our analysis in this case begins and ends with the first element, duty. \"The existence of a duty is a question of law and only if such a duty is found to exist does the trier of fact then determine whether the defendant violated that duty in the particular situation at hand.... Because the court's determination of whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff is a question of law, our standard of review is plenary.... Our Supreme Court has stated that the test for the existence of a legal duty of care entails (1) a determination of whether an ordinary person in the defendant's position, knowing what the defendant knew or should have known, would anticipate that harm of the general nature of that suffered was likely to result, and (2) a determination, on the basis of a public policy analysis, of whether the defendant's responsibility for its negligent conduct should extend to the particular consequences or particular plaintiff in the case.... The first part of the test invokes the question of foreseeability, and the second part invokes the question of policy.\" (Citations omitted;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Abramczyk\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Abbey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"210578\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/64/442/#p445\">\n    64 Conn.App. 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 445,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=780%20A.2d%20957\">\n    780 A.2d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"358022,358076,357806\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/258/933/\">\n    258 Conn. 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=785%20A.2d%20229\">\n    785 A.2d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It has long been established that municipalities have the primary duty to maintain public sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition.\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cianfarani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20A.3d%20375\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   314 Conn. at 525,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20A.3d%20375\">\n    107 A.3d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, she maintained that, unlike the crack, the wildly growing grass that she alleges contributed to her injuries by concealing the crack is not a defect covered by the municipal highway defect statute, \u00a7 13a-149, because the grass, in and of itself, did not hinder her from walking on the sidewalk. She argued that abutting landowners, regardless of the lack of any ordinance or statute that shifted liability or proof of a positive act on the part of the landowner, are liable for \"nonsidewalk defects.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Similarly, on appeal, the plaintiff does not address the preceding authority regarding\n   exceptions to the common-law rule that would shift liability for an unsafe public sidewalk from the municipality to an abutting property owner either by statute or ordinance or the\n   positive act of the property owner. Rather, the plaintiff argues that because the grass did not constitute a \"highway defect\" under \u00a7 13a-149, as defined in\n   <em>\n    Sanzone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Police Commissioners\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"524005\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/179/\">\n    219 Conn. at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=592%20A.2d%20912\">\n    592 A.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the defendant is liable for the plaintiff's injury due to Mickens' failure to remove the grass that concealed the crack in the sidewalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiff's argument is flawed. In\n   <em>\n    Sanzone,\n   </em>\n   the estate of a person injured in a motor vehicle accident sued a municipality, alleging that the accident was caused by the existence of simultaneous green traffic lights in perpendicular directions. Id., at 181,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=592%20A.2d%20912\">\n    592 A.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The issue was whether the traffic light was a \"highway defect\" for the purpose of \u00a7 13a-149. Under \u00a7 13a-149,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   municipalities can be held liable for injuries caused by highway defects on public roads. Our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Sanzone\n   </em>\n   reiterated longstanding case law that a highway defect is defined as \"[a]ny object in, upon, or near the traveled path, which would necessarily obstruct or hinder one in the use of the road for the purpose of traveling thereon, or which, from its nature and position, would be likely to produce that result ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Sanzone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Police Commissioners\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"524005\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/179/\">\n    219 Conn. at 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=592%20A.2d%20912\">\n    592 A.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the growing grass failed to meet the definition of a highway defect,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the outcome of this case would not be different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The main issue affecting summary judgment in this case is whether Mickens owed a duty to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Sanzone\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 13a-149 address municipality liability; neither are pertinent to whether Mickens owed a duty to the plaintiff and\n   they are therefore inapplicable to this case. The plaintiff has not identified any authority in support of the contention that when dangerous \"nonsidewalk\" defects or naturally occurring conditions not created by an abutting landowner are present on a public sidewalk, the abutting landowner has an affirmative duty to rectify such defects and is subject to liability to third parties for any injuries if he or she fails to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Again, the controlling longstanding rule is that abutting landowners are not liable for injuries due to the lack of public sidewalk maintenance, unless there is a statute conferring liability or the landowner contributed to the creation of the accident-causing condition by positive act. See\n   <em>\n    Hartford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Talcott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"780849\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/48/525/#p534\">\n    48 Conn. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534 (1881) (landowner owes no duty to public for defects resulting wholly from operations of nature). The revised complaint does not allege, nor does the plaintiff claim,\n   either that Mickens had possession of, or control over the sidewalk abutting her property. There also is no allegation in the plaintiff's revised complaint or in the documents she submitted in opposition to summary judgment that Mickens created the wildly growing grass on the sidewalk through any positive act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, it alleges that Mickens failed to take affirmative steps to remediate an existing condition on what was indisputably a public sidewalk. See\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cianfarani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20A.3d%20375\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   314 Conn. at 528,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20A.3d%20375\">\n    107 A.3d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As was noted previously in this opinion, the court observed that the plaintiff abandoned any claim that a Meriden ordinance had shifted liability to the defendant. Whether the plaintiff sustained the injury because the clump of grass obstructed her view of the crack or the grass caused her to trip or slip; see part I A of this opinion; the fact remains that the pleadings and other documents do not remotely suggest that Mickens through any positive act caused the grass to grow on the sidewalk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Grass is naturally occurring. As the court aptly noted, \"grass grows by itself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Therefore, the plaintiff's alternative theory of common-law liability based on the Mickens' negligence for \"nonsidewalk\" defects is governed by the settled common-law rule that, in the absence of statute or ordinance, an abutting landowner ordinarily is under no duty to keep the public sidewalk in front of her property in a reasonably safe condition for travel. Accordingly there is no basis to impose liability on the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We next consider the plaintiff's related claims that in granting summary judgment, the court erroneously\n   considered facts outside the confines of this case and in so doing, violated the plaintiff's right to due process of law by failing to allow her to review evidence from other cases that the court utilized in deciding the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff claims that the court, by citing to its prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Marino\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Branford\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. 431477 (Oct. 12, 2000) (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20297\">\n    28 Conn.

These claims are entirely without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Marino\n   </em>\n   , the injured party fell when she stepped on a sidewalk defect that was concealed by weeds and grass. Id., at 297. The court determined that the abutting landowner was not liable, however, because grass grows naturally and, thus, the condition at issue was not created by a positive act. Id., at 298. In its memorandum of decision, the court in the present case reasoned: \"For the reasons set forth in [\n   <em>\n    Marino\n   </em>\n   ] ... the objection to the motion for summary judgment must be overruled. As explained in\n   <em>\n    Marino\n   </em>\n   , 'the positive act exception to the general rule absolving abutting property owners of liability for defective sidewalks cannot be established' in the case of growing grass, since grass grows by itself.... The operative facts of\n   <em>\n    Marino\n   </em>\n   cannot be distinguished from the operative facts of this case, and, despite frequent entreaties by the court at argument, [the plaintiff] was unable to articulate any such distinction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   There is no indication that the court considered the facts in\n   <em>\n    Marino\n   </em>\n   in lieu of the facts presented by the parties at summary judgment. A court may look to an opinion from a factually similar case, or any reported\n   case, in fact, even if such case is nonbinding, for legal guidance in resolving the case before it.

The plaintiff does not assert rights of this nature. Instead, the plaintiff argues that the court did not provide notice that it would cite to the\n   <em>\n    Marino\n   </em>\n   decision. The argument is wholly frivolous, and we further note that the defendant cited to\n   <em>\n    Marino\n   </em>\n   in his motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the court did not err in granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The plaintiff's final claim is that the court erred by denying the plaintiff's postjudgment motions to amend her revised complaint and to reargue the motion for summary judgment. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We note the following additional facts relevant to this claim. The plaintiff's revised complaint alleges that\n   she fell on May 14, 2014, and it refers to the defendant's decedent as\n   <em>\n    Janice\n   </em>\n   Mickens, rather than\n   <em>\n    Janet\n   </em>\n   Mickens. Through discovery, however, it was determined that the incident had in fact occurred on May 14,\n   <em>\n    2013\n   </em>\n   . It is undisputed that Mickens died on January 4, 2014. The plaintiff did not correct these errors in her revised complaint prior to the granting of summary judgment. In its memorandum of decision granting summary judgment, the court observed that the plaintiff incorrectly referred to\n   <em>\n    Janice\n   </em>\n   Mickens and that Mickens had been dead for over four months at the time of the\n   incident in question, thus leaving \"the identity of the person actually responsible for the condition complained of ... in considerable doubt.\" The court, however, acknowledged the incorrect date was \"not the subject of the defendant's motion for summary judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After the court granted summary judgment, the plaintiff filed the two motions previously identified. The plaintiff sought to amend her revised complaint to fix the error as to the date of the incident and sought to reargue the motion for summary judgment because she argues the court rendered its decision \"based upon [the] ... erroneous facts\" her amendment sought to cure. The court summarily denied the motion to reargue. The record does not indicate that the court ruled on the motion to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As she did before the trial court, the plaintiff argues that the court looked to incorrect details when deciding whether to grant summary judgment for the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiff argues that the record should be modified to allow for a \"proper decision upon the facts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"[T]he purpose of a reargument is ... to demonstrate to the court that there is some decision or some principle of law which would have a controlling effect, and which has been overlooked, or that there has been\n   a misapprehension of facts.... It also may be used to address alleged inconsistencies in the trial court's memorandum of decision as well as claims of law that the [movant] claimed were not addressed by the court.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Opoku\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"124136\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/63/686/#p692\">\n    63 Conn.App. 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 692,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%20981\">\n    778 A.2d 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).

The court expressly stated that the incorrect date was \"not the subject of the defendant's motion for summary judgment.\" The principal issue on summary judgment was whether the owner of the property adjacent to the sidewalk in question owed the plaintiff a duty to maintain the sidewalk. The court concluded that the abutting landowner at the time of the plaintiff's accident, whether it was Mickens or her estate, could not be held liable. We are not persuaded that reargument based on the correct date of the plaintiff's fall, as argued, would have affected the court's judgment. Whether Mickens or her estate was the abutting landowner at the time of the incident in question was irrelevant to the court's analysis. For the foregoing reasons, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiff's motion to reargue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To the extent that the plaintiff challenges the court's denial of her motion to amend, we observe that \"[w]e cannot pass on the correctness of a trial court ruling that was never made.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Fischel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    TKPK, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"726347\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/34/22/#p26\">\n    34 Conn.App. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20125\">\n    640 A.2d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).

Pursuant to \u00a7 7-148, municipalities also may levy penalties against abutting landowners for their failure to remove such debris and obstructions.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Accordingly, the city of Meriden requires property owners to keep grass or weeds properly cut or removed in the area between the property line of the landowner's premises and the curbline. Meriden City Code \u00a7 180-42. But there is no language in this ordinance or in any statute that imposes upon the abutting property owner any liability to a third party for his injuries. Under General Statutes \u00a7 7-163a, municipalities may transfer to abutting property owners liability solely for injuries caused by ice and snow on public sidewalks. Section 7-148 is the only other source under which a municipality may delegate duties to abutting landowners with respect to sidewalks. Although \u00a7 7-148 authorizes municipalities to require abutting property owners to remove debris and other obstructions from public sidewalks, unlike \u00a7 7-163a, it does not authorize a municipality to shift liability for injuries to adjacent landowners.

Photographs submitted by the plaintiff as exhibits accompanying her objection might have indicated to a trier of fact that if the grass had not been concealing the crack, the plaintiff might have seen it and been able to avoid the accident.
