Ray, for an order establishing his child support obligation to the plaintiff in accordance with the state's child support and arrearage guidelines (guidelines), Regs. Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-1 et seq. The plaintiff also appeals from the judgment of the trial court, rendered after argument, denying the relief requested in her postjudgment motion for reargument and reconsideration. The defendant sought an order establishing his child support obligation when, pursuant to the judgment of dissolution rendered on August 11, 2008, his unallocated alimony and child support obligation had terminated. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court erred by (1) establishing the defendant's child support obligation without making a finding as to his net income, (2) making findings as to the parties' gross and net incomes based upon an unsworn child support guidelines worksheet (guidelines worksheet) prepared by a family relations officer where the information on the guidelines worksheet was contrary to the evidence, and (3) failing to take into account the defendant's income in excess of his base salary when it determined his child support obligation. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court or apparent from the record, and procedural history are pertinent to our consideration of this appeal. The parties were married on June 26, 1994, and they have one minor child who was born on September 1, 2005. At the time of the dissolution, the plaintiff was thirty-nine years old and in good health. She has a masters degree in business administration and was employed as a financial manager at Starwood Hotels and Resorts, earning a base salary of $92,000 per year. She also was eligible for bonuses. The defendant was thirty-six years old and also in good health. He was employed as an executive director at Morgan Stanley, earning a base salary of $150,000 per year. He too was eligible for bonuses. Following a trial, the court,\n   <em>\n    Shay, J.\n   </em>\n   dissolved the parties' marriage and made a finding \"[t]hat taking into consideration the factors set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82, including the age, education, earnings and work experience of the [plaintiff], in light of the facts and circumstances of this case, a time limited award of alimony is appropriate.\" The dissolution court also made a finding \"[t]hat the combined net weekly income of the parties is $3145; that basic child support is $418 per week; and that the [defendant's] share is $255 per week ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court further ordered that in the event that the alimony should terminate for whatever reason and the child was still a minor, commencing with the first day of the first month following such termination, and monthly thereafter, the defendant would pay to the plaintiff a sum consistent with the then existing guidelines, or as the court may otherwise direct, as child support until such time as the child reached the age of eighteen years. In the event, however, that the child turns eighteen years old and is still in high school, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84(b), the child support order shall continue until the first day of the next month following the\n   child's graduation from high school or his nineteenth birthday, whichever occurs first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court also ordered that the child's extracurricular expenses, including summer camp and day care expenses, would be shared by the parties equally. The plaintiff was ordered to maintain and pay for health insurance for the child, so long as it is available to her through her employment\n   at a reasonable cost. In the event that such insurance is unavailable to the plaintiff, the defendant was ordered to \"obtain and maintain health insurance for the ... child at his expense, so long as he shall be obligated to pay child support [or subject to] an educational support order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56c, or an order based upon a written agreement of the parties for postmajority educational support.\" The dissolution judgment incorporated the agreement of the parties that all unreimbursed medical, dental, orthodontic, optical, pharmaceutical, psychiatric, and psychological expenses for the child would be shared by the parties equally. The dissolution court also reserved jurisdiction to enter an educational support order pursuant to \u00a7 46b-56c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly after it rendered its judgment dissolving the marriage, the dissolution court issued an amendment and corrections to its memorandum of decision that amended its original order of unallocated alimony and child support. The dissolution court deviated from the guidelines and entered financial orders providing that the defendant was to pay to the plaintiff $3125 per month as unallocated alimony and child support until the death of either party, the remarriage of the plaintiff, or August 31, 2015, whichever occurred first. In addition, commencing September 1, 2008, for so long as the defendant had an outstanding alimony obligation to the plaintiff, within two weeks after receipt by the defendant of any gross additional cash compensation from his employment, including, but not limited to, any salary,\n   bonus or incentive pay in excess of his base salary of $150,000, the defendant was to pay to the plaintiff 25 percent of such gross additional cash compensation up to and including the first $200,000 per year of such additional compensation, as additional periodic unallocated alimony and child support, until the death of either party, the remarriage of the plaintiff, or August 31, 2015, whichever occurred first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 4, 2015, the defendant filed a postjudgment motion for order requesting that the court enter an order establishing his child support obligation in accordance with the guidelines, as the plaintiff's alimony had terminated on August 31, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 19, 2015, the court held a hearing on the defendant's motion. At the hearing, both parties presented evidence and testimony regarding their respective incomes, and during the hearing, the guidelines worksheet prepared by a family relations officer was submitted to the court after it noted that it had not been provided with one. The guidelines worksheet reflected a combined net weekly income of $6000 using the parties' base salaries and allowing for permitted deductions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant requested that the court enter an order of $288 weekly, which was the amount suggested on the guidelines worksheet. The plaintiff submitted into evidence her own child support calculations. The plaintiff requested, on the basis of her calculations, that the trial court order the defendant to pay her child support in the amount of $895 per week, or $3878 per month, and that the court \"consider the ... [defendant's] deferred compensation ... [a]nd include [it] in providing an order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court, after stating that it had considered all of the evidence, including the testimony of the parties, the exhibits, the parties' financial affidavits, and guidelines,\n   ordered the defendant to pay the requisite presumptive minimum child support in the amount of $288, in accordance with the\n   guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court did not issue any supplemental child support order based on the deferred compensation the defendant receives in addition to his base salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 3, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion for reargument or reconsideration postjudgment (motion to reargue). The court granted the plaintiff's motion and held a hearing on January 20, 2016. Following argument by counsel for both parties, the court denied the plaintiff the relief she requested and determined that its decision of October 19, 2015, would stand, reiterating that it had \"considered the ... guidelines, the statutory factors of criteria ... [and] all the evidence that was presented, including the financial affidavits and their attachments.\" This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We begin with the well established standard of review relative to domestic relations cases. \"An appellate court will not disturb a trial court's orders in domestic relations cases unless the court has abused its discretion\n   or it is found that it could not reasonably conclude as it did, based on the facts presented. ... The trial court's findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. ... [T]o conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, we must find that the court either incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably conclude as it did. ... In determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486152\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/141/884/#p361\">\n    164 Conn.

In the present case, the court did not file a written memorandum of decision explaining its ruling, nor did it prepare and sign a transcript of its oral ruling as required by Practice Book \u00a7 64-1(a). The plaintiff did not file a motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 64-1(b) providing notice that the court had not filed a written decision or a signed transcript of its oral decision, nor did the plaintiff take any additional steps to obtain a decision in compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 64-1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"When the record does not contain either a memorandum of decision or transcribed copy of an oral decision signed by the trial court stating the reasons for its decision, this court frequently has declined to review the claims on appeal because the appellant has failed to provide the court with an adequate record for review. ...

The defendant claims that insofar as the plaintiff's factual assertions and arguments remain unsupported by appropriate citations to the record, they should be disregarded by this court, citing\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition Against Millstone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Siting Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960222\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/57/#p87\">\n    286 Conn. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=942%20A.2d%20345\">\n    942 A.2d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (mere conclusory assertions regarding claim, with no mention of relevant authority and minimal or no citations from the record, will not suffice)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We have reviewed the plaintiff's principal and reply briefs with the defendant's assertions in mind. The plaintiff has not completely disregarded the applicable rules of appellate procedure. In some instances, we find that the plaintiff has provided a citation to the record or to an exhibit. Although at times the portion of the record to which she cites does not seem to support her argument, we cannot fault her attempt to make the arguments that, in her view, are supported by the record. In her reply brief, the plaintiff adequately counters most of the defendant's complaints by clarifying parts of the record where her assertions are supported with adequate citations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Despite the existence of some deficiencies in the presentation of the appeal, we will review the plaintiff's claims on appeal because we are able, from the trial court record, which consisted of short testimony and only a few exhibits, to discern the evidentiary basis, or lack thereof, for the arguments advanced by both parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff's first claim is that the trial court erred by entering an order establishing the defendant's child support obligation without making a finding as to his net income. We agree with the defendant that the record in this case directly contradicts the plaintiff's claim that\n   the court did not make a finding as to the defendant's net income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In ruling on the defendant's motion for order, the court stated: \"The court notes that the [guidelines] worksheet indicates a gross income [for the plaintiff] of ... $3470, and for [the defendant of] $5769. Net incomes [for the plaintiff] of $2344, and for [the defendant] of $3652. The court notes that the [guidelines indicate] a presumptive current support amount of $185 for [the plaintiff] and $288 for [the defendant]. Having considered the exhibits, the testimony of the parties, having reviewed the motion and supporting documentation, the court grants the defendant's motion for order concerning child support postjudgment and orders child support in the amount of $288 per week.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Tuckman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tuckman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20194\">\n    308 Conn. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 208,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%20449\">\n    61 A.3d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), upon which the plaintiff relies,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the basis for the\n   child support order in this case is readily ascertainable and can be verified by noting that the combined net weekly incomes, as indicated on the guidelines worksheet, to which the court referred, exceeded $4000 per week, and that $185 and $288 were the presumptive proportional minimal amounts required of each party by the guidelines. Given that the parties' combined net weekly base salaries were in excess of $4000, the court had the discretion to order, as a minimum, the presumptive child support amount\n   for a combined net weekly income of $4000, which is the highest weekly amount listed on the guidelines schedule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   See Regs., Conn.

During the hearings on the defendant's motion for order and on her motion to reargue, however, the plaintiff never objected to the submission of the guidelines worksheet to the trial court or to the court's consideration of it because it had not been marked as an exhibit. The plaintiff's motion to reargue also makes no reference to the guidelines worksheet; rather, her allegations assert that the defendant's financial affidavit was \"incomplete and failed to properly declare his income as that term is defined in the [guidelines].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As to the plaintiff's claim that the guidelines worksheet contained information that was unsupported by\n   the evidence, during the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to reargue, her counsel argued that he had \"no reason to doubt that [f]amily [r]elations put together a [guidelines worksheet] because they based it on [the defendant's] financial affidavit,\" an admission that the information contained in the guidelines worksheet to which the plaintiff is now objecting was indeed in evidence.

The defendant counters that the court entered its order of child support after considering both parties' incomes, including income in excess of their respective base salaries, and that ultimately, the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that a supplemental child support order based on the parties' income of indeterminate amounts was not appropriate in this particular case. We agree with the defendant. We address this claim in two parts as it relates to both the court's initial ruling on the defendant's motion for order and its ruling on the plaintiff's motion to reargue, from which the plaintiff also appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We first address the plaintiff's challenge to the court's decision on the defendant's motion for order. During the hearing on the defendant's motion, the parties' financial\n   affidavits were entered as exhibits. The plaintiff's financial affidavit reflected a gross base salary from her employment at GE Capital of $13,878 per month, or $166,536 per year. During the cross-examination of the plaintiff, however, it was revealed that her gross weekly base salary was $3470, for a total gross annual base salary of $180,440. In addition to her base salary, she earned a gross bonus of $2114 per month, or $25,368 per year. She testified that she is paid a bonus once per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The defendant's financial affidavit showed his gross base salary from his employment at Morgan Stanley as being $25,000 per month, or $300,000 per year. The defendant testified that he also received deferred compensation in the form of stock in addition to his base salary. Attached as schedules to his financial affidavit were summaries from Morgan Stanley listing in detail his interest in unvested Morgan Stanley stock units and the \"Morgan Stanley Investment Management Plan,\" as well as the vesting and distribution schedules for both. The defendant testified that the deferred compensation he receives from these interests is not guaranteed and that, if his department or he did something wrong, the money could be taken back. Additionally, he testified that even after some of the awards vest, they are not immediately distributed to the defendant in full but, rather, distributed at a much later date, sometimes years after vesting. The defendant pointed out that, with respect to his 2014 W-2 form, the amount reflected as deferred compensation income had vested but had not been distributed and that he had included all of his cash compensation on his financial affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   There is no indication in the record that the court did not consider the evidence of the plaintiff's bonus income from GE Capital and of the defendant's deferred compensation from Morgan Stanley. The former was presented as evidence during the plaintiff's testimony\n   and through defendant's exhibit B, although she omitted any mention of her bonus income in her financial affidavit. The defendant testified as to the nature of his deferred compensation plan and his receipt of awards of stock from his employer, and also attached documentation describing his past receipt of such compensation to his financial affidavit as a separate schedule. The gist of the plaintiff's claim is that the court should have based its child support order on more than the defendant's net base income from his base salary. On appeal, the plaintiff\n   argues that the court's order is not in compliance with the guidelines. She asserts that the court was\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   either to issue a supplemental child support order based on a percentage of the defendant's deferred compensation income, which is what the plaintiff requested during the hearing on the defendant's motion for order,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   or that the court should have included the amount of the defendant's deferred compensation income in determining his net weekly income for purposes of establishing his weekly child support obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   During the hearing on the defendant's motion for order, the plaintiff submitted into evidence her own child support calculations. In making these calculations, she did not use the defendant's income as stated on his financial affidavit but, rather, included all the income reported on his 2014 W-2 form, and ascribed to the defendant a weekly income of $7434.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also\n   calculated her own income based on her admittedly understated weekly base income as reflected on her financial affidavit. The plaintiff, however, clearly indicated to the court that the income from the defendant's deferred compensation was not a part of her calculation that resulted in her request for her purported maximum presumptive amount of $895 per week in child support. Rather, she requested that the court consider entering a supplemental order based on a percentage of his deferred compensation income, which she admitted consisted of future unknown amounts. In seeking the $895 per week order, the plaintiff requested that the court order the maximum presumptive amount of child support based on the parties' proportional shares of 12.04 percent of what she claimed was their combined net weekly income of $9674.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of the circumstances of the present case, in which the parties' combined net weekly income was in excess of $4000, the court's child support order of the presumptive minimum child support amount pursuant to the guidelines was legally proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It has long been established that the guidelines, as promulgated by a commission empowered pursuant to legislation enacted in 1989; see Public Acts 1989, No. 89-203; were intended to \"substantially [circumscribe] the traditionally broad judicial discretion of the court in matters of child support.\"\n   <em>\n    Favrow\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vargas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546515\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/222/699/#p715\">\n    222 Conn. 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 715,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20A.2d%201267\">\n    610 A.2d 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). \"[T]he ... guidelines shall be considered in\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   determinations of child support amounts within the state and ... the guidelines consist of the Schedule of Basic Child Support Obligations as well as\n   <em>\n    the principles and procedures\n   </em>\n   set forth [therein].\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086186\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/80/#p118\">\n    296 Conn. 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=995%20A.2d%201\">\n    995 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The guidelines that became effective on July 1, 2015, were in effect at the time the\n   court conducted its hearing on the defendant's motion for order.

Our Supreme Court explained: \"[T]he schedule\n   [in the guidelines] sets forth a presumptive percentage and resultant amount corresponding to specific levels of combined net weekly income; the schedule begins at $50 and continues in progressively higher $10 increments, terminating at $4000.... This court has recognized that the guidelines nonetheless apply to combined net weekly income in excess of that maximum amount. ... Indeed, the regulations direct that, [w]hen the parents' combined net weekly income exceeds $4,000, child support awards shall be determined on a case-by-case basis, and the current support prescribed at the $4,000 net weekly income shall be the minimum presumptive amount. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \"Either the presumptive ceiling of income percentage or presumptive floor of dollar amount on any given child support obligation, however, may be rebutted by application of the deviation criteria enumerated in the guidelines and by the statutory factors set forth in \u00a7 46b-84(d)....

Thus, this court unambiguously has stated that, when a family's combined net weekly income exceeds $4000, the court should treat the percentage set forth in the schedule at the highest income level as the presumptive ceiling on the child support obligation, subject to rebuttal by application of the deviation criteria enumerated in the guidelines, as well as the statutory factors described in \u00a7 46b-84(d)....

The Supreme Court reversed the judgment after concluding that the trial court did not base this supplemental child support order on the needs of the children and, in addition, improperly deviated from the guidelines, as \"any deviation from the schedule or the principles on which the guidelines are based must be accompanied by the court's explanation as to why the guidelines are inequitable or inappropriate and why the deviation is necessary to meet the needs of the child.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Pursuant to the applicable guidelines codified subsequent to\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, the court could \"exercise [its] discretion consistent with the income scope as set forth in [\u00a7] 46b-215c (a) (2) [of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies] on a case by case basis where the combined income exceeds the range of the schedule. When the combined net weekly income exceeds $4,000, the presumptive support amount shall range from the dollar amount at the $4,000 level to the percentage amount at that level applied to the combined net weekly income consistent with statutory criteria,\n   including ... \u00a7 46b-84(d).... In exercising discretion in any given case, the ... trial judge should consider evidence submitted by the parties regarding actual past and projected child support expenditures to determine the appropriate order.\" Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines (2015), preamble, \u00a7 (e) (5), p. ix.\n   It was therefore an appropriate exercise of the trial court's discretion to adhere to the guidelines schedule and to order the presumptive minimum child support amount of $288 per week in the present case. The plaintiff presented limited evidence to the court that would have justified a higher amount. It was her burden to prove that the presumptive minimum child support amount would be inappropriate or inequitable and that an application of the deviation criteria in the guidelines and the statutory criteria contained in \u00a7 46b-84(d) was necessary. In fact, during the hearing on the defendant's motion for order, the plaintiff never argued that any deviation from the guidelines was justified, nor did she refer to the criteria in \u00a7 46b-84(d). She simply demanded, without any real justification, that the court order both the maximum presumptive amount under the guidelines, as well as a supplemental order based on the defendant's deferred compensation income. Other than the expenses listed on her financial affidavit, the veracity of which had been called into question, she presented no other evidence or any testimony regarding the \"age, health, station, occupation, educational status and expectation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs\" of the parties' minor child; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84(d) ; upon which the trial court could base an order deviating from the guidelines or a supplemental child support order based on income derived from the defendant's deferred compensation plan. The plaintiff did not argue that the child's needs dictated a child support order higher than the presumptive minimum amount. Rather, her arguments focused exclusively on what she asserted was the defendant's cash income from the prior year and his receipt of indeterminate deferred compensation. Her request for a child support order of $895 per week, or $3878 per month, was in excess of the base unallocated alimony and child support amount she had been receiving pursuant to the dissolution judgment, suggesting\n   that she was essentially seeking a continuation of alimony disguised as child support. \"[S]upport award[s] may not be used to disguise alimony award[s] to the custodial parent.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086186\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/80/#p118\">\n    296 Conn. at 105-106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=995%20A.2d%201\">\n    995 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"679048\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/190/345/#p349\">\n    190 Conn. 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=460%20A.2d%201287\">\n    460 A.2d 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We therefore are not persuaded that the court abused its discretion in ordering $288 per week as child support given the high incomes of both parties, the lack of any evidence as to any specialized or particular financial needs of the child, and the fact that other unmodified portions of the dissolution decree address payment for the many typical additional expenses for a child that are likely to arise-daycare, the child's health needs, the cost of his extracurricular activities, including summer camp, and his potential need for future assistance with college expenditures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the same reasons, we conclude that the court acted within its discretion in determining that a supplemental child support order regarding the parties' income of indeterminate amounts was not appropriate or necessary in this particular case.

The specific dollar amount ordered to be paid by the defendant as child support was $288 per week, which was calculated using the parties' combined net weekly determinate income, i.e., their base salaries. Because the parties' combined net weekly income exceeded $4000 using their base salary income alone, it was within the court's discretion not to make any supplemental order with respect to income of indeterminate amount, as such orders in cases in which the net weekly income exceeds $4000 are to be determined on a case-by-case basis. See Regs. Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-2c(c)(1)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The preamble to the guidelines, referring to \"supplemental orders,\" provides in relevant part as follows: \"[S]ometimes when a support order is being set the parties have knowledge of anticipated future payments of an unknown amount, such as a bonus or other incentive based compensation such as stock options, restricted stock, or other stock rights if, and, or when vested or exercisable. While the expected amounts may be substantial, the indeterminate nature of such amounts precludes their inclusion in the gross income of the parent expected to receive them at the time the\n   order enters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In such cases ... the most practical way of considering such amounts for purposes of establishing an appropriate amount of support is to treat the amounts separately from the basic current support order, which is to be paid periodically. ... [W]hen the order is entered, the parties agree or the court orders [that] a percentage of the future amounts shall be obligated as support upon either the receipt of the payment (such as in the event of a bonus), or upon vesting (such as restricted stock or stock options). This approach maintains the integrity of the current support calculation method, since it does not attempt to include\n   indeterminate or speculative amounts in a parent's gross income. It also saves the parties from returning to court to modify the support order to account for receipt of the payment. ... [F]or combined net weekly incomes over $4,000, [supplemental] order[s] shall be determined on a case by case basis consistent with the determination of the child support order ....\" (Footnote added.) Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines (2015), preamble, \u00a7 (g) (7), p. xv.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   It appears from the record that, during the hearing on the defendant's motion for order, the self-represented plaintiff understood that the defendant's deferred compensation would be awarded in future indeterminate amounts, but because she claimed she could determine the amount of such awards on the defendant's 2014 W-2 form, she lumped what he testified was additional\n   vested but undistributed deferred compensation into her calculation of his gross and net weekly income, and asked for the maximum presumptive amount pursuant to the guidelines based on that purported income. At a later point in the hearing, however, she asked the court to consider a supplemental order based on a percentage of the defendant's future bonus or deferred compensation payments of unknown amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the court did not consider the parties' income of indeterminate amounts in making its orders, which is not the case. The court had before it evidence of the plaintiff's bonus income, as well as evidence that future deferred compensation paid to the defendant in indeterminate amounts could be subject to \"claw back,\" and that it was, at times, distributed years after being awarded. There is no indication in the record that the trial court did not consider the defendant's receipt of deferred compensation, as it specifically noted during the hearings on the defendant's motion for order and the motion to reargue that it had considered all of the evidence and testimony, including the parties' financial affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The plaintiff also argues that the parties' indeterminate income should have been included in the court's determination of the parties' gross and combined net weekly income when it calculated the weekly support order. This argument is contrary to\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, and the guidelines' regulations conforming to the legal principles established therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   As described previously, in the preamble to the guidelines, \"the indeterminate nature of such amounts [of bonus or other\n   incentive based compensation] precludes their inclusion in the gross income of the parent expected to receive them at the time the order enters.\" Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines (2015), preamble, \u00a7 (g) (7), p. xv. The ability of a trial court to make supplemental orders is meant to address specifically the variability and speculative nature of income of indeterminate amounts and \"saves the parties from returning to court to modify the support order to account for receipt of the payment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=460%20A.2d%201287\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Even if the court had been provided with sufficient evidence to assign a periodically determined, predictable amount to the defendant's bonus income, it would not be required to be included in the calculation of his gross and net weekly income, but, rather, it would be awarded as a fixed percentage of the routine, consistent annual bonus income in the nature of a supplemental order. Moreover, because the parties' combined net weekly base salaries were already in excess of $4000 per week, the court still had the discretion to order only the presumptive minimum child support amount and to decline to enter any supplemental order, which the plaintiff conceded during the hearing on her motion to reargue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As we have discussed previously in this part of the opinion, there was little evidence presented by the plaintiff to justify the necessity for an award higher than the presumptive minimum amount required under the guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the trial\n   court did not abuse its discretion in determining its child support order, which was in compliance with the guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, we address the plaintiff's claim that the trial court erred in denying her the relief that she sought in connection with her motion to reargue. After the court granted the plaintiff's motion to reargue, it held a hearing and declined to afford the plaintiff the relief she was requesting. When a trial court grants a motion to reargue and merely reaffirms the underlying judgment, as is the present case, its original decision stands.

The plaintiff's primary concern was that the court had misapprehended the facts relative to the total amount of the defendant's income. Counsel for the plaintiff stated: \"My review of the orders of the court are that they are not in accordance with the ... guidelines. ... [The plaintiff] did, in fact, seek to point [that] out to the court ... but perhaps in a different way than I would do at the present time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Essentially,\n   counsel was arguing that the facts surrounding the defendant's income were not clearly presented to the court during the hearing on the defendant's motion for order. This was an improper use of a motion to reargue, and the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant the plaintiff any relief, as the information the plaintiff was relaying to the court did not consist of any prior evidence that the court had misapprehended or that could not have been earlier discovered and presented during the previous hearing on the defendant's motion. The plaintiff also did not request that the court consider any overlooked legal authority or claim. The plaintiff essentially argued, without any additional proof, that the defendant had misrepresented the extent of his income.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the\n   court applied the well-known standard on motions to reargue in making its decision and did not abuse its discretion in denying the relief sought in the motion to reargue. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Light\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%2053\">\n    156 Conn.

The arguments did not establish any predictable certainty as to the future amounts\n   of the defendant's deferred compensation. Counsel for the plaintiff admitted that the value of the defendant's restricted shares of stock \"depends on the value of the stock on the day ... that the restrictions lapse.\" Essentially, the plaintiff, in reargument, told the court that the defendant made too much money to be ordered to pay only the presumptive minimum child support amount of $288, but other than focusing on the amount of the defendant's income, the plaintiff, following an approach disapproved by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   , failed to establish any misapprehended deviation or \u00a7 46b-84(d) criteria that would justify a ruling that the needs of the parties' minor child required the entry of either a higher weekly amount within the range between the minimum and the maximum presumptive amounts, a deviation from the guidelines to a higher weekly amount, or a supplemental order based on the defendant's bonus income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We therefore conclude that the court properly exercised its discretion in ordering the defendant to pay child support based on the presumptive minimum amount for a family whose combined net weekly income exceeds $4000. The presumptive amount of $288 was not rebutted adequately by the plaintiff with proof that a higher amount in compliance with the guidelines was necessary, or that an application of the deviation criteria enumerated in the guidelines, as well as the statutory factors described in \u00a7 46b-84(d), appropriately and equitably justified a higher amount of child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    This figure was derived as follows, as reflected on the guidelines worksheet: The basic child support obligation from the schedule of basic child support obligations for families with combined net weekly incomes of $4000 or higher is $473. The plaintiff's share of this amount, based on the percentage of the parties' combined net weekly incomes that her net weekly income comprises, 39.07 percent, was $185. The defendant's share of the $473 basic child support obligation was 60.93 percent, or $288. If the court had decided to award the maximum presumptive amount of child support, the court would have multiplied the recommended percentage on the schedule of basic child support obligations, 12.04 percent, by the parties' combined net weekly incomes and ordered the defendant to pay 60.93 percent of that amount, or $440.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    On March 16, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion for articulation, which the court denied on July 8, 2016.

There is no basis in law for this use of the motion to reargue, which, for obvious reasons, would have prejudiced the defendant. \"This court has always been solicitous of the rights of pro se litigants and, like the trial court, will endeavor to see that such a litigant shall have the opportunity to have his case fully and fairly heard\n    <em>\n     so far as such latitude is consistent with the just rights of any adverse party\n    </em>\n    ....
