C. L., </em>17.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-7\">I. The supreme court has held that where, there is a wrongful taking of personal property by a party, under A process of the court which was afterwards set aside, that such party cannot show, in mitigation of damages, that the same property was afterwards seized by a valid process m his own favor. Such is the principle laid down in the following cases, <em>(Hanner </em>agt. <em>Wilsey, </em>17 <em>Wend., </em>91; <em>Otis </em>agt. <em>Jones, </em>21 <em>Wend., </em>394; <em>Lyons </em>agt. <em>Yates, </em>52 <em>Barb., </em>237; Peak <em>agt. Lemon, </em>1 <em>Lansing, </em>205).</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-8\">II. But where the property was taken by an attachment, or other process which was set aside, and the sanie property was afterwards seized by process <em>in favor of a third person, </em>then' such fact may be\" shown in mitigation of damages <em>(Higgins </em>agt. <em>Whitney, </em>24 <em>Wend., </em>379)<em>.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-10\">III. The rule so broadly laid down by the supreme court, that where property has been taken under process, which was afterwards set aside, the same party cannot, in any case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>show, in mitigation of damages, that the same property was seized under a valid process in his favor, is not founded upon reason or principle. The supreme court of New Jersey, in reviewing all the cases upon the subject, disapproved of the decisions of this state, and held that it was immaterial, so far as the question of damages resulting from the trespass is comcerned, whether the attachment was sued out by A or B, or whether the property was applied to pay a debt of the plaintiff or any of the creditors who came under the attachment <em>(Hopple </em>agt. Higbee, 3 <em>Zabriskie, </em>342).</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-5\"><em>Second. </em>The court erred in charging the jury that they might give punitory damages. In an action to recover damages for the unlawful taking and conversion of the plaintiff\u2019s property, the value is the proper measure of-damages (B<em>urt </em>agt. <em>Dutcher, </em>35 <em>N. Y., </em>493; <em>Campbell </em>agt. <em>Woodworth, </em>26 <em>Barb., </em>649; <em>S. C. </em>20 N. <em>Y., </em>499; <em>Ives </em>agt. <em>Humphrey, </em>1 <em>E. D.

The question now is, has the former n\\c been abrogated by the Code ? The Code declares, that the answer of the defendant must contain \u201c a staten cut of any new matter constituting a \"defense or counterclaim in ordinary and concise language without repetition.\u201d Code, <em>\u00a7 </em>149.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-7\">'New matter constituting a defense is,' that which admits the cause of action alleged m the complaint, yet constitutes a defense to the same <em>(McKyring </em>agt. <em>Bull, </em>16 <em>N. Y., </em>116; <em>Gilbert </em>agt. <em>Cram, </em>12 <em>How., </em>455; <em>Radde </em>agt. <em>Brockbager, </em>3 <em>Duer, </em>684; <em>Harter </em>agt. <em>Crill, </em>33 <em>Barb., </em>283; <em>Bellinger </em>agt. <em>Craigue, </em>31 <em>Id., </em>537; <em>Carter agt.

Berryman, </em>6 <em>Bosw., </em>679).</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-8\">In <em>Bellinger </em>agt. <em>Crague, </em>(31 <em>Barb., </em>537,) the court said : <em>\u201c </em>The new matter mentioned in section 149 of the' Code is, that which admits and avoids the cause of action set up in the complaint and constitutes a defense <em>(See </em>41 <em>N. Y. </em>116).</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-10\">In <em>Carter </em>agt. <em>Koezly, </em>(16 <em>Abb., </em>147,) in the superior court at general term, Bosworth, J., said: \u201c It is as essential to the sufficiency of an answer under the Code stating new matter as a defense as that of a special plea prior to the Code, that it states facts, which if true, will bar the action, or so much of it, as is attempted to be answered.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-12\">So in an action for seduction, matters in mitigation of damages, may be given in evidence without being pleaded <em>(Travis </em>agt. <em>Barger, </em>614.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-13\">So, in actions for assault or false imprisonment <em>(Hays </em>agt. <em>Berryman, </em>6 <em>Bosw., </em>679.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>So, mitigating circumstance are admissible under a general denial in any action of wrong <em>(Harter </em>agt. <em>Crill, </em>33 <em>Barb., </em>286.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\">III. The evidence was offered in mitigation of damages, and there being no ground of objection specified, it is now too late to raise the objection, that the testimony was not admissible because it had not been pleaded <em>(Walter </em>agt. <em>National Fund Ins, Co., </em>20 <em>N. Y., </em>35; <em>Fake </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>7 <em>Abb., N. S. </em>120.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-6\">III. The evidence offerred is in no sense, a defense in whole of part; when a payment has been made and pleaded, it is a partial defense and admits the cause of action <em>pro tanto. </em>So it is with every defense as such <em>(Mc Kyring, </em>agt. <em>Bull, </em>16 <em>N. Y, </em>116.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-7\">IY. Damages are not the subject of a denial <em>(Hackett </em>agt. <em>Richards, </em>3 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>13; <em>Gilbert </em>agt. <em>Bounds, </em>14 <em>How., </em>46; <em>Woodruff </em>agt. <em>Cook, </em>25 <em>Barb., </em>505.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-8\">. <em>Sixth. </em>This court, as well as the supreme court at a general term has the power and right to examine the evidence at large, and upon the whole case, including the law and the facts, to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial. It is the duty of the court so to do, if it is apparent that injustice has been done, although no objection or exceptions were made or taken on the trial. <em>(Macy </em>agt. <em>Wheeler, </em>30 <em>N. Y., </em>231; <em>S. C., </em>17 <em>Abb., </em>73; <em>Lusk </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>8 <em>Barb., </em>570.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-9\">I. This is in conformity with the decisions of our courts prior to the Code: \u201c A new trial may be asked for on a case, made, on the misdirection of the judge, although no exception is taken to the charge of the judge <em>(Archer </em>agt. <em>Hubbell, </em>4 <em>Wend., </em>514, 517, <em>and </em>note; <em>Hart </em>agt. <em>Coltrain, </em>24 <em>Id., </em>14, 15; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Holmes, </em>5 <em>Id., </em>192.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-12\">II. But on bill, of exceptions the party was entitled to a new trial as a matter of right <em>(Myers </em>agt. <em>Malcolm, </em>6 <em>Hill, </em>292; <em>Northrop, </em>agt. <em>Wright, </em>24 <em>Wend., 22.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-13\">-' III.

There is no such fact set up in the answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-12\">II. There is no proof to that effect in the case; the evidence offered tends to show a joint trespass of defendants,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>and other parties by taking the property first under void attachments of the marine court, and subsequently under attachments in this court issued by the same parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-5\">III. The case of <em>Ball </em>agt. <em>Liney, </em>(44 <em>Barb., </em>505,) only holds, that in an action of trover <em>\u201c </em>the levy upon the property by an execution in favor of a third person against the plaintift in the action, and. the consequent dispossession of the defendant was equivalent to a return of the property to the plaintiff\u201d <em>(p </em>515.) In the case at bar, the defendants were not dispossessed, and the original tresspassers (and not third persons) procured the issuing of the subsequent attachments <em>(See cases on fourth point.)</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b413-6\"><em>By the court, </em>Joseph F.

Such attachments .having been subsequently vacated as irregular. The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $66.30, the value of the goods taken and interest. .Among other questions presented upon this appeal is the following :</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">On the trial the defendants offered to prove: \u201c that on the day those attachments were discharged three other attachments were taken out in this court, that two motions had been made to discharge those attachments, and both those motions had been denied, and the property in question had been held ever since under these attachments, and that this proof was not offered as an excuse for the trespass, but it goes to the question of damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">. To this an objection was interposed by plaintiff, and the court sustained the objection. The defendants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">The ground upon which the proof was rejected is not. \u25a0stated in the case, but is now claimed to be that it was not set up in the answer, and that it could not be received in mitigation of damages unless specialy pleaded.

Y., </em>352,) the court holds that in actions for a balance due for work where there is no averment, as to the time the work was commenced or finished, or the terms of compensation fixed, proof of payments on account may be given in evidence without being pleaded, although payments whether as a defense or in mitigation of damages must be pleaded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">But these cases deal exclusively with the question of partial payments in actions on contract and they declare a long settled rule under the Code, viz., that defense of payment cannot be given in evidence under the general denial, except in the particular case discused in <em>Quinn </em>agt. <em>Lloyd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">In <em>Bush </em>agt. <em>Prosser, </em>(11 N. <em>Y., </em>347,) which was an action of slander it was held, that the answer setting up matters in mitigation of damages, might stand without an answer, setting up justification ; this was the first recognition of the right to plead under the Code matters in mitigation of dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u25a0ages as a partial defense under sections 149 and 150 of the Code, although at common law such matters could not be pleaded, and are not pleaded in England at this time <em>(Linford </em>agt. <em>Lake, </em>3 <em>Hurtst &amp; Norm., </em>276.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The court in <em>Bush </em>agt. <em>Prosser, (supra,) </em>per Allen, J., conclude, that facts constituting a partial defence and tending to mitigate the damages, may and should be pleaded. In <em>Foland </em>agt. <em>Johnson, </em>(16 <em>Abb., </em>239,) which was an action of assault and battery, where matter going merely to mitigate the damages was set up in the answer, the court held under the authority of the cases in the court of appeals above cited, that such matter may be pleaded as a partial defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">, The matter in mitigation there set up was not in the nature ot satisfaction, but concerned only the social condition and habits, &amp;c., of the person claiming damages for injury by the assault and imprisonment complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">This alteration of the rule of pleading before the Code, is one productive of good results in cases where the matter relied upon in mitigation of damages, is really a partial satisfaction of the claim as in the present case, and of which the plaintiff should have notice before the trial. The fact offered to be shown by the defendant, viz., that the property was seized, and held by subsequent valid attachments against the plaintiff is no+ one which the plaintiff can certainly be presumed to be aware of, and be prepared to meet on the trial without notice that it is to be proved ; it does not resemble those matters usually urged in mitigation which refer to the condition, conduct or proceedings \u00f3f the parties, at or before the time of the act for which the action is brought, and which, form a part of the motives, &amp;c., inciting to the offense or circumstances immediately attending it. - I am inclined to follow the views of the supreme court at general term in the third district 1862, <em>Foland </em>agt. <em>Johnson, (supra,) </em>and hold the provisions of the Code, sections 149 and 150, requiring partial defenses to be pleaded, applicable to matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>in mitigation of damages, so far at least as those matters occur after the act complained of as the cause of action, and out of the presence of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u2022 The judge, at special term, on the trial, therefore, properly excluded the evidence offered at folio 199 of the case\u2014 the defense not having been set up in the answer. This question has been examined in view of the fact, that a new trial will have to be granted for the reason stated in the opinion of Judge Robinson, and the defendants in order to avail themselves of any defense in mitigation of damages of the character offered by them and here discussed, must obtain leave to amend and plead it specially.</p>\n<author id=\"b417-6\">Robinson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqo\">But while entertaining the opinion that there was no error of law in the rulings or decisions of the judge upon any matters excepted to, yet there do appear such errors in the course of the trial which so manifestly tended to the prejudice of the defendants as require that a new trial should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\"><em>Ftrst. </em>The plaintifis\u2019 witnesses without the production of any inventory or statement of the goods taken, or any either general or particular description of their quantity, quality, kind or character, or of the separate value of the numerous articles taken, from which any summary or aggregate value might be calculated or computed, were allowed to testify that the stock was worth between $10,000 and $12,000, and so far as appears upon this mere guess or conjecture a recovery has been had of $6,630, while the estimate of defendants experts, founded on an examination accompanied with an inventory, do not exceed $2,500. The opinion of experts is only admissible or of any weight when the facts or particulars upon which it is predicated have been so distinctly proven that any other expert who heard, testified to, or to whom they were communicated, would be in like manner enabled to make estimate or give an opinion. The general statement by a witness of his opinion or conclusion, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the facts and particulars upon which it is founded appear to be within his knowledge, and the process by which his conclusion is arrived at, is improper testimony to be admitted on a trial <em>(Terpenning </em>agt. <em>Corn Ex. Ins. Co., </em>43 <em>N. Y., </em>279), and amounts at most to mere <em>conjecture, </em>and such to a very great extent must have been the character of the testimony introduced by the plaintiffs, and ought not to have prevailed against the more reliable evidence introduced by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><em>Second. </em>The learned judge misdirected the jury in charging them that if one of several trespassers paid the judgment against him <em>\u201c </em>he is entitled to contribution from the others, that as between him and them they must each bear their proportional parts.\u201d As between several wrong doers no such contribution can be enforced <em>(Peck </em>agt. <em>Ellis, 2 Johns., ch. </em>131; <em>Miller </em>agt. <em>Fenton, </em>11 <em>Paige, </em>18; <em>Anderson </em>agt. <em>Murray, </em>33 <em>Barb., </em>354; 1 <em>Hillys on Tort, </em>185, <em>note a). </em>There is an exception to the general rule where one person commits the trespass for the benefit of another, where he has acted innocently and without intent to break the law: in such case he may have recourse for the damages he sustains,, but no such feature was presented in this case. '</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><em>Third., </em>He also erred in charging the jury that the party aggrieved was entitled to interest on the value of the property, by way of additional damages. In actions <em>ex delicto </em>it is in the discretion of the jury to . allow interest or not, and it is error to charge them that the plaintiff is entitled to interest as a matter of right <em>(Sedg. on Dam., </em>386, 5 <em>ed., </em>441; <em>Black </em>agt. <em>Camden &amp; A. B. &amp; T. Co., </em>45 <em>Barb., </em>43; <em>Walrath </em>agt. <em>Redfield, </em>18 <em>N. Y., </em>462).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">For these reasons the judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
