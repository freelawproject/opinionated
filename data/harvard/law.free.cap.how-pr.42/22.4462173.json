It is made to apply by section 8 of the Code. District courts are courts of the state. <em>(Delavan </em>agt. <em>Florence </em>9 <em>Abb., </em>277, <em>note</em>; <em>Conger </em>agt. <em>Vandewater, </em>1 <em>Abb. N.

These are not new courts, organized in 1813, and <em>continued </em>with modification by several acts, chapter 153, laws 1848, chapter 276, of the same year, by the Code, of 1848, section 9, subdivision 16, also section 59. Also by the Code of 1849, section 9, subdivision 16, and section 66. Their name was changed by chapter 324 of laws 1852, to \u201cdistrict courts in the city of New York,\u201d and were further continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>by laws of 1857, <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Batchelor, </em>22 <em>N. Y., </em>140, <em>and </em>142.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-5\">3d. The object of the Code was, <em>\u201cto </em>simplify and abridge the practice, pleadings and proceedings of the courts of this state, (See \u00a3/ie <em>Preamble).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-6\">While the title of the act and the preamble to the act are,, strictly speaking, no part of it, they serve to show the scope and purport of the act, and the inducement which led to its enactment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-7\">They may at times, and in the construction of it. (1 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. Pl., \u00a7 </em>19, <em>10th ed., </em>1.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-8\"><em>4 th. </em>As to the intent of the Commissioners on Practice and Pleadings by section 102 and section 122. <em>(See report dated February 29th, </em>1848, <em>pp. </em>123 <em>and </em>124. J</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-9\">This object should be kept steadily in view by those who. are called upon to interpret or apply its provisions, (Gardiner, <em>J., in Giles </em>agt. <em>Lyons, </em>4 <em>Coms., </em>602.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-10\"><em>5 th. </em>By the amendment of section 122 in 1851, it was intended to more fully cany out the object and design of the lawmakers in the adoption of the Code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-11\">And the section should be construed as if it had originally constituted an enactment. (Henry, <em>J., People </em>agt. <em>Aichinson, </em>7 <em>How., </em>245.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-12\">If the legislature had not intended the amendment to apply to the district courts, they would have excepted them by special words, as they have in section 354 of the Code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-13\">As to the constructions of statutes, he cited 1 <em>Kent\u2019s Com., p. </em>523 <em>and </em>4, <em>10th ed. ; Sedgwick on Stat. and Con. Law, p. </em>247.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-14\"><em>6 th. </em>But all doubt on the question is settled by section 48 of the district court act of 1857, passed after the amendment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-15\">The provisions of section 55 to 64 both inclusive, and of section 68 of the Code, is made to apply to these courts by this section. The 15th subdivision of section 64 makes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>provisions of the Code respecting parties <em>to action, </em>&amp;c., apply to these courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-5\">It will be seen that all the provisions mentioned in this section are to be found in the second part of the Code from section 79 to 122 both inclusive. And the provisions respecting <em>parties to actions </em>are sections 111 to 122 both inclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-6\">All the above provisions are included and mentioned in section 8 of the Code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-7\">It could not be the design of the law that a defendant sued in a district court should be deprived of any benefit he could have had, if he had been sued in another court of record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-8\">He could not move the action to the court of common pleas, and there make his motion, for the reason that the motion to interplead must be made before issue; and this cause could not be removed to the common pleas until .after issue. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-9\">As to the construction put upon section 64 and 68 of the Code, see <em>Young </em>agt. <em>Moore (Code R., </em>143); <em>Hodges </em>agt. <em>Hunt, </em>22 <em>Barb., </em>152.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-10\">That the section applies: <em>Waits Law and P. in actions in Justices Ct., (vol. 1, p. </em>22, <em>ed, </em>1866); <em>Fenn </em>agt. <em>Timpson </em>(4 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>276); <em>Lowber </em>agt. <em>Childs </em>(2 <em>Id, </em>582.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-11\">Section 81 of district court acts does not affect this question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-12\"><em>Second. </em>The appellant acted in the order and not objecting, he consented thereto. <em>(Clapp </em>agt. <em>Graves, </em>26 <em>N. Y., </em>418.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-13\"><em>Third. </em>This was a proper case for interpleader.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-14\">1st. It was an action on contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-15\">2d. The respondent, Rauch was sued in'- the same court,for the same cause of action by another party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-16\">3d. The respondent, Rauch admitted that the amount claimed was due, and that each of the persons claimed the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-17\">The only question was, who was the procuring cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the sale. <em>(Chilton </em>agt. <em>Buttler, </em>1 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>150; <em>Briggs </em>agt. <em>Rome, </em>4 <em>Keyes, </em>424).</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\">There could not be a liability to both parties, as there was one purchaser, and the question was, whose customer he was. And when that question was answered, that determined the controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">4th. There was no collusion between Rauch and the other persons making the claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-7\">5th. Rauch was ready to pay the money into court. <em>(Johnson </em>agt. <em>Lewis, </em>4 <em>Abb., N. S., </em>151; <em>Tanton </em>agt. <em>Groh, </em>39 <em>How., </em>153).</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-8\"><em>Fourth. </em>The granting of the motion was in the discretion of the justice, and is not the subject of review. <em>(Section </em>122 <em>of the Code; People </em>agt. <em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co., </em>29 <em>N. Y., 418; Tanton </em>agt. <em>Groh, supra).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-9\"><em>Fifth. </em>If the court thinks that the appellant is entitled to the money, the court should affirm the judgment as to Rauch, and reverse as to Schmitt. <em>(Section </em>866 <em>of the Code).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-10\"><em>Sixth. </em>If the court should reverse the judgment, the court should direct, that Schmitt restore the money paid to him. <em>(Section </em>369 <em>of the </em>Code; <em>Sheridan </em>agt. <em>Mann, </em>5 <em>How., </em>202-3.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-11\">T. W. Kearney, <em>for respondent, Schmitt.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-12\">Claimed that in the case as made, Schmitt was entitled to the money, as he was the procuring cause of the sale.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b31-13\"><em>By the court, </em>Loew, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2i\">By section 8 of the Code, the provisions of that act from sections 69 to 126 both inclusive, are made applicable to actions in all the courts of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">That'this refers to actions in the district and other inferior courts as well as those in courts of record, is evident from the fact that the same section declares, that the other provisions of the second part of the Code, shall relate to actions in the supreme court and the other courts of record, and also for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>reason, that in the enumeration of the courts of the state in section 9, the justices (now district), and other inferior courts are mentioned. It is quite clear, therefore, that after the passage of the amended Code in 1849, section 122 was applicable to actions in the inferior as well as the higher courts. If, however, there could be any doubt as to whether the provision in regard to interpleader, which was added to that section in 1851, applies to those courts, the same is removed so far as the district courts are concerned by section 48 of the district court act, <em>(Laws </em>1857, <em>chap. </em>344 \u00a7 48). That section makes section 64 of the Code of Procedure applicable to those courts, and the 15th subdivision of the last named section declares, that the provisions of that act <em>(the Code), </em>respecting forms of action, <em>parties io actions, </em>&amp;c., shall apply to said courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Now the provisions concerning parties to actions are embraced with sections 111 to 122 of .the Code, both inclusive.-</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The district courts, therefore, unquestionably possess the power to compel adverse claimants of the same money or property to interplead, if the case be a proper -one.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">It may, perhaps, be doubtful whether the power of compelling parties to interplead, extends to persons residing outside of the respective districts, over which these courts have jurisdiction, but as the defendant, Schmitt submitted himself to the jurisdiction, of the court, and appeared in the action without objection, it is not necessary to express an opinion on that point, at present.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The question then arises, was the case under consideration a proper one for the exercise of that power ?</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">I have no hesitation in saying, that it was. The action was brought to recover commissions, the amount of which was agreed upon by all parties. Moreover, each of the claimants ' insisted, that the purchaser was his customer, that the sale-was effected through his individual agency or exertions, and each of them demanded the same sum o\u00ed money trom the defendant, Eauch.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The latter admitted that he was bound to pay one party or the other; and the only point to be determined was to whom the same was to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The affidavit of the defendant Rauch, I have no doubt was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the court below, to make the order of interpleader.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">It showed :</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">1st. That an action upon contract was pending against him, in which issue had not been joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">2d. That a person, not a party to the action, made a demand of him for the same debt or sum of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">3d. That he was not in collusion with said person.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">4th. That he was indifferent to the claims of either party, and</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">5th. That he himself had no interest in, and made no claim upon the moneys held by him, but was ready and willing to deposit the same in court, to abide the event of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">That, I apprehend, was all that the court required, or was requisite should appear in the affidavit. But if as is contended by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and some of the authorities seem to hold, it be necessary for a party to show in addition that he is ignorant of the rights of the respective claimants, and .does not know to which he can safely pay the money in his hands, then, in my opinion, that clearly appeared from the facts alleged and averments contained in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">I do not know of any case, nor has our attention been called to any, which decide that anything is necessary to be stated in terms beyond what the statute calls for.' Respecting the merits of the case, I am unable to agree with plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that the justice erred in deciding that-the defendant Schmitt was entitled to the moneys deposited in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-14\">Whichever of the two parties was the procuring cause of the sale was entitled to the commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-15\">It is true the plaintiff first called the attention of the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>chaser to the bakery in question; but from the testimony returned to us, it appears that that was all he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">It resulted in no agreement, and the negotiation fell through.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Several months thereafter the defendant Schmitt, without knowing (as appears by his testimony), that Rauch\u2019s attention had previously been called to the said bakery offered the same to him (Rauch) brought him, and the seller together, and finally succeeded in effecting a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Under the circumstances, I do not see how it can be fairly claimed, that the plaintiff found the purchaser, or that he was the procuring cause of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">In my opinion, the court below was correct, not only in making the order of interpleader, but also in rendering judg-. ment in favor of the defendant Schmitt, and I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">The case was first argued at general term, October, 1870, before C. P. Daly, Robinson and Larremore, <em>J. J., </em>and on argument reversed. At the suggestion of Judge Robinson a motion for a re-argument was made, and this motion was granted by general term, November,' 1870, Judge C. P. Daly, Robinson and J. F. Daly. The cause was re-argued at general term before Judge Robinson, Loew and J. F. Daly, when the above opinion was delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Application was made by the appellant at general term, before Judge C. P. Daly, Robinson and Laeremore, for liberty to go the court of appeals, which motion was denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
