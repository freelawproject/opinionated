It follows, that the promise of the plaintiff that there-would be no more blasting after defendant took possession, only amounted to a simple contract or covenant, for a breach of which she would have been liable to him in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">With regard to the carpeting, it may be said that, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the agreement respecting the sale thereof appears to have been made with defendant\u2019s wife still the plaintiff testified, that she believed that the defendant himself was present at the time. Besides, the defendant, in his answer, admits that he agreed to purchase them if he took the house, and it came out in his own testimony, that when he moved his furniture away, he took these carpets with him. True, he says, he did not intend to take them, but it nowhere appears that they were ever returned, and we, therefore, think, the defendant should be held liable for the price of them.The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Daly, Ch. J., and Larremore, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
