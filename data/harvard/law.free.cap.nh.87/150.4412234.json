H. 161, 164; and cases cited. Although this inquiry is one of fact for the trial court, his decision thereon is not necessarily final. \u201cSuch a decision presents the question whether it could reasonably be made and may be set aside when it is apparent the trier of fact unwittingly fell into a plain mistake.\u201d <em>Ingerson </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>79 N. H. 154, 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">It is now established that a verdict may not be set aside as excessive or inadequate \u201cif the evidence on the issue of damages is susceptible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>of opposite inferences.\u201d <em>Andrew </em>v. <em>Goodale, </em>85 N. H. 510, 511; <em>Morrell </em>v. <em>Gobeil, </em>84 N. H. 150; and cases cited. It is the duty of the court to determine whether or not there is evidence to support the verdict. If there is it should not be set aside. If there is not it should be. In passing upon this question it is not the function of the court to pass upon the credibility of witnesses in the same sense in which the jury is required to pass upon it. In dealing with the evidence the court may only go so far as to determine whether there exists in the case any evidence to support the verdict. If there is he must determine whether in the light of the other evidence this supporting evidence is so manifestly false or so clearly incredible or so overwhelmingly contradicted that he is justified in finding as a fact that no reasonable man could believe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In the case at bar there is evidence to support the verdict, and this evidence is neither so incredible, nor is it so manifestly false or mistaken, nor is it so overwhelmed by the defendant\u2019s evidence as to permit the finding that all reasonable men must reject it. The granting of the defendant\u2019s motion compels the conclusion that the court mistook the limits placed upon his authority and invaded the province of the jury by passing upon the credibility of the plaintiff and her witnesses. Under these circumstances it is our duty to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s exception and order</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff for $498.75.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">On October 16, 1934, Mr. Elwin L.
