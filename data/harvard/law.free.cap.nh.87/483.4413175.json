The defendant\u2019s exception is, therefore, unavailing, for it is an elementary rule that such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>objection is waived unless taken before the case is submitted to the trier of fact. Hening, N. H. Digest, Tit., Procedure, 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Even if the procedural difficulty were obviated and the assumption adopted that the evidence is fully transferred, the defendant\u2019s position would not be improved. He failed to prove before the referee a special term of his contract of purchase upon which he relied as a defence. The referee\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s evidence upon this point presents no question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
