This factory was situated south of the crossing where the accident occurred. The train which collided with the decedent\u2019s automobile was one of the defendant\u2019s regular passenger trains, and consisted of only two cars including the car in which the motive power was installed. It usually reached the crossing at 6:40, but on that particular morning it was a few minutes late.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The decedent drove over the crossing at 6:50 from the north and remarked at the time that \u201cthe train had gone down.\u201d She left her daughter and the other occupants of the car at the tack shop; then, again remarking that \u201cthe train had gone by,\u201d turned and drove back toward the crossing. She came \u201cright up on to the crossing without any change in speed\u201d and was there struck by the on-coming train.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The plaintiff contends that the jury were warranted in finding (1) that no train signals were given, (2) that \u201cthe special features and facts\u201d connected with the crossing were such as to require the installation of \u201csome sort of a warning device\u201d at that point, and (3) that the speed of the train was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The defendant\u2019s gasoline-electric engine was equipped with a whistle or loud horn and an automatic bell. Several of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified that the whistle was sounded for the crossing and that the bell rang continuously. There was no testimony to the contrary of a sufficiently positive character to justify a submission of the issue to the jury. <em>Morier </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>81 N. H. 48, 53; <em>Collette </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 210, 216; <em>Peppin </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>86 N. H. 395, 401; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Railroad, ante, </em>246, 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s second contention is equally unavailing. The highway which extended across the track to the tack shop was not an important thoroughfare but merely a rough dirt road. For a distance of 20 or 25 feet south of the crossing the view of the track, which intersected the road at approximately a right angle (see <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 73, 76), was \u201cabsolutely unobstructed.\u201d At that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>point there were trees and bushes bordering the road, but at the time of the accident they were bare of leaves, and did not hide the track completely. So far as appears, the travel on this particular highway was confined to local workmen who were necessarily familiar with the road, track, crossing, and customary movement of trains. The plaintiff does not claim that railroad trafile over the crossing was extensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Reasonable need of special crossing-protection \u201cis to be determined by the special and unusual dangers of the crossing considered,\u201d and among the \u201cspecial features of pertinent bearing\u201d are the \u201cclearness of view of the track,\u201d the \u201camount and character of travel\u201d over the crossing and \u201cthe extent of train movements\u201d there. <em>Stocker </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 401, 405. The application of this test to the evidence before us plainly demonstrates that the dangers connected with the crossing in question were not such as to reasonably require the installation of an automatic warning device or any other special protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">On the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff the speed of the train did not exceed 30 miles an hour. Considering the location of the crossing, its physical surroundings, and the extent and character of the travel over it, such speed, particularly in view of the evidence relating to the train signals, could not fairly be deemed excessive. The case of <em>Stocker </em>v. <em>Railroad, supra, </em>on which the plaintiff relies, presents few parallel facts. In that case the accident occurred at a pleasure resort on a Sunday afternoon when \u201ccrowds of people\u201d were using the crossing and ordinarily no trains passed over the crossing on Sundays. Unlike the situation in <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>75 N. H. 40, 44, it does not appear that the speed was in excess of that allowed by the defendant\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">There is no evidence that the engineer was trying to make up time unless that fact can be inferred from the testimony of a witness who stated that the train was going 30 miles an hour (an estimate which he later changed to 25 or 30), whereas its usual rate of speed was \u201cabout twenty-five.\u201d This witness was standing near the track 300 feet east of the crossing and directly facing the train. There is no evidence that the speed of the train was \u201cso great as to render unavailing the warning of its whistle and bell\u201d (see <em>Huntress </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>66 N. H. 185, 187), nor, as already indicated, is there any evidence that such warning was not given. The witness himself stated that he heard the whistle blow and that the bell rang \u201cright up to the crossing.\u201d Under such circumstances the fact that the speed may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>have been slightly faster than usual is of no significance. <em>Kilmer </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>45 Fed. Rep. (2d), 532, 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">There are no facts which render applicable the plaintiff\u2019s argument that a reduction of speed could be found essential because \u201cthe train was running later than schedule time.\u201d The decedent\u2019s belief that the train had passed could not have been known to the defendant, and there is no claim that this belief was based on any circumstance other than the mere fact that it was a few minutes past train time. The trainmen did not testify, and it does not appear that they were aware of the decedent\u2019s peril in time to have avoided the accident. \u201cThere was no occasion for slackening speed until some danger was apparent. The fact that the train was late is immaterial.\u201d <em>Tucker </em>v, <em>Railway, </em>122 Mich. 149, 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Since there was no evidence from which the jury could reasonably have found that the defendant was negligent, it is unnecessary to consider the contention that the decedent was herself negligent as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b484-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
