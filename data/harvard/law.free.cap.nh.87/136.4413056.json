By every test of common and statute law of this state, the plaintiff was merely a tenant at will of the defendant. <em>Dame </em>v. <em>Dame, </em>38 N. H. 429, 434; P. L., c. 213, s. 15; P. L., c. 357, s. 1. Her right to occupy the land in question was terminable at any time by the defendant providing the statutory notice was given. P. L., c. 357, s. 2; <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Laffee, </em>46 N. H. 505; <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Hibbard, </em>58 N. H. 269. Three months\u2019 notice is \u201csufficient in all cases.\u201d P. L., <em>c. </em>357, <em>s. </em>3. The motives of the defendant in seeking to terminate the tenancy are immaterial. <em>DeWolfe </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>229 Mass. 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">The injunction was improvidently issued and must be dissolved forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">\n<em>Injunction dissolved: bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b192-16\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
