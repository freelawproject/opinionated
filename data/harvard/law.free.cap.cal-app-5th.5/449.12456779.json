(Pen. Code, \u00a7 186.22, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The enhancement for the commission of a felony for the benefit of a criminal street gang requires that the underlying crime be a felony. <em>{Id., </em>subd. (b)(1).) Here we resolve an unanticipated consequence of the passage of Proposition 47, i.e., whether a conviction for street terrorism survives after a felony conviction that is based upon the same conduct has been reduced to a misdemeanor. We hold that it does survive because, unlike with a gang enhancement, a street terrorism conviction does not require a felony conviction; it requires only that the conduct that resulted in the conviction was felonious at the time it was committed. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s order denying resentencing on Luis Donicio Valenzuela\u2019s street terrorism conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">In 2013, Valenzuela stole a $200 bicycle from \u201cthe person\u201d of the victim and was convicted of grand theft. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. (c).) In addition, an enhancement of having committed that crime for the benefit of a gang was found to be true. (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1).) Valenzuela was also convicted of street terrorism <em>{id., </em>subd. (a)), and sentenced to an aggregate term of nine years eight months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">At the time Valenzuela stole the bicycle, taking property from the person of another was classified as grand theft, irrespective of the property\u2019s value. Following the passage of section 1170.18 (Prop. 47) by voter initiative in November 2014, theft of money or property worth $950 or less, even if taken directly from another person, is \u201cconsidered petty theft and . . . punished as a misdemeanor.\u201d (\u00a7 490.2, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">After Proposition 47 took effect, Valenzuela successfully petitioned the trial court to reclassify his theft conviction as a misdemeanor. The effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>doing so precluded attachment of the gang enhancement to that count. The trial court, however, denied his motion to dismiss the street terrorism conviction, finding that the reclassification of his theft conviction as a misdemeanor did not affect that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Valenzuela\u2019s appeal concerns the difference between a gang enhancement, which requires a felony conviction (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)), and a street terrorism conviction, which requires both the active participation in a criminal street gang and the willful promotion of \u201cfelonious criminal conduct\u201d by gang members. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a).) As we shall explain, the street terrorism conviction did not require a felony conviction; it required only that Valenzuela\u2019s conduct (which resulted in the grand theft conviction) was felonious <em>at the time he engaged in it.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Valenzuela claims the trial court \u201cfailed to treat [his] resentencing as a plenary sentencing which required the court to take into account [his grand theft conviction\u2019s] reduction to a misdemeanor when resentencing on [the street terrorism conviction].\u201d But the trial court <em>did </em>treat the resentencing as a plenary sentencing. It resentenced him to a misdemeanor on the grand theft count and struck the enhancements on that count\u2014including the gang enhancement\u2014that did not apply to a misdemeanor conviction. Valenzuela does not argue that his modified sentence on the street terrorism count was unauthorized for a valid conviction; he contends that the street terrorism conviction itself was invalid after the theft conviction became a misdemeanor. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u201cThe gravamen of the [street terrorism offense] is active participation in a criminal street gang.\u201d <em>(People v. Albillar </em>(2010) 51 Cal.4th 47, 55 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 415, 244 P.3d 1062].) To that end, it requires participation in the \u201cfelonious criminal conduct\u201d of at least one other gang member. (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (a); <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 1125, 1134 [150 Cal.Rptr.3d 533, 290 P.3d 1143].) It does not require that anyone sustain a conviction for that conduct. Because the focus is on the commission rather than the conviction of a felony, it is irrelevant that Valenzuela\u2019s theft conviction \u201cshall [now] be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k).) Valenzuela\u2019s reliance on cases such as <em>People </em>v. <em>Park </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 782 [156 Cal.Rptr.3d 307, 299 P.3d 1263], <em>People </em>v. <em>Abdallah </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 736 [201 Cal.Rptr.3d 198], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 461 [154 Cal.Rptr. 851], is misplaced. Those cases involved sentence enhancements predicated on the felony status of a <em>conviction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Grand theft is generally a \u201cwobbler\u201d <em>(People v. Ceja </em>(2010) 49 Cal.4th 1, 7, fn. 6 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 568, 229 P.3d 995]), which \u201cbecomes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u2018misdemeanor for all purposes\u2019 . . . only when the court takes affirmative steps to classify the crime as a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Park, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 793; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Abdallah, supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 745 [construing \u2018\u201cthe phrase \u2018misdemeanor for all purposes\u2019 in section 1170.18, subdivision (k), to mean the same as it does in section 17\u201d].) \u2018\u201cIf ultimately a misdemeanor sentence is imposed, the offense is a misdemeanor from that point on, but not retroactively . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Feyrer </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 426, 439 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 518, 226 P.3d 998], superseded by statute on another ground as stated in <em>Park, </em>at p. 789, fn. 4; <em>People </em>v. <em>Moomey </em>(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 850, 857 [123 Cal.Rptr.3d 749] [\u2018\u201c[A] wobbler is a felony at the time it is committed and remains a felony unless and until the principal is convicted and sentenced to something less than imprisonment in state prison (or the crime is otherwise characterized as a misdemeanor)\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">When Valenzuela stole the bicycle, he engaged in felonious criminal conduct. That is true regardless of his conviction for grand theft and its subsequent reduction to a misdemeanor. The trial court properly declined to set aside his conviction for street terrorism.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The order denying Proposition 47 resentencing on Valenzuela\u2019s street terrorism conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-8\">Yegan, Acting P.
