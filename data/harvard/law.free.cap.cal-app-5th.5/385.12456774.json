On appeal, Colbert contends the trial court erred in ruling these convictions were ineligible for redesignation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">We find no merit to Colbert\u2019s arguments and will affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">I. <em>Factual and Procedural </em>Background<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Following his conviction on four felony counts of second degree burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459, 460, subd. (b)), Colbert was sentenced to a total term of two years eight months in prison, consecutive to a six-year prison term he incurred due to a robbery he committed in San Mateo County while out on bail on the burglary charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">A. <em>Facts relating to count 1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">\u201cOn December 26, 1996, while Susan Welter, the manager of a Shell service station in Campbell, California, saw one Black man talking to a clerk about lottery tickets, another Black man took money from the back office. Welter was shown a photo lineup almost a year after the incident and identified the man who was talking about lottery tickets. The clerk was unable to positively identify anyone.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Colbert, supra, </em>H019315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u2018\u201c[A]bout $300 in cash was taken [in this burglary].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">B. <em>Facts relating to count 2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u2018\u201cOn December 30, 1996, Maria Ramirez, the manager of a 7-Eleven store in Sunnyvale, saw two men enter the store together and then separate. One stayed at the front register and purchased lottery tickets and the other went to a back room, came out of it, and left the store. The other then left the store. Both men were six feet tall and were between the ages of 20 to 30 years old. Appellant is under six feet tall and was 40 years old.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Colbert, supra, </em>H019315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The trial court\u2019s May 12, 2015 order noted that \u2018\u201capproximately $318 dollars [\u00ab'c] was taken [in this burglary].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">C. <em>Facts relating to count 3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\u2018\u201cOn January 6, 1997, Chuong Doan was working at a 7-Eleven store in Los Gatos when two Black men entered the store. The taller man asked to use the restroom, which Doan would not allow. While the shorter man bought a lottery ticket, the taller man \u2018just walked through.\u2019 They then left the store together. Thu Cates, the franchisee, saw a Black man closing the door to the office and later found a bank deposit bag missing. When the man saw Thu, he stated that he was looking for the bathroom. She was unable to identify anyone in a photo lineup. Another employee on her way to work saw two Black men, one with lotto tickets in his hand, get into a maroon car with a dent on the side. She was unable to identify anyone in a photo lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u2018\u201cHowever, a month later, Doan identified appellant from the photo lineup, and at the preliminary hearing in May 1997, he identified appellant as a man who had been in the store. At trial he was unable to positively identify appellant.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Colbert, supra, </em>H019315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">According to the trial court\u2019s May 12, 2015 order, the bank deposit bag taken in this burglary contained \u2018\u201cmore than $3000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">D. <em>Facts relating to count 4</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">\u2018\u201cOn January 27, 1997, Mohammed Elissa, cashier at a 7-Eleven store in Los Gatos, observed two Black men enter the store together and then split up. The shorter one remained at the cash register and was involved with lottery tickets and the taller man proceeded to the wine cooler and \u2018vanished.\u2019 Elissa went to the store office and saw the tall man with a cup of coffee. The man said he was looking for the manager and then he left the area. The tall man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>told the other to pay for the coffee, which he did. The two men left the store together. Elissa wrote down the license plate number of their car. The tall man asked Elissa if there was a problem. No money was missing from the store on January 27. About a week after the incident, Elissa identified appellant in a photo lineup as the shorter man.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Colbert, supra, </em>H019315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">E. <em>Colbert\u2019s petition to redesignate under Proposition 47</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">On May 6, 2015, Colbert petitioned the trial court to redesignate certain of his felony convictions for second degree burglary as misdemeanors pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (f). By written order dated May 12, 2015, the trial court denied Colbert\u2019s petition, finding that he was not eligible for the relief requested. The trial court noted that, in each case, \u2018\u201c[Colbert] and an accomplice entered an establishment and, while one of them distracted the cashier . . . , the other snuck into the non-public areas of the building to commit the intended thefts.\u201d As a result, the offenses were based \u2018\u201cupon entry into a private . . . office area and not a commercial establishment that was open during business hours\u201d and could not qualify as \u2018\u201cshoplifting\u201d under section 459.5. As an additional basis for denying relief, the trial court noted that the amount stolen in count 3 was over $950. Because Colbert and his accomplice employed the same \u2018\u201cmodus operandi\u201d in each theft, it \u2018\u201cstrongly suggests that the amount <em>intended to be taken </em>in each case exceeded $950.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Colbert timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">IE <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Colbert argues he was entitled to redesignation of the three counts at issue because they all involved theft of less than $950 from a commercial establishment during business hours. According to Colbert, the trial court erred by finding that the thefts were based on entry into \u2018\u201cprivate . . . office area.\u201d He further argues it erred by finding, without any supporting evidence, that Colbert and his companion \u2018\u201cintended to take\u201d more than $950 from the stores they entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">A. <em>Overview of Proposition 47</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Under Proposition 47, an individual who has completed his or her sentence for a felony conviction can file a petition with the trial court to have the conviction designated as a misdemeanor, so long as that conviction would have qualified as a misdemeanor under Proposition 47 had its provisions been in effect at the time of the offense. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (f).) If a petitioner\u2019s application satisfies the requirements set forth under section 1170.18, subdivision (f), the court \u2018\u201cshall designate the felony offense or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>offenses as a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (g).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No hearing is necessary in order to grant an application filed under section 1170.18, subdivision (1). <em>{Id., </em>subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Among the crimes reduced to misdemeanors by Proposition 47 \u2018\u201care certain second degree burglaries where the defendant enters a commercial establishment with the intent to steal. Such offense is now characterized as shoplifhng as defined in new section 459.5.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Sherow </em>(2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 875, 879 [191 Cal.Rptr.3d 295].) Section 459.5, subdivision (a), provides: \u2018\u201cNotwithstanding Section 459, shoplifhng is defined as entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950). Any other entry into a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny is burglary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">It is undisputed that Colbert and his accomplice entered into commercial establishments during regular business hours with larcenous intent. The question is whether separate office areas\u2014areas off-limits to the general public\u2014within an establishment are to be considered an undivided part of that commercial establishment under sechon 459.5, or are those areas to be treated separately? In other words, by crossing the threshold into these office areas did Colbert and his accomplice exit the \u2018\u201ccommercial\u201d part of the establishment and enter a discrete area where their thefts could not be considered shoplifting? We think they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u2018\u201cGiving the term its commonsense meaning, a commercial establishment is one that is primarily engaged in commerce, that is, the buying and selling of goods or services. That commonsense understanding accords with dictionary definitions and other legal sources. (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Diet. (2002) p. 456 [\u2018commercial\u2019 means \u2018occupied with or engaged in commerce\u2019 and \u2018commerce\u2019 means \u2018the exchange or buying and selling of commodities esp. on a large scale\u2019]; The Oxford English Reference Diet. (2d ed. 1996) p. 290 [defining \u2018commerce\u2019 as \u2018financial transactions, esp. the buying and selling of merchandise, on a large scale\u2019]; Black\u2019s Law Diet. (10th ed. 2014) p. 325 [\u2019commercial\u2019 means \u2018[o]f, relating to, or involving the buying and selling of goods; mercantile\u2019]; see 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 258.2 (2015) [copyright regulation defining the term \u2018commercial establishment\u2019 as \u2018an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>establishment used for commercial purposes, such as bars, restaurants, private offices, fitness clubs, oil rigs, retail stores, banks and financial institutions, supermarkets, auto and boat dealerships, and other establishments with common business areas\u2019]; Gov. Code[,] \u00a7 65589.5, subd. (h)(2)(B) [defining \u2018neighborhood commercial\u2019 land use as \u2018small-scale general or specialty stores that furnish goods and services primarily to residents of the neighborhood\u2019]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cochran </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 396, 404-405 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 595, 48 P.3d 1148] [quoting dictionary definition of commerce, \u2018 \u201c[t]he buying and selling of goods, especially on a large scale,\u201d \u2019 in interpreting statutory phrase \u2018commercial purpose\u2019].)\u201d <em>(In re J.L. </em>(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1114 [195 Cal.Rptr.3d 482].)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The office areas from which Colbert and his accomplice stole money were not areas in which goods were bought and sold. There was no merchandise offered for sale in those offices, or at least there is no evidence in the record suggesting there was. Colbert was not interested in stealing the goods on offer in these establishments, otherwise he and his accomplice would have remained in the area where those goods were displayed rather than intruding into the private areas where the employees were likely to keep their personal belongings, such as purses and wallets, and where the business was likely to store larger amounts of cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Based on this finding, we need not address the alternative basis for the trial court\u2019s denial of Colbert\u2019s petition, i.e., that Colbert intended to take property valued in excess of $950. Assuming we needed to reach the issue, however, we think the trial court\u2019s finding on this question is not supported by the limited evidence available. It is true that the actual amount Colbert was able to take was less than $950 in three of the four counts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The most that can said about Colbert\u2019s intent is that he and his accomplice intended to take whatever they could, of whatever value, from the offices they entered. There is no evidence that property valued in excess of $950 was customarily present in those back rooms, let alone that Colbert or his accomplice believed that to be the case. It was therefore a matter of circumstance, not intent, which dictated the value of the property taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">III. <em>Disposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The order denying the petition for resentencing is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b411-9\">Grover, J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-14\"> Unspecified statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-15\"> By order dated November 4, 2015, we denied Colbert\u2019s request to take judicial notice of the trial record in Santa Clara County Superior Court case No. 206805. On the court\u2019s own motion, we take judicial notice of this court\u2019s unpublished opinion on the direct appeal from that case. <em>People </em>v. <em>Colbert </em>(Feb. 29, 2000, H019315) (nonpub. opn.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b408-13\"> Our prior unpublished opinion did not specify the amounts taken in each burglary, with the exception of count 4 in which no money was taken. With respect to counts 1, 2 and 3 we derive the amounts taken from the trial court\u2019s May 12, 2015 order denying Colbert\u2019s petition for redesignation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\"> A petitioner is not eligible to have his felonies designated as misdemeanors if he or she has one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) or for an offense that requires registration under section 290, subdivision (c). (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (i).) It is undisputed that these provisions do not apply to Colbert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> To recap, in count 1, $300 was taken. In count 2, Colbert and his accomplice made off with approximately $318. In count 4, they took nothing, but only because the cashier walked into the back office and interrupted Colbert\u2019s accomplice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>RUSHING, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASW\">Dissenting.\u2014I respectfully dissent. In my view, Colbert\u2019s conduct constituted shoplifting under the plain language of Penal Code section 459.5. Because Colbert has established his eligibility for resentencing under Proposition 47, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">In each of the four offenses, Colbert and his companion entered a commercial establishment during business hours. They employed the same modus operandi in each instance: While Colbert distracted the store clerk, Colbert\u2019s companion snuck into a back office to steal cash. In count 1, the companion stole about $300 in cash at a gas station. In count 2, he stole about $318 in cash at a 7-Eleven convenience store. In count 3, he stole more than $3,000 in cash at another 7-Eleven.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In count 4, also at a 7-Eleven, he was interrupted before he could take anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Shoplifting is defined as \u201centering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950).\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459.5, subd. (a).) There is no dispute that each of the four offenses occurred at a \u201ccommercial establishment\u201d\u2014e.g., a gas station and three convenience stores. There is also no dispute that Colbert and his companion entered the establishments during business hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The majority nonetheless reasons that Colbert and his companion did not commit shoplifting because in each instance the companion entered a private back office area to take the property. The majority concludes that, by entering a private office, Colbert and his companion exited the commercial part of the establishment and entered a discrete area.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">I respectfully disagree. Under the plain language of the statute, a defendant commits shoplifting as soon as he or she enters a commercial establishment with the requisite intent. As evidenced by their modus operandi, it is obvious both Colbert and his companion had the intent to commit larceny as soon as they set foot in each establishment. At that point, the offense of shoplifting was complete. Whatever they did after entering the establishment was relevant only insofar as it revealed their preexisting intent to commit larceny. Nothing in the statute or any other authority cited by the majority defines a \u201ccommercial establishment\u201d to exclude nonpublic areas of the structure in question. And I do not think a defendant can \u201cexit\u201d an establishment by entering an office inside it.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The Second District Court of Appeal recently considered this issue in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hallam </em>(2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 905 [207 Cal.Rptr.3d 812], Hallam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>stole an air compressor from an employee restroom at a computer store. After pleading no contest to commercial burglary, he petitioned under Proposition 47 to designate the conviction as misdemeanor shoplifting. The trial court denied the petihon for resentencing on the ground that Hallam did not enter into an area of a commercial establishment to which the public has access and where merchandise is sold. The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that \u201cwe find no indication that shoplifting can occur only in specihc areas of a commercial establishment. Nor does there appear any requirement that the business\u2019s commercial activity must be taking place in the area from which the theft occurs in order to qualify the offense as shoplifhng. The trial court thus added an element to the offense that is absent from the plain language of the statute itself when it determined that appellant\u2019s theft would qualify as shoplifhng only if it occurred in an area of the commercial establishment open to the public where merchandise is sold.\u201d (Hallam, at p. 912.) I find this reasoning persuasive and squarely on point with the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The trial court here also ruled that the offenses did not constitute shoplifting based on a finding that Colbert intended to take more than $950 from each establishment. But the statute sets the threshold at \u201cthe value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459.5, subd. (a).) This language sets the threshold at the objective value of the targeted property, not some subjective dollar amount in the defendant\u2019s mind. This makes sense because the defendant may have no specihc monetary value in mind. Here, for example, Colbert and his companion apparently intended to take whatever cash they could find, regardless of whether it was $300 or $3,000. With the exception of count 3, I see no evidence that the property they intended to take was valued at more than $950. Because the value of the stolen property in counts 1 and 2 fell within the $950 limit, I conclude those offenses constituted shoplifhng.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Accordingly, I would reverse the order denying the petihon and remand for further proceedings to determine Colbert\u2019s eligibility on count 4 and his risk of danger to public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">On November 18, 2016, the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Appellant\u2019s pehtion for review by the Supreme Court was granted February 15, 2017, S238954.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\"> Because the value of the cash stolen in count 3 exceeded $950, Colbert does not contend this count constituted shoplifting.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
