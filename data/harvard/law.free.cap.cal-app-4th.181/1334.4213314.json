Code, \u00a7 422).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a bifurcated proceeding thereafter, the court found true allegations that defendant had suffered a prior serious felony conviction (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)) and a prior strike conviction (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (c) &amp; (e)(2)(A), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(A)). On appeal defendant makes two contentions: (1) the court erred in finding that he failed to demonstrate good cause for the court to conduct an in camera review of the arresting officers\u2019 personnel files pursuant to defendant\u2019s <em>Pitchess</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>motion, and (2) the court erred in denying his section 1118.1 motion for acquittal on count 1. We affirm the judgment in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-12\">On January 11, 2008, defendant called Lorraine Silverman on her cell phone. Defendant had previously lived with his girlfriend at Silverman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>home for two months. Defendant informed Silverman that her son, Jordan, owed him $20 and he wished to come over to collect it. Silverman told him to come over.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">Silverman\u2019s friend, Michael Simmons, was at the home when defendant arrived. After defendant entered the home, Jordan declared that he did not owe defendant $20; rather, he insisted that defendant owed him money. The conversation became heated and Simmons told defendant to leave. Defendant struck Simmons with his right hand, causing a scratch on Simmons\u2019s face. The two then engaged in \u201cmutual combat.\u201d Simmons testified that, before defendant ran out the door, he exclaimed that \u201che was going to come back . . . with his homeboys to kill [them] with guns.\u201d Silverman testified defendant said that \u201che was going to go to the hood, and, he was going to shoot all of [their] windows out, and he was going to take care of [them]\u2014 take [them] out.\u201d Silverman interpreted defendant\u2019s remarks as a threat to kill them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">Simmons called 911, \u201c[b]ecause [he] was frightened that [defendant] was sincere to his words.\u201d Silverman testified that she was frightened. She believed that defendant was capable of carrying out his threat because she had seen defendant with a weapon before. The police responded to the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">While the police were at Silverman\u2019s home, her phone rang.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The phone was on \u201cloudspeaker,\u201d so everyone in the room could hear the conversation. It was defendant; he \u201cwas being threatening.\u201d Silverman testified defendant stated, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m going to . . . kill you. . . . I\u2019m going to take you out.\u2019 \u201d Officer Purcell testified that he heard the voice say he would \u201c \u2018[b]e back tonight to kick your ass, and we got guns, and we\u2019ll be back.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">Officer McGinnis then took the phone and asked defendant where he was.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant replied by giving the officer his cross-streets. The officers responded to the location where they contacted defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-9\">At trial, the People elected to use the threats made during the phone call, not those made earlier at the house, as the basis for counts 1 and 2. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>jury was instructed with CALCRIM No. 3502 which provided, \u201cYou must not find the defendant guilty of criminal threat[s] as charged in Counts 1 and 2 or the lesser included offense of attempted criminal threat[s] unless you all agree that the People have proved specifically that the defendant committed that offense as alleged on January 11, 2008, by the statements made by telephone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">A. Pitchess <em>Motion </em>1. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">Prior to trial, defendant filed a <em>Pitchess </em>motion seeking disclosure of the personnel records of Officers Purcell and McGinnis. In particular, defendant sought \u201cany documents discussing, mentioning, pertaining or relating to reports, complaints, or investigations of: [jQ a. Dishonesty; [][] b. Falsifying police reports.\u201d In defense counsel\u2019s attached declaration he stated his belief that Officer Purcell had falsified information contained in his police report of the incident. Specifically, defense counsel noted that Officer Purcell\u2019s report indicated that both he and Officer McGinnis had heard defendant make threats while on the speakerphone with Silverman. Defendant denied making the statement attributed to him by Officer Purcell. Thus, defense counsel averred that \u201crecords of dishonest[y] and fabrication [by] Officers McGinnis and Purcell would be relevant to disprove that the statements were made.\u201d No police report was attached to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">In their opposition to defendant\u2019s motion, the People specifically and repeatedly objected to the fact that defendant had not attached the police report; thus, they contended that defendant had failed to make a threshold showing of good cause. The People asserted that \u201ca declaration without the police report is deficient for a good cause showing under Evidence Code \u00a7 1043.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Assuming the court found defendant\u2019s failure to attach the police report excusable or remediable, the People argued that the request was too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-9\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s <em>Pitchess </em>motion, defense counsel requested that the court take judicial notice of Officer Purcell\u2019s testimony at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>preliminary hearing regarding the threat\u2014specifically, that he heard defendant say, \u201c \u2018We have got guns, and we will be back.\u2019 \u201d The court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t have objection to take notice of a line testified to at the preliminary hearing just as corroboration to your statement of facts in the motion for that limited basis.\u201d The People objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">Nonetheless, the court ruled, \u201cIt\u2019s what he asserts in his factual basis that the officer\u2019s report says. That\u2019s the statement that the officer heard that was made, and the officer testified in accordance in a way that really doesn\u2019t change anything, but I\u2019ll note your objection but still take judicial notice of it.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">The People then argued that defendant\u2019s factual scenario was not plausible and that his request was overbroad in asking for items of all dishonesty and in asking for Officer McGinnis\u2019s personnel records. The court denied the motion without conducting an in camera review of the files: \u201c[T]he concern of the Court is that if this were to constitute a plausible basis for release of these records, then any time a defendant says, T didn\u2019t say that,\u2019 their peace officer records concerning dishonesty would be discoverable, and I do not believe for one moment that\u2019s what this case law contemplates. This is merely a credibility question, [f] The officer says, \u2018This is what I heard.\u2019 [f] The defendant saying, T never said that.\u2019 [f] If that could be the basis for a <em>Pitchess </em>motion to discover records, that could happen in every single case. And, as such, I do believe it is overbroad. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s adequately supported by factual details which would make the records pertinent or discoverable under the <em>Pitchess </em>procedure. As such, the motion to disclose is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">A trial court\u2019s ruling on a <em>Pitchess </em>motion is based on the trial court\u2019s sound discretion and is reviewable for abuse. <em>(Alford v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1033, 1039 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 63 P.3d 228].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">\u201c[G]n a showing of good cause, a criminal defendant is entitled to discovery of relevant documents or information in the confidential personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>records of a peace officer accused of misconduct against the defendant. [Citation.] Good cause for discovery exists when the defendant shows both \u2018 \u201cmateriality\u201d to the subject matter of the pending litigation and a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 that the agency has the type of information sought.\u2019 [Citation.] A showing of good cause is measured by \u2018relatively relaxed standards\u2019 that serve to \u2018insure the production\u2019 for trial court review of \u2018all potentially relevant documents.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Gaines </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 172, 179 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 627, 205 P.3d 1074].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">The defendant does not need to corroborate or show motivation for the alleged officer misconduct, but must provide \u201c \u2018a plausible scenario . . . that might or could have occurred.\u2019 [Citation.] A scenario is plausible when it asserts specific misconduct that is both internally consistent and supports the proposed defense. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Garcia v. Superior Court </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 63, 71 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 948, 163 P.3d 939].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">\u201c[Defendant need demonstrate only \u2018a logical link between the <em>defense </em>proposed and the pending charge\u2019 and describe with some specificity \u2018how the discovery being sought would support such a defense or how it would impeach the officer\u2019s version of events\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gaines, supra, </em>46 Cal.4th at p. 182, italics added.) The inquiry does not involve \u201can assessment or weighing of the persuasive value of the evidence . . . presented [or] which should have been presented. [Citations.] Indeed, a defendant is entitled to discover relevant information under <em>Pitchess </em>even in the absence of any judicial determination that the potential defense is credible or persuasive.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>\u201cIf the defendant establishes good cause, the court must review the requested records in camera to determine what information, if any, should be disclosed. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 179.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">Here, the trial court could reasonably conclude that defendant failed to demonstrate sufficient good cause insofar as defendant \u201cdid not present a specific factual scenario that is plausible when read in light of the . . . undisputed circumstances.\u201d <em>(People v. Thompson </em>(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1312, 1316 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 884] <em>(Thompson).) </em>Officer Purcell apparently stated in his police report, and testified at the preliminary hearing, that he heard defendant state over the phone to Simmons and Silverman that defendant was going to come back with his friends and \u201c \u2018kick their ass.\u2019 \u201d Officer Purcell alleged he further heard defendant state \u201cwe got guns and we\u2019ll be back.\u201d This statement formed the core of the charges against defendant. However, defendant simply denied making the statement attributed to him; he did not deny making the phone call or engaging in a telephonic conversation with Simmons and/or Silverman at the time the police were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>present at the house.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendant failed to present \u201can alternate version of the facts\u201d regarding the reason and nature of his telephonic exchange with Simmons and Silverman. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1318.) Therefore, the trial court acted within its discretion to the extent that it made a \u201ccommon sense\u201d determination that defendant\u2019s version of events was not plausible \u201cbased on a reasonable and realistic assessment of the facts and allegations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">We find <em>Thompson </em>particularly instructive. There, an undercover police officer arrested the defendant after purchasing drugs from him. <em>(Thompson, supra, </em>141 Cal.App.4th at p. 1315.) The defendant filed a <em>Pitchess </em>motion, seeking discovery of the personnel records of numerous officers involved in the undercover sting operation. In that motion, the defendant simply denied all the allegations contained in the police report. The court denied the motion determining that the defendant failed to show good cause to compel it to conduct an in camera review of the documents. <em>(Thompson, </em>at pp. 1315-1317.) The appellate court agreed, holding that the defendant failed to provide a factual showing that was \u201cplausible by any rational standard.\u201d This was because the defendant did not \u201cpresent a factual account of the scope of the alleged police misconduct, and [did] not explain his own actions in a manner that adequately supported] his defense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1315, 1317.) This is precisely the case here. Indeed, if anything, defendant here presented less of an explanation of the factual circumstances surrounding the alleged offenses than did the defendant in <em>Thompson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\"><em>Warrick v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1011 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 2, 112 P.3d 2] is distinguishable. There, three officers noticed the defendant standing next to a wall in an area known for violent crime and drug activity. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1016.) The defendant was looking at a clear plastic bag in his hand containing \u201c \u2018off-white solids.\u2019 \u201d The officers exited their patrol car; the defendant fled, dumping copious amounts of \u201coff-white lumps\u201d on the ground. One of the officers retrieved 42 such \u201clumps.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant was in possession of an empty plastic bag when arrested, and was charged with possession of cocaine for sale. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1016-1017.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">There, the defendant filed a <em>Pitchess </em>motion seeking release of any prior citizen complaints against all three officers for making false arrests, false police reports, or planting evidence. <em>(Warrick v. Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 1017.) In defense counsel\u2019s attached declaration, he averred that the defendant had run from the police due to an outstanding parole warrant, while \u201cthere were \u2018people pushing and kicking and fighting with each other\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>as they collected from the ground objects later determined to be rock cocaine. After two officers retrieved some of the rocks, an officer told defendant, \u2018 \u201cYou must have thrown this.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[The defendant denied possessing or discarding any rock cocaine.\u201d He contended that, not knowing who discarded the cocaine, the officers must have speculated that he was responsible because he ran. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court denied the motion. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1018.) The appellate court affirmed, holding that, although the defendant had presented a specific factual scenario of police misconduct, he failed to articulate a plausible factual foundation. The California Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the appellate court, holding that the defendant\u2019s version of events was plausible, requiring in camera review of the officers\u2019 personnel files. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1018, 1027.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">However, contrary to the circumstances of the present case, the defendant in <em>Warrick </em>\u201cdid not merely make bald assertions that denied the elements of the charged crime. He provided an alternate version of the events that was plausible, if not entirely convincing. The defendant presented a \u2018specific factual scenario\u2019 that explained his presence in the area, his running from the police, and a reason for the police to conclude that he had discarded the rock cocaine they recovered. And the scenario supplied, at least by inference, an explanation for the cocaine being on the ground, namely that others had discarded it to avoid arrest.\u201d <em>(Thompson, supra, </em>141 Cal.App.4th at p. 1318.) Here, defendant presented no such alternative, specific, factual scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">The People additionally cite <em>People v. Hustead </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 410 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 875], in order to distinguish the present case. In <em>Hustead, </em>an officer initiated a traffic stop of the defendant. The defendant failed to yield. The officer testified that he was subsequently involved in a pursuit of the defendant in which the defendant committed numerous traffic violations, collided with another vehicle, and nearly struck two pedestrians. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 413.) The defendant filed a <em>Pitchess </em>motion seeking discovery of the officer\u2019s personnel records for material relevant to whether he had been accused of falsifying reports in the past. <em>(Hustead, </em>at pp. 415-418.) The defendant averred, via defense counsel declaration, that he did not drive dangerously and did not drive the route alleged by the officer; hence, he maintained the officer\u2019s report contained material misstatements and false accusations. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 416\u2014417.) The appellate court reversed, holding that the defendant\u2019s \u201callegations were sufficient to establish a plausible factual foundation for an allegation that the officer made false accusations in his report.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 417.) Thus, unlike defendant in the present case, but similar to the defendant in <em>Warrick, </em>the defendant in <em>Hustead </em>presented a plausible alternative factual scenario rather than merely denying the elements of the charge against him. The trial court\u2019s ruling was within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>B. <em>Section 1118.1 Motion</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">McKinster, Acting P.
