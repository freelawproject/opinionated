Luckenbach\u2019s (collectively plaintiffs)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motion for summary judgment. On appeal, defendants challenge the trial court\u2019s (1) denial of their motions for leave to amend and supplement their answer and cross-complaint, and (2) grant of plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary adjudication of issues and summary judgment. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Plaintiffs own a residential subdivision lot (lot 102) in the town of Bethel Island, California. Defendants own the residential subdivision parcel (comprised of lot 103 and a small portion of lot 104), adjacent to plaintiffs\u2019 lot. Both lots have frontage on Taylor Slough, a navigable waterway. This matter involves the question of the proper boundary line between the parties\u2019 areas of littoral rights<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for use of the water adjacent to their upland property.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">On September 29, 1998, plaintiffs filed a complaint for damages for trespass to real property and for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction. The complaint alleged that a houseboat moored to defendants\u2019 dock extended onto plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>On August 26, 1999, plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint, in which they added Victor and Alicia Levchenko, plaintiffs\u2019 neighbors to the south and owners of lot 101, as defendants, so that in the event correction of an alleged survey error altered the dividing line between the properties of plaintiffs and the Walker defendants, the dividing line between plaintiffs and the Levchenkos would also be changed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition to the cause of action for trespass, the first amended complaint also added causes of action for declaratory relief regarding the location of the dividing lines between the parties\u2019 littoral rights; declaratory relief acknowledging plaintiffs\u2019 paramount rights conferred by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, authorization to relocate their dock; declaratory relief stating that defendants\u2019 mooring of their houseboat partially in front of plaintiffs\u2019 parcel violated covenants, so-called \u201cCC&amp;Rs\u201d (covenants, conditions, and restrictions), that encumbered their parcel; relief from nuisance due to defendants\u2019 mooring of their houseboat partially in the area of littoral rights belonging to plaintiffs; and relief from nuisance due to defendants\u2019 violation of the CC&amp;R\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">On December 27, 2000, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of issues, claiming, inter alia, that the area in question was within the area of navigable water owned by the State of California and that the parties\u2019 rights were governed under leases and permits issued by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Also on December 27, 2000, plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of issues (summary adjudication motion).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">On January 29, 2001, the trial court issued its tentative ruling denying defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granting plaintiffs\u2019 request for summary adjudication on all but one cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Also on January 29, 2001, defendants filed a cross-complaint to quiet title to the disputed portion of Taylor Slough, pursuant to a lease they had obtained from the State Lands Commission (Commission) on August 12, 1991. Then, on January 30, 2001, defendants requested and the trial court granted a continuance for discovery, which the court ordered reopened \u201conly with regard to the State Lands Comm[ission].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>On May 18, 2001, the Commission submitted a letter brief to the trial court, in which it stated that it had used the \u201cColonial Method\u201d to determine the sideline property projections on the curved shoreline. Using that method, the Commission concluded \u201cit is apparent that the Walkers\u2019 houseboat does extend over the sideline so determined. And drawing the Luckenbach-Walker sideline in this manner demonstrates that the Walkers will have more than sufficient shoreline to support the houseboat and pier if the structures are relocated upstream.\u201d In light of this determination, the Commission indicated that it would not be renewing defendants\u2019 lease, which would be up for renewal in August 2001, as to the area beyond their sideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">On October 5, 2001, defendants served notice that they were dropping their summary judgment motion on the grounds that (1) their lease had expired, (2) they had learned that the state may not own the submerged land, and (3) upon discovery that certain facts in the parties\u2019 joint stipulation of facts were not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">On February 5, 2002, over one year after the first hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 summary adjudication motion, the trial court held another hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 motion and took the matter under submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">On February 8, 2002, defendants filed a motion seeking leave to amend their answer and cross-complaint. In their motion, defendants stated: \u201cThe amended pleadings are designed to take into account facts uncovered in October 2001 as to the ownership of the subject portion of Taylor Slough.\u201d In particular, the motion asserted that \u201cit has become apparent that the area of the current configuration of Taylor Slough at issue in this action is not a part of the original portion of Taylor Slough that existed, circa 1850, when California received title to submerged lands upon achieving statehood.\u201d Based on these facts, defendants\u2019 proposed amendments would add defenses and causes of action for adverse possession and a prescriptive easement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">On March 26, 2002, the trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">On May 4, 2002, the trial court filed an informal ruling\u2014followed by an order on February 3, 2003\u2014granting in part plaintiffs\u2019 summary adjudication motion. In its order, the trial court granted summary adjudication as to all causes of action except for the third cause of action for declaratory relief regarding defendants\u2019 violation of the CC&amp;R\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>On March 4, 2003, plaintiffs filed a final motion for summary adjudication of issues or, in the alternative, summary judgment. In that motion, plaintiffs requested summary judgment as to defendants\u2019 cross-complaint, asserting that no issues raised in the cross-complaint remained unresolved. Plaintiffs also offered to have the trial court dismiss the third cause of action in their first amended complaint, in order to completely resolve the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">On May 5, 2003, defendants filed a motion seeking leave to file a supplemental answer and cross-complaint to allege that the submerged land was not owned by the state and to assert causes of action for a prescriptive easement and adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">On July 14, 2003, the trial court entered an order denying defendants\u2019 motion to supplement their answer and cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On September 19, 2003, the trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and entered judgment thereon. On February 17, 2004, plaintiffs filed a notice of entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">On March 11, 2004, defendants filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">On November 8, 2005, this court ordered that all proceedings in this appeal be stayed, in light of bankruptcy proceedings initiated by Alvin H. Luckenbach on October 12, 2005. On March 10, 2008, plaintiffs advised the court that the United States Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of California, had filed an order lifting the stay as to this appeal. On June 19, 2009, we therefore ordered that the stay previously imposed be lifted, and this appeal was restored to active status. We also granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to substitute John T. Kendall, United States Bankruptcy Trustee, etc., as respondent, in place of Alvin H. Luckenbach.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\"><em>DISCUSSION </em>L, II.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">III. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Grant of Plaintiffs\u2019 Motions for Summary Adjudication and Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">Defendants contend the trial court improperly granted plaintiffs\u2019 summary adjudication and summary judgment motions because there were several triable issues of material fact that precluded the granting of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>A motion for summary adjudication or summary judgment \u201cshall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) \u201cIn moving for summary judgment, a \u2018plaintiff . . . has met\u2019 his \u2018burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if\u2019 he \u2018has proved each element of the cause of action entitling\u2019 him \u2018to judgment on that cause of action. Once the plaintiff .. . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant ... to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. The defendant . . . may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials\u2019 of his \u2018pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but, instead,\u2019 must \u2018set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(l).)\u201d <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.

Richard S. Flier) granted summary adjudication of the first cause of action in plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint, \u201cDeclaratory Relief Re: Location of Littoral Rights,\u201d declaring \u201cthat the location of the boundary separating the Luckenbach littoral rights from the Walker littoral rights is \u2018LINE \u201cB\u201d \u2019 as depicted upon the survey map [attached to the order as exhibit A].\u201d (A copy of the survey map is attached as appendix A at the end of this opinion.) The court found \u201c[t]here is no disputed issue of fact with respect to the boundary, but only questions of law, which are resolved in plaintiffs\u2019 favor in accordance with applicable authority. ([See <em>Fraser\u2019s etc. P. Co. </em>v. <em>Ocean Park P. Co. </em>(1921) 185 Cal. 464, 472-473 [198 P. 212] <em>(Fraser\u2019s); Marks </em>v. <em>Whitney, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 251, 256, 262-263].) The boundary line is not determined by any projection or extension of the upland property lines into the water. Rather, it is determined by a line drawn into the water which is perpendicular to the shore line, that is, to the general course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the shore at that point. The location of the boundary line is also consistent with the State Lands Commission\u2019s \u2018Colonial Method\u2019 of determining boundaries for leasable water areas. (See State Lands Commission\u2019s letter brief filed on May 18, 2001.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The trial court granted summary adjudication of plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action, \u201cDeclaratory Relief Re: Paramount Rights Conferred by Army Authorization,\u201d declaring \u201cthat: (a) plaintiffs are authorized to construct a dock upon a portion of the area occupied by the WALKER houseboat, by virtue of a written authorization letter from the United States Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, and that defendants WALKER have no rights in that area which are paramount to such authorization; and (b) the aforesaid authorization from the United States Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, confers upon the plaintiffs the right to construct a dock, which right is paramount to any alleged rights of anyone else to moor a boat in the same location, ['ll] Plaintiffs have federal authority to relocate their dock in an area which is encroached upon by defendants\u2019 houseboat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The trial court also granted summary adjudication of plaintiffs\u2019 fourth cause of action, \u201cRelief from Nuisance due to Encroachment on Littoral Rights.\u201d The court ordered that \u201ca permanent injunction shall be issued enjoining defendants WALKER from in any way encroaching upon the littoral rights belonging to the plaintiffs, including an encroachment by mooring a boat (such as a houseboat) within any part of plaintiffs\u2019 littoral rights.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The trial court granted summary adjudication of the plaintiffs\u2019 fifth cause of action, \u201cRelief from Nuisance due to Violation of CC&amp;Rs,\u201d ordering that \u201ca permanent injunction shall be issued enjoining defendants WALKER from in any way mooring a houseboat, or other type of floating residence, at the structure referred to in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit No. 5118. . . . [1] The houseboat is a floating residence, and thus violates the CC&amp;Rs. Defendants have failed to show that plaintiffs do not have standing or the right to enforce the CC&amp;Rs. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Finally, the trial court granted summary adjudication of the plaintiffs\u2019 sixth cause of action, \u201cRelief for Trespass to Littoral Rights,\u201d and ordered that \u201ca permanent injunction shall be issued enjoining defendants WALKER from in any way encroaching upon the littoral rights belonging to the plaintiffs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>including an encroachment by mooring a boat (such as a houseboat) within any part of plaintiffs\u2019 littoral rights.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">1. <em>Waiver of Second and Fifth Causes of Action</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\n<em>2. Applicable Law Regarding Littoral Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The California Supreme Court has explained the rights of an upland property owner with respect to littoral rights: \u201cA littoral owner has a right in the foreshore adjacent to his property separate and distinct from that of the general public [citation]. This is a property right and is valuable, and although it must be enjoyed in due subjection to the rights of the public, it cannot be arbitrarily or capriciously destroyed. [Citation.] A littoral owner can enjoin as a nuisance interference by a private person with this right. [Citation.] A littoral owner has been held to have the right to build a pier out to the line of navigability; a right to accretion; a right to navigation (the latter right being held in common with the general public) [citations]; and a right of access from every part of his frontage across the foreshore [citation]. This right of access extends to ordinary low tide both when the tide is in and when the tide is out. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Marks </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>supra, 6 Cal.3d at pp. 262-263, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Moreover, it is owners of land abutting on \u201cthe waterfront line who, under legal sanction, may . .. build into the deeper public waters beyond.\u201d <em>(Shirley v. City of Benicia </em>(1897) 118 Cal. 344, 346 [50 P. 404].) Erection of a private wharf that would preclude upland owners from building a wharf on part of their waterfront constitutes a nuisance in the navigable waters of the state, which the upland owner may have abated. <em>(Shirley </em>v. <em>Bishop </em>(1885) 67 Cal. 543, 546 [8 P. 82]; 63 Cal.Jur.3d (2005) Water, \u00a7 774, p. 128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">In <em>Fraser\u2019s etc. P. Co. v. Ocean Park P. Co., supra, </em>185 Cal. 464 <em>(Fraser\u2019s), </em>our Supreme Court discussed the proper line of division between adjoining littoral landowners. <em>Fraser\u2019s </em>was concerned with the boundaries of a city over the waters of the ocean and whether a pier built out into the ocean by a private owner was fully within the jurisdictional limits of the City of Santa Monica or partly within the limits of the City of Venice, for purposes of determining the proper tax assessments against the cities. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 471.)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">The Supreme Court in <em>Fraser\u2019s </em>corrected the parties\u2019 misunderstanding of the method of determining the littoral boundary: \u201cAll the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>appear to have assumed that the division line which marked the jurisdiction of the respective cities over the water beyond high-tide line would be the line of the boundary extended into the water. It appears that this line is not perpendicular to the shore line at that point, but strikes it at an angle, less than ninety degrees on the Venice side and more than ninety degrees on the Santa Monica side. Under the law applicable to such matters it is not true that the rights of adjoining owners of land bordering upon tide water, or upon a navigable lake or stream, in the land under the water upon which both tracts abut are to be ascertained by extending the line of the boundary between them in its original direction into the water, to the center thereof in the case of a stream, or indefinitely in the case of the ocean. On the contrary, the rule is that the area over which such rights as each proprietor may have in the land under the water upon which his tract abuts, and to the use of the water covering the same, is not fixed by extending his boundary line into the water in the direction of the last course ending at the shore line, but is fixed by a line drawn into the water perpendicular to the shore line; that is, to the general course of the shore line at that point. Unless extraordinary conditions occur, this is the rule to be applied in defining the respective rights of such owners to the space in front, under, upon, and in the water. If accretions occur in front of the land the boundary line between them as to such accretions is a line extending into the water perpendicular to the original shore line in its general course and not by the line of the boundary extended in its original direction. If this were not the case it will be seen that where the boundary strikes the shore line at an acute angle the rights of one proprietor would extend in front of the land of the other so as to practically cut him off from the use of the water. The authorities are all to the effect that this is not the case. [Citations.]\u201d <em>{Fraser\u2019s, supra, </em>185 Cal. at pp. 472-473.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The court then noted that the same general rule applied to the boundaries of municipal jurisdictions over the waters of the ocean, and that the line dividing the jurisdictions of Santa Monica and Venice over the ocean \u201cis a line drawn from the intersection of that boundary with the shore line into the ocean in a direction perpendicular to the general course of the shore line at that place. If the shore line is circular it will be perpendicular to a tangent drawn on the circle at the point of such intersection.\u201d <em>(Fraser\u2019s, supra, </em>185 Cal. at p. 473.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Later, in <em>Swarzwald v. Cooley </em>(1934) 220 Cal. 438, 443 [31 P.2d 381] (Swarzwald), our Supreme Court stated that it interpreted <em>Fraser\u2019s </em>\u201cas setting forth the general rule of the common law by which accretions are to be subdivided.\u201d The <em>Swarzwald </em>court noted there are exceptions to the rule under certain circumstances. \u201c \u2018For instance, in applying the rule to the ancient margin of the river, to ascertain the extent of each proprietor\u2019s title on that margin, the general line ought to be taken, and not the actual length of the line on that margin if it happens to be elongated by deep indentations or sharp projections. In such case, it should be reduced by an equitable and judicious estimate, to the general available line of the land upon the river.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The court further stated; \u201cThere is nothing in the case of <em>Fraser\u2019s . . . </em>at variance with these principles or with the exceptions noted to the general rule. By use of the phrases \u2018at that point\u2019 and \u2018at that place\u2019 the court did not mean to limit its other pronouncement defining the original line as the \u2018general course\u2019 of the \u2018original shore line.\u2019 One point will not determine a line nor two points an arc. At least three points are necessary to describe an arc. What is meant by the original general shore line is the general course of the line marking the margin of the properties as a whole and it is altogether possible that to determine it in some cases it would be necessary to consider points in the shore line nearby the particular margin in question.\u201d (Swarzwald, <em>supra, 220 </em>Cal. at p. 445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">3. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The shoreline in this case, as shown on the 1944 subdivision map utilized by the court and the parties, comes to a point where the dividing line between the properties meets the shore, and then angles slightly up from that point on both sides, which plaintiffs describe as looking something like the bottom of a stop sign. Plaintiffs\u2019 surveyor, Ronald C. Greenwell, made three boundary measurements on the map. Line A is a line perpendicular to defendants\u2019 shoreline boundary; line C is a line perpendicular to plaintiffs\u2019 shoreline boundary. These lines make a \u201cV\u201d out from the dividing line at the shore. Line B, which the trial court found to be the proper line dividing the parties\u2019 areas of littoral rights, comes out from the base of the \u201cV\u201d and is \u201cthe mathematical equal split\u201d of lines A and C. (See appendix A.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Defendants argue that summary adjudication on the first cause of action, regarding the boundary dividing the parties\u2019 areas of littoral rights, was improper because there was a factual dispute as to the location of the original shoreline. According to defendants, the <em>Fraser\u2019s </em>rule requires a determination of the shoreline at the time California became a state in 1850. However, because the shoreline map used to determine the boundary line was a 1944 subdivision map and because both the Commission and defendants\u2019 expert, Roy Minnick, questioned whether dredging and other activities over the years had changed the location of Taylor Slough, defendants claim there has been no determination of the original shoreline in this case, as required by <em>Fraser\u2019s. </em>Defendants also claim that, under <em>Swarzwald, </em>it was necessary to make an equitable determination of the boundary, and that such a determination is not compatible with summary adjudication. They further claim that the mathematical formula utilized to arrive at \u201cline B\u201d as the dividing line was flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Defendants failed to raise these issues either in their opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 summary adjudication motion or in their response to plaintiffs\u2019 separate statement of undisputed facts. In their response to plaintiffs\u2019 separate statement, defendants\u2019 sole challenge to the survey method or map used by plaintiffs\u2019 land surveyor, was an objection that the term \u201cshoreline\u201d was \u201cambiguous in that it could mean the ordinary high water line, the ordinary low water line, or other points. The Exhibit prepared by Greenwell [plaintiffs\u2019 surveyor] does not identify the high water mark, low water mark, tidal zone or submerged lands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Defendants did not challenge the results of plaintiffs\u2019 survey until they raised the issue in their opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent summary judgment motion, by which time the littoral rights issues to which the map of the shoreline and mathematical formula pertained had already been adjudicated. Accordingly, defendants have waived these issues on appeal. (See <em>Mills v. Forestex Co. </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 625, 640 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 273] [appellate court \u201cwill consider only those facts that were before the trial court [i.e., contained in parties\u2019 separate statements] when it ruled on the motion[]\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In any event, even were we to address defendants\u2019 claims regarding determination of the original shoreline and the proper dividing line of the parties\u2019 areas of littoral rights, we would find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">First, with respect to the alleged failure to determine the course of the original shoreline, <em>Swarzwald </em>explained the term \u201cancient shore line\u201d discussed in Fraser\u2019s: \u201cWhat is meant by the original general shore line is the general course of the line marking the margin of the properties as a whole.\u201d <em>{Swarzwald, supra, 220 </em>Cal. at p. 445.) Thus, the question is not what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>shoreline looked like at the earliest possible date. Rather, it is what the general course of the shoreline is \u201cif [the actual shoreline] happens to be elongated by deep indentations or sharp projections.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In the present case, defendants presented no evidence that the general course of the shoreline was not that depicted in the 1944 subdivision map used to determine the littoral boundary between the properties. Thus, there was no material factual dispute on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Second, regarding defendants\u2019 claim that <em>Swarzwald </em>sets forth the rule that any determination of littoral boundaries requires an equitable determination, on the contrary, <em>Swarzwald </em>states an <em>exception </em>to the general rule set forth in <em>Fraser\u2019s, </em>and holds that an equitable determination is required only when \u201cdeep indentations or sharp projections\u201d distort the shoreline such that the general rule of <em>Fraser\u2019s </em>cannot equitably be utilized in determining the boundaries. <em>(Swarzwald', supra, </em>220 Cal. at pp. 443-444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In this case, while there is a slight angle in the shoreline where the parties\u2019 property line meets the shore, that angle is not equivalent to the dramatic indentations or projections described in <em>Swarzwald </em>that required equitable consideration to avoid an unjust result. Hence, <em>Fraser\u2019s </em>general rule applies, just as it does when the shoreline is circular, and the trial court properly determined the littoral boundaries in this case using that method. (See also <em>Emerson v. Taylor, supra, 9 </em>Me. 42, 44-45 [discussing Colonial Method, which was used in this case by the Commission to arrive at same result reached by trial court].)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Finally, defendants contend their adverse possession and prescriptive rights claims raised a triable issue of material fact\u2014whether the state did or did not own the land\u2014requiring denial of plaintiffs\u2019 summary adjudication motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>despite the fact that the trial court did not permit them to file amended or supplemental pleadings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u201c[Sjummary judgment cannot be denied on a ground not raised by the pleadings. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bostrom </em>v. <em>County of San Bernardino </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1654, 1663 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 669], italics omitted.) In particular, as relevant here, \u201c[a] party claiming the right to use water by adverse possession for the statutory time must set up the same as a defense in his answer.

Thus, defendants were precluded from raising claims of adverse possession and prescriptive rights when they did not raise these issues in their answer or cross-complaint.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In conclusion, the trial court properly granted summary adjudication of issues on the first, fourth and sixth causes of actions in plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint related to plaintiffs\u2019 littoral rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">B. <em>Grant of Summary Judgment</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\n<em>DISPOSITION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The judgment is affirmed.

Taylor </em>(1832) 9 Me. 42, 44-45, the Supreme Court of Maine discussed the so-called Colonial Method for determining the littoral boundary on a shoreline that is not straight. The court explained: \u201cThe mode of applying the principle is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>this. Draw a base line from the two comers of each lot, where they strike the shore; and from these two comers, extend parallel lines to low-water-mark, at right angles with the base line. If the line of the shore be straight, as in the case before us, there will be no interference in running the parallel lines. If the flats lie in a cove, of a regular or irregular curvature, there will be an interference in running such lines, and the loss occasioned by it must be equally borne or gain enjoyed equally by the contiguous owners . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\"> In their opening brief, defendants state that the parties\u2019 docks have been built across the foreshore to the line of navigability. In their reply brief, they assert, without citation to the record, that \u201c[i]t is common knowledge throughout the proceedings\u201d that the docks are dozens of feet beyond the line of navigability, and that littoral rights do not apply past the line of navigability. Defendants have waived this issue both by failing to articulate it in their opening brief and failing to cite to the record to support the assertion in their reply brief. Moreover, as previously noted, upland owners of waterfront land, \u201cunder legal sanction, may . . . build into the deeper public waters beyond.\u201d <em>(Shirley </em>v. <em>City of Benicia, supra, </em>118 Cal. at p. 346.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Defendants also cite <em>Woods v. Johnson (1966) 241 </em>Cal.App.2d 278 [50 Cal.Rptr. 515], for the proposition that plaintiffs are not entitled to an injunction against the mooring of defendants\u2019 houseboat, absent a factual showing and weighing of evidence to determine \u201cwhether the few feet on [plaintiffs\u2019] side of the \u2018boundary\u2019 occupied by [defendants\u2019] boat were <em>necessary </em>to [plaintiffs\u2019] \u2018reasonable access\u2019 to navigable water.\u201d <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>however, is plainly distinguishable from the present case in that, there, \u201c[a]dmittedly, respondents\u2019 fill does not encroach on lands of appellants, nor does it lie upon land directly lakeward to appellants\u2019 property.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 280.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\"> We further observe that defendants\u2019 allegations regarding state nonownership of the submerged land were based on speculation. For example, in their response to plaintiffs\u2019 separate statement of material facts, they disputed that plaintiffs\u2019 and defendants\u2019 parcels have frontage on Taylor Slough, stating, \u201cIt appears that the area owned by the State is partially or completely outside of the area of [defendants\u2019] dock and houseboat,\u201d and cited as a material fact that \u201c[t]he State of California may not own the area of [defendants\u2019] dock and houseboat and it may be private land adversely possessed by [defendants].\u201d In support of these propositions, defendants cited the declarations of their expert, Roy Minnick (\u201cBased on my work to date, it is my preliminary opinion that the original location of Taylor Slough as of 1850 is closer to the opposite shore from the Walker property. If this preliminary analysis is confirmed by further work, it will mean that the State of California does not own fee title to the area currently under water adjacent to the Walker property . . .\u201d), their counsel (\u201cIt is my expectation that admissible evidence may exist and be forthcoming that will establish that some or all of the area in dispute is private land, as to which [defendants] will have title by adverse possession, or at least an easement by prescription for the statutory period\u201d), and exhibit C to the declaration of Margery F. Walker (Aug. 9, 2001 letter from Commission stating that \u201cnot all property owners need obtain a lease from the State Lands Commission to place a dock on a waterway. This is due to the fact that the State does not own the beds of all of the rivers and sloughs and it may issue leases only on those lands it does own\u201d). These unsupported allegations do not rise to the level of \u201csubstantial responsive evidence sufficient to establish a triable issue of material fact,\u201d as is necessary to defeat a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication of issues. <em>(Sangster v. Paetkau </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 162-163 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 66].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 584.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
