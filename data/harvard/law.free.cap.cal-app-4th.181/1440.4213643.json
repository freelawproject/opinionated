Defendant drove a vehicle filled with gang members, and one of those members fired the fatal shot. On appeal, defendant contends that (1) the evidence is insufficient to support his murder conviction under the natural and probable consequences doctrine; (2) the court erred in discharging a juror for misconduct and substituting an alternate juror during deliberations (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1089); and (3) a gang-related firearm enhancement must be stricken because the jury failed to find that defendant was a principal in the murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (e)(1)). We reject the contentions and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">In the published part of this opinion, we discuss defendant\u2019s first contention and conclude that the fatal shooting was a natural and probable consequence of a planned physical attack by multiple gang members upon perceived rival gang members even though the shooting occurred at the start of the confrontation and no assault with fists, baseball bats, knives, or other weapons preceded the shooting. A defendant may be convicted under the natural and probable consequences doctrine even if the target criminal act (here, allegedly assault with a baseball bat) was not committed. An aider and abettor may be liable where he intentionally aids one criminal act but the perpetrator actually commits some other, more serious criminal act that is reasonably foreseeable. The ultimate factual question is one of reasonable foreseeability, to be evaluated under all the factual circumstances of the case. Here, evidence establishing the gang-related nature of the planned assault showed that escalation of the confrontation to a deadly level was reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-8\">The Sure\u00f1os and Norte\u00f1os are rival street gangs. Defendant joined the Sure\u00f1os around 1996, when he was 12 years old. In 1997, at age 13, defendant committed assault with a deadly weapon\u2014he stabbed someone in the back at school. In 1998, at age 14, defendant gave a gun to another Sure\u00f1o to shoot at a car full of Norte\u00f1os, and defendant\u2019s accomplice fired four or five shots at the vehicle. The juvenile court held defendant responsible for attempted murder and placed him in the California Youth Authority. Defendant remained incarcerated until February 2005, when he was 20 years old. Five months after his release, he participated in the gang shooting at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>The gang attack occurred on the afternoon of July 12, 2005, in a Norte\u00f1o neighborhood. On that day Francisco Rodriguez was standing outside his apartment building talking with his brother-in-law and a friend when a blue car drove past. Rodriguez was a former Norte\u00f1o gang member who had left the gang when he married a couple of years earlier. Defendant was driving the blue car, and it was filled with four or five other Sure\u00f1o gang members, including Josu\u00e9 O. and Daniel V. who were both 15 years old. At age 20, defendant appears to have been the oldest person in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">Josu\u00e9 shot and killed Rodriguez, and the victim\u2019s brother-in-law described the events at trial. The brother-in-law, Richard Padilla, testified that a blue car slowly drove past them, then returned at an even slower rate of speed. The car was full of occupants. A male exited the car from behind the driver\u2019s seat, with a Mexican flag bandana covering the lower part of his face, and approached Rodriguez, Padilla, and Rodriguez\u2019s friend, Jose Navarret. The individual approached to within about eight feet of the threesome, then raised his hand in a pointing gesture. Padilla thought the individual had a weapon and ran. Padilla\u2019s companions ran, too, but Rodriguez\u2019s foot had a malformation that caused him to walk with a \u201cbad limp\u201d and prevented him from running fast. Padilla heard a gunshot and returned to see Rodriguez on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">Navarret, Rodriguez\u2019s friend who was talking with him just before the shooting, also testified that a blue car stopped in the street and a male with his face covered immediately exited the vehicle from the rear seat behind the driver and approached the threesome. The threesome ran and, seconds later, Navarret heard a gunshot followed by the sound of running, a door slamming, and a car taking off. He returned to see Rodriguez lying on the ground in a puddle of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">Rodriguez died from a gunshot wound to the back of his head. The police found a small kitchen knife near Rodriguez\u2019s feet when they arrived on the scene, but his companions never saw a knife and Rodriguez\u2019s brother-in-law insisted that Rodriguez was not holding a knife or any weapon when Rodriguez was attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-8\">Defendant was arrested hours later driving the blue car, with Josu\u00e9 and another Sure\u00f1o in the car. Josu\u00e9 admitted being the shooter and said he had obtained the gun from a hidden compartment in the car. A car search found the hidden compartment (then empty) and also uncovered a baseball bat and a stabbing shank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-9\">The gun used to kill Rodriguez was recovered later by the police, from a Sure\u00f1o named Juan O. Juan testified that Daniel telephoned on the afternoon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>of the shooting and arranged to meet him. Daniel arrived in a blue or gray car driven by defendant, accompanied by Josu\u00e9. Daniel asked Juan to hide two guns and a box of bullets. Daniel told Juan that one of the guns had been used by Josu\u00e9 to shoot a Norte\u00f1o. Juan hid the weapons but a police search the next morning recovered them. A criminalist testified that one of those guns was the one used to kill Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">Defendant admitted being the driver of the vehicle used in the shooting but denied making any plans to kill a Norte\u00f1o. In a statement admitted into evidence at trial, defendant told the police that he had methamphetamine for \u201cbreakfast\u201d and was driving the car with five occupants, \u201cjust cruising around,\u201d when he passed three men who seemed to be Norte\u00f1os who were \u201cdisrespecting\u201d them. The car occupants asked defendant to drive by again. Defendant did not own the car; he had been asked to drive because he looked older than the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">Defendant knew there \u201cwas gonna be some funk,\u201d and \u201c[s]ome gang related ass shit\u201d when he and his friends returned. Defendant said he thought his friends were \u201cgonna go over there and beat the shit out of the guy.\u201d Defendant knew there was \u201ca bat and shit\u201d in the car, but claimed he did not know anyone had a gun. Defendant did admit that everyone in the car except him covered their faces when they returned to confront the threesome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">The police officer interviewing defendant asked: \u201cWhat were you gonna do? What were you planning on doing? Obviously you were gonna handle business, right?\u201d Defendant answered: \u201cYeah, I was gonna get out and beat up on somebody.\u201d But defendant said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know they were gonna shoot him or nothing.\u201d Defendant said that when he stopped the car in the street, one of the men (Rodriguez) approached the car with a knife in his hand. Josu\u00e9 got out of the car with a gun and said \u201c[w]hat\u2019s up puta?,\u201d which is a Spanish obscenity. The men ran. Josu\u00e9 fired a shot and a man \u201cdropped.\u201d Josu\u00e9 returned to the car, yelled \u201cgo, go, go, go,\u201d and defendant sped away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">Defendant told the police that, after the shooting, some of the car occupants said the man was dead and kept telling Josu\u00e9 he was a murderer. Josu\u00e9 \u201cwas like, nah, fuck that.\u201d Defendant said Josu\u00e9 was \u201cscared\u201d by the talk, and Josu\u00e9 told the others that he thought he shot the man in the back. A couple of hours after the shooting, the group heard that the man who was shot was dead. Defendant and his friends met Juan, and Daniel gave Juan the gun used in the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">Defendant\u2019s girlfriend testified at trial and cast doubt on defendant\u2019s claim that he and his friends had no plan to attack Norte\u00f1os on the day of the shooting. The girlfriend testified that Josu\u00e9, Daniel, and three other Sure\u00f1os <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>arrived in a blue car on the afternoon of July 12, 2005, and informed defendant that they had just had an argument with Norte\u00f1os, and the Norte\u00f1os had thrown things at the car. The group in the car told defendant they wanted to return for \u201cpayback.\u201d They asked defendant to drive because he looked older. Defendant grabbed the keys and got in the car, according to his girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">A police officer with expertise in gang behavior testified that there was a gang war being waged on city streets between Sure\u00f1os and Norte\u00f1os at the time of the shooting. Violent attacks by gang members upon rivals were frequent and those attacks often involved shootings. The expert testified that the \u201cultimate goal\u201d in gang culture is to kill a rival gang member. Defendant was a long-term Sure\u00f1o gang member with a violent past who wrote a letter bragging about \u201csmashing\u201d on Norte\u00f1os and proudly reporting that a Norte\u00f1o got \u201cpop[ped]\u201d recently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">The gang expert also testified that there is a gang hierarchy starting at the bottom with associates and topping out at original gangster (OG) status that is achieved by those who have been in the gang a long time and have committed violent acts on rival gang members. The officer said the OG is the \u201cshot caller\u201d on the streets, who directs younger members of the gang. The officer opined that defendant was the \u201cOG\u201d and \u201cshot caller\u201d in the group that attacked Rodriguez. The officer noted that defendant was the oldest person in the group, and the one who had \u201cdone the most violent acts against rival gang members.\u201d When defendant was interviewed by the police, an officer referred to defendant as \u201cthe OG in the car,\u201d and defendant did not dispute the characterization. The gang expert also testified that gang members do not cover their faces in most gang attacks because they want notoriety and know a rival gang victim will not report the attack to the police. According to the gang expert, gang members only conceal their faces \u201c[wjhen there\u2019s going to be a preplanned shooting, most notabl[y] a murder,\u201d because a murder will be reported by citizens and investigated by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">II. TRIAL COURT PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">The prosecution presented its case, consisting of the testimony summarized above as well as other evidence. The defense did not present any witnesses. In closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor argued that defendant was guilty of first degree murder because he was the \u201cshot caller\u201d in a group that intended to retaliate against the Norte\u00f1os by killing one of their members, and was a knowing accomplice in the premeditated shooting. Alternatively, the prosecutor argued that defendant was guilty of at least second degree murder because defendant admitted to the police that he intended to commit assault with a deadly weapon (a baseball bat), and the shooting was a natural and probable consequence of the gang assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>Defense counsel, in his argument to the jury, conceded that defendant was a Sure\u00f1o gang member but maintained that defendant never intended to kill anyone. Counsel said that the evidence showed only that defendant planned to engage in a gang fight and did not show the intent to use a dangerous weapon in the attack. While defendant knew there was a baseball bat in the car, counsel noted that defendant never told police he intended to use the bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">The jury began its deliberations on the afternoon of Monday, June 16, 2008. On June 18, 2008, two days later, the jury foreperson accused one of the jurors (S.R., Juror No. 2) of misconduct. The court investigated the matter the next day by questioning the foreperson and Juror S.R. The foreperson said S.R. was claiming familiarity with gangs, drugs, and the neighborhood where the murder occurred, and interjecting her claimed expertise of these matters into the deliberations. The foreperson said he did not remember the juror disclosing these experiences during voir dire and said he thought the juror was being \u201ccoach[ed]\u201d or was under some outside \u201cinfluence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">A questionnaire had been completed by all prospective jurors concerning their personal experiences, and the prosecutor reviewed the questionnaire completed by S.R. The prosecutor argued that the juror lied on the questionnaire by saying she had no knowledge of gangs and was never the victim of a crime. The prosecutor introduced police incident reports showing that S.R. had been the victim of several minor crimes but failed to disclose that fact on the questionnaire. The court discharged S.R. for misconduct and replaced her with an alternate juror. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1089.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">The reconstituted jury resumed deliberations that day, Thursday, June 19, 2008. The court recessed for a long weekend, and deliberations continued on Monday, June 23, 2008. That afternoon, the jury returned its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">The jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189.) The jury also found that the murder was committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang and that defendant was a principal in a gang murder committed by the intentional discharge of a firearm. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1), 12022.53, subds. (d), (e).) The court sentenced defendant to prison for an indeterminate term of 15 years to life for the murder, plus an additional 25 years for the gang-related firearm enhancement. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 190, 12022.53, subds. (d), (e).) The gang participation enhancement was stayed. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1), 12022.53, subd. (e)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">in. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">Defendant argues on appeal that (1) his second degree murder conviction was based on the jury finding that murder was a natural and probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>consequence of assault with a deadly weapon (a baseball bat), and there was insufficient evidence to instruct, and convict, on the natural and probable consequences doctrine because no assault with a bat ever occurred (CALCRIM No. 403); (2) the court\u2019s discharge of a deliberating juror was without good cause, and in violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to a jury trial and due process of law (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1089; U.S. Const., 6th &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 29); and (3) the gang-related firearm enhancement (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (e)), must be stricken because the jury\u2019s murder verdict rests on the natural and probable consequences doctrine, which means that the jury found him to be a principal only in the commission of assault with a deadly weapon and not a principal in the commission of murder. We discuss each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">A. <em>Substantial evidence supports the murder conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">Defendant contends that he \u201cwas convicted on the theory that he had intended to aid and abet an assault on perceived rival gang members that would have included use of a bat, which is a deadly weapon, and that murder is a natural and probable consequence of such an attack.\u201d Defendant argues that \u201c[insufficient evidence supports the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 theory\u201d because any \u201cintended assault with fists and perhaps a bat\u201d never took place; instead, Josu\u00e9 shot Rodriguez with a handgun. Defendant insists: \u201cThere was no evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that if [defendant] only intended a fistfight, even a fight with a bat or a club, he should have expected that someone in his car would use a gun.\u201d We reject the claim. Substantial evidence supports defendant\u2019s murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-7\">1. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">\u201cSubstantial evidence is evidence which is \u2018 \u201creasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value.\u201d \u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] We must presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact that the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence. [Citation.] \u2018The focus of the substantial evidence test is on the <em>whole </em>record of evidence presented to the trier of fact, rather than on \u201c \u2018isolated bits of evidence.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Medina </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 913, 919 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 202, 209 P.3d 105] <em>(Medina).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">Defendant participated with five fellow gang members in a planned physical attack upon perceived rival gang members during which defendant\u2019s confederate shot and killed one of the intended victims. The shooting was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>natural and probable consequence of the gang attack, and thus defendant was properly convicted of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">2. <em>The natural and probable consequences doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">\u201cThe natural and probable consequences doctrine is based on the recognition that those who aid and abet should be responsible for the harm they have naturally, probably, and foreseeably put in motion.\u201d <em>(People v. Avila </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 491, 567 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 133 P.3d 1076].) Accordingly, \u201c \u2018[a] person who knowingly aids and abets criminal conduct is guilty of not only the intended crime [target offense] but also of any other crime the perpetrator actually commits [nontarget offense] that is a natural and probable consequence of the intended crime. The latter question is not whether the aider and abettor <em>actually </em>foresaw the additional crime, but whether, judged objectively, it was <em>reasonably </em>foreseeable. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] Liability under the natural and probable consequences doctrine \u2018is measured by whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have or should have known that the charged offense was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the act aided and abetted.\u2019 [Citation.] [][] ... A reasonably foreseeable consequence is to be evaluated under all the factual circumstances of the individual case [citation] and is a factual issue to be resolved by the jury.\u201d <em>(Medina, supra, </em>46 Cal.4th at p. 920.) The doctrine exists not only in California, but also in most other jurisdictions. <em>(Gonzales </em>v. <em>Duenas-Alvarez </em>(2007) 549 U.S. 183, 190-191 [166 L.Ed.2d 683, 127 S.Ct. 815].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">3. <em>Gang confrontation cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-10\">Our Supreme Court recently affirmed murder convictions under the natural and probable consequences doctrine on facts similar to those presented here involving a gang confrontation. In <em>Medina, </em>three Lil Watts gang members had a fistfight at a party with a rival gang member and, after the fight was broken up, one of the three Lil Watts members shot the rival as he drove away in a car. <em>(Medina, supra, </em>46 Cal.4th at p. 917.) The shooter and the other two Lil Watts members were each convicted of murder. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 917-919.) The court affirmed the convictions imposed on those who participated in the fistfight, but did not fire the gun, concluding that \u201ca rational trier of fact could have found that the shooting of the victim was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the gang assault. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 922.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">Jurors in a number of cases have found shootings to be foreseeable consequences of gang confrontations, and those findings have been affirmed on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1, 10-11 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 247] [fatal shooting during gang-related fistfight was natural and probable consequence of fistfight]; <em>People v. Montes </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1450\">*1450</page-number>1050, 1053, 1056 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 482] [shooting of rival gang member during retreat from fight was natural and probable consequence of gang fight in which defendant wielded a chain]; <em>People v. Olguin </em>(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1376 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 596] [defendant\u2019s punching of victim during gang confrontation foreseeably led to fatal shooting of victim by fellow gang member]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Montano </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 221, 226 [158 Cal.Rptr. 47] [defendant\u2019s aiding and encouragement of battery on victim foreseeably led to shooting of victim by fellow gang members].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">4. <em>The fatal shooting here was a natural and probable consequence of assault with a deadly weapon</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">The jury was instructed that, to convict defendant of second degree murder or voluntary manslaughter under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, it would have to find that (1) \u201cdefendant knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted an assault with a deadly weapon\u201d; (2) \u201ca co-participant in that offense committed the crime of murder or voluntary manslaughter\u201d; and (3) \u201c[u]nder all of the circumstances, a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have known that the commission of the murder or voluntary manslaughter was a natural and probable consequence of the commission of an assault with a deadly weapon.\u201d The type of deadly weapon (whether a gun, baseball bat, or shank) was not specified in the jury instructions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-7\">The evidence here strongly supports a finding that the fatal shooting was a natural and probable consequence of defendant\u2019s aiding and abetting an assault with a deadly weapon during a gang confrontation. Defendant disputes the sufficiency of the evidence supporting that finding by relying upon isolated pieces of evidence favoring his version of events, specifically his self-serving statements to the police that the attack was unplanned and the presence of a gun unknown. But we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and not, as defendant does, in the light most favorable to the defense. <em>{Medina, supra, </em>46 Cal.4th at p. 922.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-8\">The prosecution\u2019s evidence includes the testimony of a gang expert who explained that there was a gang war being waged between Sure\u00f1os and Norte\u00f1os at the time of the shooting. Violent attacks by gang members upon rivals were frequent and those attacks often involved shootings. The expert testified that the \u201cultimate goal\u201d in gang culture is to kill a rival gang member. Evidence at trial also established that defendant was a long-term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1451\">*1451</page-number>Sure\u00f1o gang member with a violent past who wrote a letter bragging about \u201csmashing\u201d on Norte\u00f1os and proudly reporting that a Norte\u00f1o got \u201cpop[ped]\u201d recently. Defendant\u2019s girlfriend testified that defendant\u2019s Sure\u00f1o confederates told defendant, shortly before the shooting, that they had had an argument with Norte\u00f1os and the Norte\u00f1os had thrown things at the car. The Sure\u00f1os told defendant they wanted to return for \u201cpayback,\u201d and defendant got into the car with his five confederates. The gang expert opined that gang members would take guns with them when entering a rival gang\u2019s territory to retaliate. Evidence seized after the shooting showed that the car driven by defendant contained two guns, a box of bullets, a baseball bat, and a stabbing shank. Defendant admitted his intention to attack the perceived rival gang members when he drove back to confront them, whatever his intention when he and his confederates first entered the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">Defendant argues that his case is distinguishable from other gang attacks where homicide was found to be foreseeable because any \u201cintended assault with fists and perhaps a bat\u201d never took place; instead, Josu\u00e9 shot Rodriguez with a handgun. But we cannot assume that the jury found the bat, and not the gun, to be the deadly weapon in the targeted assault. An assault with a gun did occur. In finding defendant guilty of second degree murder, the jury may well have found that defendant knew that Josu\u00e9 intended to shoot at Rodriguez (while lacking specific intent to kill) and that Rodriguez\u2019s death was a foreseeable consequence of the shooting. Defendant told police he did not know there were guns in the car but the jury was free to disbelieve defendant on this point. A rational trier of fact could conclude that the car occupants did know there was a gun in the car and planned to shoot a Norte\u00f1o with the intention of either killing or injuring the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">Even if the jury credited defendant\u2019s claimed ignorance of the gun\u2014and found the deadly weapon in the targeted assault to be a baseball bat instead of a gun\u2014the jury could still find murder to be a foreseeable consequence of the violent gang confrontation. \u201c[P]rior knowledge that a fellow gang member is armed is not necessary to support a defendant\u2019s murder conviction as an aider and abettor.\u201d (Medina, <em>supra, </em>46 Cal.4th at p. 921.) \u201c[Ajlthough evidence indicating whether the defendant did or did not know a weapon was present provides grist for argument to the jury on the issue of foreseeability of a homicide, it is not a necessary prerequisite.\u201d <em>(People v. Godinez </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 492, 501, fn. 5 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 325].) In the context of a gang war, a jury could rationally conclude that an attack by six gang members wielding a baseball bat upon rival gang members could escalate into a fatal confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">The fact that the baseball bat was never actually used in the confrontation does not change the analysis. Defendant was still properly found liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1452\">*1452</page-number>for the homicide as a natural and probable consequence of the planned gang assault. In arguing otherwise, defendant notes that the California Supreme Court once commented: \u201c[W]e need not address, and therefore we do not decide, whether a defendant may be convicted under the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 doctrine when the target criminal act was not committed.\u201d <em>(People v. Prettyman, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 262, fn. 4.) The comment reflects the insight that foreseeability of harm in a given case is likely to be attenuated if the target criminal act is only contemplated and never committed. But the comment does not compel a categorical rule that foreseeability of harm never exists if the target criminal act was not committed, and a different criminal act was committed. Aiders and abettors are \u201cresponsible for the harm they have naturally, probably, and foreseeably put in motion.\u201d <em>(People v. Avila, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 567.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">The California Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201cthe ultimate factual question is one of reasonable foreseeability, to be evaluated under <em>all </em>the factual circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>(Medina, supra, </em>46 Cal.4th at p. 927.) \u201c[A] defendant whose liability is predicated on his status as an aider and abettor need not have intended to encourage or facilitate the particular offense ultimately committed by the perpetrator. His knowledge that an act which is criminal was intended, and his action taken with the intent that the act be encouraged or facilitated, are sufficient to impose liability on him for <em>any </em>reasonably foreseeable offense committed as a consequence by the perpetrator.\u201d (P<em>eople v. Croy </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 1, 12, fn. 5 [221 Cal.Rptr. 592, 710 P.2d 392], italics added.) Therefore, it is not true that, \u201cthe perpetrator must actually commit the criminal act which the aider and abettor intentionally aids and encourages. . . . [T]he aider and abettor may be liable where he intentionally aids and encourages one criminal act, but the perpetrator actually commits some other, more serious, criminal act.\u201d <em>(People v. Laster </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1450, 1464-1465 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 680].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">Defendant seems to concede the possibility that an aider and abettor may properly be convicted under the natural and probable consequences doctrine when the target criminal act was not committed but argues that, in this case, there is \u201cno logical basis for a conviction.\u201d Defendant asserts that \u201c[flhere was no evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that if [defendant] only intended a fistfight, even a fight with a bat or a club, he should have expected that someone in his car would use a gun.\u201d While the assertion may have some force in a common fistfight, it has no force in the context of the gang attack at issue here. This was not a spontaneous fistfight but a pitched battle in an ongoing gang war. Our Supreme Court has recognized that the gang-related nature of an assault\u2014even one without weapons\u2014may provide the trier of fact with sufficient evidence to conclude that \u201cescalation of the confrontation to a deadly level was reasonably foreseeable . . . .\u201d <em>(Medina, supra, </em>46 Cal.4th at pp. 922-923.) In <em>Medina, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1453\">*1453</page-number>sufficient evidence of a foreseeable escalation from a fistfight to a shooting was found where there was testimony that the attacking gang used deadly violence to gain respect, and gang members were commonly armed and regularly committed gun offenses. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 923.) Such is the case here.  The jury could reasonably conclude that a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would have known that escalation was likely to occur when defendant and five other Sure\u00f1os confronted three perceived Norte\u00f1os with the intention of physically attacking them\u2014even if the attack was originally intended as a fistfight. Josu\u00e9\u2019s shooting of Rodriguez was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the assault defendant aided and abetted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">B., C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">IV.
