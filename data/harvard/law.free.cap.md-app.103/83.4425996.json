He had counselled her that she would not succeed in appealing an adverse decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the Commission) opining that Ankney was barred from future workers\u2019 compensation benefits because of her settlement with a third party. Thus, this appeal is principally a review of whether the trial judge, in his evidentiary ruling and interpretation of the pertinent law, erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>granting Franch\u2019s motion for judgment in essence determining that Ankney had not produced sufficient evidence to sustain a claim for malpractice. Before reaching the question of whether Franch\u2019s advice constituted legal malpractice, we must decide whether the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission opining that Ankney\u2019s settlement barred recovery of future benefits was wrong and whether the state of the law was such, at the time of Franch\u2019s advice, that he exercised the proper standard of care in rendering his advice and his assessment of Ankney\u2019s chances for success.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The purpose and objective of workers\u2019 compensation statutes are to insure that an employee who is injured during activity which benefits the employer will be compensated without regard to the fault of the employer. The employee, on the one hand, is not left without a remedy when he or she is injured through no fault of the employer, and the employer, at the same time, avoids the disruption of business by reason of burdensome lawsuits having the potential of crippling the business enterprise. It is the clearly-stated policy of such statutes, including Maryland\u2019s statute, Md.Ann.Code, Labor and Employment, \u00a7 9-101 et seq., to carry out a beneficent purpose and to vest liberally in employees, injured during or in the course of their employment, benefits pursuant to a preset schedule according to the degree and duration of physical impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">While the benevolent purpose of the statutes is the cardinal principle in determining the rights of the parties, this case presents the question of how to achieve the beneficent purpose of the statute while not impairing an employer\u2019s right to be reimbursed by a third party who has caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">THE INSTANT CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Appellant Lottie L. Ankney<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought suit against appellees William F. Franch, et al., alleging legal malpractice in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Franch\u2019s handling of a workers\u2019 compensation claim. The malpractice claim proceeded to trial in August 1993. At the close of Ankney\u2019s case, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County struck the entire testimony of Ankney\u2019s two expert witnesses and granted Franch\u2019s motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Ankney presents the following questions for our review, which we restate for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">I. Did the trial court err as a matter of law in striking the entire testimony of plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">II. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in striking the entire testimony of plaintiffs expert witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">III. Did the trial court err in granting defendant\u2019s motion for judgment, when expert witnesses were unnecessary and the court could have instructed the jury on the relevant points of law?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">In January 1982, Lottie Ankney injured her back during the course of her employment at Maritel Enterprises. Ankney had been sent to purchase lunch for a work-related meeting. Returning from that errand, she slipped on the ice and fell in a parking lot owned by Beerfoot Enterprises, Inc. Following a hearing in April 1982, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission awarded Ankney benefits from the date of the fall. Ankney\u2019s attorney in those proceedings was Samuel H. Paavola. Pursuant to an insurance policy with Maritel, the benefits were to be paid by Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Insurance Company (Aetna).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">According to Ankney, Aetna was slow in paying covered medical expenses. After one of her treating physicians filed suit, Ankney complained to Paavola, who negotiated a third-party settlement with Beerfoot\u2019s insurance company. From the $6,500 settlement, Paavola retained roughly $1,900 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees. Ankney testified that the balance went to pay covered medical expenses. She also testified that Aetna continued to be slow in paying her medical bills:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">They paid a few of them, off and on, you know. But, uh, they didn\u2019t pay all of them. In fact, when I was cut out completely from Working\u2014Workman\u2019s [sic] Comp, Mr. Franch still had quite a few bills there that hadn\u2019t been paid. And from the time limit that it was cut off, I had quite a few bills that they should have paid, you know, before that, and I never got it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Ankney eventually discharged Mr. Paavola and retained the appellees, William F. Franch and the firm of Franch, Earnest &amp; Cowdrey, P.A. On January 22, 1985, Franch appeared before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission at a hearing on Ankney\u2019s claim. Aetna advised the commissioner that Ankney had settled her third-party claim against Beerfoot without Aetna\u2019s knowledge or consent. By order dated January 29, 1985, the Commission ruled that Ankney\u2019s claim for benefits was terminated by the unauthorized settlement, and further compensation after that date was denied. No appeal was taken. In April 1986, Ankney\u2019s petition to reopen the case was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Ankney\u2019s back condition grew progressively worse, and she underwent surgery in 1988 and 1991. She made several attempts to return to work, but was unable to do so. At trial, Ankney presented evidence that, as of the date of the fall, she suffered from a sixty-eight percent functional impairment of her back, and was one hundred percent disabled from employment. There was also expert testimony that she probably will suffer gradual deterioration and will, over the years, become \u201cmuch worse than she is now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The gravamen of Ankney\u2019s complaint is that Franch gave her bad advice regarding the merits of an appeal from the Commission\u2019s decision to terminate her benefits. She further contends that Franch greatly overstated the cost of pursuing an appeal. According to Franch, Ankney elected not to proceed after being properly advised on those matters. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>not disputed that Franch requested an advance of $2,500 toward the cost of an appeal, including the expense of expert witnesses. Ankney testified that Franch \u201cseemed to think that I didn\u2019t have a chance of, you know, getting anywhere with going to the Circuit Court.\u201d By letter dated February 28, 1985, Franch stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">This letter will confirm a telephone conversation which we had on Monday, February 25th, at which time I told you that I did not believe that an appeal could be successful and for that reason it was mutually agreed that there would be no appeal taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Ankney testified that she did not have the $2,500, \u201c[b]ut if I thought that I had a chance of getting my Workman\u2019s [sic] Comp back, I would have borrowed it from my brother or from someone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Prior to trial, Ankney proposed to offer expert testimony from two practicing workers\u2019 compensation attorneys: Herbert Arnold and Harold DuBois. Both witnesses were prepared to testify regarding the appropriate standard of care. After taking their depositions, Franch filed a memorandum arguing that Ankney\u2019s experts should be excluded because their opinions were based on \u201can erroneous assumption as to the applicable Maryland law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">At trial, both experts testified that the Commission had erred in terminating Ankney\u2019s benefits. Mr. Arnold explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">I believe that the only action against Mrs. Ackney [sic] should have been a credit against any future award of compensation, and that her case should have remained open subject to credit. I believe if Aetna, having been represented by Mr. Paavola, since they\u2019re a subrogee of Mrs. Ackney [sic] here, if they felt that they had some grievance against him for settling the case, then they should have\u2014should have taken an action against him as far as a breach of any alleged subrogation rights are concerned, or an alleged breach of subrogation rights. But as far as the Workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Compensation claim is concerned, absolutely not. It should have stayed open subject to a credit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Mr. Dubois also testified that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission erred when it terminated Ankney\u2019s claim, and opined that Ankney would have been successful on appeal. With regard to the advance that Franch requested, Dubois testified that the amount was \u201cexcessive\u201d because \u201cthere was only one limited issue in this case,\u201d and it would have been decided on summary judgment without any need for expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">With respect to the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits lost by Ankney as a result of the alleged failure by Franch to exercise the proper standard of care, the following colloquy transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">Q (By Mr. Shar) Based upon your education, training, experience and expertise in the area of Workman\u2019s [sic] Compensation law, uhm, do you have an opinion what, if any Workman\u2019s [sic] Compensation protection Lottie Ankney lost as a result of the Defendant\u2019s breaches of the generally accepted standards of legal practice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">A As a result of being terminated by\u2014as a result of her benefits being terminated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">sf: :{\u00ab s|*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">A The opinion is that first of all, I believe she has lost\u2014 she lost her medical benefit, a lifetime medical benefit for the injuries which are causally related to that particular accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">Q What do you mean by medical benefit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">A Medical expenses. The doctors, the hospitals, the prescriptions, the, uh, uh, what other incidental expenses would be required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-13\">Q Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-14\">A In addition to that, she lost compensation for her\u2014 her lost time from work, and for her disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-15\">Q All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>A She lost her temporary-total disability compensation, she lost her permanent-partial disability compensation, and/or her permanent total disability compensation payments. And when I talk about the temporary-total, permanent-partial and permanent-total, I\u2019m talking about dollars that the insurance company would be obligated to pay her had it not been for the, uh, uh, uh, closing out of this case. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">Q Do you need it to refresh your recollection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">A Well, we\u2019re getting involved in dates here. What I\u2014 what I said was, that on November 7th, 1980\u2014\u201983 the medical evidence showed this woman was totally disabled, and if they had pursued this matter to appeal and they had been successful in having the Court determine that her benefits were not cut off, temporary-total and/or permanent-total disability Compensation for the period November 7th, 1983 up until the time of my deposition would have been around five hundred and three weeks. Her Compensation\u2014Mrs. Ankey\u2019s (sic) Compensation rate, based on her average weekly wage at the time of her accident, was a hundred and seventy-seven dollars a week. So, we call that accrued benefit, five hundred and three accrued\u2014five hundred and three weeks of accrued benefits at a hundred and seventy-seventy [sic] dollars, would have been eighty-nine thousand, thirty-one dollars, and that would have just been from 19\u2014from 1983 until July of \u201993, a period of a little less than ten years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">Q And would the\u2014would the Compensation benefits stop at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">A No. If a person is considered to be\u2014if the Commission had believed, and if a person is considered to be permanently and totally disabled, they would be entitled to a life-time benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">A Yeah. What I did is I used the\u2014I got them this time\u2014I didn\u2019t have it the last time, the Vital Statistics of the United Stated of 1987, and in this is commonly referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>to as the Life Tables published by the National Center for Health\u2014these are health statis\u2014statistics. And Mrs., uh, uh, Ankey (sic) in\u2014July of 1993 was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">Q At the time of your deposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">A \u2014right, is fifty-seven years old. So, a person at age fifty-seven in July of 1993, according to the United States Government Life Tables has another twenty-five point two years of life remaining. So, that be the case, if she had lived, according to Uncle Sam, another twenty-five point two years, that would be another one thousand, three hundred and ten more weeks, again multiplying that by a hundred and seventy-seven dollars a week, we\u2019re talk\u2014now talking about another two hundred and thirty-one thousand, nine hundred and forty dollars, if they\u2014if the insurance company\u2014if she was found permanently and totally disabled, and she got benefits for the rest of her life, and she lived to age, uh, fifty-seven\u2014fifty-seven and twenty-five is eighty-two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">Q And what would that total?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">A That would have been two thou\u2014two hundred and thirty-one thousand, nine hundred and forty. That, coupled with what we\u2014what I referred to before as the accrued compensation, the eighty-nine thousand, we\u2019re talking now around three hundred and twenty thousand dollars worth of benefits that are being potentially deprived because Commissioner Rosenbaum cuts off Mrs. Ankey\u2019s (sic) Compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">Q Now, is that three hundred twenty thousand dollars, does that absorb the medicals? That lifetime medicals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">A No, that\u2019s just annuity. That\u2019s just Compensation dollars in her pocket. That does not take into account her medical expenses, prescriptions, doctors, hospitals, things of this nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">Q Would\u2014would that also be covered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">A Certainly, it would have been covered, if the case is still, what we call alive, or still open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">Q Do those figures, the three hundred twenty-thousand dollars and the\u2014the life-time of medicals, uhm, do those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>figures include physical pain that Mrs. Ankney had to suffer during the years that she unable to get medical attention because she lost her Worker\u2019s [sic] Compensation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">Q Do they include, uh, her emotional pain and trauma that she had to go through as a result of being unable to work, without income, without money coming in from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">A No, this\u2014this again, is strictly dollar replacement for salary. This doesn\u2019t take into consideration any other factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">At the close of Ankney\u2019s case, the court granted Franch\u2019s motion to strike the testimony of both experts. The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">Now, as I said, I considered the <em>Western Railway Company </em>case in 163 Maryland 97 [161 A. 5] [ (1932) ] as the only authority, at least the only guiding authority in\u2014on this case. And I am satisfied that one reading of that case would clearly be that the, uh, uh, Commissioner is right in cutting off the claims. Now, I\u2014I said, that would be a logical extension of that case. I also have some problems as to whether that would be the current law. Now, to take the position that the only alternative would be for a credit, I think is just a complete misstatement of the law. I don\u2019t accept that. I believe that the insurance company certainly would have a right to show that the actions\u2014were prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Because the court\u2019s ruling left Ankney without expert testimony on the appropriate standard of care, the court also granted Franch\u2019s motion for judgment. From those rulings, Ankney noted the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">The questions presented by Ankney may be condensed into two broad issues. We first consider the law that would have governed an appeal from the termination of Ankney\u2019s benefits, then address the ultimate question: did the trial court err or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>abuse its discretion in striking the entire testimony of Ankney\u2019s expert witnesses?</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">When an employee suffers injury or occupational illness in the course of his or her employment, the employer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is required to pay compensation under the terms of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act), Md.Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. (LE) \u00a7 9-101 <em>et seq. </em>(1991 RepLVol.) (formerly Md.Ann. Code, art. 101).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In cases involving a tortious third party, the original version of the Act created an election of remedies: the employee was required to choose between a statutory claim against the employer, or a common law tort claim against the third party. <em>Hagerstown v. Schreiner, </em>135 Md. 650, 653, 109 A. 464 (1920). If the employee filed a claim under the Act, the employer was granted the right to proceed against the third party. Amendments adopted in 1920 and 1922 abolished the election of remedies and granted the employee the right to sue the third party if the employer had not done so within two months following the initial award of compensation under the Act. <em>See Brocker Mfg. v. Mashburn, </em>17 Md.App. 327, 332-35, 301 A.2d 501 (1973) (discussing the history of the Act with regard to third-party claims); LE \u00a7 9-902(c). Thus, the employer has an exclusive right to proceed against a third party for the first two months after the initial award; thereafter, the covered employee has an equal right to bring suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Because the employer and employee both have an interest in the third-party claim, the statutory scheme carefully provides for the distribution of any damages recovered. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>employer who recovers damages in excess of the costs and compensation awarded must pay the full amount of the excess to the injured employee. LE \u00a7 9\u2014902(b). When the employee recovers damages, the employer must be reimbursed for any compensation already paid and awarded, and any amounts paid for medical services, funeral expenses, or other purposes enumerated in the Act. LE \u00a7 9-902(e). <em>See also Western Maryland Railway Co. v. Employer\u2019s Liab. Assurance Corp., </em>163 Md. 97, 102-03, 161 A. 5 (1932) (holding that the terms of a settlement agreement between the employee and a third party violated the employer\u2019s statutory right to be reimbursed from the proceeds of the settlement).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">It is firmly established that the Act does not give the employer a separate right of action against a tortious third party. <em>Smith v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>303 Md. 213, 221-22, 492 A.2d 1286 (1985). As the Court of Appeals observed in <em>Western Maryland Railway, </em>163 Md. at 104, 161 A. 5, \u201c[tjhere is only one claim, and that is of the one injured, or his dependents in the case of death, and one judgment, the division of which is fixed by statute.\u201d The employer\u2019s rights are purely derivative, and by way of subrogation. <em>Erie Insurance Co. v. Curtis, </em>330 Md. 160, 164, 623 A.2d 184 (1993); <em>Johnson v. Miles, </em>188 Md. 455, 459, 53 A.2d 30 (1947). In <em>Erie Insurance, </em>330 Md. at 162-64, 623 A.2d 184, the Court explained that this subrogation interest constitutes a statutory lien on the employee\u2019s recovery in a third-party action. <em>See also </em>Richard P. Gilbert &amp; Robert L. Humphreys, Jr., Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook, \u00a7 16.1-5, at 325 (2d ed. 1993). In recognition of that interest, the employer has an absolute right to intervene in a third-party action filed by the covered employee. <em>Collins v. United Pac. Ins. Co., </em>315 Md. 141, 145, 553 A.2d 707 (1989). <em>See also Johnson, </em>188 Md. at 460, 53 A.2d 30 (employer\u2019s statutory interests are satisfied when the employer is given an opportunity to \u201cintervene and control\u201d the third-party suit and obtain reimbursement out of any recovery).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>In the case at hand, Aetna\u2019s subrogation rights for any benefits paid after the date of the settlement were destroyed by Ankney\u2019s unauthorized settlement. <em>See Cleaveland v. C &amp; P Telephone Co., </em>225 Md. 47, 51-52, 169 A.2d 446 (1961).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The merits of Ankney\u2019s legal malpractice claim turn, in part, on whether the Commission properly terminated Ankney\u2019s benefits as a consequence of that settlement. In their handbook on workers\u2019 compensation law, Gilbert and Humphreys suggest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\">The claimant may not impair the lien -with impunity. The claimant should not settle the claim \u201cout from under\u201d the lienholder by reaching a separate accommodation with the third-party tort-feasor. Impairment of the employer/insurer\u2019s rights by the vehicle of a <em>de minis </em>[sic] settlement could foreclose the claimant\u2019s future rights in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings and require a disgorging of the employer/insurer\u2019s monetary interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Gilbert &amp; Humphreys \u00a7 16.1-5, at 325 (citations omitted). Whether a covered employee\u2019s future right to compensation must be foreclosed as a consequence of an unauthorized settlement has yet to be decided by this Court or the Court of Appeals. In considering that issue, we strive to strike an appropriate balance between the employer\u2019s right to subrogation and the claimant\u2019s right to compensation under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In granting the motion to strike the testimony of Ankney\u2019s experts, the trial court relied heavily on <em>Western Maryland Railway. </em>There, the injured employee entered a third-party settlement that provided for payment of a certain sum apart from, and in excess of, any workers\u2019 compensation benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>received. <em>Id. </em>163 Md. at 100, 161 A. 5. The agreement further stipulated that the release contained therein should \u201cnot operate to release or discharge, or in any way affect\u201d the insurer\u2019s subrogation rights. The Court of Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3e\">As the appellants construe [the Workers\u2019 Compensation] act, the alleged tort-feasor can settle with the employee, by entering into an agreement whereby the settlement is stated to be in excess of or in addition to any amount which the insurer might recover against them. In our opinion such a settlement cannot be made without the acquiescence of the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 102-03,161 A. 5. The Court noted that the effect of the settlement was \u201cto split a single cause of action into two causes\u201d in contravention of the well-established principle that there is \u201conly one claim, and that is of the one injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103-04, 161 A. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">A close reading reveals that the case is not directly applicable here. Under article 101, \u00a7 58, an employee was not entitled to receive funds from a third-party tort-feasor until <em>after </em>the employer had been reimbursed for \u201ccompensation already paid or awarded and any amount or amounts paid for medical or surgical services.\u201d <em>Western Maryland Railway, </em>163 Md. at 102, 161 A. 5. The settlement reached was squarely in conflict with that provision, and the Court properly concluded that <em>\u201csuch a settlement </em>cannot be made without the acquiescence of the insurer\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 102-103, 161 A. 5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Moreover, the appeal in <em>Western Maryland Railway </em>was brought from an order restraining the settlement. <em>Id. </em>at 98, 161 A. 5. The employee\u2019s claim for benefits under the Act had not been terminated, and there is nothing in the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>directly supporting the proposition that the Commission could terminate an employee\u2019s claim solely on the basis of an unauthorized third-party settlement. The opinion does state, however, that an employee \u201ccannot settle with the one causing him loss, except with the acquiescence of the insurance company without putting into peril his status with the latter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 161 A. 5 (quoting <em>Packham, </em>91 Md. at 523, 46 A. 1066). The precise nature of that potential peril is never clearly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In many jurisdictions, an employee who settles a third-party claim without the employer\u2019s consent forfeits any future right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>See </em>2A Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 74.17(a), at 14-428 (1992). Among jurisdictions that reach that result, the great majority have concluded that termination of benefits was required by the relevant statute. <em>See 4 </em>Larson, Appendix C, Table 21, at 574.42 (listing twenty-four states whose workers\u2019 compensation statutes require an employee to obtain the employer\u2019s consent before reaching a third-party settlement); 2A Larson \u00a7 74.17(a), at 14-428-14-440 (citing cases construing many of those statutes). In some cases, the applicable statute expressly states that all rights to compensation \u201cshall be terminated\u201d if the employee reaches a third-party settlement without the employer\u2019s written approval. <em>See, e.g., Parmelee v. International Paper Co., </em>157 A.D.2d 878, 550 N.Y.S.2d 150, 151 (1990). <em>See also Nicklos Drilling Co. v. Cowart, </em>927 F.2d 828, 831 (5th Cir.1991) (construing the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act). Other courts have concluded that termination of the employee\u2019s benefits was necessary to protect the employer\u2019s subrogation rights and to prevent the employee from reaching an unreasonably small settlement. In <em>Hornback v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>106 Ariz. 216, 474 P.2d 807, 810-11 (1970), the Supreme Court of Arizona noted that the statute expressly required the employer\u2019s written approval for any third-party settlement that was less than the compensation awarded. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Arizona court concluded that termination of the employee\u2019s benefits was required to give full effect to the statute\u2019s approval provision. The Supreme Court of Virginia reached an identical conclusion in <em>Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Van Hoy, </em>225 Va. 64, 300 S.E.2d 750, 753-54 (1983). In Indiana and North Carolina, state legislatures have adopted yet a third approach. In those states, the workers\u2019 compensation statute provides that a third-party settlement shall not be valid without the written consent of both the employer and employee. <em>See State v. Mileff, </em>520 N.E.2d 123, 128 (Ind.Ct.App.1988); <em>Williams v. International Paper Co., </em>324 N.C. 567, 380 S.E.2d 510, 512-13 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Among those states in which the statute is silent, as in Maryland, there appears to be a diversity of opinion. As the Supreme Court of Minnesota explained in <em>Lang v. William Bros. Boiler and Mfg., </em>250 Minn. 521, 85 N.W.2d 412 (1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqo\">[I]n what appears to be a majority of the states, the employee is allowed to make the [unauthorized] settlement, and still collect compensation, but the employer is not thereafter precluded from recovering from the third party the amount it must pay, in spite of the settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">Underlying all these cases seems to be the general thought that the employer, having been given a right of indemnification for compensation paid, should not have that right affected by a settlement to which he is not a party____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-8\"><em>Id. </em>85 N.W.2d at 417 (citations omitted). <em>See also United Steelworkers of America v. Quadna Mountain Corp., </em>435 N.W.2d 120, 122 (Minn.App.1989) (citing <em>Lang </em>with approval). <em>See generally, </em>2A Larson \u00a7 74.17(e), at 14-454-14-462. This approach, unfortunately, is plainly inconsistent with Maryland law. As we noted earlier, Aetna\u2019s subrogation rights for any benefits paid after the date of the settlement were destroyed. <em>Cleaveland, </em>225 Md. at 51-52, 169 A.2d 446. <em>Compare Traveler\u2019s Insurance Co. v. Haden, </em>418 A.2d 1078, 1082 (D.C.App.1990) (reaching a similar conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Regardless of the position that other states may take, our task here is to determine the meaning and intent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>our own statute, and give full effect to the legislative purpose or policy. <em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 744-45, 580 A.2d 188 (1990); <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387-88, 614 A.2d 590 (1992). Although the language of the statute is the primary guide to legislative intent, <em>Tracey, </em>328 Md. at 387, 614 A.2d 590, we must also consider the legislative history, as well as the prior state of the law and the \u201cparticular evil, abuse or defect\u201d that the statute was designed to correct. <em>Department of Tidewater Fisheries v. Sollers, </em>201 Md. 603, 611, 95 A.2d 306 (1953). The workers\u2019 compensation statute itself states that the law must be \u201cinterpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose.\u201d Art. 101, \u00a7 64; <em>see also </em>LE \u00a7 9-102. The benevolent purposes of the law require that any ambiguities be liberally construed in favor of injured employees, insofar as the language of the statute will allow. <em>Lovellette v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 282, 465 A.2d 1141 (1983); <em>Bethlehem-Sparrows Pt. Shipyard, Inc. v. Hempfield, </em>206 Md. 589, 594, 112 A.2d 488 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">As Ankney points out, our workers\u2019 compensation statute carefully sets forth the grounds for termination of an employee\u2019s benefits. <em>See, e.g., </em>LE \u00a7 9-903 (employee\u2019s third-party recovery terminates case <em>unless </em>amount recovered is less than compensation awarded). <em>See also </em>LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-506, 9-680 (stating circumstances under which compensation is prohibited). In light of the policy favoring liberal construction of the Act, Ankney suggests that the Commission has no authority to terminate an employee\u2019s benefits except as <em>expressly </em>provided by statute. In <em>Wildin v. CNA Insur. Co., </em>256 Mont. 354, 846 P.2d 1022 (1993), for example, the Supreme Court of Montana held that an employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim was not terminated by an unauthorized settlement. In reaching that conclusion, the court stressed that there was no express statutory authority for the termination of the claim: \u201cIf the legislature wanted the insurer to exercise such control over the insured, they would have so stated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>846 P.2d at 1024. With respect to Maryland law, there is nothing in the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>itself to suggest that an unauthorized settlement should be treated differently than a settlement reached with the employer\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">For further support, Ankney points to the legislative history of article 101, \u00a7 58. The Act \u201ccreates a special statutory remedy, and the rights of all persons affected by the proceedings are, so far as they are applicable, measured and limited by the terms of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Barrett v. Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>152 Md. 253, 259, 136 A. 542 (1927). <em>See also Hubbard v. Livingston Fire Protection, Inc., </em>289 Md. 581, 589, 426 A.2d 901 (1981); <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Harroll, </em>217 Md. 169, 176, 141 A.2d 912 (1958); <em>Western Maryland Ry. Co., </em>163 Md. at 104, 161 A. 5. With regard to an action brought by the employee against a third party, the critical language of the Act provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">[T]he amount thus received by the injured employee ... shall be in lieu of any award that might otherwise have been made thereafter in the same case under the provisions of this article and said case shall thereupon be deemed to have been finally settled and closed <em>unless the amount thus received by the injured employee or his dependents from such other person shall be less than the injured employee or his dependents would be otherwise entitled to receive under the provisions of this article, </em>in which event he or his dependents shall have the right to reopen the claim for compensation under this article to recover the difference between the amount thus received by the injured employee or his dependents and the full amount of compensation which would be otherwise payable under this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9f\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Art. 101, \u00a7 58 (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>LE \u00a7 9-903.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The latter part of this sentence, beginning with the italicized language, was added by amendment in 1957. <em>See Smith v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>303 Md. 213, 220, 492 A.2d 1286 (1985); <em>Brocker Mfg. v. Mashburn, </em>17 Md.App. 327, 336-37, 301 A.2d 501 (1973). As the commission that proposed the amendment explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">The Study Commission believes that the fact that disability or death resulted under circumstances giving rise to an action against a third party tort-feasor, should not operate, <em>under any circumstances, </em>to decrease the benefits properly allowable under Article 101.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Second Report of The Commission to Study Maryland\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws and the Operation of the State Industrial Accident Commission, p. 24 (emphasis added). In <em>Brocker, </em>17 Md.App. 327, 301 A.2d 501, we considered the 1957 amendment in light of the Study Commission\u2019s report. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">The report of the Study Commission ... makes it vividly clear that the purpose behind the amendment was to prevent an injured employee, who obtains recovery from a negligent third party, from receiving less in <em>benefits </em>under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the Act than he would have been entitled to receive absent a third party claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\"><em>Id. </em>303 Md. at 226, 492 A.2d 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission terminated Ankney\u2019s benefits on account without any showing that Aetna had suffered material prejudice. We think that the Commission\u2019s decision was plainly inconsistent with the legislative intent underlying the 1957 amendment, as well as the broader statutory goal of providing full compensation for injured employees. We reach that conclusion notwithstanding the result in <em>Noma Elec. Corp. v. Fidelity &amp; Dep. Co., </em>201 Md. 407, 94 A.2d 277 (1953). There, the Court of Appeals declined to decide whether a subrogee has the burden of showing prejudice. Nonetheless, the court concluded that, \u201csince the principle of suretyship rests upon the variation in risk or undertaking, <em>it is the loss of a fair chance of recovery, </em>not an absolute certainty, that constitutes a showing of prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>201 Md. at 413-14, 94 A.2d 277 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">In <em>Bachmann v. Glazer &amp; Glazer, </em>316 Md. 405, 413, 559 A.2d 365 (1989), the Court of Appeals noted that subrogation rights may arise by way of contract, statute, or equity. <em>See also Security Ins. Co. v. Mangan, </em>250 Md. 241, 246-48, 242 A.2d 482 (1968). The nature of a party\u2019s subrogation rights may be different in each situation, depending on the terms of the pertinent agreement or statute. <em>South Down Liquors, Inc. v. Hayes, </em>323 Md. 4, 10 n. 1, 590 A.2d 161 (1991). Because the result in <em>Noma Electric </em>rests on equitable principles of suretyship, the case is not directly applicable in the context of workers\u2019 compensation. Unlike the situation in <em>Noma Electric, </em>the subrogation rights at issue here arise within the framework of a comprehensive statutory scheme. It is beyond dispute that an employer\u2019s subrogation rights may not be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the express terms of the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We carry that principle one step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>further and conclude that an employer\u2019s subrogation rights may not be enforced in a manner that is plainly inconsistent with the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">At the outset of this discussion, we noted that we strive to strike an appropriate balance between the employer\u2019s right to subrogation and the employee\u2019s right to compensation. The result that we reach must be consistent with the legislative intent and the statutory scheme as a whole. Moreover, we must avoid a construction that is unjust or unreasonable. <em>Tracey, </em>328 Md. at 387-88, 614 A.2d 590; <em>D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 538, 578 A.2d 1177 (1990). In light of the 1957 amendment to the Act, now codified as LE \u00a7 9-903, we think it would be both unjust and unreasonable to allow the termination of an employee\u2019s claim without a showing that the employer suffered material prejudice. In many cases, a third-party claim may have little more than nuisance value. Under those circumstances, termination of the employee\u2019s benefits would bestow an undeserved windfall on the employer. Likewise, it would be manifestly unjust to leave the employer without a remedy in those cases in which material prejudice can be shown. Striking an appropriate balance between the rights of employer and employee requires that we reach a middle ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The employee\u2019s interest compels our conclusion that an unauthorized third-party settlement does not, in itself, constitute grounds for the termination of the employee\u2019s claim. The employer, on the other hand, must have an opportunity to show material prejudice. The burden of proof is on the employer to establish that the <em>reasonable dollar value </em>of the third-party claim was greater than the amount of the settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ment. Since there can only be one recovery for an injury, any other proceeds received on account of the injury, i.e., settlement of malpractice claim against Paavola, would have to be factored into the equation. These sums received by the claimant must be computed as a credit to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Where prejudice cannot be shown, the proceeds of the unauthorized settlement must be distributed according to the terms of the Act: the employer is entitled to reimbursement from the proceeds; <em>see </em>LE \u00a7 9-902, and the claim will not be terminated or payment suspended if the sum of the credits to the employer, i.e., the amount of the unauthorized settlement and the settlement against Paavola, is less than the compensation that the employee would otherwise be entitled to receive. LE \u00a7 9-903. In a case in which material prejudice is shown, the employer is also entitled to a credit for the amount of the prejudice. The employee\u2019s claim may not be abated on account of the prejudice unless the amount of the unauthorized settlement and the settlement against Paavola, <em>plus </em>the amount of any prejudice shown, is equal to or greater than the compensation awarded. In the case of a lump-sum payment for a temporary-total or temporary-partial disability, if the credits to the employer exceeded the amount of the lump-sum award, the claim would be abated accordingly. In Ankney\u2019s case, future benefits to be received by Ankney pursuant to the Commission\u2019s award must be abated where the credits due the employer exceed the amount already received by Ankney, subject to a motion to reopen the case at the point in time when the credits have been exhausted, i.e., the compensation due Ankney equals the proceeds received by her from her unauthorized settlement, her settlement with Paavola, and the amount computed as the prejudice resulting from the unauthorized settlement. The net effect is to shift the loss resulting from an unreasonable or <em>de minimis </em>settlement from the employer to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">A hypothetical based on the case before us illustrates these principles. The amount of Ankney\u2019s unauthorized settlement with Beerfoot was $6,500. Absent a showing that Aetna <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>suffered material prejudice, the case would not be treated differently than one involving an authorized settlement, and the consequences of Ankney\u2019s settlement would be governed by the terms of LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-902 and 9-903. If the Commission found that the reasonable value of Ankney\u2019s claim against Beerfoot was $50,000, then the amount of prejudice suffered would be $43,500, and Aetna would be entitled to a credit for that amount as well.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>Ankney had already received $40,000 in her malpractice claim against Paavola, Aetna would be entitled to a credit of $6,500 [the unauthorized settlement], $43,500 [the prejudice resulting from the unauthorized settlement], and $40,000 [the hypothetical figure assigned to her settlement against Paavola] or a credit in the amount of $90,000. Aetna would still be required to pay Ankney benefits otherwise due whether by way of a lump-sum amount in excess of the $90,000 credited to Aetna or future payments under the Commission\u2019s award in excess of $90,000. At the point in time when Ankney would have received benefits equal to the $90,000 credited to Aetna, she would be entitled to have her future benefits resume.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">On the other hand, if the amount credited to Aetna was exceeded by a lump-sum award or if the payments to Ankney under the award never became equal to or greater than the credits to which Aetna was entitled, Ankney\u2019s benefits would, in effect, be terminated, subject to reopening under LE \u00a7 9-736. Ankney\u2019s claim would only be closed in the manner described by LE \u00a7 9-903 in a case where the credits exceed a lump-sum payment, or, in Ankney\u2019s case, actuarially, the future benefits could never exceed the credits due Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We recognize that our decision here calls for the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission to delve into issues that it heretofore has not been required to resolve. Any result other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>our decision herein would be incompatible with the legislative purpose embodied in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Having resolved the underlying issue of workers\u2019 compensation law, we turn our attention to Ankney\u2019s claim against Franch for legal malpractice. Following the Commission\u2019s decision to terminate Ankney\u2019s benefits, the parties discussed the possibility of an appeal to circuit court. Franch requested that Ankney pay an advance of $2,500 toward the cost of an appeal, including the expense of expert medical witnesses. During argument before the trial court, Franch\u2019s counsel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">I would agree, [Aetna] would have the burden of showing prejudice. But that\u2019s key to our case because that means on appeal you\u2019d had to have doctors in there, and you\u2019d have been litigating, like Paavola, settling the case for a reasonable amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">In short, Franch contended that Aetna would have the opportunity, in circuit court, to litigate fully the value of Ankney\u2019s claim against Beerfoot. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">When a party appeals a decision rendered by the Commission, the scope of review in circuit court is narrow. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-737 (providing for an appeal \u201cin accordance with Subtitle B of the Maryland Rules\u201d). <em>See also </em>art. 101, \u00a7 56 (providing that the Commission\u2019s decision shall be affirmed on appeal if \u201cthe Commission has acted within its powers and has correctly construed the law and facts\u201d). The Court of Appeals has previously noted that an issue of fact not raised before the Commission may not be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Cabell Concrete Block Co. v. Yarborough, </em>192 Md. 360, 369, 64 A.2d 292 (1949) (\u201cAs the Commission is the original fact-finding body, an issue of fact must originate with the Commission ... \u201d). Even in cases where the appeal is argued <em>de novo </em>before a jury, the parties may not raise new factual issues in circuit court. <em>See Benoni v. Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, </em>188 Md. 306, 308-09, 52 A.2d 613, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>332 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>749, 68 S.Ct. 86, 92 L.Ed. 336 (1947) (addressing the scope of an appeal under art. 101, \u00a7 56). <em>See also Esslinger v. Baltimore City, </em>95 Md.App. 607, 623, 622 A.2d 774, <em>cert. denied, </em>331 Md. 479, 628 A2d 1066 (1993) (reaching a similar conclusion regarding the scope of administrative appeals pursuant to Subtitle B of the Maryland Rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">An appeal from the termination of Ankney\u2019s claim was likewise limited to the law and facts that were litigated before the Commission. Under the circumstances, an appeal to the circuit court would have been limited to a single question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax\">Did the Commission err, as a matter of law, by terminating Ankney\u2019s compensation from the date of the unauthorized settlement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">If the circuit court answered \u201cyes,\u201d then the Commission would be required to entertain Ankney\u2019s claim. If the court concluded that Aetna must show prejudice, the issue of prejudice could not have been litigated in circuit court. Thus, Ankney\u2019s experts were correct when they concluded that an appeal could have been decided on summary judgment, without the need for expert witnesses. Finally, we observe that if the outcome in circuit court was not favorable, Ankney could have noted an appeal to this Court without further delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Both of Ankney\u2019s expert witnesses testified that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission erred by terminating Ankney\u2019s claim solely on the basis of the unauthorized third-party settlement. After concluding that the experts were wrong, the trial court struck their entire testimony. Ankney contends that the trial court erred as a matter of law in granting the motion to strike. She also contends that the judge abused his discretion. Our ruling on those questions requires that we briefly consider the role of expert testimony in a claim for legal malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The gravamen of a complaint for attorney malpractice is \u201cthe negligent breach of a contractual [and professional] duty.\u201d <em>Flaherty v. Weinberg, </em>303 Md. 116, 134, 492 A.2d 618 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>(1985). <em>See also Stone v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 329, 335, 624 A.2d 496 (1993). An attorney\u2019s professional obligations include, <em>inter alia, </em>the duty to exercise reasonable care in advising his or her client about the merits of a claim. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.4(b) (stating that \u201c[a] lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation\u201d). <em>See also Flaherty, </em>303 Md. at 134-35, 492 A.2d 618 (discussing negligent misrepresentation in the context of attorney malpractice).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">As a general rule, expert testimony is required to establish legal malpractice, except in those cases in which the \u201ccommon knowledge or experience of laymen is extensive enough to recognize or infer negligence from the facts.\u201d <em>Central Cab Co. v. Clarke, </em>259 Md. 542, 551-52, 270 A.2d 662 (1970); <em>Fishow v. Simpson, </em>55 Md.App. 312, 318-19, 462 A.2d 540 (1983). Ankney\u2019s malpractice claim rests on her assertion that Franch was negligent in advising her about the merits of an appeal. In that regard, expert testimony was indispensable to establish what conclusions a reasonably competent workers\u2019 compensation attorney would have reached under all the facts and circumstances, including the state of Maryland law at the time of the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In her brief, Ankney asserts that the testimony of expert witnesses was not essential to her case. In her view, the jury could have concluded, from their \u201ccommon knowledge or experience,\u201d that Franch was negligent in advising Ankney about the merits of an appeal. Although we conclude that the termination of Ankney\u2019s benefits was erroneous as a matter of law, we do not agree that Ankney could establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence without the benefit of expert witnesses. The central issue in Ankney\u2019s malpractice claim was not whether Franch\u2019s advice and conclusions were <em>legally correct, </em>but whether they were <em>reasonable. </em>Prior to our decision here, Maryland law on the relevant point was very much unsettled, and decisions in other jurisdictions offered no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>clear guidance. Whether Franch\u2019s advice was reasonable must be assessed against the backdrop of that uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The admissibility of expert testimony is an area in which the trial court is given broad discretion, and it rarely constitutes grounds for reversal. <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 43, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988). The trial judge has broad power to strike the testimony of expert witnesses, particularly when that testimony is grounded in \u201cmere conjecture or guess.\u201d <em>Hartless v. State, </em>327 Md. 558, 578-79, 611 A.2d 581 (1992); <em>State Department of Health v. Walker, </em>238 Md. 512, 520, 209 A.2d 555 (1965). The trial court\u2019s decision to reject such evidence may be reversed if it is founded on an error of law, or if the trial court clearly abused its discretion. <em>Radman v. Harold, </em>279 Md. 167, 176, 367 A.2d 472 (1977); <em>Raithel v. State, </em>280 Md. 291, 301-02, 372 A.2d 1069 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">As we explained in <em>Melrod v. Melrod, </em>83 Md.App. 180, 574 A.2d 1, cert. <em>denied, </em>321 Md. 67, 580 A.2d 1077 (1990), the trial court may not exercise its discretion in a manner that is unduly prejudicial to a litigant. In <em>Melrod, </em>the trial court excluded Mrs. Melrod\u2019s expert witness, thereby creating a situation in which the court, as trier of fact, heard only the opinion evidence of one party\u2019s expert witness, with no expert testimony supporting the other side. On appeal, we recognized that \u201cthe basic unfairness of that situation was an additional factor to be weighed by the [trial] court,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 193, 574 A.2d 1, and concluded that the court abused its discretion. The Court of Appeals had reached a similar result in <em>Marder v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>232 Md. 299, 303-04, 192 A.2d 512 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the depositions of both experts were taken prior to trial, and Franch prepared a pre-trial memorandum arguing that their testimony should be excluded. Arnold testified before Dubois, and Franch promptly moved to strike Arnold\u2019s testimony. We think the court\u2019s ruling was unduly prejudicial. As in <em>Melrod, </em>the \u201cbasic unfairness\u201d of the situation constituted a clear abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>tion. Accordingly, the judgment of the circuit court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Upon retrial, the threshold issue that must be adjudicated is whether, given the state of the law when Franch advised Ankney that her appeal would not succeed, his advice was reasonable and in accord with the standards of the legal profession. Upon a finding that Franch acted in accordance with accepted standards of reasonableness in the legal profession, any necessity to conduct further inquiry into the harm Ankney may have suffered would thereby be obviated. Upon a finding that Franch\u2019s advice, in light of the law available to him at the time, was not reasonable, the burden then shifts to Ankney to show the resultant loss she suffered by reason of Franch\u2019s counsel that she would not succeed on appeal. Stated otherwise, she must prove the amount of the award she would have expected to receive had her case been heard by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\">. Appellant's husband was a co-plaintiff in the suit against Franch, hence, the appendage of \u201cet vir\u201d in the caption of this appeal. We will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>however, for the sake of simplicity, refer only to Ankney since none of the issues addressed are affected by her husband\u2019s claim for consortium.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\">. For the sake of clarity, we refer throughout to the employer and the employee, recognizing that others may assert the interests of those parties.

In <em>Cleaveland, </em>the Court of Appeals concluded that, when an unauthorized settlement is reached <em>after </em>the insurer pays a claim, the settlement and release will not bar the subrogee\u2019s right of action against a third party. <em>See Cleaveland, </em>225 Md. at 52, 169 A.2d 446 (reviewing both cases and insurance treatises which generally take that position). When the unauthorized settlement is reached before the claim is paid, however, the insurer's right of subrogation is destroyed. <em>Cleaveland, </em>225 Md. at 51-52, 169 A.2d 446; <em>Noma Elec. Corp. v. Fidelity &amp; Dep. Co., </em>201 Md. 407, 412, 94 A.2d 277 (1953). <em>See also Packham </em>v. <em>German Fire Ins.

The Court also concluded that under the express terms of the release signed by the third party, the insurer\u2019s subrogation rights were not destroyed by the settlement. As the Court explained, the insurer was entitled to receive the amount of money that the third party agreed to pay the employee, \u2018\u2018and as much more as it may recover in its suit against them to the extent of its obligation under the award.\u201d <em>Western Maryland Railway, </em>163 Md. at 105, 161 A. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\">. In <em>Erie Insurance v. Curtis, </em>330 Md. 160, 165-69, 623 A.2d 184 (1993), for example, an insurance company attempted to assert a statutory lien against an employee\u2019s right to compensation under a policy providing uninsured motorist coverage. The Court of Appeals concluded that Art. 101, \u00a7 58, by its express language, was applicable only to third-party claims against tort-feasors. Because the employee\u2019s claim sounded in contract rather than tort, the Court held that the insurance company had no interest in the third-party claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b135-8\">.
