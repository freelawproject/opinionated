At a trial held before a jury on May 26, 1992, Hunter was convicted of being an accessory after the fact to murder. In the post conviction case, the court decided that Hunter had received ineffective assistance of counsel at that trial. As a result, the court vacated his conviction and ordered that he be granted a new trial. We conclude that Hunter did not prove his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and shall reverse the order granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">The circuit court ruled that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance by neglecting to object to the way the trial judge explained \u201creasonable doubt\u201d to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The trial was concluded on May 26, 1992. At that time the trial judge defined \u201creasonable doubt\u201d in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">\u201cI further instruct you that the defendant is presumed to be innocent of the crimes charged until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">The test of reasonable doubt is that the evidence that the State has produced must be so convincing that it would enable you to act on an important piece of business in your everyday life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">The words \u2018to a moral certainty\u2019 do not mean absolute or mathematical certainty, but a certainty based upon convincing grounds of probability. The phrase \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 does not mean beyond any doubt or all possible doubt, but, as the words indicate, beyond a doubt that is reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">On March 5,1993, ten months after the applicant\u2019s trial, the Court of Appeals decided the case of <em>Wills v. State, </em>329 Md. 370, 620 A.2d 295 (1993). In <em>Wills, </em>the Court ruled that, in giving a reasonable doubt instruction, it is preferable to use the phrase \u201cwithout reservation\u201d rather than the phrase \u201cwithout hesitation.\u201d It is error, the Court ruled, if the instructions considered as a whole leave the impression that the test is a preponderance test. The Court did not rule that either the \u201cwithout reservation\u201d phrase or the \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d phrase had to be used in every reasonable doubt instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The hearing judge, citing <em>Wills v. State, supra, </em>reasoned that, even though the Court of Appeals had not yet ruled that one of the \u201cwithout\u201d phrases had to be used, he expected the court would so rule in the future. Based on this ruling, he decided that the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d instruction that was given was improper and counsel had been ineffective for failing to object to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">The defendant bears the burden of proving that he was denied effective representation by trial counsel. In order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>meet this burden the defendant must satisfy the two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), i.e., that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The Supreme Court declared that, in order to establish the \u201cdeficiency\u201d prong, the defendant bears the burden of (1) identifying the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment; (2) showing that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment (i.e., that, considering all the circumstances, the representative fell below an objective standard of reasonableness); and (3) overcoming the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The Sixth Amendment does not require the best possible defense or that every attorney render a perfect defense. In order to be deficient, counsel\u2019s acts or omissions must be \u201coutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The courts should not, aided by hindsight, second guess counsel\u2019s decisions. <em>Gilliam v. State, </em>331 Md. 651, 666, 629 A.2d 685 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The problem with the hearing judge\u2019s reasoning is that the <em>Wills </em>case was decided after the instant case was tried. At the time this case was tried, the instruction that the trial judge gave was consistent with what was thought at the time to be the proper thing to say. The law does not require lawyers to anticipate changes in the law. <em>Prokopis v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 531, 536, 433 A.2d 1191 (1981). Since at the time it was given the instruction was generally considered to be correct, counsel\u2019s failure to object to the omission of a \u201cwithout hesitation/or reservation\u201d phrase was not a deficient act.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">We conclude that the hearing judge was in error when he ruled that counsel\u2019s representation was ineffective. Because we discern no ineffective representation, we grant the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tion and remand the case with instructions that the circuit court vacate its order granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL GRANTED; JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY TO VACATE ITS ORDER GRANTING A NEW TRIAL.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
