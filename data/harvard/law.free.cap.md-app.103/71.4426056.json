Lynch,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant, was held in civil contempt and sent to jail for nonpayment of child support. She presents three questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">1. Is this appeal moot because appellant has served the sentence imposed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">2. Did the trial judge err in finding appellant in contempt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">3. Did the trial judge err in imposing a purging provision of five hundred dollars?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Our answer to the first and second questions is \u201cno.\u201d To the third question, however, our answer is \u201cyes.\u201d The evidence was insufficient to support the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that appellant was able to comply with the purging provision at the time when the coercive imprisonment began.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">Appellant and Robert D. Lynch, appellee, were divorced in 1987. At that time, appellant was awarded custody of the parties\u2019 two minor children. On September 12, 1991, however, the circuit court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">ORDERED, that the residential care, custody and control of the minor children of the parties be placed with ... Robert D. Lynch, reserving unto ... Susan M. Lynch, reasonable rights of visitation, pending further Order of Court, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-13\">ORDERED, that commencing and accounting from September 15, 1990, (appellant) shall pay unto (appellee) as and for support and maintenance of the minor children of the parties, the sum of $150.00 per month, due and payable at a rate of $75.00 on the 15th and $75.00 on the 1st of each month hereafter, pending further Order of Court, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ORDERED, that all payments of support be made through the Child Support Enforcement Division of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, 50 Courthouse Square, 4th Floor, Rockville, Maryland 20850.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Appellant immediately fell behind on her support obligation. The record shows that on one occasion she agreed to cooperate in the Support Division\u2019s efforts to attach her unemployment benefits, and on another occasion she agreed to turn over whatever cash she would receive from her federal government pension. No funds were ever received from either of these sources. The Support Division initiated contempt proceedings. On March 4, 1994, with both sides represented by counsel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a hearing was finally held.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Appellant was the only person who testified at the hearing. She told the court that she was living in a house that had been owned by her deceased mother, whose will left that house to appellant\u2019s children and their parental guardian. According to appellant, the house was tied up in probate proceedings that she did not understand. Appellant further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtD\">Q. But at the moment you don\u2019t have legal title to the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">:\u25a0\u00ab jfc }\u00a3 <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">Q. Okay. Are you paying any rent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">Q. Okay. Are you receiving any kind of money at all right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">A. No. There\u2019s a mortgage and everything on the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANX\">Q. You are not paying the mortgage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-13\">A. I have to pay the taxes. I haven\u2019t paid the mortgage yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Q. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">A. I do have a tenant that\u2019s moving in Wednesday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">Q. Has he moved in yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">A. Well, he\u2019s moved in. He gets paid this Wednesday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0g\">Q. Okay. How long has he been living there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">A. He just got there last Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">Q. Okay. How much is he going to be paying you for the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">A. Sixty a week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">Q. Has he paid you anything so far?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">A. No, not yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">Q. How are you eating?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-14\">A. I got this for verification. This is Mana, and what you do is you call in to the Salvation Army and you get a referral, and what they do is they give you an amount of food. When I first started going to Mana, I had the two children, so, of course, the letter does state for two children and two adults.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-15\">* <em>* </em>* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-16\">Q. Do you have a car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-17\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-18\">Q. How did you get here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-19\">A. Public transportation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-20\">Q. Okay. Do you have any kind of bank accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-21\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-22\">Q. Do you have any cash or any other valuables with you today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-23\">A. I have a 20-dollar bill that I was going to pay, but I figured I was going to jail, so I thought maybe I should keep that in my pocket for jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-24\">Q. Do you receive any kind of public assistance, social security or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-25\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-26\">Q. Any kind of workman\u2019s compensation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">Q. How long since you have been working?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">A. \u201991, August \u201991.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">Q. What kind of work was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">A. That was a job for the federal government, NIH. My mother got very sick and because of personal problems at home, et cetera, I quit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">Q. What attempts have you made to find employment recently?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">A. Well, I\u2019ve done miscellaneous, like yard work or\u2014let\u2019s see, I\u2019ve delivered flowers one day, where you get a whole four dollars for walking three hours one day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\">Q. Have you got applications out anyplace?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-13\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-14\">Q. Why don\u2019t you have a phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-15\">A It was turned off a couple of years ago, back in 1992, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-16\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-17\">THE COURT: Ma\u2019am, what kind of work did you have with the government?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-18\">THE WITNESS: It was receptionist type, personal assistant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-19\">THE COURT: How much did you get paid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-20\">THE WITNESS: That was $11.49 an hour when I quit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-21\">s}: # * # * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-22\">THE COURT: You left that job in 1991?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-23\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-24\">THE COURT: Because your mother was sick?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-25\">THE -WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-26\">THE COURT: When did she die?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-27\">THE WITNESS: November 1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-28\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-29\">The prosecutor made the following closing argument: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>... I think you are looking at somewhat of a classic voluntary impoverishment case. She doesn\u2019t work, she obviously doesn\u2019t have to work. She can meet her needs by some other way. I can\u2019t get to any of her assets because she doesn\u2019t legally own anything. In terms of this piece of property, it would be nice if we had a judgment, we could go after the property, but she doesn\u2019t own the property and she won\u2019t do anything to get the estate moving along ... I think it is one big game. In light of the payment history, I think that is pretty obvious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">The circuit court agreed, stating to appellant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">You know, you are free to live the life that you do, and I am not saying it is a great life ... but you have got support payments here, you have got to face them, you have got to deal with that. That is the problem I have, I have got to make you understand how important this is. You can\u2019t live the way you live. You can\u2019t do it ... You have got to go out and make some money ... obviously, you are a pretty skillful person and you have got some ability ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">I am going to decide that you are in arrears $5,680. Your case has been continued at least eight, times for you to start paying. You did not show up once. The last time you paid was November 1992, over a year ago. You are lucky you don\u2019t have to pay any rent. All you have to do is eat and ... you have got a discretionary lifestyle if there ever was one. Even though it is not the best lifestyle, it is one that is discretionary and in the process of it you don\u2019t pay support that you have the ability to pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">The circuit court entered an order providing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">1. That (appellant) is in contempt of Court for her willful failure to pay child support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">2. That a judgment is entered in favor of (appellee) and against (appellant) for $5,680.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">3. That (appellant) be confined to the Montgomery County Department of Correction and Rehabilitation for twenty (20) days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>4. That (appellant) may purge her contempt by paying $500.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">5. That this matter is set for further Review on July 22, 1994, at 9:00 A.M.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration was heard and denied on March 16, 1994. At that hearing, the circuit court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think she did have $500 in her pocket ... but I think because of the lifestyle that she leads, has it available to her to purge herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Appellee argues that we should hold that the issues are moot because appellant has already served the sentence that was imposed. We disagree. In <em>Jones v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 94, 484 A.2d 1050 (1984), even though the appellant had already served the sentence imposed, we held that the case was not moot because she would be entitled to exoneration if the trial court\u2019s finding was reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 96, 484 A.2d 1050. Moreover, a case that involves \u201cfrequently recurring issues of public importance ... ought to be decided.\u201d <em>Rutherford v. Rutherford, </em>296 Md. 347, 352, 464 A.2d 228 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">It is true that appellant is out of jail at the present time. We are not persuaded, however, that her case is necessarily moot. Her support obligation continues to be the subject of further review. She remains in arrears on that obligation. A recurrence of this action is likely. We shall answer the second and third questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">To determine whether appellant was in contempt of the September 12, 1991 order, the circuit court properly focused on the entire period of time between the date on which the order was entered and the date on which the hearing was held. The evidence showed that appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>earning $11.49 per hour when she left her job in August of 1992. Her mother died in November, 1992. As of the March 4, 1994 hearing, appellant had not yet obtained other steady employment. Appellant\u2019s hearing had already been postponed eight times to give her an opportunity to make payments. That appellant chose to be supported by others does not prove that she lacked the ability to make child support payments. Voluntary impoverishment is simply not a valid defense to a contempt charge arising out of a parent\u2019s refusal to comply with his or her child support obligation. <em>Goldberger v. Goldberger, </em>96 Md.App. 313, 326, 624 A.2d 1328 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\"> \u201cThe purpose of imprisonment for contempt is to compel compliance with a court order but where the person alleged to be in contempt can establish a valid defense, such as the unintentional inability to obey the order, imprisonment is not proper.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>241 Md. 416, 420, 216 A.2d 914 (1966). The \u201cunintentional inability\u201d defense is an affirmative defense to the charge of contempt. The alleged contemnor bears both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion on this issue. <em>Speckler v. Speckler, </em>256 Md. 635, 637, 261 A.2d 466 (1970); <em>Elzey v. Elzey, </em>291 Md. 369, 374, 435 A.2d 445 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Appellant was given the opportunity to present evidence in support of her affirmative defense. The circuit court \u201cwas free to accept that evidence which it believed and reject that which it did not.\u201d <em>Muir v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 648, 654, 498 A.2d 666 (1985), <em>affd. </em>308 Md. 208, 517 A.2d 1105 (1986). The rejection of testimony, of course, does not prove that the converse of that testimony is true. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Clements, </em>319 Md. 289, 298, 572 A.2d 174 (1990); <em>Roeder v. Auxier, </em>70 Md.App. 50, 55, 519 A.2d 1323 (1987), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Wellcraft Marine Corp. v. Roeder, </em>314 Md. 186, 550 A.2d 377 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Disbelief of appellant\u2019s \u201cunintentional inability\u201d testimony could not, of itself, prove that she was guilty of contempt. The trial judge was entitled, however, to accept certain portions of appellant\u2019s testimony and to reject other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>portions. We are persuaded that the evidence presented in this case was sufficient to support the conclusion that appellant had committed a contempt of court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">There can be no question that courts have inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders through civil contempt ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">However, the justification for coercive imprisonment as applied to civil contempt depends upon the ability of the contemnor to comply with the court\u2019s order ... This limitation accords with the doctrine that a court must exercise \u201c[t]he least possible power adequate to the end proposed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Dunn, </em>6 Wheat. 204, 231, 5 L.Ed. 242 (1821);</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\"><em>Shillitani v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 364, 370-371, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 1536, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Having correctly determined that appellant had committed a civil contempt, the trial judge was entitled to order that she be confined\u2014for a determinate <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or indeterminate period\u2014until she complied with the purging provision. Because the purging provision must give the contemnor \u201cthe keys to the jail cell,\u201d the judge must be affirmatively persuaded that the contemnor has the ability to accomplish whatever it takes to avoid imprisonment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is an abuse of discretion to set a purging provision that the contemnor cannot satisfy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>Baltimore v. Baltimore, </em>89 Md.App. 250, 254, 597 A.2d 1058 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The. issue of whether the contemnor has the ability to comply with the purging provision differs in two respects from the issue of whether a contempt has been proven. First, the issue of what the purging provision should contain is much narrower than the issue of whether a contempt has been committed. When establishing the purging provision, the judge\u2019s focus must be confined to the period of time between the moment at which the contemnor is found in contempt and the moment at which the coercive imprisonment is to begin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, because the contempt order provided for immediate confinement, the judge\u2019s focus was narrowed to the circumstances that existed at that moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Second, although it is the person charged with contempt who has the burden of proving the \u201cunintentional inability\u201d defense, the person found to be in civil contempt cannot be assigned the burden of proving his or her inability to comply with the purging provision. <em>Fields v. Fields, </em>74 Md.App. 628, 635, 539 A.2d 708 (1988), <em>Elzey v. Elzey, </em>291 Md. 369, 376, 435 A.2d 445 (1981). In one respect, however, the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of evidence at the purging provision phase is identical to the evaluation of evidence at the guilt/innocence phase. An affirmative finding that the contemnor is presently able to comply with the purging provision cannot be based solely on the judge\u2019s disbelief of the contemnor\u2019s claim of inability to comply. <em>Clements, supra, </em>319 Md. at 298, 572 A.2d 174; <em>Roeder, supra, </em>70 Md.App. at 55, 519 A.2d 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In this case, the finding that appellant had the present ability to comply with the purging provision of five hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>dollars ($500) was based exclusively on the disbelief of her testimony that she was not able to pay any more than the twenty dollars ($20) she brought to court with her. The evidence was therefore insufficient to support the conclusion that appellant had the present ability to comply with the purging provision that was established. The establishment of a purging provision in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500) constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">If appellant had not already served the sentence imposed, we would remand for a modification of the purging provision. We shall instead reverse the purging provision only, and direct that any future civil contempt proceedings be consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">FINDING OF CONTEMPT AFFIRMED; PURGING PROVISION REVERSED; APPELLEE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-14\">. Appellant has resumed use of her maiden name, Susan McGaiy. This appeal, however, was docketed under her married name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-14\">. Appellant was facing a sentence of incarceration and was therefore entitled to appointed counsel. <em>Rutherford v. Rutherford, </em>296 Md. 347, 363, 464 A.2d 228 (1983). She was represented by an Assistant Public Defender. The Support Enforcement Division was represented by an Assistant State's Attorney for Montgomery County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b109-10\">. A determinate sentence may be imposed as long as the order of commitment allows the contemnor to be released if compliance is accomplished prior to the end of the term. <em>McDaniel v. McDaniel, </em>256 Md. 684, 690, 262 A.2d 52 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b109-11\">. In <em>Speckler, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals stated \u201cthat one charged with contempt may avoid imprisonment by showing he has neither the money nor the ability to pay. <em>Id. </em>at 637, 261 A.2d 466. That statement, however, actually addresses the issue of who has the burden of persuasion on the \"unintentional inability to obey\u201d defense, rather than on the purging provision issue. We are persuaded that <em>FAzey </em>requires an affirmative finding that the contemnor is able to comply with the purging provision. 291 Md. at 376, 435 A.2d 445.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b110-7\">. When the evidence establishes that the contemnor needs time to comply with the purging provision, the coercive imprisonment must be deferred to the deadline for compliance. If, for example, it is established at a Monday hearing that the contemnor will be unable to pay any support until a paycheck arrives on Friday, the contempt order should provide for the contemnor\u2019s imprisonment at the close of business on Friday if the purging provision has not been complied with by that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
