Taylor filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against attorney Karl G. Feissner. The complaint alleged that Feissner was negligent in his handling of Taylor\u2019s, claim against the U.S. Department of Commerce for age discrimination. In addition to the value of Taylor\u2019s discrimination claim, the alleged damages included $30,000 in legal fees paid to Feissner over a three-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In response, Feissner filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment. In the motion, Feissner argued that, as a matter of law, his conduct was not the proximate cause of any damages to Taylor. At the close of a hearing on March 23, 1994, the court (Ryan, J.) granted the motion, and stated that the issue of attorney\u2019s fees should be handled through arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Taylor, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>presents fifteen questions (including subparts) for our review, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">I. Did the circuit court err in granting the motion for summary judgment when it concluded, as a matter of law, that appellee\u2019s conduct was not the proximate cause of appellant\u2019s damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">II. Did the circuit court err when it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to decide the fee dispute between appellant and appellee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">III. Did the circuit court err in failing to provide appellant an opportunity for rebuttal to a defense raised for the first time at the hearing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">For the reasons we shall set forth, we affirm in part and reverse in part the circuit court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">On November 4, 1988, Taylor retained Feissner to represent him with regard to a claim against the U.S. Department of Commerce for age discrimination. Prior to the alleged discrimination, Taylor was chief of the supply division at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>National Bureau of Standards. In 1978, the supply division was eliminated during a reorganization, and Taylor\u2019s position was abolished. Taylor was fifty-four years old at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Following the reorganization, Taylor was assigned to a series of different positions within the agency, in which he claimed he was given no meaningful work. On three different occasions in 1981, Taylor was placed on a \u201creduction in force\u201d list, but was removed from the list each time prior to any formal hearing. He was also required to change offices at least four times during a four-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In August 1985, Taylor learned that the \u201csupply\u201d division was to be reinstated as the \u201csupply and procurement\u201d division, and a younger employee was named as the chief. In 1987, the acting director of the agency asked Taylor what his retirement plans were. Taylor was not eligible for retirement at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Taylor was detailed to a temporary administrative position in December 1987. On April 29, 1988, a new acting deputy director also asked Taylor about his retirement plans. On June 7, Taylor was ordered to vacate his private office and was moved to a desk in a reception area.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Taylor first began to pursue his claim of age discrimination in June 1988. He contacted an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor regarding his complaints on June 14. The following day, he initiated an administrative grievance procedure with the Department of Commerce. On July 13, 1988, Taylor filed a formal age discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In his complaint, Taylor sought to be reinstated to his original permanent position as chief of the supply and procurement division. After the complaint was filed, the Director of the National Laboratory restored Taylor to his position of record (\u201cProgram Resources Analysis\u201d) and returned him to the private office that he was forced to vacate in June.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">When Feissner entered the case on November 4, 1988, both the administrative grievance and the EEOC complaint were \u2022 still pending. Each of those complaints charged the depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ment with a series of allegedly discriminatory acts occurring over a ten-year period. In December 1988, the Department of Commerce issued a final decision on the administrative grievance. The department concluded that relief for most of the alleged wrongdoing was time-barred by provisions in the applicable EEOC regulations, with the sole exception of the department\u2019s removal of Taylor from his private office in June 1988. Because Taylor had been returned to that office, the department concluded that the final issue was moot. In February 1989, the EEOC released a decision that concurred with the department\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In his brief, Taylor asserts that Feissner \u201ccontinuously counseled that appellant\u2019s claim of age discrimination was indeed valid, legitimate, and meritorious.\u201d According to Taylor, Feissner also told him that the administrative procedures must be exhausted before a complaint could be filed in federal court. Nonetheless, Feissner filed a complaint in the Federal District Court for the District of Maryland on January 24, 1989\u2014one month prior to the EEOC\u2019s final ruling. The amended complaint contained two counts. Count I alleged a violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et. seq. </em>Count II alleged a conspiracy to violate Taylor\u2019s civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">After a thorough briefing by both parties, the federal court dismissed Taylor\u2019s claim without a hearing. In a Memorandum and Order dated November 12, 1991, the court (Ramsey, J.) ruled, <em>inter alia, </em>that Taylor had failed to give the EEOC proper notice of his intent to file the district court action. The court also concluded that the EEOC was correct in ruling that relief for the alleged discrimination was either time-barred or moot. With regard to Count II, the court ruled that the \u00a7 1985 conspiracy claim was preempted by the ADEA. Taylor\u2019s <em>pro se </em>appeal to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals was still pending when this appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Taylor\u2019s claim for legal malpractice alleges, in part, that the lawsuit filed by Feissner was not timely and that Feissner did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>not properly notify the EEOC of his intent to file the action. The complaint alleges that Feissner\u2019s malpractice resulted in $590,000 in damages, the bulk of which represents the alleged value of Taylor\u2019s claim for age discrimination. The damages also include $30,000 in fees paid to Feissner and expert witnesses, and $10,000 for costs incurred by Taylor in pursuing his <em>pro se </em>appeal to the Fourth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In support of his motion to dismiss, Feissner avers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">A close examination of the requirements to file an age discrimination suit in District Court, along with the facts of this case, reveals, regardless of Feissner\u2019s alleged failure to timely notify the EEOC, Taylor would not have been able to recover any damages in his age discrimination suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In short, Feissner asserted that his handling of the case was not the proximate cause of Taylor\u2019s failure to recover damages for his age-discrimination claim. With regard to the dispute over Feissner\u2019s fees and the litigation expenses, Feissner noted that the retainer signed by the parties provides for settlement of such disputes \u201cby arbitration or court action\u201d at his option.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">In granting Feissner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">I believe that at the time the suit was filed in the Federal Court the only action that could have been pled correctly or alleged was the removal of [Taylor\u2019s] office and title and that was resolved. I have considered the entire record, including [the federal district court\u2019s] memorandum and order, and I believe having said that and dismissing this action, the issue of attorney\u2019s fees can now be handled through the arbitration. So, I will grant the motion and dismiss this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">From that ruling, Taylor filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AHO\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">As we noted above, the motion at issue in this case was styled as a \u201cmotion to dismiss, or in the alternative, motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>summary judgment.\u201d Maryland Rule 2-322(c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">If, on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 2-501----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Here, the court considered more than a dozen exhibits submitted by the parties before it ruled on the motion. The court plainly treated the motion as one for summary judgment, and we review the matter accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Maryland Rule 2-501(a) provides that a motion for summary judgment may not be granted unless the court concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In determining whether a factual dispute exists, all inferences that may be drawn from the pleadings, from affidavits, or from admissions must be resolved against the moving party. <em>Berkey v. Delia, 287 </em>Md. 302, 304-05, 413 A.2d 170 (1980). A disputed fact is not \u201cmaterial\u201d unless resolution of such issue would somehow affect the outcome of the case. <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985); <em>Washington Homes, Inc. v. Interstate Land Dev. Co., </em>281 Md. 712, 717, 382 A.2d 555 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">In <em>Seaboard Surety Co. v. Richard F. Kline, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 236, 603 A.2d 1357 (1992), we explained that the trial court\u2019s handling of a motion for summary judgment should be akin to the standard applied to a motion for a directed verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyL\">[T]he judge must ask himself not whether he thinks the evidence unmistakably favors one side or the other but whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented. The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 603 A.2d at 1361 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Ltd., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). When reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment, we must consider whether a dispute of material fact existed and whether the trial judge was legally correct. <em>Lynx, Inc. v. Ordnance Prods. Inc., </em>273 Md. 1, 8, 327 A.2d 502 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In <em>Watson v. Calvert Bldg and Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>91 Md. 25, 33, 45 A. 879 (1900), the Court of Appeals stated that an attorney will be hable to his or her client for losses resulting from the attorney\u2019s failure to exercise a \u201creasonable degree of skill\u201d or a \u201clike degree of diligence.\u201d <em>Accord Stone v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 329, 335, 624 A.2d 496 (1993). In a suit against an attorney for negligence, the plaintiff must prove that the attorney\u2019s neglect of a reasonable duty was the proximate cause of injury to the client. <em>Stone, </em>330 Md. at 335, 624 A2d at 499; <em>Flaherty v. Weinberg, </em>303 Md. 116, 128, 492 A.2d 618 (1985). To establish that proximate cause existed, the plaintiff must show some reasonable connection between the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence and the injury suffered by the plaintiff. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Hartford Ins. Co. v. Manor Inn, </em>335 Md. 135, 156, 642 A.2d 219 (1994), proximate cause \u201cultimately involves a conclusion that someone will be held legally responsible for the consequences of an act or omission.\u201d The plaintiff must show, in part, that the alleged negligence was a \u201ccause in fact,\u201d <em>Atlantic Mutual v. Kenney, </em>323 Md. 116, 127-28, 591 A.2d 507 (1991), and that \u201cbut for\u201d the negligence, the injury would not have occurred. <em>Peterson v. Underwood, </em>258 Md. 9, 16, 264 A.2d 851 (1970). The existence or absence of proximate cause rests upon principles of common sense in light of the surrounding facts and circumstances. <em>See Texas Co. v. Pecora, </em>208 Md. 281, 293, 118 A.2d 377 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In the context of this case, Taylor has the burden of proving that, \u201cbut for\u201d Feissner\u2019s alleged negligence, Taylor would have prevailed on his age-discrimination claim. Feissner\u2019s motion for summary judgment cannot be upheld unless no fair-minded jury could return a verdict for Taylor on the evidence presented. <em>Seaboard Surety, </em>91 Md.App. at 244, 603 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>A.2d at 1360-61. Our decision on that issue requires that we examine the mechanics of bringing a claim under the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The Age Discrimination in Employment Act provides two routes by which an aggrieved party may pursue a claim for age discrimination in federal district court. Under the \u201cdirect route,\u201d an ADEA plaintiff may proceed directly to federal court pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(c) (1988). The only prerequisite for such an action is timely notice to the EEOC as required by \u00a7 633a(d). Second, the ADEA provides that a person may pursue the claim administratively via the EEOC, and then bring an action in federal court if he or she is not satisfied with the outcome of the administrative process. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(b), (c) (1988). <em>See Stevens v. Department of Treasury, </em>500 U.S. 1, 5-6, 111 S.Ct. 1562, 1566, 114 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">An aggrieved party who files a direct action in federal court must give the EEOC notice of his or her intent to do so \u201cwithin one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(d) (1988). The claimant is also required to give notice to the EEOC at least thirty days in advance of filing an action. <em>Id. </em>Under the administrative route, the time restrictions are substantially more severe. The aggrieved employee must bring</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">... to the attention of the Equal Employment Opportunity Counselor the matter causing him/her to believe he/she had been discriminated against within 30 calendar days of the date of the alleged discriminatory event, the effective date of an alleged discriminatory personnel action, or the date that the aggrieved person knew or reasonably should have known of the discriminatory event or personnel action....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.214(a)(l)(i) (1994). In ruling on Taylor\u2019s claim, the federal district court concluded that the time limitations under both routes function like statutes of limitation, subject to equitable modification in proper cases. <em>See James </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>v. United States Postal Service, </em>835 F.2d 1265, 1267 (8th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The United States Supreme Court addressed a similar situation in <em>United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, </em>431 U.S. 553, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977). The applicable statute required that a claim of gender discrimination be filed with the EEOC within ninety days after the alleged unlawful conduct. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">A discriminatory act which is not made the basis for a timely charge is the legal equivalent of a discriminatory act which occurred before the statute was passed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\"><em>Evans, </em>431 U.S. at 558, 97 S.Ct. at 1889. The alleged discriminatory acts, the Court said, were \u201can unfortunate event in history which has no present legal consequences.\u201d Although <em>Evans </em>was decided under Title VII, the same principle has been applied to the time limitations contained in the ADEA. <em>See Bruno v. Western Elec. Co., </em>829 F.2d 957, 960 (10th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In his complaint, Taylor alleged that Feissner negligently failed to give the EEOC thirty days\u2019 notice and that the lack of such notice was the proximate cause of Taylor\u2019s inability to recover damages for the alleged discrimination. In granting Feissner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court effectively concluded that no fair-minded juror could return a verdict for Taylor on the evidence presented. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The federal court\u2019s ruling, together with the applicable statutes and regulations, make it plain that Taylor could have recovered damages <em>only </em>for discriminatory conduct that took place within the thirty-day or 180-day time limitations. If Feissner had given notice to the EEOC on November 4, 1988 (the date that Taylor first contacted him) and filed a direct action thirty days thereafter, Taylor\u2019s claim for damages would have been limited to his removal from a private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>office in June 1988. The same may be said for an appeal from Taylor\u2019s administrative claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">When Taylor first contacted Feissner in 1988, ten years had passed since the department terminated Taylor\u2019s position, and three years had passed since the department failed to reinstate him as chief of the revived supply and procurement division. On Taylor\u2019s behalf, Feissner argued to the federal court that the time limitations should not apply to Taylor\u2019s claim for two reasons: first, because Taylor did not \u201cdiscover\u201d the discrimination until mid-1988; and second, because the removal of Taylor from his private office constituted part of a \u201ccontinuing violation.\u201d The federal court rejected both theories.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With regard to the discovery rule, the court pointed to the direct language of the EEOC regulations, which states that an aggrieved employee must contact an EEO counselor within thirty calendar days of those events \u201ccausing him/her to believe\u201d that discrimination had occurred. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.214(a)(l)(i) (1994). The court then noted that Taylor, by his own admission, had \u201csuspected discrimination all along,\u201d and only became <em>certain </em>in 1988. Further, the federal court concluded that Taylor was in no position to invoke the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d theory, because the doctrine does not apply to a case in which the claimant is denied meaningful work following an allegedly discriminatory event. <em>See Bruno, </em>829 F.2d at 960-62 (discussing the continuing violation theory generally); <em>Brewer v. Mosbacher, </em>Civil No. JFM-89-2340 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>(D.Md.1990) (holding that the continuing violation theory does not apply to an employee who alleges that he or she was denied meaningful work). <em>See also </em>3A Arthur Larson, Employment Discrimination \u00a7 102.21(b), at 21-251-53 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>the truth of Taylor\u2019s allegations, it appears that Taylor may have had a meritorious claim for age discrimination. Nonetheless, Taylor was required to bring the matter to the prompt attention of the EEOC, and his own failure to do so was the proximate cause of his inability to collect damages for the alleged discrimination. Regardless of any facts that might be alleged and proven at trial, no reasonable jury could conclude that, \u201cbut for\u201d Feissner\u2019s alleged negligence, Taylor would have recovered those damages. Feissner was entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to that issue relating to damages, and the circuit court did not err in granting his motion for summary judgment with respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">We think it necessary, however, to clarify the effect of the trial court\u2019s ruling. Taylor\u2019s complaint presented a single count of negligence and legal malpractice, by reason of which he allegedly suffered certain damages. With regard to the largest part of those damages\u2014the alleged value of Taylor\u2019s age-discrimination claim\u2014the trial court ruled that Feissner was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. With regard to the remainder of the damages\u2014the fees paid to Feissner\u2014the court dismissed the claim holding that there was a binding arbitration agreement. The court did not grant summary judgment with regard to Feissner\u2019s allegedly negligent performance of his professional and contractual duties to Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">At the close of the hearing on Feissner\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe issue of attorney\u2019s fees can now be handled through arbitration.\u201d Taylor contends that the trial court erred in dismissing his claim for fees and costs paid to Feissner. Resolution of the issue requires that we consider the nature of the damages claimed, as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>scope and effect of the arbitration clause contained in the retainer agreement signed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In Taylor\u2019s complaint for legal malpractice, the alleged damages include approximately $30,000 in legal fees paid to Feissner over a three-year period. A January 1992 letter from Taylor to the Fee Arbitration Committee of the Montgomery County Bar Association provides further details. The letter states that Taylor paid Feissner $28,745.19 in costs and fees: $21,956.10 in attorney\u2019s fees, $6,035.50 for expert witnesses, and $753.59 in deposition costs. In part, Taylor\u2019s letter asserts that Feissner\u2019s filing of the federal court action was \u201cnonproductive, inappropriate, unnecessary, and totally without merit.\u201d The letter concludes that Taylor\u2019s payment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with the federal court action is \u201cunconscionable, unfair, and excessive\u201d in view of Feissner\u2019s mistakes and his \u201cproven lack of expertise in employment law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Although Feissner and the trial court have both characterized those concerns as a \u201cfee dispute,\u201d we think it essential to point out that the claim is one for legal malpractice. The gravamen of such a claim is \u201cthe negligent breach of the contractual duty.\u201d <em>Flaherty v. Weinberg, </em>303 Md. 116, 134, 492 A.2d 618 (1985). In <em>Kendall v. Rogers, </em>181 Md. 606, 611, 31 A.2d 312 (1943), the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">A client who has employed an attorney has a right to his diligence, his knowledge, and his skill; and whether he had not so much of these qualities as he was bound to have, or having them, neglected to employ them, the law properly makes him <em>liable for the loss which has accrued to his employer.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">(quoting <em>Cochrane v. Little, </em>71 Md. 323, 18 A. 698 (1889) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The \u201cfee dispute\u201d contained in Taylor\u2019s complaint and his letter to the fee arbitration committee may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>1. Feissner negligently counseled Taylor that his claim for age discrimination \u201cwas indeed valid, legitimate, and meritorious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">2. Relying on that negligent misrepresentation, Taylor authorized Feissner to pursue an action in federal court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">3. Feissner was further negligent in failing to give the EEOC proper notice of his intent to file an action in federal court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">4. As a consequence of Feissner\u2019s negligence, Taylor has been billed $30,000 in fees for a lawsuit that was \u201cnonproductive, inappropriate, unnecessary, and totally without merit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-7\"><em>Compare Flaherty, </em>303 Md. at 134-35, 492 A.2d at 627-28 (discussing negligent misrepresentation in the context of attorney malpractice). A client may certainly consent to an action that has only a modest chance of success in court. Nonetheless, the attorney has both professional and contractual obligations to exercise reasonable care in advising his or her client about the merits of a claim. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Rules of Peofessional Conduct, Rule 1.4(b) (stating that \u201c[a] lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The damages arising from this malpractice claim consist primarily of the fees and costs paid by Taylor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Feissner contends that the claim is subject to the arbitration clause contained in the retainer signed by the parties, which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">Any claim or controversy <em>arising out of or relating to fees or costs due the Firm </em>shall be settled by arbitration or court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>action, at the option of the Firm, with the costs of said proceeding abiding the result. If an arbitration hearing is required, it shall be held at the Firm, and judgment upon any award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any Court having jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The cardinal rule in the construction and interpretation of contracts is that effect must be given to the intention of the parties, unless it is inconsistent with some established principle of law. <em>Kasten Constr. Co. v. Rod Enterprises, </em>268 Md. 318, 328-29, 301 A.2d 12 (1973). The construction or interpretation of contracts is initially a matter of law for the court. <em>Suburban Hosp. v. Dwiggins, </em>324 Md. 294, 306, 596 A.2d 1069 (1991). Where a contract is plain and unambiguous, there is no room for construction and we must presume that the contract means what it says. In those circumstances, the court will not consider extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent. Rather, we confine our review to the language itself, and consider what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought the contract meant. <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Daniels, </em>303 Md. 254, 261-62, 492 A.2d 1306 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Taylor\u2019s complaint for legal malpractice alleged that he \u201cpaid\u201d $30,000 in fees to Karl Feissner \u201cand various experts he required in the preparation of the lawsuit.\u201d In his letter to the fee arbitration committee, Taylor asserted that the fees were \u201cpaid\u201d to Feissner \u201cover the period November 1988 through December 1991.\u201d In his motion to dismiss, Feissner neither admits nor denies that the fees have been paid. Had he done so, the trial court would have been required to consider all disputed issues of fact in the light most favorable to Taylor. <em>Berkey, </em>287 Md. at 304-05, 413 A.2d at 171. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it dismissed Taylor\u2019s claim for recovery of any fees and costs that he alleged were previously paid. Rather than an adjudication of a \u201cfee dispute,\u201d the trial court will be required to determine whether, under all of the circumstances, Feissner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>exacted a fee in excess of that which would have been required by competent counsel to conclude that there was no merit to Taylor\u2019s claim. Such a determination must be based on evidence at trial or documentation (affidavits on a summary judgment motion) by legal experts concerning whether a lawyer experienced in discrimination law should have realized a low probability of successfully advancing the \u201ccontinuing liability\u201d theory or the theory that Taylor\u2019s cause of action accrued only in 1988 when he was alleged to have discovered the violation, and whether he therefore should have so advised his client of the low or minuscule probability of success. Should it be decided that Taylor was misled into believing there was a high probability of success when Feissner knew otherwise, Feissner would be entitled only to that reasonable fee required to determine that Taylor\u2019s cause was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\n<em>TV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The final question presented by Taylor hinges on certain remarks made by Feissner\u2019s attorney near the close of the hearing on Feissner\u2019s motion. According to counsel, the effect of <em>Stevens, </em>500 U.S. at 1, 111 S.Ct. at 1562, was that \u201cnothing could be done to salvage [Taylor\u2019s] claim, because no claim in fact existed as of November 4, 1988, as a matter of law, when my client was retained.\u201d Taylor contends that this was a new defense, previously unraised. He further contends that the trial court erred by \u201cabruptly\u201d ending the hearing, and by failing to give him an opportunity for rebuttal. It is clear from the pleadings and the transcript that Taylor\u2019s position has no merit. On page five of the memorandum supporting his motion to dismiss, Feissner sets out an argument that is not substantially different from his position during the hearing. Moreover, the transcript shows that Taylor did not request an opportunity to respond. The issue, therefore, was not preserved for appellate review. See Md. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\n<em>V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Feissner devotes the final section of his brief to his assertion that \u201cappellant is not entitled to recover the fee charged by appellee.\u201d In doing so, Feissner seriously misstates the effect of <em>Stevens, </em>500 U.S. at 1, 111 S.Ct. at 1562. Because Feissner\u2019s counsel made the same misstatements in his argument to the court below, we think it pertinent for us to comment briefly on the holding of <em>Stevens, </em>and the impact of that decision on Taylor\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">At the time that Feissner was retained, the federal circuit courts had reached different conclusions about the requirements for notification contained in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(d). In <em>Stevens, </em>500 U.S. at 3-5, 111 S.Ct. at 1565, the district court had determined that an aggrieved employee was required to (a) initiate an action in federal court no later than 180 days after the alleged wrongful conduct, and (b) notify the EEOC <em>within </em>thirty days prior to the filing of the action. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the district court erred, and held that <em>notice </em>must be given to the EEOC within 180 days after the alleged wrongful conduct. Nonetheless, the Fifth Circuit agreed that the federal litigation had to commence within thirty days after notice to the EEOC. Other federal courts had similarly misconstrued the statute. <em>See, e.g., Castro v. United States, </em>775 F.2d 399, 403 (1st Cir.1985); <em>McKinney v. Dole, </em>765 F.2d 1129, 1140 (D.C.Cir.1985). As we noted earlier, the Supreme Court concluded that (a) an aggrieved employee must notify the EEOC within 180 days after the alleged wrongful conduct, and (b) the notice must be given at least 30 days before the federal court action is filed. <em>Stevens, </em>500 U.S. at 5-7, 111 S.Ct. at 1566.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">During the hearing, Feissner\u2019s counsel argued that \u201cthe law in this area ... was in a state of flux,\u201d and the dispute between the various federal circuits was not resolved until <em>Stevens </em>was decided, well after Feissner had been retained. He later restated that position in greater detail. \u201c[A]t the time that Mr. Taylor walked into [Feissner\u2019s] office,\u201d he asserted, \u201cthe law was very much unsettled as to whether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>not one needed to exhaust administrative remedies and the time for filing a lawsuit.\u201d Feissner\u2019s counsel concluded that \u201cup until the time that Stevens is decided, there is no question that the advice he renders is correct.\u201d The same arguments are made in Feissner\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">With regard to the timing requirements, Feissner\u2019s argument is entirely without merit. The law was indeed unsettled, but we fail to see what bearing that uncertainty had on Taylor\u2019s claim. Regardless of whether Taylor was required to give notice within 180 days, or whether he was required to initiate a federal court action within 180 days, the result would have been the same, i.e., on the date that Taylor contacted Feissner, no relief could have been granted for the alleged discrimination, <em>unless </em>the federal court decided that the alleged discrimination was a \u201ccontinuing violation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the ruling in <em>Stevens </em>does not redeem Feissner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>failure to give notice to the EEOC before filing the action. Although the federal circuit courts had disagreed about the timing of the notice, it was clear that <em>some </em>advance notice was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Before Taylor expended $30,000 on the federal lawsuit, Feissner was obliged to explain the merits of the case \u201cto the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.\u201d Md.Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.4. He was also required to exercise reasonable care by filing any action in compliance with the applicable statutes, including the notice requirement contained in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(d). Taylor, of course, bears the burden of proving that Feissner failed to meet the proper standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Because Taylor is proceeding pro <em>se, </em>we close with a word of caution. As a general rule, expert testimony is required to establish legal malpractice, except in those cases where the \u201ccommon knowledge or experience of laymen is extensive enough to recognize or infer negligence from the facts.\u201d <em>Fishow v. Simpson, </em>55 Md.App. 312, 318-19, 462 A.2d 540 (1983); <em>Central Cab Co. v. Clarke, </em>259 Md. 542, 551-52, 270 A.2d 662 (1970). We think that expert opinion will be necessary to establish whether Feissner exercised reasonable care in assessing the merits of the continuing violation theory as applied to Taylor\u2019s case. It may also be necessary to establish whether Feissner properly advised Taylor regarding the merits of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID ONE-HALF BY APPELLANT AND ONE-HALF BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-6\">. Because Taylor first contacted an EEO counselor on June 14, 1988, relief under the administrative route would have been limited to discriminatory acts that occurred on or after May 15, 1988. Had Feissner given notice to the EEOC on November 4, 1988, relief under the direct route would be limited to acts which occurred on or after May 8, 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\">. Although the federal court ruled that an action by the direct route was barred by Taylor\u2019s failure to give <em>proper </em>notice, the court reached those issues via the administrative route. After noting that the ADEA contained no express exhaustion requirement, the court explained that the issue remained unsettled, and concluded that it lacked authority to impose an exhaustion requirement in Taylor\u2019s case. In <em>Stevens, </em>500 U.S. at 7-11, 111 S.Ct. at 1567-68, the Supreme Court declined to decide the exhaustion issue because the government had \u201creconsidered\u201d its position and no longer asserted that exhaustion was required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b400-11\">. In his complaint, Taylor also sought $10,000 in damages for the \u201ccontinuing costs\u201d of pursuing a pro se appeal in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as the costs of pursuing three related civil actions in federal district court. On the record before us, it is unclear which (if any) of those expenses may constitute damages proximately caused by Feissner\u2019s alleged malpractice. We were advised at oral argument that Taylor's appeal to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has been recently decided adversely to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\">. The successful application of the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d theory to the facts of Taylor\u2019s case appears to be problematic. As Larson\u2019s treatise on employment discrimination explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">[T]he demotion or transfer of an employee, or the denial of a promotion, are discrete acts, rather than a continuing practice, and may not be the basis of a continuing violation claim, <em>even when the plaintiff asserts that each day he faces the effects of the discriminatory act.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">3A Larson \u00a7 102.21(b), at 21-252-53 (citations omitted; emphasis added). Although we have quoted from the 1994 edition, the cases that Anderson cites in support of that proposition were decided <em>before </em>Taylor retained Feissner. <em>See, e.g., Downey v. Southern Natural Gas Co., </em>649 F.2d 302, 304-05 (5th Cir.1981) (demotion was deemed to be a single act of discrimination, even though the demotion had a continuing effect on Downey); <em>Furr v. AT &amp; T Technologies, </em>824 F.2d 1537, 1543 (10th Cir.1987) (a continuing violation will not be found where the plaintiff merely complains about the \"continuing effects\u201d of past discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">The continuing violation may constitute either a company-wide policy of discrimination, or a clear pattern of related acts taken against a single individual. <em>Bruno, </em>829 F.2d at 961. Feissner apparently argued that a continuirig violation existed by virtue of the department\u2019s systematic discrimination against older employees. <em>Compare Furr, </em>824 F.2d at 1542-43. In support of that argument, Feissner pointed to the facts of <em>Brewster v. Mosbacher, </em>Civil No. JFM-89-2340 (D.Md.1990), a case involving similar allegations against the department. The federal court concluded that Feissner\u2019s argument had no merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
