From an order directing payment of $5,000 plus interest to Voland, Nationwide has appealed. For the reasons discussed below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The material facts are undisputed. On December 5, 1991, Voland was involved in an automobile collision with Douglas Franklin. On September 17, 1992, Voland sued Franklin in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to recover for injuries he sustained in the accident. An Amended Complaint adding Nationwide as a defendant was filed on May 3, 1993 and served on May 12, 1993. In the Amended Complaint, Voland alleged that Nationwide, his own insurance carrier, had breached the uninsured-motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) and underinsuredmotorist (\u201cUIM\u201d) clauses of its insurance policy by denying Voland\u2019s claim for damages in excess of Franklin\u2019s insurance policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">On May 4, 1993, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., Franklin\u2019s insurance carrier, extended an offer to settle Voland\u2019s case for $50,000, which constituted the limit of Franklin\u2019s liability coverage. Voland\u2019s counsel accepted the offer on May 27, 1993, but did not inform Nationwide of that settlement. Thereafter, on June 3, 1993, Voland signed a one-page \u201cRelease.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counsel for both Voland and Franklin also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>executed a Stipulation of Dismissal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In a.letter dated June 3, 1993, Nationwide sent Voland\u2019s counsel a request for a settlement demand. Voland\u2019s attorney responded, on June 15, 1993, with a demand of $25,000. Nationwide then filed its Answer on June 24, 1993. Subsequently, on July 13, 1993, Nationwide\u2019s claims representative offered $5,000 in settlement which Voland\u2019s attorney accepted. Although Nationwide issued a check to Voland that same day, it never sent the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The parties agree that, as of July 13, 1993, Voland\u2019s counsel had not informed Nationwide of Voland\u2019s settlement with Franklin, but he did not make any false statements to Nationwide or otherwise actively conceal facts from the insurer. Further, Nationwide\u2019s claims representative did not inquire as to the status of the underlying tort litigation before reaching an agreement with Voland\u2019s attorney, even though it had known for several months of Voland\u2019s suit against Franklin.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">On July 21, 1993, Nationwide learned of the settlement agreement between Voland and Franklin through Franklin\u2019s attorney. Several weeks later, when Voland inquired as to the status of Nationwide\u2019s settlement check, Nationwide advised that it would not pay the money; in its view, Voland had breached the insurance contract by failing to obtain Nationwide\u2019s consent prior to settling with Franklin. Based on Voland\u2019s execution of the Release, Nationwide also contended that its subrogation rights had been compromised.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ingly, on August 26, 1993, Voland filed a Motion to Enforce Settlement, which was heard by Judge Robert E. Cahill on March 11, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"ADV\">In its opinion of March 21, 1994, the trial court concluded that neither the Release nor the Stipulation of Dismissal vitiated the settlement agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court further noted that the UM/UIM endorsement did not expressly require Voland to advise Nationwide of the status of his suit against Franklin. The court thus framed the issue in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">The question to be decided, therefore, is whether Nationwide had a duty to determine the status of the tort case before it agreed to settle with the plaintiff. If it did, it will be deemed to have waived its right to rely on the language in the exclusion as the basis for revoking its settlement agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The court determined that its decision was controlled by paragraph 8 of the \u201cLimits and Conditions of Payment\u201d section of the policy. It provides: \u201cWe will not pay any underinsured motorists loss until the limits of all bodily injury liability coverage available from any source <em>have been exhausted by payment of settlements </em>or judgments.\u201d (Emphasis added). The court interpreted this language to mean that Nationwide would not be obliged to pay any claims under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>UIM clause until <em>after </em>its insured had exhausted the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance coverage. As applied to this case, the court determined that Voland\u2019s receipt of the policy limits from Franklin\u2019s insurance carrier was a \u201ccondition precedent\u201d to Nationwide\u2019s duty to pay under the UIM clause. Accordingly, the court held that Nationwide either knew that the condition precedent had been satisfied or had waived its right to be told of it. Consequently, the court ordered Nationwide to pay Voland $5,000 plus interest from July 13, 1993.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\n<em>Issues Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Nationwide presents the following issues for our consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">1. \u201cWhen the insurance contract between [Voland] and [Nationwide] clearly requires in its \u2018Trust Agreement\u2019 section that [Voland] do nothing to prejudice [Nationwide\u2019s] rights of recovery against a tortfeasor, was it error for the trial judge to find that the general release and Stipulation of Dismissal signed by [Voland] in conjunction with a settlement with [Franklin] did not breach the insurance contract and therefore did not vitiate [Nationwide\u2019s] later settlement with [Voland]?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">2. \u201cWhen [Nationwide\u2019s] insurance policy contains a coverage exclusion which requires [Nationwide\u2019s] consent to [Voland\u2019s] settlement with any liable party before [Nationwide\u2019s] Underinsured Motorist insurance will apply, and [Nationwide] is unaware of a prior settlement between [Voland] and [Franklin], was it error for the trial judge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>find that if [Nationwide] had a duty to determine the status of the underlying tort case before it agreed to its own settlement with [Voland], that it waived its right to rely upon the language in the exclusion as the basis for revoking its settlement agreement?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">3. \u201cAlthough not conclusively determined in the ruling, was the trial judge in error when he found that [Nationwide\u2019s] Exclusion and Trust Agreement provisions apply only to the uninsured motorist and have no application to payments made in excess of the limit of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Voland frames the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">1. \u201cWas the settlement agreement entered into by both parties binding upon. [Nationwide]?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">2. \u201cDoes [Nationwide\u2019s] \u2018Trust Agreement\u2019 provision in its policy conflict with the purpose of Underinsured Motorist coverage?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">We answer Voland\u2019s first issue in the affirmative and, consequently, we answer Nation-wide\u2019s first issue in the negative. We hold that Nationwide\u2019s settlement agreement was valid and enforceable. With respect to the enforceability of the settlement agreement, we conclude that Voland\u2019s counsel had no affirmative duty to disclose his earlier settlement with Franklin. If Voland\u2019s suit against Nationwide had not settled and, instead, proceeded to trial, Nationwide may have had a meritorious claim or defense, whether based on the insurance policy or otherwise. As the enforceability of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement does not turn on the language of the insurance policy, we decline to answer any of the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">An agreement to settle a lawsuit is a contract and is governed by ordinary contract principles. <em>See Creamer v. Helferstay, </em>294 Md. 107, 448 A.2d 332 (1982). It is undisputed here that the parties had agreed to settle; the terms required Nationwide to pay Voland $5,000 in exchange for Voland\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>agreement to dismiss, with prejudice, his breach of contract claim against Nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">As we have noted, Nationwide argues that, prior to accepting Nationwide\u2019s settlement offer, Voland had an affirmative duty under the insurance policy to disclose that he had settled with Franklin, executed the Release, and filed the Stipulation of Dismissal. Nationwide contends that it would never have offered to settle had it known of the Release<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, due to Voland\u2019s breach of contract, it had no obligation to pay anything under the UM/UIM clauses of the policy. Therefore, Nationwide concludes, Voland\u2019s breach rendered the settlement unenforceable. Nationwide also argues that it had no duty to investigate and apprise itself of the status of the underlying litigation, and that its ignorance of the status of that case\u2014a unilateral mistake of fact\u2014entitles Nationwide to a rescission of the agreement. Nationwide\u2019s arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\"><em>In the absence of a settlement agreement between Voland and Nationwide, </em>Voland\u2019s execution of the Release or the Stipulation, or both, may have constituted a breach of Nationwide\u2019s insurance policy to the extent Voland failed to protect Nationwide\u2019s rights. <em>See Cleaveland v. C &amp; P Telephone Co., </em>225 Md. 47, 51-52, 169 A.2d 446 (1961) (settlement with tortfeasor, without insurer\u2019s consent, prior to payment on claim destroys insurer\u2019s right of subrogation). If so, Voland\u2019s breach would have provided Nationwide with a meritorious defense to Voland\u2019s contract claim. <em>See, e.g., Glenn L. Martin Co. v. Fidelity-Baltimore Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>218 Md. 28, 37, 145 A.2d 267 (1958) (when one party has breached, other party may rely on that breach as defense); <em>see also, Hubler Rentals, Inc. v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>637 F.2d 257, 260 (4th Cir.1981) (in the right circumstances, a court may, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Maryland law, refuse to allow recovery by either party when both have breached).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We need not resolve that thorny issue, however, because Nationwide and Voland <em>did </em>settle. We are unaware of any authority\u2014and Nationwide has not presented any\u2014 that stands for the proposition that, in the absence of fraud, a party\u2019s post-settlement discovery of a meritorious claim or defense, such as a pre-settlement breach, excuses that party\u2019s performance under a settlement agreement. The law is, in fact, to the contrary. <em>See Fiege v. Boehm, </em>210 Md. at 361, 123 A.2d 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The parties do not dispute that the settlement agreement constitutes a facially valid agreement, complete with offer, acceptance, and consideration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When parties settle a case, they give up any meritorious claims or defenses they may have had in order to avoid further litigation. <em>See, e.g., Fiege, </em>210 Md. at 360-63, 123 A.2d 316; <em>Eastern Environmental v. Industrial Park, </em>45 Md.App. 512, 520, 413 A.2d 1355 (1980).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">When a contractual promise is aleatory in character, the performance being expressly made conditional upon an uncertain and hazardous event, the promisee bets that it will happen and the promisor that it will not. The consideration exchanged for such a promise varies in proportion to their opinions as to probability. They consciously assume the risk. If the event occurs, ... [the promisor] is a loser; if it fails to occur, ... it is [the promisee] who is loser. <em>The opinion of one of them as to probability is thus shown to have been erroneous; but his mistake is not ground for rescission, because he consciously assumed the risk. </em>An insurer can not escape payment of the amount promised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>because the insured was most unexpectedly struck by lightning two days after execution of the policy. An insured can not get restitution of his insurance premiums because he has paid them for forty years and has never had a fire.... The same result obtains in any case where the risk of the existence of some factor ... is consciously considered in agreeing upon terms. There is no mistake; instead, there is awareness of the uncertainty, a conscious ignorance of the future. <em>This is why an ordinary compromise of a doubtful or disputed claim is not subject to rescission when one of the parties turns out to have been correct in his assertions and the other incorrect. They were aware of the uncertainty, estimated their chances, and fixed the compensation accordingly.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">3 <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 598, at 584-86 (1960) (footnotes omitted). <em>See also Id., </em>\u00a7 605, at 638-41 (the ultimate value of the object of a contract involves a measure of uncertainty, and all parties to a contract assume the risk as to value; accordingly, a mistake as to value is not grounds for rescission).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">We note that \u201c[t]he law in this State is clear that, absent intentional, culpable conduct, such as fraud, duress or undue influence, a unilateral mistake is ordinarily not a ground for relief from a contract.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Creamer v. Helferstay, </em>294 Md. at 121, 448 A.2d 332 (citing, <em>inter alia, Wood v. Patterson, 4 </em>Md.Ch. 335 (1850), in which this \u201cgeneral rule was applied with respect to a settlement agreement.\u201d); <em>see also, Gatz v. Southwest Bank of Omaha, </em>836 F.2d 1089, 1095 (8th Cir.1988); 13 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 1588, at 566 (1970) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>(\u201cRescission for mistake of law is ... commonly denied where the basis of the bargain was the settlement of a disputed claim.\u201d); 6 <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 1292, at 177-80 (1962) (accord and satisfaction not vitiated by mistake); 17 C.J.S. <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 143, at 888-889 (1963) (\u201cA mistake of only one of the parties to a contract ... as to the subject matter does not affect its binding force, and ordinarily affords no ground for its avoidance.... \u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Although a mistake induced by misrepresentation or fraud may justify rescission, Nationwide does not contend that either Voland or his attorney was deliberately deceptive, actively concealed facts or information, or otherwise made any false statements. Nor is there any indication in the record that either Voland or his attorney was even aware of Nationwide\u2019s interpretation of its Exclusion and Trust Agreement clauses. Under the circumstances here, the insured\u2019s failure to disclose or volunteer information does not constitute misrepresentation or fraud. <em>Cf. Finch v. Hughes Aircraft Co., </em>57 Md.App. 190, 232, 234-40, 469 A.2d 867, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 88, 475 A.2d 1200 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1215, 105 S.Ct. 1190, 84 L.Ed.2d 336 <em>reh. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1049, 105 S.Ct. 2043, 85 L.Ed.2d 341 (1985) (in an action for fraud, patent licensee\u2019s claim that licensor failed to disclose \u201cmaterial\u201d information does not constitute either misrepresentation or fraud, as there was no duty to disclose the information during arms\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>length negotiation). In the absence of fraud or misrepresentation, Nationwide remains bound by its agreement to settle.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Williston states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">It has been said that \u201cthere is no legal obligation on the vendor to inform the purchaser that he is under a mistake, not induced by the act of the vendor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">And it is undoubtedly the general rule ... that it is not necessarily fraudulent for one party to a bargain consciously to take advantage of the ignorance or mistake of the other party, provided no words or acts of the former contribute to the mistake, and there is no duty of disclosure arising from a special or fiduciary relation of the parties based on trust or confidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">12 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 1497, at 377-79 (footnotes omitted). <em>See also, </em>17 C.J.S. <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 155, at 912 (1963); 17A Am.Jur.2d <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 220, at 226 (1994). We see no reason to depart from this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">It is also significant that, before Nationwide offered the $5,000 settlement, nothing prevented Nationwide from checking the court file or from asking either Voland\u2019s attorney, Franklin\u2019s attorney, or Franklin\u2019s insurance carrier about the status of the case between Voland and Franklin. Moreover, Nationwide never sought to condition its settlement on verification of the status of its subrogation rights. Indeed, it did not pose even a single question to Voland\u2019s attorney about the underlying tort litigation, of which Nationwide had actual knowledge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nationwide conceded as much below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">Every party to a contract must put forth some effort to ascertain the nature of the engagement he is confecting; and a party who seeks to avoid the contract ... is under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>duty to make such efforts to discover the [truth] as would amount to ordinary diligence in law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">Where the means of knowledge of the truth ... are at the victim\u2019s hand, he will be presumed to have had such knowledge, and the court will not generally relieve him....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">17 C.J.S. <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 163, at 925-26 (footnotes omitted). <em>See also Finch, </em>57 Md.App. at 238, 469 A.2d 867 (even if licensor were aware of licensee\u2019s ignorance as to a particular \u201cmaterial\u201d fact, nondisclosure is not actionable because fact was a matter of public record and licensee never asked licensor about it).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Considering that, throughout the settlement negotiations, Voland and Nationwide were adversaries in litigation, we cannot say that Voland\u2019s duty to disclose was any greater than Nationwide\u2019s duty to inquire. Nationwide cannot blame Voland for its own failure to inquire, investigate, or avail itself of discovery. Nationwide never made any effort to protect its interests, and has not otherwise demonstrated that its ignorance should justify rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Public policy considerations also support the enforceability of the settlement agreement at issue here. \u201c[C]ourts should \u2018look with favor upon the compromise or settlement of law suits in the interest of efficient and economical administration of justice and the lessening of friction and acrimony.\u2019\u201d <em>Clark v. Elza, </em>286 Md. 208, 219, 406 A.2d 922 (1979) (quoting <em>Chertkof v. Harry C. Weiskittel Co., </em>251 Md. 544, 550, 248 A.2d 373 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 974, 89 S.Ct. 1467, 22 L.Ed.2d 754 (1969)). The policy of encouraging settlement is so important that, even when the parties later discover that the settlement may have been based on a mistake, settlement agreements will not be disturbed. <em>See Chernick v. Chernick, </em>327 Md. 470, 481-83, 610 A.2d 770 (1992) (for policy reasons, a party should not be able to renege on divorce consent judgment, in that the judgment reflects an agreement reached between the parties); <em>Fiege v.

The court also noted that, if it had to decide the merits of Nationwide\u2019s breach of contract claim, it would conclude that Voland had not breached the \"Exclusion\u201d and \"Trust Agreement\" clauses of the insurance policy by failing to notify Nationwide of the settlement. The court distinguished the purposes of the UM and UIM clauses of the policy, and concluded that the Exclusion and Trust Agreement clauses logically apply only to <em>uninsured </em>motorist coverage. The court said that the Exclusion and Trust Agreement provisions do not apply to payments made in excess of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage. Accordingly, the court decided that Voland would have had no duly to protect Nationwide\u2019s subrogation rights under these two clauses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\">.

In its brief, Nationwide states that the parties \u201cdiscussed\u201d a settlement on July 13, 1993. We note that Nationwide does not raise as an issue whether as a matter of fact the parties ever reached an actual agreement to settle. To the contrary, Nationwide\u2019s argument before the triad court, as well as its statement of issues in its brief, accepts that the parties reached a settlement agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\">.
