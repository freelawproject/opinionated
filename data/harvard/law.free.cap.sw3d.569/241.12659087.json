On the State's motion, the juvenile court concluded that, because of the seriousness of Bell's offense, the welfare of the community required criminal proceedings. The juvenile court waived its jurisdiction and transferred the case to criminal district court, where Bell pleaded guilty without an agreed recommendation. The criminal district court deferred a finding of guilt and placed him on community supervision for six years. The State later moved to adjudicate, alleging that Bell had violated the terms of his supervision. Following a hearing, the district court granted the motion, found Bell guilty, and sentenced him to 20 years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, Bell contended that, under\n   <em>\n    Moon v.

Our Court agreed that the juvenile court did not provide sufficient case-specific findings, vacated the district court's judgment, dismissed the criminal case, and remanded to the juvenile court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State filed a petition with the Court of Criminal Appeals, arguing for the first time that this Court lacked jurisdiction to hear Bell's complaint because he did not contest the juvenile transfer when the trial court entered its order of deferred adjudication.

At the hearing on the State's motion, the juvenile court admitted three exhibits: proof that Bell had been served, a stipulation of Bell's birth date, and a probation report. The juvenile court also heard testimony from three witnesses, including Deputy A. Alanis of the Harris County Sheriff's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the hearing, the juvenile court waived jurisdiction and transferred the case to the criminal district court. The juvenile court concluded that, because of the seriousness of Bell's offense, the welfare of the community required criminal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Proceedings in the criminal district court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the criminal district court, Bell pleaded guilty without an agreed recommendation.

The State later moved\n   to adjudicate, alleging that Bell had violated the terms of his supervision. In May 2015, the district court granted the motion, found Bell guilty of aggravated robbery, and sentenced Bell to 20 years' imprisonment.

PROC. art. 44.47\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Article 44.47 is straightforward. It applies to an appeal of a transfer from juvenile court. And it provides that a defendant may, as here, appeal a transfer from juvenile court \"in conjunction with the appeal of a conviction ... or an order of deferred adjudication ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%201221\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The statute uses the disjunctive \"or.\" Its plain meaning, therefore, is that a defendant transferred to adult court may appeal the transfer when appealing either a conviction\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   an order of deferred adjudication. Because Bell appealed the transfer when appealing his conviction, we have jurisdiction over the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The State challenges our jurisdiction, contending that Bell should have attacked the transfer order in an appeal from his 2013 order of deferred adjudication. According to the State, because Bell did not do so-and instead waited to attack the transfer order on appeal from his conviction-he waived his right to challenge the transfer order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The statute does not support the State's argument. The statute simply states that a defendant may challenge a juvenile transfer on appeal from a conviction or an order of deferred adjudication. It does not require a defendant to challenge the transfer at the first opportunity-on the earlier of a conviction or deferred adjudication. Nor does the statute otherwise limit one's ability to challenge a transfer order on appeal from a conviction. It provides, without limitation, two options for when one can challenge a juvenile transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The State points us to\n   <em>\n    Eyhorn v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7124965\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/378/507/\">\n    378 S.W.3d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. App.-Amarillo 2012, no pet.), where the Amarillo Court of Appeals concluded that the defendant waived his right to challenge the juvenile transfer by not appealing his order of deferred adjudication and instead challenging the juvenile transfer later, on appeal from his conviction. That case is not binding on us, and we are unpersuaded by its reasoning. There, the court noted the general rule in criminal cases that non-jurisdictional complaints that arise before an order of deferred adjudication must be raised on appeal of that order or are waived.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7124965\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/378/507/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7124965\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/378/507/\">\n    at 509-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Eyhorn\n   </em>\n   court then stated, \"We see no logical reason why art. 44.47(b) should be read as jettisoning that rule simply because the accused was initially subject to being tried as a juvenile.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7124965\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/378/507/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7124965\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/378/507/\">\n    at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We respectfully disagree in light of the statutory text. Article 44.47 gives a defendant the right to challenge his transfer on appeal of a conviction \"or\" an order of deferred adjudication. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 44.47(b). The statute could have limited the ability to appeal in conformance with this background principle. But the Legislature did not do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the same reasons, we reject the State's contention that this case is governed by\n   <em>\n    Manuel v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11665708\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/994/658/#p661\">\n    994 S.W.2d 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 661-62 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).\n   <em>\n    Manuel\n   </em>\n   established the background rule (not specific to juvenile transfers) concerning appeals of deferred adjudications, stating: \"a defendant placed on deferred adjudication community supervision may raise issues relating to the original plea proceeding, such as evidentiary sufficiency, only in appeals taken when deferred adjudication community supervision is first imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11665708\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/994/658/#p661\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is the background rule on which\n   <em>\n    Eyhorn\n   </em>\n   relied. And this background rule would apply in the absence of a statute providing to the contrary. But here, article 44.47-entitled \"Appeal of transfer from juvenile court\"-expressly and specifically addresses when one can appeal a transfer to criminal court from juvenile court, and it says the defendant can appeal the transfer with either his conviction\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   deferred adjudication. The statute's terms are clear and make no exception for this background rule. To read the statute to comport with the background rule (and to thus require a defendant to appeal upon deferred adjudication, not conviction) would require us to rewrite this specifically-applicable statute. We can do no such thing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vandyke v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655524\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/538/561/#p569\">\n    538 S.W.3d 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We also disagree with the argument that this case is governed by article 4.18 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\"Claim of underage\"), which imposes a procedural requirement that was not met in this case. By its own terms, article 4.18 expressly excludes from its application \"a claim of a defect or error in a discretionary transfer proceeding in juvenile court.\" TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 4.18(g) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ROBERT O. DAWSON, TEXAS JUVENILE LAW , 534 (Nydia D. Thomas et al. eds., 8th ed. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Moreover, when article 4.18 does apply (when one is not alleging a defect or error in a discretionary transfer proceeding), its application is limited. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A claim that a district court or criminal district court does not have jurisdiction over a person because jurisdiction is exclusively in the juvenile court\n   <strong>\n    and that the juvenile court could not waive jurisdiction under Section 8.07(a), Penal Code, or did not waive jurisdiction under Section 8.07(b), Penal Code\n   </strong>\n   , must be made by written motion in bar of prosecution filed with the court in which criminal charges against the person are filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 4.18(a) (emphasis added). In simple terms, article 4.18 applies in only two scenarios: (1) when a party asserts that the district court lacks jurisdiction because the juvenile court could not waive jurisdiction because the defendant was under 15 (and the case did not involve certain offenses not at issue here) (8.07(a) ), or (2) when the party asserts that the district court lacks jurisdiction because the juvenile court did not waive jurisdiction and the person is under 17 (8.07(b) ). TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 8.07(a), (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case presents neither of those scenarios.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Bell makes no argument that the district court lacks jurisdiction because the juvenile court could not waive jurisdiction under Penal Code section 8.07(a). And he makes no argument that the juvenile court did not waive jurisdiction under Penal Code section 8.07(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 4.18(a). Indeed, Bell does not argue that he was under 15 and thus could not be tried as an adult or that he was under 17 and no juvenile court waived jurisdiction over him\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the challenges\n   contemplated by the plain terms of article 4.18.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655524\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/538/561/#p569\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To the contrary, Bell is arguing that the juvenile court waived jurisdiction but abused its discretion by doing so and transferring the case to district court without making adequate case-specific findings in the transfer order. On these facts, article 4.18's plain terms render it inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   4.18(a), (g);\n   <em>\n    Delacerda v.
