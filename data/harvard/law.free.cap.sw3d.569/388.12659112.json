The Mortons maintain the trial court failed to apply the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   \"best interest of the child\" factors and further failed to make the grandparent visitation determination based upon clear and convincing evidence, the standard enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Walker.\n   </em>\n   Although the trial court did not cite\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Blair,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7128108\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/382/862/#p871\">\n    382 S.W.3d 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871 (Ky. 2012), we conclude the findings of fact reflect proper consideration and application of the best interest factors. As for the standard of proof, the trial court properly applied the preponderance of the evidence standard because the higher clear and convincing evidence standard only applies in the event of a grandparent visitation dispute involving a custodial parent. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL\n     <footnotemark>\n      1\n     </footnotemark>\n     AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Bruce Tipton (Tipton) is the paternal grandfather of the minor children CT, born March 8, 2007, and KT, born July 31, 2009. Following their births, they and their parents, Brian Tipton and Roxanna Swartz, resided with Tipton for a period of time. When not residing with Tipton, the four visited Tipton almost every day until CT and KT were approximately two (2) years and nine (9) months and five (5) months of age, respectively. Both Brian and Roxanna have histories of drug abuse, and they engaged in domestic violence in the presence of their children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January 2010, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (the Cabinet) filed petitions alleging that CT and KT were neglected by both parents because of the parents' drug abuse and that the family was not stable because they were dependent upon others to provide them housing. CT and KT were placed with David and Darlene Morton, maternal grandfather and\n   step-grandmother. In March 2011, the Mortons were granted permanent custody of CT and KT and, by the same order, the Powell Circuit Family Court included a provision for Tipton to have supervised visitation with CT and KT at the Mortons' discretion. At the time of this decision, as later found by the Montgomery Circuit Court, the Powell Circuit Family Court had held multiple hearings with the parties, had received reports and Tipton's home evaluation from the Cabinet,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was in the best position to evaluate whether it was in CT and KT's best interest to have visitation with Tipton. In June 2012, because the Mortons moved their residence, the case was transferred to Montgomery District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From April 2010 and later pursuant to the March 2011 order, Tipton visited with CT and KT for one (1) hour per week, either with or without the children's father, Brian. The visits took place in Montgomery County at a restaurant, a park, or the Mortons' home. At some point, Tipton asked the Mortons for increased visitation, which they denied. In October 2012, Tipton filed this action in Montgomery Circuit Court, specifically petitioning for \"grandparent timesharing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Mortons requested that a specific timesharing schedule be denied and, as part of their objection, noted that Tipton's showing the young girls a dead pig carcass had disturbed them. Tipton testified that the pig, shown at the girls' request was not bloody, having been slaughtered for food a couple of days before. Darlene described the incident as causing great trauma to the children, who became fearful of Tipton from that point forward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While the Cabinet conducted an evaluation of Tipton's home, the Montgomery Circuit Court ordered that Tipton have continued visitation with the children, setting a schedule for one (1) hour biweekly. The Cabinet's evaluation concluded that Tipton appears to love CT and KT; he has maintained ongoing contact and would like more contact with them; and he has the support of his church family, friends, and family. The Cabinet's concerns stemmed from some safety issues in the home, past reports of Tipton's spanking a significant other's minor child in 1989, and Brian's presence in the home given his significant criminal history. Following evaluation, the Cabinet did not recommend custodial placement with Tipton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the Mortons again objected to Tipton's request for increased visitation, they stated that Tipton's visitation with CT and KT had become an emotional strain. The trial court nevertheless granted Tipton weekly visits with the children, but, at the Mortons' request, appointed a GAL. Upon completing her investigation, the GAL did not recommend unsupervised visitation with Tipton at that time primarily due to CT and KT's uneasiness with him. The GAL recommended that until the children became more comfortable with Tipton, visitation be less frequent and in the least distracting environment for the children. Based upon the GAL's recommendation, the court ordered that CT and KT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   attend counseling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tipton maintained telephone communication and over the course of time he attended individual sessions with the children's therapist and discussed ways to appropriately communicate with children the ages of CT and KT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In October 2014, with the children showing a lack of progress after fourteen months of therapy, the trial court ordered the children to be assessed by a therapist specializing in trauma. In November 2014, while in a session with her usual counselor, CT, age 7, disclosed that when she was around age 4, Tipton touched her while helping her wipe after going to the bathroom and that the touch felt inappropriate. The counselor reported this to the Cabinet and Darlene Morton filed an emergency protective order on behalf of CT and KT. The trauma therapist's report was received in December; CT discussed various things which made her feel anxious or sad, but there was no mention of the alleged touching by Tipton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At Tipton's request due to the pending investigation of CT's allegations of inappropriate touching, the trial court suspended Tipton's contact with the children in a January 2015 order. In July, after the Kentucky State Police had completed its investigation into this alleged criminal act and indicated no charges would be filed, Tipton asked for reinstatement of his timesharing with CT and KT. This motion led to a final hearing in November 2015 at which Tipton; Kristy Smith, Tipton's daughter who has twins near the age of CT; and Scott Rogers, Tipton's pastor, testified on his behalf. Darlene Morton; Michelle Felty, the social worker for the Cabinet; and Amy Smith, CT and KT's counselor, testified on the Mortons' behalf. Amy Smith testified that she recommended that CT have no contact with Tipton. Felty's and the trauma therapist's reports were admitted into evidence, along with Tipton's photo of his other granddaughters swinging on his front porch. The trial court took the matter under advisement but additionally ordered that family visits take place in Kristy Smith's home with Kristy, her two daughters, CT and KT, and Darlene Morton present, the intention being to help CT and KT feel comfortable around the paternal side of the family in anticipation of Tipton being incorporated into future family visits, if appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In February 2016, the EPO against Tipton was dismissed. The trial court found that there was no evidence that the alleged inappropriate touching was anything beyond that which occurred incidentally while Tipton helped wipe CT after she used the bathroom and was not done for sexual gratification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In June 2016, observing that the family visits at his daughter's home had reportedly gone well, Tipton requested that his visitation with CT and KT be reinstated and that he be incorporated into the family visits. The Mortons opposed the motion. In July, the trial court granted Tipton visits at his daughter's home with the established family group. Afterward, the Mortons renewed a motion for a final order, stating the visits had not gone well. The trial court scheduled hearings in October and December to hear from others present at the visits. Kristy Smith, the children's aunt, testified that the two visits had gone well. Shirley Bowen, Darlene's sister, testified that the visit \"did not go badly.\" No one testified or otherwise reported that either CT or KT was traumatized by these\n   visits, acted out before or following these visits, or needed to return to counseling as a result of the visits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 7, 2017, the trial court entered its final order consisting of approximately 30 pages of detailed findings of fact, ultimately concluding it is in the best interest of the children to be allowed to continue a relationship with Tipton through occasional supervised visitation. The trial court concluded that in this case, grandparent visitation rights do not interfere with the constitutional rights of the biological parents given that the parents do not have custody, do not have a set visitation schedule, and, indeed, their whereabouts are unknown. Tipton's visitation was limited to three (3) times per year and included the following restrictions: the visits are to occur at Kristy Smith's home, under her supervision, with her two daughters present; and Darlene Morton is to be present until CT feels comfortable enough for her to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, the Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court properly applied the preponderance of the evidence standard and appropriately considered the relevant\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   factors. With those conclusions, the appellate court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting Tipton the very limited visitation with CT and KT as outlined. This Court granted discretionary review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Mortons insist that the circuit court erred by not applying the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   best interest factors and by not requiring Tipton to prove by clear and convincing evidence that visitation with him was in his grandchildren's best interests. Tipton counters that the circuit court actually considered the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   factors and that preponderance of the evidence is the appropriate standard of proof when a circuit court addresses a grandparent's request for visitation with a child not in the custody of his or her parents. Alternatively, Tipton insists that even if the higher clear and convincing evidence standard were applicable, the court in this case did not abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Massie v.

Domestic Relations, Chapter 405. Parent and Child, and entitled\n   <strong>\n    \"Reasonable visitation rights to grandparents.\"\n   </strong>\n   KRS 405.021(1)(a) currently provides: \"The Circuit Court may grant reasonable visitation rights to either the paternal or maternal grandparents of a child and issue any necessary orders to enforce the decree if it determines that it is in the best interest of the child to do so.\" When the statute was originally adopted in 1976, it only applied if a child's parent was deceased. In 1984 the General Assembly extended the right of grandparents to petition for visitation to cases where the parent or parents of the child are not deceased.\n   <em>\n    Cole v.

Although KRS 405.021(1)(a) is premised upon a custodial parent being present and responsible for the care and upbringing of the child, it is not uncommon today for a child to be cared for by someone other than a custodial parent. Thus, grandparents are often seeking visitation from non-parent custodians and caretakers, including, as in this case, the child's other grandparents.

Prior to the United States Supreme Court's discussion of a parent's superior, constitutional rights in\n   <em>\n    Troxel,\n   </em>\n   Kentucky trial courts employed the preponderance of the evidence standard when performing a KRS 405.021 best interest analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7128108\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/382/862/#p871\">\n    382 S.W.3d at 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Tipton counters that the parents' liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their children does not extend to non-parent custodians and consequently, no presumption exists under the Due Process Clause that the non-parent custodian is acting in the best interest of a minor child when denying a grandparent visitation.

The liberty interest at issue in\n   <em>\n    Walker,\n   </em>\n   the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children - which commands a heightened burden of proof - is simply not present when non-parents are granted custody by the State. Stated differently, the superior rights of a parent are not bestowed on a non-parent custodian, regardless of the custodian's relationship to the child or the length of their custodial relationship. Consequently, the presumption that a fit parent would make decisions in the child's best interest does not transfer to the non-parent and is not part of the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although fit parents and grandparents seeking visitation with a grandchild are not constitutionally on equal footing and a heightened burden of proof is required to be met for a trial court to grant the disputed visitation, the same is not true of grandparent visitation disputes involving a non-parent custodian. As the Commonwealth has an interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the children, our legislature has recognized with its acts that children should have the opportunity to benefit from relationships with their\n   grandparents. The opportunity to benefit from that relationship may indeed be greater when circumstances are such that the parents no longer have custody of the children. Without a fundamental constitutional right at issue, we find no authority for imposing the clear and convincing standard on the best interest of the child analysis. Unless the legislature provides otherwise, the non-parent custodian and a grandparent are on equal footing under KRS 405.021(1)(a) and the preponderance of the evidence standard for determining whether grandparent visitation is in the child's best interest is fundamentally fair and proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Although the trial court in this case did not explicitly identify the standard of proof it employed, it did state as an initial conclusion of law that \"[g]randparent visitation rights do not interfere with the constitutional right of the biological parents in this case, given that the parents' whereabouts are unknown, the parents do not have custody and the parents do not have a set visitation schedule.\" This statement and the remainder of the order strongly suggest that the trial court correctly employed the typical preponderance of the evidence standard. The Court of Appeals also identified that standard as the appropriate standard in cases such as this and, for the reasons stated, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Before advancing to the next issue, we note that since the inception of this action, the 2018 General Assembly passed House Bill 517, an act relating to grandparent visitation, which amended KRS 405.021 and KRS 620.090. The act's preface acknowledges the amendments are needed due to the crucial role many grandparents play in their grandchildren's healthy development, especially when the parents abuse drugs and the children no longer live with their parents. Its preface states\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   \"studies have shown that relationships between adolescents and grandparents contribute to the adolescents' well-being\"; \"studies have also shown that grandparents are instrumental in times of family adversity and help the whole family to survive a crisis\"; \"emotionally close ties between grandparents and grandchildren provide a wide variety of benefits to both grandparent and grandchild\"; \"the opioid epidemic and rise in drug abuse has led to an increase in the number of families that are pulled apart\"; \"over 70,000 children in Kentucky ... are no longer living with their parents, including over 8,000 children in foster care and over 30,000 homeless children\"; \"the presence of healthy, supportive grandparents has been shown to be a factor in distinguishing well-functioning children of drug abusers\"; and \"there is a rapidly increasing number of grandparents who serve as the primary caregivers for children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As mentioned above, under KRS 620.090 which deals with temporary custody orders, a new subsection (6) was created which states: \"If custody is granted to a grandparent of the child pursuant to this section, the court shall consider granting reasonable visitation rights to any other grandparent of the child if the court determines the grandparent has a significant and viable relationship with the child as established in KRS 405.021(1)(c).\" Newly created KRS 405.021(1)(c) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   In order to prove a significant and viable relationship under paragraph (b) of this subsection,\n   <em>\n    the grandparent shall prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n   </em>\n   that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   1. The child resided with the grandparent for at least six (6) consecutive months with or without the current custodian present;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   2. The grandparent was the caregiver of the child on a regular basis for at least six (6) consecutive months;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   3. The grandparent had frequent or regular contact with the child for at least twelve (12) consecutive months; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   4. There exist any other facts that establish that the loss of the relationship between the grandparent and the child is likely to harm the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (Emphasis added.) KRS 620.090(6) is noteworthy for its impact on future grandparent visitation cases involving temporary custody orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To reiterate, going forward, trial courts must use the preponderance of the evidence standard when considering grandparent visitation if someone other than a parent, including another grandparent, is the grandchild's custodian. We turn now to whether the trial court properly considered the factors relevant to determining whether grandparent visitation is in a child's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The trial court properly considered the\n    <em>\n     Walker\n    </em>\n    factors and did not abuse its discretion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As noted earlier, the facts of each case will determine the factors to be considered when determining whether grandparent visitation is in the child's best interest. Although the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   factors were developed in the context of a parent-grandparent visitation dispute, the factors are readily amenable to disputes not involving a parent - the references to \"parents\" are simply replaced with \"non-parent custodian\" or other fitting reference. The factors, while not necessarily identifying all circumstances to be considered, reflect a holistic approach to the assessment when determining the best interest of the child. Upon review of the trial court's approximately 30 pages of findings of fact, which included a review of the case from its inception, we conclude that the trial court considered the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   factors, albeit without reference to the case itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court of Appeals identified various findings of fact which reflected the trial court's careful consideration of the visitation factors, even though\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   was not cited. For example, the trial court found Tipton was involved with the children since birth and that the relationship had been interrupted due to Brian and Roxanna's substance abuse problems and Darlene's subsequent animosity toward Tipton. The trial court found it was in the children's best interest to have contact not only with Tipton but also with the paternal side of the family through occasional contact with Tipton provided it was in a manner that would not disrupt the children's daily lives. Although some evidence supported that the children are reluctant to visit with Tipton, the trial court attributed that reluctance to Darlene's negative attitude toward Tipton and the pending court proceedings. As to the allegations that Tipton sexually abused CT, the trial court found no improper touching occurred with Tipton's helping CT to wipe after using the bathroom. In his brief to this Court, Tipton likewise demonstrated that the trial court considered the evidence in light of all relevant factors by pairing the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   factors and the trial court's findings which supported a decision in his favor. We agree that despite not citing\n   <em>\n    Walker,\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </em>\n   the trial court's order sufficiently addressed relevant factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Mortons acknowledge that the Court of Appeals analyzed the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   factors but argue that the Court of Appeals erred by failing to consider fully the evidence introduced at the final hearing. By listing the factors and evidence viewed as disfavoring the award of visitation under those factors, such as the social worker and therapist's recommendation against visitation or for limited visitation with Tipton, the Mortons seek to persuade us of the trial court's error. Indeed, the conflicting evidence in this case would have allowed another decision maker to reach a different conclusion. However, if the trial court's findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, we assess whether the trial court's decision was arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair, or unsupported by sound legal principles.\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

We find no clear error in the factual findings and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting Tipton limited visitation three times per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We note that this case was initiated in Montgomery Circuit Court in October 2012. As concerns for the children evolved, so did the trial court's attempts to find solutions which were in the best interest of the children. After conducting the final hearing and finding it to be in CT and KT's best interest to visit with Tipton, the trial court found yet another safeguarded avenue for CT and KT to have an opportunity to benefit from a relationship with their paternal grandfather and other paternal family members. The trial court structured restricted visitation at Tipton's daughter's home three times a year. Although this is far from the visitation requested by Tipton, the schedule will keep Tipton and his granddaughters from being complete strangers and will allow CT and KT to decide when they are older how their relationships with the paternal side of their family will develop. The Court of Appeals properly concluded that the trial court's findings were not clearly erroneous and that court did not abuse its discretion in this difficult case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In summary, Tipton petitioned to modify the court-ordered grandparent visitation by asking for an established visitation schedule. Over the course of time, the Mortons came to reject any visitation between Tipton and the grandchildren. The trial court finally granted visitation three times per year with restrictions. We conclude the trial court properly used the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof when assessing whether Tipton's grandparent visitation was in the best interest of the children and did not abuse its discretion when granting the restricted visitation. The Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Minton, C.J.; Keller, Lambert, VanMeter and Wright, JJ., sitting.

However, six months after the final hearing (two months after\n    <em>\n     Massie\n    </em>\n    was issued), the Mortons cited KRS 405.021 in a motion for a final and appealable order.
