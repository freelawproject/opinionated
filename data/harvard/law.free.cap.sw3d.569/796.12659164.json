After their 2012 divorce, a court entered an agreed order that the parents would be C.V.'s joint managing conservators and that Monica would have the exclusive right to determine C.V.'s domicile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Erik initiated this suit and sought to modify the conservatorship order to grant him the exclusive right to determine C.V.'s domicile. After a bench trial, the trial court granted Erik's requested modification. In four issues, Monica challenges the trial court's actions. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Erik and Monica divorced in 2012, and the court entered an agreed custody order providing that C.V.-then almost six years old-would live with Monica and that Erik would exercise standard visitation rights. The order also named both parents as joint managing conservators. It gave Monica the exclusive rights to determine C.V.'s domicile and to direct C.V.'s education and gave both parents the shared right to jointly direct C.V.'s medical and psychiatric care. Monica and either Erik or his relatives would meet at a designated place to transfer C.V. for visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Things changed around 2015, when, according to trial testimony, Monica began refusing to transfer C.V. at the designated place unless a police officer was present. Erik then initiated this suit to change the visitation-transfer location to a local police department, in accordance with Monica's wish to have a police officer present. Monica counter-petitioned to have Erik's future visitation periods supervised and to be named as sole managing conservator. Erik later amended his petition to seek the exclusive right to determine C.V.'s domicile. Both parents alleged that a material and substantial change in their and C.V.'s circumstances supported a modification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. FAM. CODE \u00a7 156.101(a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By Rule 11 agreement, which was later entered as the court's temporary order, Erik and Monica agreed to the appointment of a licensed psychologist, Dr. Marie Alvarez, to evaluate C.V. and the living situation at each parent's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties tried the case without a jury. Though the suit was pending before the 300th District Court of Brazoria County, Hon. Randall Hufstetler presiding, the elected judge of the Brazoria County County Court at Law No. 3, Hon. Jeremy Warren, presided over the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, Erik called several witnesses in support of his requested modification. He testified first, explaining that he has remarried and has lived with his new wife and her biological sons for about two years. His parents live in a different home on the same property. His parents help care for C.V. during visitation periods, and C.V. gets along with the other children. Erik's wife takes C.V. to school from time to time too, and the family takes trips and goes fishing together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Erik testified that until recently his visitation with C.V. generally went well. He helps C.V. with his homework, and he tries to learn about C.V.'s grades. He eats lunch with C.V. at school on occasion. And he enjoys fishing with C.V., watching C.V. play basketball at the YMCA, and going to the movies with C.V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Erik testified that Monica's and her mother's conduct in 2015 and 2016 changed things. According to Erik, he stopped the school lunch visits because Monica's mother would also show up and chill C.V.'s interaction with him. Monica requested that Erik undergo drug and alcohol testing, and all tests were negative. Though the most recent summer visitation went well, CPS investigated Erik anyway, apparently at Monica's request. He also testified that Monica has been trying to turn C.V. against him-trying to \"brainwash\" him-and he feared that her efforts would continue absent a custody modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Erik admitted, though, that there had been limits to his past involvement. He had not attended any meetings with school personnel to address C.V.'s academic performance\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or any of C.V.'s appointments with medical and psychiatric caregivers. He does not know whether C.V. needs to take any medication, though he has noted that no medication comes with C.V. during scheduled visitations, and C.V. has only taken Tylenol during his visits. Erik has not read C.V.'s school or therapy records, though he could have. He also admitted his 2005 and 2006 convictions for family violence against Monica. Finally, he admitted that Monica is not a bad mother, she would never intentionally harm C.V., and his only concern about C.V. continuing to live with Monica is her attempt to undermine Erik's relationship with C.V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Erik's mother, Pauline Moeller, also testified. She picks up C.V. frequently at the visitation exchanges, and C.V. often stays with her on Friday evenings while Erik is still working, before spending the rest of the weekend with Erik and his family. According to Pauline, no medication is sent with C.V. for his visitations. Pauline takes C.V. out to eat, goes to movies with him, and lets him ride a four-wheeler on their property. C.V. seems happy spending time with both her and Erik. C.V. now gets along with Erik's wife's children, though Pauline acknowledged some early tension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Pauline, C.V. once told her of an incident when he saw his mother strip naked while drinking alcohol and smoking. Pauline also described how Erik used to drink alcohol in front of C.V. and how C.V. told her that people drinking in front of him scared him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Alvarez, a licensed psychologist, testified that she performed a psychological and custody evaluation of C.V. and his extended families. She conducted several lengthy interviews with C.V., Monica, and Erik, sometimes including C.V. in meetings with one or the other parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Alvarez noted what she called \"a lot of inconsistencies in [Monica's] recollection and facts and data that she offers depending on who she is talking to.\" Monica accused Erik of \"being a violent and aggressive individual,\" and while there were two convictions for family violence in 2005 and 2006, Monica's post-divorce accusations appeared to Dr. Alvarez to be riddled with inconsistencies. Many of Monica's responses were untruthful or, in Dr. Alvarez's professional opinion, intended to deny or mask \"problems, pathology, and personality difficulties.\" Monica's accounts of events often shifted. Dr. Alvarez also thought that Monica underreported personality factors and associated pathology. Dr. Alvarez concluded that Monica likely \"has a lot of self-esteem and a lot of low confidence issues\" and suffers from some psychopathologies, including frequent untruthfulness; agenda-driven interactions with others; \"under-report[ing of] the common faults that the vast majority of the\n   adult population readily admits having\"; moderate anxiety; somatization; possible depression; \"attention-seeking and dramatic\" behaviors; and narcissism. In contrast, according to Dr. Alvarez, Erik \"does not have any significant psychological disorders.\" He demonstrated low levels of \"some personality traits of narcissism\" and \"some personality traits of some obsessive compulsive behaviors,\" but \"nothing reached clinical level,\" which \"was confirmed by all of the evaluation results.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. Alvarez stated that she had confidence in Erik's truthfulness and found that he had no significant psychological disorders, with parenting scores within the normal range. Erik had expressed concern to her over Monica's alcohol and substance abuse and Monica's attempts to sabotage his relationship with C.V. Dr. Alvarez corroborated Erik's concern, concluding that many of C.V.'s statements about his father's \"drinking or being mean\" or alleged abuse \"came directly from\" Monica. In Dr. Alvarez's view, Monica was attempting \"to influence or alienate [C.V.] from his father by talking to him in ways that will affect\" the parent-child relationship. Specifically, Dr. Alvarez opined that Monica's push to have a police officer present at visitation exchanges \"is a form of parental alienation.\" According to Dr. Alvarez, children need healthy relationships with both their parents and alienation attempts can qualify as abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dr. Alvarez noted positives about C.V.'s home life with Erik. Erik's mother and her husband are involved in C.V.'s life. C.V. behaves better when with his father. C.V.'s relationship with his father has improved over time, and C.V.'s emotional connections to his father and his mother are now equal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Dr. Alvarez recommended to the court that Erik be given the exclusive right to determine C.V.'s domicile and to direct C.V.'s medical and psychological care, with joint managing conservatorship and standard possession for Monica. The amicus attorney for C.V. joined Dr. Alvarez's recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Erik's wife, Shannon Vasquez, and his stepfather, Thomas Moeller, also testified in support of Erik's position, noting how happy C.V. is with Erik and his family and how Erik's family has maintained their relationship with C.V. Shannon indicated her willingness to co-parent C.V. with Monica and to participate in counseling to that end.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Monica testified too. She sees many problems with Erik's parenting and visitation periods. For a time, C.V. returned from visitation periods anxious, sad, angry, or aggressive and, according to Monica, even had panic attacks. Monica also expressed concern that C.V. once was bitten by a dog when playing outside near Erik's stepfather's property, but no one notified her or sent her medical records of C.V.'s treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Monica testified that she has taken care of virtually all C.V.'s school, medical, and psychiatric needs over the years. She has helped C.V. as he has improved his school grades and attendance, participating in many meetings with C.V.'s school counselors while Erik has not. C.V. has received therapy also because he saw Erik physically assault Monica in the past. Monica also takes C.V. to a therapist for PTSD, anxiety, ADHD, skill-building, and learning difficulties. Monica explained that C.V. will lose access to these services if he moves from Fort Bend County, where she lives, to Brazoria County, where Erik lives. Monica testified that she has completed three parenting classes in connection with this suit and has used what she learned in parenting C.V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Monica explained that she began requiring a police presence at visitation transfers because some of Erik's family would be \"aggressive\" toward her at the exchange or at her job. And though she requested that Erik be tested for drugs and alcohol during his visitation periods, Monica acknowledged that the tests were negative and that she is no longer concerned about C.V.'s safety with Erik. Notwithstanding C.V.'s past concerns about Erik's wife and the other children, C.V. more recently has expressed contentment to Monica about staying with his father. Monica admitted that C.V. loves and gets along well with Erik and his family. She also admitted to surreptitiously recording C.V.'s phone calls with his father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Monica's mother also testified, and she acknowledged that C.V. loves Erik, that C.V. increasingly looks forward to seeing Erik, and that C.V. comes back to Monica a happy child after visits with Erik.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the end of the trial, Judge Warren orally pronounced \"the Court's ruling\" in open court. He granted Erik's first amended petition and his requested modification, allowing Erik to determine C.V.'s primary residence within Brazoria County or contiguous counties but granted no other exclusive rights because he wanted Monica and Erik \"to get along and work with [C.V.] for his best interest.\" He appointed both Monica and Erik as joint managing conservators. He granted Monica a standard possession order or the alternative times, if elected, under Family Code section 153.317. He terminated Erik's child-support-payment obligation and ordered Monica to pay $230 per month in child support and $61 per month in medical reimbursement, as recommended by counsel for the Attorney General. He ordered visitation pick-ups and drop-offs during the school year to take place at the school and other pick-ups and drop-offs to take place at a gas station that is equidistant from Monica's and Erik's homes. He ordered Monica to pay attorney's fees and the amicus attorney's fees. And he found that all these orders were in C.V.'s best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   He then asked the parties whether he had forgotten anything. Monica's counsel responded, \"No, your Honor,\" and the other attorneys present answered similarly. Judge Warren concluded by describing his rulings as \"an order that I have rendered today, and it is effective now, 2:05 p.m., February 8th, 2017,\" and setting an entry date for the judgment, telling Erik's counsel to \"give it to me whenever you can give it to me to sign, but it's effective today.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A minute entry was made on the docket for February 8, 2017, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Continue trial.... All counsel and parties present. Further evidence presented. Ruling: parents JMC, father with right to designate residence in Brazoria or contiguous counties, mother gets SPO, pay CS $230 month begin 03/01/17, pay $61 medical support; all rights and duties under the Family Code; standard mutual injunctions. Father's CS obligation terminates 02/28/17. Mother ordered to pay $15,173.78 in atty fees and $1,387 to Amicus. Entry set 03/10/17. JW\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On March 13, 2017, the final order adjudicating Monica's and Erik's competing claims was entered and was signed by Judge Hufstetler. The substance of the order conformed to Judge Warren's in-court pronouncements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On appeal, Monica challenges the modifications awarding Erik the exclusive right to determine C.V.'s primary residence and granting her only standard possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction Relating to Sharing of Judicial Duties in Same District Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Appellate courts have an obligation to consider their jurisdiction even if not\n   raised by the parties.\n   <em>\n    Malone v.

The case proceeded to a bench trial before Judge Martinez, a visiting judge, who took the case under advisement without rendering judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10014244\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/783/783/#p785\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Later, an unsigned docket entry was made, stating, \"Judgment for Plaintiff rendered this day.

C.V.'s desires\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   C.V. did not testify, and no witness testified that C.V. has expressed a custody preference. Several witnesses offered testimony that supports a determination that C.V., at a minimum, has no objection to his father having custody. Erik, Pauline, and Shannon described how C.V. gets along well with his extended paternal family. Monica agreed that the paternal familial relationships were good. Monica's mother, too, admitted that C.V. loves Erik, that C.V. increasingly looks forward to seeing Erik, and that C.V. comes back to Monica a happy child after visits with Erik. C.V. enjoys activities with his father, including playing outside, fishing, and going to movies. Notwithstanding Monica's stated concerns about C.V. living with Shannon and her children, Monica admitted that C.V. has expressed interest in staying with Erik, that C.V. has fun around Erik, and that things are better between C.V. and Shannon now. Finally, Dr. Alvarez concluded that C.V. is equally emotionally connected to both parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In response, Monica asserts that C.V. told Dr. Alvarez that he wants to keep living with Monica. She offers no record support for that assertion, and we find none. In fact, Monica testified that she is not aware of anyone having asked C.V. who he wanted to live with. Monica references Dr. Alvarez's testimony about C.V.'s therapist's deposition. Dr. Alvarez noted that, during a drawing exercise with the therapist, C.V. was asked which of two barns a horse should go in, understanding that the horse could not stay in both barns. One barn said \"Mom\" and the other \"Dad.\" C.V. chose the \"Mom\" barn. Finally, Monica points to a statement made by the therapist during her deposition that C.V. \"is worried about having to live with his dad if that were to be the case, that he wants to stay with his mom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The trial court could have discounted the drawing exercise and deposition statement by C.V.'s therapist for at least two reasons. First, Dr. Alvarez reviewed this information and still recommended that C.V. live with Erik. Second, Monica has, according to Dr. Alvarez, alienated C.V. from his father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We conclude that this factor is neutral.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    B. C.V.'s emotional and physical needs now and in the future\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Much of the trial concerned Monica's efforts to alienate C.V. from Erik and the resulting emotional harm to C.V. Based on interviews with C.V., Monica, and Erik, Dr. Alvarez noted \"an attempt by Ms. Townsend to influence or alienate [C.V.] from his father by talking to him in ways that will affect\" the father-son relationship. Both Erik and Dr. Alvarez were concerned by Monica's behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Dr. Alvarez concluded that many of Monica's allegations against Erik after the 2012 custody order-allegations of physical abuse against Monica and improper drinking around C.V.-were too riddled with inconsistencies to be true. Monica caused Erik to be subjected to drug and alcohol testing, he passed the tests, and the tests were discontinued. Monica admitted that Erik has since quit drinking around C.V. and that she no longer worries that C.V. is unsafe with Erik because of drug or alcohol abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Dr. Alvarez testified that Monica's attempted alienation and untruthfulness supported her conclusion that C.V. was better off living with his father and that Monica should have a standard possession order. The amicus attorney for C.V. agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Monica responds by pointing out her past care and support for C.V. throughout his entire life, including as it relates to school activities, medical care, and psychiatric care. She has been C.V.'s primary caregiver, and C.V. is attached to her. But C.V. is likewise attached to Erik, who has expressed his willingness and desire to assume the primary role in caring for C.V. Erik also has the support of his other family members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In her motion for rehearing, Monica points to C.V.'s personal therapist's deposition, which she argues undercuts Dr. Alvarez's and the trial court's conclusion that she was an alienating parent. Specifically,\n   she points to the therapist's testimony about Monica's decision to keep C.V. in personal therapy and the therapist's inability to recall C.V. saying anything negative about Erik. But, in reaching her conclusions, Dr. Alvarez reviewed this therapist's deposition and spoke with the therapist. Dr. Alvarez nevertheless concluded that C.V. was better off living primarily with Erik, noting that the therapist \"never attempted to reach out to\" Erik or \"understand an entirely new set of historical facts and information\" that he could have provided for context, if asked. In light of this, and in light of the amicus attorney's joining Dr. Alvarez's recommendations, the trial court was within its rights to believe Dr. Alvarez and to discount contrary testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409278\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/537/238/#p242\">\n    537 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   243 ;\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202112806\">\n    2011 WL 2112806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    Hatteberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10011281\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/933/522/#p530\">\n    933 S.W.2d at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This factor favors Erik.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Dr. Alvarez testified that children's psychological development \"is negatively impacted and developed by parents that work to alienate the [child] from one parent.\" She opined that Monica's explanation to C.V. about the need for a police presence at visitation exchanges created a psychological framework that communicated to C.V. that Monica was \"so afraid of Mr. Vasquez that they can't meet at any other place. And that is a form of parental alienation trying to influence the relationship between [C.V.] and his father by presenting Mr. Vasquez as an abusive monster.\" There is record evidence that would support the inference that Monica feared Erik due to his past physical aggression with her. Erik had been convicted twice of domestic abuse against her before C.V.'s birth, and Monica testified that C.V. had witnessed his parents in a physical altercation. But Monica did not take the position at trial that the police presence was necessary because she feared Erik. Instead, she explained that she had asked for custody exchange at the police station because Erik's family had acted aggressively toward her at prior exchanges. Erik himself rarely was present for the exchanges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Moreover, Monica testified that she does not believe that Erik puts C.V. in danger or that his visitations need to be supervised. In her report, Dr. Alvarez detailed a history of inconsistencies in Monica's communications to others about whether Erik had ever hurt C.V.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Additional inconsistencies in Ms. Townsend's historical accounts include telling the Fort Bend Women's Center in June 2012 that [C.V.] was emotionally and psychologically abused by his father, but denying any physical abuse or violence towards him. At a later date, Ms. Townsend denied that [C.V.] was abused at all by his father to [another psychologist] in September 2014, but in February 2015 to CPS, Ms. Townsend alleged that Mr. Vasquez choked Christopher when he was a younger child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Thus, Monica's explanation to C.V. about the need for police presence, as discussed by Dr. Alvarez, was not consistent with Monica's explanation to the court, and the trial court could have reasonably concluded that it supported Dr. Alvarez's suggestion of parental alienation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Monica also suggests that statements by C.V. to his therapist show that he has been afraid of Erik, feels unsafe in Erik's home, and has been mistreated by Shannon. Dr. Alvarez testified that Monica suggested\n   these fears to C.V. to alienate him from his father. The trial court, as sole judge of witness credibility in this bench trial, was entitled to believe Dr. Alvarez on this topic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409278\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/537/238/#p242\">\n    537 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   243 ;\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202112806\">\n    2011 WL 2112806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    Hatteberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10011281\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/933/522/#p530\">\n    933 S.W.2d at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   This factor favors Erik.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Erik's and Monica's parental abilities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Monica has been C.V.'s primary caregiver his whole life. C.V. has not lived with Erik for most of his life. Monica is involved in C.V.'s schooling and improving his grades. She has borne the greater share of taking care of C.V.'s medical needs. Erik has been largely absent from those efforts. During this suit, Monica also completed several parenting classes and testified that she has used what she learned to improve her parenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Dr. Alvarez compared Erik's and Monica's parental abilities by performing personality testing and parental testing on both parents. Both parents took a Personality Assessment Inventory. This allowed Dr. Alvarez to consider both parents' truthfulness. Erik's responses in this inventory gave Dr. Alvarez \"more confidence in describing\" what the later parental-test results would show \"because he was truthful and did not score in the clinical range on the validity scale.\" But Monica \"responded in a way that was not truthful,\" undermining any confidence that Dr. Alvarez would otherwise have in Monica's parental-test results. Monica frequently denied or masked \"problems, pathology, and personality difficulties.\" According to Dr. Alvarez, Monica suffers from some psychopathologies, including frequent untruthfulness, agenda-driven interactions with others, \"under-report[ing of] the common faults that the vast majority of the adult population readily admits having,\" moderate anxiety, somatization, possible depression, \"attention-seeking and dramatic\" behaviors, and narcissism. But Erik has no \"significant psychological disorders,\" save for some traits of narcissism and obsessive-compulsive behaviors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Erik's Parent Awareness Skills Survey and Parent-Child Relationship Inventory scores were within the normal range, according to Dr. Alvarez, although he needed to improve encouraging autonomy in C.V. In contrast, Monica's responses to the Personality Assessment Inventory suggested that she \"was not truthful.\" Therefore, Dr. Alvarez could not have complete confidence in Monica's results on the later parental-test results. Dr. Alvarez also opined that C.V. behaves better when with Erik.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In her report, Dr. Alvarez concluded that Erik \"has more awareness of critical parent/child issues, better overall ability to developmentally appropriate language, and a better ability to consider how the child feels given the parenting situation\" but that Monica \"exhibited better ability to integrate information in order to parent in a variety of situations/conditions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Based on Dr. Alvarez's testimony, which we are to presume the trial court credited because it supports the trial court's judgment, we conclude that this factor slightly favors Erik.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Programs available to assist Erik or Monica in promoting C.V.'s best interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Monica has ensured that C.V. received therapy for several years, and she has regularly attended meetings with school personnel to address C.V.'s low-but-improving school performance. Therapy has helped C.V. address concerns about his interactions with Shannon and her children. It also has helped C.V. work through issues relating to PTSD, anxiety, ADHD, and learning difficulties. Living with Erik outside of Fort Bend County will preclude\n   C.V. from using the same therapist's services because that therapist only serves Fort Bend County residents. Erik has never reached out to the therapist Monica retained for C.V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Monica has also attended meetings with school personnel to address C.V.'s performance. In contrast, Erik has had limited involvement with helping C.V.'s school performance, even though online tools have been available to him to monitor C.V.'s performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Erik responds that all the \"programs available to promote the best interests of the child are equally available to both parents.\" In a general sense this may be accurate, but it ignores that C.V.'s longtime therapist will not be available to C.V. if he lives in Brazoria County with Erik. Erik also points out that the trial court's order provides that both parents have the right, subject to the other's agreement, to consent to medical and psychological treatment for C.V. But so did the original custody order, yet Erik failed to stay engaged in C.V.'s medical and psychological care or his school performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   This factor favors Monica.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Erik's and Monica's plans for C.V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Both parents claim that they are better suited to prepare C.V. for his future. Monica has invested significant time helping C.V.'s education and obtaining therapy for him. Dr. Alvarez interviewed each parent several times and concluded that C.V. was better off living with his father. While Monica's interactions with C.V., as they related to his father, introduced feelings of fear and anxiety for C.V., Erik's interactions were healthier. Erik's home and family support are likewise beneficial and preferable for C.V.'s development, according to Dr. Alvarez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Given the recommendations of Dr. Alvarez, a neutral licensed psychologist, this factor favors Erik.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    G. The stability of Erik's home\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Dr. Alvarez's interviews with each parent led her to conclude that Erik's home was a better environment for C.V. Her impressions were that Erik was truthful but that Monica was not. Shannon, who lives with Erik, and Erik's parents, who live nearby, are involved in C.V.'s life, and C.V. enjoys spending time with each of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Monica raises some of C.V.'s prior complaints about Shannon's sons hurting him and about not feeling comfortable around Shannon. Notwithstanding these earlier concerns, Monica testified that she does not believe that C.V. is unsafe in Erik's care or that Erik's visitation must be supervised. Monica faults Dr. Alvarez's failure to interview Shannon and the other children and notes critically that Dr. Alvarez's interviews of the family and her final report's issuance happened a year or more before trial. These criticisms of Dr. Alvarez's evaluation processes go to Dr. Alvarez's credibility, which we may not second-guess.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409278\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/537/238/#p242\">\n    537 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   243 ;\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202112806\">\n    2011 WL 2112806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    Hatteberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10011281\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/933/522/#p530\">\n    933 S.W.2d at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Dr. Alvarez concluded in her report and in her testimony that Erik's home was a better environment for C.V. Therefore, this factor favors Erik.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Monica's acts or omissions that indicate that the current custodial placement is improper and any excuses for those acts or omissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Dr. Alvarez's opinions about Monica's attempts to alienate C.V. from his father also bear on these factors, as does Monica's surreptitiously recording of all C.V.'s phone calls with Erik. Dr. Alvarez testified that the efforts by Monica to paint Erik in a harsh light to C.V. were harmful to C.V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   These factors favor Erik.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In sum, of the nine best-interest factors, only one favors Monica. Her alienating conduct played a central role in Dr. Alvarez's custody recommendation. The trial court reasonably could have concluded that Dr. Alvarez's opinion about Monica's untruthfulness undermined Monica's credibility. So while Monica has done much good in her parenting, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that her intentional and repeated alienation of C.V. from his father strongly suggested that custody should be modified. We hold that the evidence before the trial court was legally sufficient to support the order modifying custody in Erik's favor because we cannot say that a reasonable person could not have reached the same judgment on the same facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stamper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8225690\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/254/537/#p542\">\n    254 S.W.3d at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We also hold that the evidence was factually sufficient because the evidence supporting the modification was not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to make the order clearly wrong or unjust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409278\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/537/238/#p242\">\n    537 S.W.3d at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The trial court did not err in applying its discretion to the evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Under the second prong of abuse-of-discretion review, Monica offers several reasons, either in her opening brief or in her motion for rehearing, why she believes Dr. Alvarez's testimony was not credible-Dr. Alvarez ignored C.V.'s therapist's deposition testimony, Dr. Alvarez's methodology was flawed, C.V.'s therapist is more credible than Dr. Alvarez, Dr. Alvarez never interviewed Shannon or her children, and Monica's personal therapist reached different conclusions about her mental health. And in her motion for rehearing, Monica adds other considerations-Dr. Alvarez failed to consider Erik's 2005 and 2006 convictions for family violence; a court-ordered substance-abuse evaluator reported that Monica \"is motivated to complete the requirements of the Court\" and \"appeared honest and open throughout the clinical interview\"; C.V.'s personal therapist had spent more time with him than Dr. Alvarez had; and parental alienation is not a diagnosable condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   All these observations concern Dr. Alvarez's credibility, which the trial court was within its discretion to judge favorably, including by discounting Monica's contrary testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409278\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/537/238/#p242\">\n    537 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   243 ;\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202112806\">\n    2011 WL 2112806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    Hatteberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10011281\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/933/522/#p530\">\n    933 S.W.2d at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
