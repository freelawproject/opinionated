Appellant was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on six total counts and has fully served his time. Appellant filed a motion under \u00a7 547.037\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a habeas corpus claim under Rule 91\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserting re-examination of DNA testing would demonstrate his innocence and entitles him to release from custody and a new trial. The motion court found the \u00a7 547.037 motion must be denied because the required prerequisites under \u00a7 547.035 were not met. The court denied the Rule 91 argument because it had been \"repeatedly rejected\" and should not be reconsidered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant appeals both denials by\n   the motion court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first point on appeal is the motion court incorrectly applied prior \u00a7 547.035 rulings in denying the \u00a7 547.037 claim. The second point on appeal is the motion court should not have denied the Rule 91 habeas corpus claim without an evidentiary hearing. Because Appellant is no longer in state custody and no testing has been ordered or taken under \u00a7 547.035, the motion court's denial of the \u00a7 547.037 motion is affirmed. Because \"no appeal lies\" from a habeas corpus decision, Appellant's second point on appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 1999, a St. Louis jury convicted Appellant of three counts of forcible rape and three counts of forcible sodomy against two victims. One of the victims, A.G., presented with DNA evidence at the hospital on the night of the alleged attack. The hospital tested the samples and could not confirm or deny Appellant's DNA. No further testing was ordered or completed by the prosecution or Appellant before trial. Appellant was convicted of six counts at trial: four counts involving victim M.M. and two counts involving victim A.G. The DNA evidence relates to one count of forcible rape involving A.G. and does not relate to the other A.G. count or any of the M.M. counts. This Court affirmed Appellant's conviction on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11083578\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/50/869/\">\n    50 S.W.3d 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. E.D. 2001). Appellant was sentenced to 15 years in the Missouri Department of Corrections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The count of forcible rape involving A.G., for which the DNA evidence was mentioned at trial, led to one five year sentence which ran concurrently to the five year sentence for forcible sodomy involving A.G. While still in custody, Appellant mounted several unsuccessful collateral attacks on his conviction. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

In 2007, Appellant filed his first \u00a7 547 motion which the motion court denied because Appellant failed to show why the DNA was not tested prior to or during trial as required by\n   \u00a7 547.035.2 (3) subsection (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court affirmed the denial.

App. E.D. 2010). In 2013, Appellant filed a second \u00a7 547 motion which the motion court denied because \u00a7 547.035 does not allow successive motions. This Court affirmed the denial.

App. E.D. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unrelated to Appellant's \u00a7 547.035 motions, the City of St. Louis retested the DNA sample from Appellant's case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a letter dated August 27, 2014, the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department contacted Appellant about a backlog of cases meant for re-examination and informed Appellant the DNA samples from trial had been retested. On October 5, 2014, Appellant was released from custody having fully served his sentence. In 2017, Appellant filed a third \u00a7 547.035 motion under Rule 74.06(b) relying on the re-examined DNA test results. The motion court denied the motion because Appellant was no longer in custody and \u00a7 547.035 does not allow successive motions. This Court affirmed the denial. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

In March 2018, the motion court denied Appellant's \u00a7 547 claim and denied a writ for habeas relief.

Section 547.037.1 reads, in relevant part: \"If testing\n   <em>\n    ordered pursuant to section 547.035\n   </em>\n   demonstrates a person's innocence of the crime\n   <em>\n    for which the person is in custody\n   </em>\n   , a motion for release may be filed in the sentencing court.\" (emphasis added).

Questions of law are subject to this Court's independent\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, and no deference is given to the motion court's decision.\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

App. E.D. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We must look to the statute for the requirements and apply them to the record on appeal. The role of courts is to ascertain the intent of the legislature from the language in a statute and give effect to that intent if possible.\n   <em>\n    Abrams v. Ohio Pacific Exp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9972341\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/819/338/#p340\">\n    819 S.W.2d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340 (Mo. banc 1991). \"Words and phrases shall be taken in their plain or ordinary and usual sense ...\" \u00a7 1.090.

The statute requires testing \"ordered pursuant to\" \u00a7 547.035 for the crime \"for which the person is in custody\". \"Ordered pursuant to\" means testing ordered according to the specific statute, in this case, \u00a7 547.035. At no point has testing under \u00a7 547.035 been ordered in Appellant's case. \"For which the person is in custody\" means this statute applies to individuals currently in state custody. When this \u00a7 547.037 motion was filed, Appellant had been out of state custody for over three years. After review of the record and consideration of the plain and ordinary meaning of subsection (1) of \u00a7 547.037, the requirements for the statute are clear. Appellant fails to meet two of the requirements of \u00a7 547.037. Therefore, the motion court did not clearly err in the findings of fact or conclusions of law in denying Appellant's motion. The first point is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.
