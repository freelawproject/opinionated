Webb raises four claims on appeal: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions; (2) the trial court erred in admitting photographs of Victim after his death; (3) the trial court erred in admitting Victim's out-of-court statements to two of his teachers; and (4) the trial court violated Webb's Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by sentencing him to a longer term of imprisonment than that of his co-perpetrator. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 15, 2012, four-year-old Victim (born January 2, 2008) lived in an 1800-square-foot home in Holt, Missouri, with Webb (his father), Melissa Webb (Stepmother), and his younger brother (the child of Webb and Stepmother). That afternoon, around 1:30 p.m., Webb arrived home from work. Stepmother and Brother sat in the living room to play a board game, while Webb was doing something in the kitchen. Victim walked down the hall toward Stepmother and Brother when Stepmother approached Victim and kicked him, knocking him to the floor. Victim\n   tried to get away, but Stepmother kept kicking him repeatedly between the legs and in the abdomen, eventually causing Victim to vomit between screams. Brother tried to get Webb to stop the attack, but Webb did nothing. Stepmother eventually stopped, and Victim stumbled outside and fell on his knees and then to the ground. Brother told Webb, who told Brother to get Stepmother. Victim's eyes were closed, and Webb did something to Victim's mouth that Brother described as \"holding up his tongue,\" and that investigators later believed to be an effort at CPR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A call was made to 911 around 3:15 p.m., reporting a four-year-old child who was not breathing. When paramedics arrived, they observed Stepmother on the front porch performing CPR on Victim, Webb standing by, restraining a dog, and Brother off to the side. One of the paramedics asked what happened, and neither Webb nor Stepmother responded. The paramedic asked again, and again neither responded. Eventually, the paramedic was advised that Victim \"had been kicked in the head at the fair a couple of days ago, had woken up with a bellyache, and now this.\" The paramedic asked how long Victim had been down and not breathing, and neither Webb nor Stepmother responded. The paramedic asked a total of three times how long Victim had not been breathing, and she never received an answer. Victim's heart was not beating, which suggested to the paramedic that Victim had not been breathing for a while;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   she also observed dark discolorations around Victim's head. At that point, they put Victim in the ambulance and headed for the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the way to the hospital, the paramedic tried to intubate Victim to get him oxygen, but she was unable to get his jaw open because it was rigid from the onset of rigor mortis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon removing Victim's clothing, the paramedic observed \"bruising around the side of the head on the right side, behind both ears, [and] down the back of his neck\"; she also observed that Victim's penis was bruised. Victim had a \"coffee grounds appearance coming from his nose and his mouth,\" which the paramedic said was \"sometimes an indication of internal bleeding.\" When they arrived at the hospital and rolled Victim over, the paramedic observed large bruises on Victim's buttocks and lower back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the hospital, three physicians and all of the nursing, respiratory, laboratory, and X-ray staff were assembled in preparation for Victim's arrival. Hospital staff again tried to secure Victim's airway but were unable to open his jaw. Hospital staff noted the onset of rigor mortis in other areas of Victim's body besides his jaw. Victim was pronounced dead at 3:50 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The medical examiner performed an autopsy of Victim the next day. The first thing the examiner noticed was that Victim was underweight. The examiner documented the following injuries to Victim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Extensive contusions and abrasions were found on the back, sides, cheeks, chin, forehead, and temples of his head. His outer lips were bruised, and his inner lips were lacerated. Internal hemorrhaging was found on the posterior regions of his head and neck. He had extensive contusions and abrasions on\n   the front, back, and sides of his torso, sacrum, and buttocks; his entire torso was discolored. His penis and scrotum were bruised, and his penis had two lacerations on its dorsal side. Multiple contusions and abrasions were located on all four of his limbs. Four healing broken ribs were discovered. Hemorrhages were found in his lungs, pancreas, diaphragm, and small bowel, and several lacerations located in multiple areas within his gastrointestinal system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Victim had a thousand milliliters of blood in the abdomen, indicating that he had severe internal bleeding. The examiner determined that Victim's most significant injury-and the ultimate cause of his death-was a laceration in the small bowel. The examiner testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [I]njuries like this are caused by blows to the abdomen in young children, and what happens is that the skin surface is basically pushed all the way to the vertebral column, which is bone and it's hard. So all the tissues caught in between are split or torn or lacerated. So he has that kind of injury in the head of the pancreas; in the omentum, which hangs off of the stomach; the stomach is ruptured in two places; and the small bowel is split; and the tissue that supplies blood to the colon is also lacerated. So-and these are all organs that would have been caught-or, these are all tissues or organs that would have been caught between the blow and the vertebral column.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to the examiner, a person suffering this kind of injury will \"go into shock pretty rapidly, especially with this kind of blood loss.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, \"the dumping of all of these intestinal contents free into the abdomen ... sets up a terrible infection, and that's what[ ] caus[ed] th[e] discoloration over [Victim's] abdomen.\" The examiner indicated that this kind of injury would be immediately symptomatic and cause extreme pain; he surmised that Victim would \"probably be rolling around in pain until he passe[d] out.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further indicated that, if untreated, this kind of injury is fatal within a matter of hours. The examiner determined the cause of death to be \"[b]lunt force injuries of the thorax and abdomen,\" and the manner of death to be homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Two days after Victim's death, both Webb and Stepmother were interviewed by an investigator with the Major Case Squad. When asked about Victim's bruising, Webb claimed that Victim bruised easily, fell often, was easily injured, and had a high pain tolerance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Webb further explained that giving Victim Vitamin D milk helped lessen Victim's bruising, but they had been out of Vitamin D milk for over two weeks at the time of Victim's death. Webb suggested that Victim had a habit of chewing on his own lips and that a heart defect caused Victim to burn energy at a high rate, leading to Victim being underweight. Webb suggested that the injuries to Victim's abdomen may have occurred\n   the evening before his death, when the family went to a fall gathering where Victim was playing on a hay bale and an older child jumped off the hay bale and landed on Victim. Webb suggested that the injuries to Victim's back and head occurred when Victim climbed the hay bale a second time and slipped off. When asked about the injuries to Victim's penis, Webb claimed that, on October 12, while Webb was in the kitchen cooking, he heard Brother and Victim in the bathroom. Apparently, Victim had been using the bathroom when Brother suddenly needed to go, and Brother did not wait for Victim to move before putting his seat on the toilet and smashing Victim's penis. Also on October 12, Webb observed a knot on Victim's head when Webb came home from work; he asked about it, and the boys said Victim fell off a truck. Stepmother claimed to know nothing about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When asked about the day of Victim's death, Webb said he arrived home around 1:30 or 2:00 in the afternoon, and Stepmother told him that Victim had been sick. So Webb checked on Victim, who appeared fine, and Webb then went to bed, as he had worked all night the night before. Webb said that he heard Victim ask for a drink of water, and shortly thereafter, he heard Stepmother scream for Webb to get up because they needed to take Victim to the hospital. According to Webb, Stepmother carried Victim outside, and Victim was throwing up down her back while she was on the phone with 911. Webb said that Stepmother then placed Victim on his back on the deck, per instructions from the 911 operator, and began CPR. Webb said that Stepmother did chest compressions while Webb provided breaths. Webb said that, when the paramedics arrived, they did nothing to assist either him or Stepmother, and instead just loaded Victim into the ambulance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When the investigating officer advised Webb that Victim's fatal injury was to his abdomen and asked how that might have happened, Webb suggested they stop their meeting. Webb, nevertheless, continued describing other injury-producing events that occurred to Victim in the days preceding his death. At two different points in the interview, Webb discussed that the last time they had taken Victim to the doctor, it was for nausea, vomiting, and bruising. According to Webb, the doctor could not describe what was causing the bruising but had provided some anti-nausea medicine so Victim could eat and keep food down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before his death, Victim attended a preschool for children with developmental delays.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   One of his teachers described him as \"a very athletic little boy.\" She said that \"[h]e liked to climb. He liked to run and play.... [H]e was very agile. He was not at all clumsy.\" In November of 2011, during a class bathroom break, Victim's classroom teacher Pamela Miller noticed severe bruising on Victim's bottom. When she asked what happened to him, Victim said \"Daddy get mad at me and hit me with a-with a stick.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also said, \"I was on daddy's boat and I fell and Daddy get mad.\" Again on January 10, 2012, Miller noticed bruising on Victim's bottom and, when she asked Victim about it, he said, \"Daddy get mad at me and hit me with a switch.\" That same day, Miller contacted the child abuse hotline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   As time progressed,\n   Miller noticed more bruises than she would expect from normal play, and she notified Victim's family of her concerns. Multiple emails went back and forth, and Victim's attendance became irregular.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Between February and April of 2012, Victim missed 21 out of 37 school days. On April 20, 2012, Stepmother removed Victim from his preschool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Victim returned to his preschool in the fall of 2012, and he was put in Staci Bonderer's class. On August 20, 2012, Victim attended a back-to-school open house, and Bonderer noticed that Victim was much thinner than she remembered him being the prior spring. On August 23, the first day of school, Bonderer noticed that Victim acted very tired and seemed very frail. Victim asked for more drinks than most children,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and he did not play during recess time. The next day, when Bonderer took Victim to the bathroom, he said that \"a monster plays with his pee-pee.\" Victim refused to play during the day and instead laid at his table with his head down. Later, on the way out to the bus, Victim told Bonderer that sometimes he didn't feel good. Bonderer asked him what hurts when he feels bad, and \"he said that it hurts when his mom kicks him in the stomach with her foot.\" Bonderer asked Victim if his mom was happy or mad when she kicked him with her foot, and he said she was mad; he also remarked that she had made him swallow a Pop Tart. On August 27, 2012, Bonderer noticed that Victim had scabbed-over teeth marks on his lips; when she asked about it, Victim said that Brother pushed him off the stroller. On August 31, 2012, Bonderer again noticed that Victim was very lethargic and did not play much at playtime. She also noted that he cried when it was time to go to the bathroom and did not want to go.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following Labor Day weekend, Victim attended school on only Friday of that week (September 7, 2012), and he had bruising on his arms and legs, and it was mostly on one side of his body. Bonderer contacted the school counselor to have her discuss the bruises with Victim. When asked how he got the bruises, Victim said he fell off a boat. An examination of Victim revealed a total of nine bruises, with some on his leg and others on his cheeks and eyes. Victim also had a scabbed-over bite mark on his back. A report was then made to the child abuse hotline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 20, 2012, Victim came to school with a bruise on his cheek. Victim told Bonderer, \"my mom said it's none of your business. She said, tell you none your ... businesses.\" That was the last day Bonderer saw Victim, as he did not attend school for the remaining weeks before his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Both Webb and Stepmother were criminally charged with respect to Victim's injuries and death. Stepmother pled guilty to second-degree (felony) murder and felony abuse of a child. Pursuant to a plea agreement, she was sentenced to concurrent terms of 20 years for felony murder and 15 years for abuse of a child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Webb was\n   charged, as an accomplice, with second-degree (felony) murder and first-degree endangering the welfare of a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Before trial, the State filed a motion to admit out-of-court statements from Victim to both Miller and Bonderer under \u00a7 491.075. Webb objected, arguing that Victim's statements were \"too remote in time\" to \"provide sufficient indicia of trustworthiness and reliability\" and that they violated Webb's Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers insofar as the statements were testimonial. The trial court overruled Webb's objections and ordered that the statements were admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At trial, Webb testified in his own defense. Webb testified that he returned home from work and running errands around 1:30 p.m. on October 15, 2012. He testified that, when he arrived home, Stepmother met him at the door and had a discussion with him about Victim. As a result of the conversation, Webb went to Victim's bedroom to check on him. Victim was lying on a pallet on the floor. Webb asked Victim what was wrong, and Victim said he was sick to his stomach. Webb then brought some items in from his truck before going back to Victim's bedroom to see him again. Webb claimed that Victim again complained that his belly hurt and said that he thought he ate too much. Webb then went to bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Shortly thereafter, he heard Victim and Stepmother walking down the hallway, and Victim asked for a glass of water. Webb fell asleep but was awakened when Stepmother screamed at him, telling him to get up because they needed to go to the hospital. Webb claimed that Stepmother was carrying Victim out to the car and that he saw Victim look up at him just before vomiting all over Stepmother's shoulder. As Webb was putting Brother's shoes on, Stepmother told him to grab her cell phone. Stepmother then ran back inside, telling Webb that Victim had collapsed. According to Webb, Stepmother then called 911 and was advised to lay Victim on his back and start CPR, which they did until the ambulance arrived and took Victim away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Webb acknowledged knowingly leaving Victim in Stepmother's care, custody, and control on multiple occasions, including September and October of 2012. Webb also acknowledged that he and Stepmother had been reported to DFS based upon Victim's bruises in September 2012. But Webb denied knowing that Victim had missed two-to-three weeks of school right before he died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The jury found Webb guilty as charged, and the trial court sentenced him to consecutive terms of thirty and seven years' imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Webb appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Webb raises four claims on appeal. First, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions; specifically, he argues that the evidence failed to establish the requisite mental element for child endangerment. Second, Webb argues that the trial court erred in admitting State's Exhibits 8, 9, and 10 (photos of Victim's body) because the photos were inflammatory, prejudicial, and unnecessary to establish Victim's cause of death. Third, Webb argues that the trial court erred in admitting Victim's out-of-court statements to Miller and Bonderer because the statements constituted testimonial hearsay and\n   their admission violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. Finally, Webb argues that the trial court violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment when it sentenced him to a longer total sentence than Stepmother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's determination that Webb knowingly acted in a manner that created a substantial risk to Victim's life, body, or health.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In his first point on appeal, Webb challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. More specifically, he argues that the evidence did not establish the requisite mental element for first-degree child endangerment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In reviewing challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, \"[t]he function of the reviewing court is not to reweigh the evidence, but only to determine whether the judgment is supported by sufficient evidence ... from which a trier of fact reasonably could have found the defendant guilty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nothing in the record provided to this court, however, reflects her actual sentences. The State does not challenge Webb's assertion; instead, the State argues that the terms of Stepmother's sentences are irrelevant. Case.net indicates that Webb's assertion is accurate.

Although the point relied on does identify the overruling of Webb's motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State's evidence, \"no motion for judgment of acquittal needs to be filed prior to the submission of the case in order for a defendant to seek a judgment of acquittal after the verdict.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.
