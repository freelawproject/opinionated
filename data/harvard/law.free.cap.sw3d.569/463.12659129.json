Fouts was injured when he fell on an exterior stairway in his apartment complex. Fouts argues that the court erred in granting Regency North's motion for summary judgment because the exculpatory clause contained in the lease was ambiguous and did not apply to personal injuries that occurred on the stairs. Fouts further argues that the trial court erred in granting Regency North's motion for summary judgment because the exculpatory clause was unenforceable since it was unreasonable to expect Fouts to read or understand the exculpatory clause and the exculpatory clause was against public policy. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Statement of Facts\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 25, 2014, Fouts entered into a residential lease agreement with Regency North for the rental of an apartment located at 6026 N. Jefferson, Apartment #3, Kansas City, Missouri. The term of the lease ran from September 1, 2014 through\n   June 30, 2015. Paragraph 44 of the lease contains an exculpatory clause, which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    44. EXCULPATION, TENANT'S RELEASE AND AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY.\n   </strong>\n   LANDLORD AND ITS AGENTS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR FOR DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF PERSONAL PROPERTY IN OR ABOUT THE PREMISES, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF SUCH INJURY, LOSS OR DAMAGE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INTERRUPTION OF UTILITIES OR OTHER CASUALTY OR OCCURRENCES. TENANT, FOR HIMSELF, HIS HEIRS, EXECUTORS, ADMINISTRATORS, APPROVED SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, HEREBY RELEASES, RELINQUISHES AND DISCHARGES AND AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, PROTECT AND SAVE HARMLESS LANDLORD, ITS AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS OF AND FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND LIABILITY FOR ANY INJURY TO, INCLUDING DEATH OF, PERSONS (WHETHER THEY BE THIRD PERSONS, TENANT, OR EMPLOYEES OF THE PARTIES HERETO) AND ANY LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY (WHETHER THE SAME BE THAT OF EITHER OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR OF THIRD PERSONS) CAUSED BY, GROWING OUT OF, OR HAPPENING IN CONNECTION WITH, TENANT'S USE AND OCCUPANCY OF THE PREMISES, FIXTURES, EQUIPMENT, APPLIANCES, FACILITIES, IMPROVEMENTS OR COMMON AREAS LOCATED OR TO BE LOCATED THEREON, OR BY REASON OF ANY LIKE OR DIFFERENT CASUALTY. IN LIKE MANNER AND TO THE EXTENT SET FORTH IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, TENANT AGREES TO EXONERATE AND SAVE HARMLESS LANDLORD, ITS EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY EVEN THOUGH THE CLAIM, OR LOSS OR CASUALTY IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NEGLIGENCE OF LANDLORD OR ITS EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS. TENANT AGREES TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING INSURANCE ON PERSONAL PROPERTY CONTENTS AND LIABILITY.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The exculpatory clause is the only paragraph in the subject of the lease printed in all capital letters and is located directly above Fouts's signature on the lease. At the time of signing, Fouts asked one of Regency North's employees what paragraph 44 meant and was told that it just meant he had to buy his own insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 15, 2014, Fouts slipped and fell on the exterior wooden stairs of the building where his apartment was located. Fouts filed a personal injury suit against Regency North on August 3, 2015. In his petition, Fouts alleged that his fall was caused by the negligence of Regency North.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Regency North filed a motion for summary judgment. This motion was fully briefed and argued. On September 27, 2017, the trial court entered judgment granting Regency North's motion for summary judgment and dismissing the petition. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   When considering an appeal from a summary judgment, we review the record in the light most favorable to the party against whom judgment was entered, and we afford that party the benefit of\n   all reasonable inferences.\n   <em>\n    ITT Commercial Fin.

In his first point, Fouts argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the exculpatory clause is unenforceable as a matter of law since it is limited in scope to the apartment unit and common areas. In his second point on appeal, Fouts argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the exculpatory clause is unenforceable as a matter of law since the phrase \"or about the premises\" is ambiguous. In Point Three, Fouts argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the exculpatory clause is unenforceable as matter of law since it is a contract of adhesion and it was unreasonable to expect Fouts to read or understand the exculpatory clause to release Regency North from liability. In Point Four, Fouts argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the exculpatory clause is unenforceable as a matter of law since it is against sound public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Points One and Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We address both Points One and Two together. In his first point on appeal, Fouts argues that the trial court erred in granting Regency North's motion for summary judgment because the exculpatory clause is unenforceable as a matter of law since the exculpatory clause was limited in scope to the apartment unit and common areas. Fouts argues that phrase \"in or about the premises\" and \"common areas\" limit the scope of the exculpatory clause to those locations, which does not include the stairs. In his second point on appeal, Fouts argues that the trial court erred in granting Regency North's motion for summary judgment because the exculpatory clause is unenforceable since the use of the term \"or about the premises\" is ambiguous. Fouts argues that the phrase \"or about the premises\" is used to be intentionally vague and therefore, by its nature, ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The issues concerning the scope of the exculpatory clause and the ambiguity of the term \"or about the premises\" were not raised or argued to the trial court by either party. Fouts failed to raise these issues in his response to Regency North's motion for summary judgment. Since Fouts did not raise these issues before the trial court on the motion for summary judgment, he is precluded from making these arguments on appeal.\n   <em>\n    D.E. Props. Corp. v.

The exculpatory clause is the only provision of this contract in all capital letters and is located directly above the signature line. Regency North's employee's statement to Fouts that this provision required him to obtain personal insurance does not make it an unreasonable expectation for the lease to contain an exculpatory clause. It is a reasonable expectation that a lease agreement would contain an exculpatory clause that is the same as other exculpatory clauses found in other lease agreements, and it is a reasonable expectation that the exculpatory clause would exculpate Regency North from liability for negligent acts. \"By an objective standard, 'reasonable expectations' might or might not\n   be what a party actually expected.\"\n   <em>\n    Heartland Health Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9994130\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/871/8/#p11\">\n    871 S.W.2d at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
