Martin, Judge\n   The City of Kansas City, Missouri, (\"City\") appeals from a judgment entered following a jury trial which found that the City discriminated against Tarshish Jones (\"Jones\") on the basis of race in violation of the Missouri Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City argues the trial court erred in denying its motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\"JNOV\"); in admitting Jones's expert witness testimony; in excluding the City's expert witness testimony; and in awarding attorneys' fees and costs. Finding no error, we affirm, and remand this matter for consideration of Jones's pending motion for an award of attorneys' fees incurred subsequent to the entry of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Jones was employed as a firefighter with the Kansas City Fire Department (\"KCFD\") for more than 19 years. Jones was promoted to fire apparatus operator (\"FAO\") in 2003. After promotion to FAO, Jones sought promotion to captain on five separate occasions. Relevant to this case, Jones, an African-American, sought promotion to captain in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   To be eligible for promotion to captain, a candidate must have ten years of service and a prior promotion to FAO. A candidate must also complete the captain's promotional process. When Jones sought promotion to captain in 2012, the captain's promotional process included four components. Each component was separately scored and equally weighted. The component scores were compiled to produce a composite score. A rankings list (\"promotional roster\") was then generated listing candidates from highest to lowest rank based on composite scores. The promotional roster controlled who was promoted to captain for two years, as vacancies were filled as they arose based solely on rank. It is not possible to determine how many candidates will be promoted from a promotional roster, as the number of captain vacancies can vary greatly from year to year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The 2012 captain's promotional process materials were created by the KCFD with the assistance of an outside contractor. Three of the four components used in the 2012 captain's promotional process involved a written multiple-choice test, a tactical exercises test, and consideration of seniority up to 25 years. The fourth component was a scenario-based situational exercise (the \"SE component\"). The SE component is the only part of the 2012 captain's promotional process at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the SE component exercise, candidates responded to three employee-based, management scenarios. The responses were video-taped. Each candidate received the same scenarios and was given four minutes to respond to each scenario.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The video-taped responses were watched by three assessors and independently scored. In 2012, the assessors were drawn from an internal pool of KCFD employees holding the rank of captain or higher.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The guidelines to initially score the SE component were developed with the assistance of the outside contractor, and included a benchmark rubric used to \"check-off\" certain topics when mentioned by a candidate. However, the guidelines were essentially subjective in nature, with the only mandatory scoring instruction being that ultimately, the assessors had to assign scores for each candidate in each scoring area within 1 point of each other. To satisfy this objective, the assessors met after independently scoring the candidates, and bartered or advocated for certain candidates, with initial scores adjusted accordingly. This bartering process sometimes involved reviewing the videotaped responses of candidates to discuss a particular assessor's judgment about a response, and sometimes included advocacy by an assessor based on factors beyond those identified in the written scoring guidelines. Ultimately, after the bartering process, a composite score would be agreed upon as the candidate's SE component score. The notes used by the assessors to score the SE component were then destroyed, rendering it impossible to document the initial scores given by each assessor, or the manner in which scores changed during the bartering process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the 2012 captain's promotional process, Jones scored well on the multiple choice, tactical exercise, and seniority components. However, Jones only scored a 2.5 out of 7.0 on the SE component. Because of the low SE component score, Jones's composite score ranked him as the 42nd candidate eligible for promotion to captain on the promotional roster. Jones requested a review of his composite score, but his position on the promotional roster remained unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The 2012 promotional roster was used to promote candidates to captain through 2014. During that time, the top 17 candidates on the list were promoted to 16 captain vacancies,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the last promotion occurring on December 14, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 23, 2015, Jones filed a charge of discrimination with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights (\"MCHR\"). Jones subsequently received a notice of right to sue letter, and then filed a race discrimination lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Jackson County on November 24, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, Deputy Chief Garrett, who had previously served as an SE component assessor, but who did not serve as an assessor during the 2012 captain's promotional process, testified that African-American candidates were routinely underscored in the SE component in comparison to Caucasian candidates. Deputy Chief Garrett also testified that he could not recall a single African-American candidate who benefitted from the bartering process that occurred after initial scores were assigned by assessors. The jury heard evidence that although assessors were trained on the SE component scoring rubric and process, they did not receive\n   any training to avoid implicit or explicit racial bias in scoring candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Jones learned through discovery, and shortly before trial, that his SE component assessors had been Brian Cooley, C.J. Stevens, and Richard Davis (\"Davis\"). Davis, a KCFD captain, was placed on the 2012 SE component assessor panel as a designated minority member, although Davis refuses to self-identify as an African-American. Davis testified at trial that other assessors told him (he claimed jokingly) that he was harder on African-American candidates than Caucasian candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Jones presented expert witness testimony from two former KCFD battalion chiefs who independently reviewed Jones's SE component score alongside the scores of five other captain candidates evaluated during the 2012 captain promotional process. The expert witnesses opined that Jones should have scored 5.4 on the SE component -- 2.9 points higher than Jones's actual SE component score. Had Jones scored a 5.4 on the SE component, he would have ranked 15th on the 2012 promotional roster, and he would have been promoted to captain from the 2012 promotional roster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The jury heard evidence that only 185 of the KCFD's 1,336 employees (13.5%) are African-Americans; that only 17 of the KCFD's 199 captains (8.5%) are African-American; and that only 3 of the KCFD's 27 battalion chiefs (11%) are African-American. In contrast, 40% of all City employees are African-American.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The City's equal employment opportunity and diversity manager acknowledged the risk of injecting bias in employment decisions when candidates for promotion are subjectively evaluated. Jones admitted evidence that the KCFD had not held any training concerning race discrimination or diversity in more than three years, and that the KCFD has never received training on implicit bias, while other City employees have received such training. The jury heard testimony that several KCFD fire stations are racially-segregated, and that KCFD Chief Paul Berardi was aware of complaints that African-American firefighters are retaliated against when traded into a station with all Caucasian firefighters. Witnesses testified to frequently hearing the word \"n----r\" and other racial slurs in the workplace. Statistical evidence demonstrated that it takes significantly more time for an African-American KCFD firefighter to be promoted than Caucasians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Jones submitted his discrimination claim to the jury with a verdict director that required the jury to find that the City failed to promote him through the 2012 captain's promotional process, and that race was a contributing factor in this failure. The jury entered a verdict in favor of Jones and against the City on Jones's claim of race discrimination during the 2012 captain's promotional process, and awarded damages in the amount of $356,694.69. The trial court entered judgment consistent with the jury's verdict, and awarded Jones attorneys' fees in the amount of $662,862.50 after applying a multiplier of 125 percent, and costs in the amount of $44,913.49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The City filed this timely appeal. Other relevant facts will be addressed in connection with the City's points on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The City asserts five points on appeal challenging the trial court's denial of the City's motions for directed verdict and JNOV; the trial court's admission and exclusion of expert witness testimony; and the trial court's calculation of attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Point One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The City's first point on appeal argues that the trial court erred in denying the City's motions for directed verdict and JNOV because Jones failed to file his charge of discrimination with the MCHR within 180 days of publication of the 2012 promotional roster. The City argues that publication of the tainted promotional roster on November 24, 2012 was the discrete act of discrimination about which Jones complains pursuant to section 213.075.1, and that use of the promotional roster for two years did not constitute a continuing violation that extended the time for Jones to file an administrative complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the City argues that Jones's January 23, 2015 administrative complaint with the MCHR was untimely, preventing the submission of his civil claim of discrimination as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The standard for reviewing a denied motion for JNOV is essentially the same as for reviewing the denial of a motion\n   for directed verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanders v.

Though the City's Brief argues that publication of the 2012 promotional roster was the unlawful discriminatory practice which triggered Jones's obligation to file an administrative complaint within 180 days pursuant to section 213.075.1, the City mistakenly presumes, without discussion, that the timely filing of a section 213.075.1 administrative complaint is essential to civil liability under the MHRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Farrow v.

We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    We have reviewed the record and conclude that the City's motions for directed verdict and for JNOV did raise (among other possible triggers) publication of the 2012 promotional roster on November 24, 2012 as a discrete act of discrimination triggering the 180-day administrative complaint filing deadline.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    In addition, the City included the affirmative defense of untimely filing of the administrative complaint in its answer and motions for directed verdict and JNOV. The City did not waive this defense by failing to repeat the defense as an objection to Jones's verdict director.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Holmes v.

Jones's verdict director, Instruction No. 7, relied on the City's failure to promote him to captain to claim discrimination on the basis of race. The City's posited trigger date for this claim is November 24, 2012, the day the 2012 promotional roster was published. That date was not in dispute. Nor was it contested that the 2012 promotional roster served as the basis for making promotion decisions through 2014. All that remains to be determined is whether Jones's claim of discrimination for failure to promote accrued when the 2012 promotional roster was posted or was a continuing violation until the roster's use ended. That is a legal determination. Questions of law are not the proper subject of jury instructions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Eagle Star Group, Inc. v.

Kline and Wedow were retired KCFD Battalion Chiefs. Kline was employed with the KCFD from 1977 to 2006, while Wedow was employed with the KCFD from 1977 to 2001. During her time with the KCFD, Kline assessed more than 700 candidates for management-level fire department promotions. Wedow also possessed significant experience assessing candidates for promotions. Wedow and Kline reviewed the 2012 assessor's manual used in connection with the 2012 SE component of the captain's promotional process and found the materials to be \"very similar\" or \"essentially the same\" as the assessor's manuals they had used during past assessments. Based on this evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Kline and Wedow were qualified to testify as expert witnesses about their SE component assessments of six 2012 captain candidates, including Jones.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The City also argues that the expert witness testimony from Wedow and Kline was not reliable. Testimony is reliable if it is \"based on sufficient facts or data, reliable principles and methods and reliable application thereof.\"\n    <em>\n     Wright\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658262\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/562/311/#p317\">\n     562 S.W.3d at 319\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Wedow and Kline evaluated the SE component videos of six candidates who participated in the 2012 captain's promotional process, including Jones. Before doing so, they reviewed the assessor manuals made available to the KCFD assessors in 2012. Two of the six candidates Wedow and Kline evaluated were African-American. Four of the candidates were Caucasian. Kline and Wedow independently viewed the videos and scored the candidates, using the same benchmark rubric prepared for the actual assessors. They then met to compare and discuss their scores, and to arrive at a consensus score. If their scores were within one point, the scores were averaged to achieve a consensus score. Wedow and Kline's assessments resulted in higher SE component scores for the African-American candidates than those given by the KCFD assessors in 2012, and lower SE component scores for the Caucasian candidates than those given by the\n    KCFD assessors in 2012.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    The assessment process Wedow and Kline used to reach their conclusions was substantially similar to the methodology each had used in hundreds of previous assessments each had conducted. And in general, the assessment process Wedow and Kline used was substantially similar to the methodology used by KCFD assessors when the SE component was scored in 2012.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Recognizing this, the City does not challenge the reliability of the basic methodology used by Wedow and Kline, as to do so would be to effectively undermine the methodology the KCFD assessors used to score captain candidates in 2012. Instead, the City highlights differences between Wedow and Kline's SE component assessments and the SE component assessments conducted by the KCFD in 2012, and argues that these differences rendered the conclusions reached by Wedow and Kline not reliable. Specifically, the City argues that Wedow and Kline's assessments were rendered not reliable because they were conducted by two assessors instead of three; because Wedow and Kline only assessed six candidates, a sample size that was not large enough; because Wedow and Kline averaged scores to reach a consensus instead of simply discussing and reaching a consensus score; and because Wedow and Kline were not trained in advance on the assessment process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    First, the City points out that the SE component was scored in 2012 using three assessors, not two. Yet, the City offers no persuasive argument to explain why this difference rendered the Wedow and Kline assessments unreliable. In fact, the outside contractor who prepared the assessor's manual for use in connection with the 2012 captain's promotional process recommended only that more than one assessor be used to score the SE component.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Next, the City complains that Wedow and Kline used a sample size that was \"too small to establish a case of 'disparate treatment through statistical analysis, at least without the application of some recognized method of statistical validation.' \" [Appellant's Brief p. 44-45]. The City relies on\n    <em>\n     R.T. French Co. v. Springfield Mayor's Comm'n on Human Rights\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9952362\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/650/717/\">\n     650 S.W.2d 717\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Mo. App. S.D. 1983).\n    <em>\n     R.T. French\n    </em>\n    involved a claim of disparate treatment where statistical samples of 3 employees and 14 employees were offered as the only evidence from which discriminatory motive or intent could be inferred.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9952362\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/650/717/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9952362\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/650/717/\">\n     at 723\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Southern District concluded that the samples were \"too small to permit an inference of discriminatory intent.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9952362\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/650/717/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     R.T. French\n    </em>\n    is of no value to the City, as it did not address the admissibility of expert witness testimony, and instead addressed only whether properly admitted statistical evidence constituted competent and substantial evidence of discriminatory intent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    In any event, the City's \"sample size\" argument mischaracterizes Wedow and Kline's expert testimony. Their assessment of a sampling of six candidates actually assessed by the KCFD in 2012 was not offered to establish disparate impact through statistical analysis, and was instead offered to demonstrate that at least as to the six candidates they assessed, all Caucasians candidates were over scored by the KCFD assessors, and both African-American candidates, including Jones, were under scored by the KCFD assessors. The number of candidates assessed by Wedow and Kline is irrelevant to the\n    reliability of the scoring conclusion reached by Wedow and Kline for each assessment conducted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Next, the City argues that Wedow and Kline averaged their scores to reach a consensus instead of negotiating to reach a consensus. However, the City does not explain how or why this effected the reliability of the assessments, particularly given evidence that Wedow and Kline only averaged their scores to reach a consensus when their scores were already within one point of one another.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Finally, the City argues that Wedow and Kline's assessments were not reliable because they did not \"normalize\" or calibrate in advance of their assessments. The only specific concern the City raises, however, is that Wedow and Kline did not watch the training videos that the KCFD assessors watched before conducting SE component assessments in 2012. Wedow and Kline did, however, review the manual prepared for the KCFD assessors in 2012. There is no evidence to permit the conclusion that information in the training videos was materially different from the printed materials reviewed by Wedow and Kline. Moreover, Wedow and Kline testified that they have conducted hundreds of similar assessments in the past. In\n    <em>\n     Wright\n    </em>\n    , the court determined that an expert witness who had conducted more than 450 interviews as a forensic interviewer could reliably offer an opinion in the case based on that experience.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658262\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/562/311/#p317\">\n     562 S.W.3d at 321\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Mo.

Here, Wedow and Kline's lengthy experience lent itself to the reasonable conclusion that each knew how to assess the SE component. As long as an expert's testimony \"rests upon 'good grounds, based on what is known' it should be tested by the adversary process with competing expert testimony and cross-examination, rather than excluded by the court at the outset.\"\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054887\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/557/#p561\">\n     754 F.3d at 562\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    In summary, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the expert witness testimony of Wedow and Kline. The reliability arguments raised by the City do not render the testimony inadmissible pursuant to section 490.065.2. The differences identified by the City between the process used by KCFD assessors in 2012 and the process used by Wedow and Kline are relevant to the persuasiveness of Wedow and Kline's opinions, and thus go to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility. \" [Federal Rules of Evidence] Rule 702 reflects an attempt to liberalize the rules governing the admission of expert testimony.\"\n    <em>\n     Lauzon v.

Specifically, the City argues that Jones \"failed to offer timely, probative facts showing that the City designed, intended, or used its 2012 captain's test to discriminate.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    As noted, \"to make a submissible case, the plaintiff must demonstrate that each and every fact essential to liability is predicated upon legal and substantial evidence.\"\n    <em>\n     Holmes v.

We disagree. The evidence, which we are required to view in the light most favorable to the verdict, established, among other things: that a deputy chief with the KCFD who had previously participated as an assessor believed that African-Americans were routinely under scored in the SE component, and never benefitted from the bartering process used to achieve consensus scores; that Davis, one of the assessors who scored the SE component in 2012, was reputed as being tougher in his assessment of African-American candidates than Caucasian candidates; that although the KCFD's outside contractor emphasized the importance of having minority representation on the SE component assessor panel and Davis was selected as an African-American assessor to fill that role, Davis did not self-identify as an African-American; that despite the fact subjective scoring was inherent to assessment of the SE component and was thus susceptible to explicit or implicit bias, the assessors were not trained to avoid such bias; that the KCFD suffered racial tensions and issues and disproportionately hired African-American employees as compared to the City as a whole; and that two expert witnesses who were former, high-ranking, KCFD employees with substantial assessment experience concluded that six 2012 captain candidates they assessed were over scored by the SE component assessors in 2012 if they were Caucasian, and were under scored by the SE component assessors in 2012 if they were African-American. There was substantial evidence to support the jury's conclusion that Jones was not promoted through the 2012 captain's promotional process because of his race.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The City does not address the aforesaid evidence, and instead cites to federal employment discrimination cases\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    where the evidence presented was deemed insufficient to establish that a testing process used to hire or promote applicants was discriminatory. The City's reliance on these cases is unavailing. Federal employment discrimination case law is only relevant to our application of the MHRA when consistent with the plain language or meaning of the MHRA.\n    <em>\n     Daugherty v.

In\n    <em>\n     Daugherty\n    </em>\n    , our Supreme Court determined that the plain language of the MHRA required use of the \"contributing factor\" test, in lieu of the more demanding substantial, determining, or motivating factor test employed under Title VII.\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8981114\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/231/814/#p818\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8981114\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/231/814/#p818\">\n     at 819\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The City also argues that Jones failed to submit probative evidence that the 2012 captain's promotional process was designed, intended or used to discriminate because of race. The City's argument relies on section 213.055.2, which provides in pertinent part that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n    [N]or shall it be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to give and to act upon the results of any professional developed ability test, provided that such test, its administration, or action upon the results thereof, is not designed, intended or used to discriminate because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry, age or disability.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The City's argument ignores, however, that this statutory exception to the definition of an \"unlawful employment practice\" was submitted to the jury as an affirmative defense through Instruction No. 8, a jury instruction tendered by the City. That instruction required the jury to find in the City's favor if it believed that the 2012 captain's promotional process was a professionally developed ability test that had not been designed, intended or used to discriminate. In entering a verdict for Jones on Instruction No. 7, the jury necessarily rejected the affirmative defense submitted by the City in Instruction No. 8. The same evidence supporting the jury's conclusion that Jones was not promoted through the 2012 captain's promotional process because of his race also supports the jury's rejection of the suggestion that the SE component of the 2012 captain's promotional process was a professionally developed ability test that was neither designed, intended, nor used to discriminate on the basis of race.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The trial court did not err in denying the City's motions for directed verdict and for JNOV.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Point Four is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <strong>\n     Point Five\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    In the City's fifth point on appeal, the City argues that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding opinion testimony from the City's expert witness -- Dr. David Morris (\"Morris\"). We review the trial court's exclusion of expert witness testimony for an abuse of discretion.\n    <em>\n     Mansil\n    </em>\n    , 554 S.W.3d at 475.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Morris is a principal with the outside contractor who worked with the KCFD to develop the 2012 captain's promotional process. Prior to trial, Jones submitted written interrogatories to the City, including an interrogatory that asked the City to identify expert witnesses pursuant to Rule 56.01(b)(4). The City objected to, and did not answer, the expert witness interrogatory because it was interrogatory number 33, and 16th Judicial Circuit Rule 32.2 limits the number of interrogatories that can be propounded without leave of court to 30.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    A few weeks before trial, Jones's counsel communicated with the City's counsel by email to inquire about whether the City would be calling any expert witnesses to testify at trial. The City's counsel advised that the City would not be calling any expert witnesses to testify at trial except \"possibly in rebuttal,\" and specifically represented that Morris would not be testifying as an expert witness and would only be testifying as a fact witness.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    At the beginning of trial, the City disclosed that it intended to call Morris as an expert witness. The trial court granted Jones's request to exclude Morris's expert testimony on the basis of unfair surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    During trial, the City called Morris to testify out of turn during Jones's case in chief. Morris was permitted to testify as a fact witness, but not as an expert witness, though the City asked the trial court to revisit its earlier ruling, and then made an offer of proof to describe the refused expert testimony. The City's offer of proof established that had Morris been permitted to testify as an expert witness, he would have described how the content of the 2012 captain's promotional process had been validated, and he would have presented statistical evidence that African-Americans as a group performed better during the process than Caucasians.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The City argues on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Morris's expert testimony because the City had no obligation to disclose Morris as an expert witness because Jones's interrogatories exceeded the number permitted by\n    local rule, and because Morris's testimony was offered in rebuttal to Jones's expert witness testimony. Neither argument has merit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Rule 56.01(b)(4) allows a party to obtain discovery by interrogatories or by deposition of facts known or opinions held by any persons the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial. Rule 57.01(c)(1) requires a party to respond to interrogatories within thirty days of service. The City violated Rule 56.01(b)(4) and Rule 57.01(c)(1) when it failed to disclose Morris in response to Jones's interrogatory requesting the identity of expert witnesses the City expected to call at trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    We are aware of no authority, and the City cites none, permitting a litigant to ignore the absolute duty to disclose imposed by Rule 56.01(b)(4) merely because an expert witness interrogatory is fortuitously assigned a number beyond the number of interrogatories permitted by local court rule. Although Article V, section 15 of the Missouri constitution, and Rule 50.01, permit each circuit to adopt local court rules, those rules will not be enforced if they are inconsistent with Supreme Court rules, the Constitution, or other statutory laws.\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.

This is not a case where unexpected evidence or developments during trial necessitated a rebuttal witness whose testimony could not otherwise have been reasonably anticipated as necessary to the City's case in chief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Morris's expert witness testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Point Five is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <strong>\n     Pending Motion for Attorneys' Fees\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Prior to submission of this case, Jones filed a motion requesting an award of attorneys' fees incurred on appeal (\"Motion\"). In the Motion, Jones noted that the trial court entered an order on April 4, 2018 authorizing Jones to submit a supplemental request for an award of attorneys' fees incurred in connection with post-trial briefing, though the trial court's order noted that a request for supplemental attorneys' fees would not be ruled on until disposition of any appeal. Jones's Motion thus requests an award of attorneys' fees for the period between the entry of Judgment and the City's filing of this appeal, and for defending this appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Section 213.111.2 authorizes the award of reasonable attorneys' fee to the prevailing party. \"This includes fees incurred on appeal from the trial court's judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     Soto v.

App. W.D. 2016). Because we are affirming the trial court's judgment in favor of Jones, Jones is the prevailing party on appeal. Therefore, his Motion is granted. However, \"[a]lthough appellate courts have authority to allow and fix the amount of attorneys' fees on appeal, we exercise this power with caution, believing in most cases that the trial court is better equipped to hear evidence and argument on this issue and determine the reasonableness of the fee requested.\"\n    <em>\n     Turner v.

App. W.D. 2016). That is particularly true when, as here, the Motion includes a request for a supplemental award of attorneys' fees for post-judgment proceedings that occurred in the trial court. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the trial court to determine a reasonable award for attorneys' fees incurred by Jones on appeal, and in connection with post-judgment proceedings in the trial court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The trial court's Judgment is affirmed.
