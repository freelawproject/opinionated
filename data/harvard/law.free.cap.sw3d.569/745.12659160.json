The parties subsequently notified the Court that they have settled this matter and that \"[n]either party will pursue any further relief in this Court or in any other court.\" Accordingly, we dismiss the motion for rehearing, pursuant to the parties' settlement, but withdraw our opinion and judgment of August 30, 2018, and issue the following opinion and new judgment in their stead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant, Primoris Energy Services Corporation, doing business as Sprint Pipeline Services (\"Sprint\"), challenges the trial court's judgment, entered after a jury trial, in favor of Myers in his suit for negligence. In five issues, Sprint contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of medical expenses, the evidence is factually insufficient to support the jury's proportionate responsibility findings, and the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's negligence finding against Sprint and the damages it awarded to Myers of $2 million for future physical impairment and $500,000 for future pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We affirm, in part, and reverse and remand, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his second amended petition, Myers alleged that Sprint, a pipeline company, secured an easement across his ranch to transport vehicles and equipment to an adjacent property, on which it was constructing a pipeline. Sprint hired Montgomery Trucking Company (\"Montgomery\") to transport equipment for the project. And Montgomery hired Justin Thomas Baggett, despite knowing that he had \"numerous unsafe[ ] traffic violations,\" to drive its truck for Sprint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 26, 2014, Baggett attempted to maneuver an 18-wheeler truck and trailer (\"18 wheeler\") loaded with Sprint's materials through the gate, which was \"entirely too narrow to accommodate the size of the truck,\" to Myers's ranch. Sprint had two \"flagmen employees\" assisting Baggett through the driveway. However, as Baggett reversed the 18-wheeler, he collided into the four-wheeler vehicle (\"four-wheeler\") on which Myers was sitting. As a result, Myers \"suffered a severe four-level cervical disc herniation that impinged on his spinal cord, requiring a four-level fusion surgery of the cervical spine.\" He also \"suffers from severe radiculopathy, neck pain, back pain and related atrophy of the right arm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Myers sued Sprint, Montgomery, and Baggett (the \"defendants\") for negligence. Specifically, in regard to Sprint, Myers alleged that it, \"by and through its agents, representatives, and/or employee spotters,\" failed to \"properly train its spotters, agents, representatives and/or employees\"; \"properly equip its spotters with communication equipment to properly and clearly communicate with\" Baggett; \"properly communicate with the truck driver and ... warn the truck driver concerning [Myers] and his four-wheeler\"; \"warn [Myers] that the truck was intending on backing up to the area where [he] was sitting on his four-wheeler\"; and \"timely build an alternative and safe ingress and egress (driveway) for [Myers's] property after having knowledge of the troublesome and dangerous condition\n   of the existing range gate for the 18-wheelers entering and exiting the property which would have completely avoided this incident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Myers further alleged that the defendants' negligence proximately caused damages for past and future pain and suffering, mental anguish, medical expenses, disfigurement, and physical impairment, as well as past and future economic damages arising from \"costs associated with running his ranch since he is physically unable to do the work required to run a ranch of [its] size as he ha[d] done in the past before his injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sprint filed an answer, generally denying the allegations and asserting that the collision was instead caused by the negligence of Myers or others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At trial, Myers testified that in 2013, he granted BridgeTex Pipeline LLC (\"BridgeTex\") an easement to construct and operate a pipeline along his sixty-six-acre ranch in Montgomery, Texas. Sprint was the contractor in charge of constructing the pipeline, and its only point of access to the easement was through Myers's gravel driveway, which had a narrow gate. Although Myers granted BridgeTex and Sprint access to the driveway, he expressed concern about large trucks using the gate due to its narrowness, the angle of the approach, and the elevation drop. He suggested that they build a separate construction entrance that would better accommodate the vehicles and other equipment, but Sprint and BridgeTex declined to do so. After a truck, on January 8, 2014, hit Myers's gate, pulling the frame over and uprooting the concrete foundation, Sprint agreed to build a separate construction driveway. And, in the meantime, it put \"spotters\" on location to guide trucks through the gate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 26, 2014, Myers drove his four-wheeler to the gate to check on the progress of the construction of the new driveway. While watching a crew working on the fence, he heard some \"yelling\" coming from the gate area. Myers drove his four-wheeler over to determine what had happened, and he saw that another 18-wheeler had struck the gate. He stopped his four-wheeler and picked up his cellular telephone to call the land agent to inform him of what had happened. Myers explained that, at this time, the 18-wheeler was stationary. Because its break lights were on and a spotter was nearby, Myers did not believe that there was any indication that the 18-wheeler would move while he was on his cellular telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While standing on his four-wheeler, Myers turned his back to the 18-wheeler and began to leave a message for the land agent. At that moment, the trailer of the truck struck his four-wheeler. His head snapped back, and he saw a \"flash of white.\" Myers then saw the trailer of the truck continue to move towards him, but it came to a stop before running him over. He got off of his four-wheeler and examined his body, not immediately noticing any apparent injuries. Eventually Myers went inside his home to lay down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As his adrenaline wore off, Myers noticed paralysis around his neck and spine. He also began to experience intense pain. Initially, Myers tried to \"sleep it off,\" but decided to see a doctor several days later when the pain did not subside. After some testing, a doctor diagnosed Myers as suffering from six herniated discs and a compressed spinal cord. To treat these injuries, Myers, in August 2014, had a four-level disc-fusion surgery, in which four of his six herniated discs were removed, his spinal cord was \"un-pinched, and his vertebrae were fused back together. Myers explained that the surgery has helped him, but his overall strength and mobility is still impaired. For example, he cannot lift more\n   than ten pounds of weight with his right arm, and the muscles in it have greatly atrophied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Myers described himself, after having sustained his injuries, as \"feeble.\" And he explained that he can no longer run the equipment on his ranch, continue employment as a body guard, or \"ride [his] daughter on his shoulders\" as he was able to do before the collision. Consequently, his property is deteriorating because he cannot maintain it as he did previously. Before the collision, he maintained the ranch by clearing and mowing the lawns and pastures, repairing fences, and servicing the vehicles and other heavy equipment. After the collision, although Myers is able to use a riding lawn mower, he cannot operate the heavy equipment needed to cut, rake, bale, haul, and stack hay. And he cannot perform most of the other regular work around the ranch. However, Myers is still able to drive a vehicle and operate a gun range on his property. And he does not need any nursing or other personal care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Nilesh Kotecha, a board-certified neurosurgeon, testified that he performed Myers's four-level fusion surgery. After physically examining Myers and reviewing his MRI, Kotecha diagnosed him as suffering from \"multilevel cervical disc herniations and ... [a] spinal cord compression.\" He also noted that Myers's MRI revealed some pre-existing, chronic degeneration in his neck. But Kotecha ultimately determined that the severe, acute injuries were caused by the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In August 2014, Dr. Kotecha performed a four-level fusion surgery on Myers's cervical spine, which involved removing four of his herniated discs, un-pinching his spinal cord, and then fusing his vertebrae back together with spacers and bone taken from his sternum. He explained that he left two of Myers's herniated discs untreated because a five-level fusion is considerably more extensive and those discs were not compressing Myers's spinal cord. He further explained that although the surgery was successful, Myers will experience limitation in his range of motion, will not be able to bend and twist his neck \"as much as he would otherwise,\" and should not lift more than 20 to 30 pounds. And while Myers's muscle atrophy could improve with therapy, any atrophy resulting from permanent nerve damage will not improve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dr. Kotecha further testified that Myers, at his follow-up visit in February 2015, did not require any prescription pain medicine. Moreover, his surgical wound had healed nicely, and he had \"good\" range of motion of his cervical spine. In regard to Myers's medical expenses, Kotecha explained that the surgery he performed on Myers was medically necessary and the bills from the surgery were \"reasonable and customary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   James Evans, an accident reconstructionist, testified that he took statements from the witnesses to the collision, gathered data from the scene, and inspected the vehicles to determine the facts surrounding the collision in this case. He has reconstructed many collisions involving tractor-trailers, such as the 18-wheeler in the collision in the instant case, and has significant experience with all-terrain vehicles like the one Myers was on at the time of the collision. Evans explained that there is ample evidence available to reconstruct the collision in this case, including: a photograph that Myers took of the 18-wheeler after it hit his gate, photographs from after the collision that show tire marks and damage to the vehicles, and information regarding the dimensions of and damage to the vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Evans input the data that he had collected into a computer-aided drafting program\n   to draw the scene to scale and reconstruct the collision. He opined that Baggett reversed without first exiting the 18-wheeler to check his surroundings and that Sprint's spotters did not do their job to warn Baggett of any hazards obstructing his path. Evans further opined that Myers was in \"small part\" to blame for the collision. However, he attributed primary fault to Baggett and Sprint's spotters. Specifically, Evans explained that spotters are placed on site to assist a driver when he does not have full visibility and to warn others in the area to avoid collisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Darrell Hurst, a ranch-hand expert who manages a 250-acre ranch in Navasota, Texas, testified that Myers's fences, pastures, creek, equipment, cattle, and pecan trees require daily maintenance. Thus, Myers would need to hire someone who knows how to build and maintain fences, care for cattle, perform mechanical work and carpentry, and maintain river banks, barns, and trees. This type of work requires heavy lifting and operation of heavy machinery, in excess of 30 pounds. In Hurst's opinion, to maintain his ranch, Myers would need to hire someone to work on it six days per week for eight hours per day. He further opined that a reasonable hourly rate for this type of labor is $20 per hour. Hurst explained that when he toured Myers's ranch, it was in a state of \"disarray.\" The pastures and fences had not been maintained, and the creek bed had overflowed and damaged a portion of the barbed-wire fencing that contains Myers's cattle. However, Hurst acknowledged that he was not aware of the condition of Myers's ranch prior to the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Baggett testified that he was employed by Montgomery and drove the 18-wheeler that hit Myers on January 26, 2014. He explained that there were two spotters from Sprint assisting him that day: one spotter was stationed outside of Baggett's window and a second one, whom Baggett could not see, was stationed behind the trailer of the 18-wheeler. The spotter stationed outside of his window told Baggett that \"he could see everything back there.\" That same spotter is the person who told him to stop the 18-wheeler because he had \"rubbed the gate.\" After he was told that he had hit the gate, Baggett kept his foot on the brake without moving the 18-wheeler for one to two minutes. He drove off only after the spotter told him that he was \"clear.\" Baggett further explained that the 18-wheeler did not make any \"beeping\" sound or other noise when it reversed. He had to rely on the spotters, who were not using flags or noisemakers, to guide him. And no one informed him that the trailer had hit Myers until he received a telephone call approximately 30 minutes later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Diana M. Dooley testified by deposition that, in 2014, she was the Director of the Business Office for Spring Central Hospital, where Myers had his surgery. She is familiar with the billing practices of that facility and also has an extensive background in hospital billing. Dooley explained that, for his four-level fusion surgery, Myers was charged $201,570.54. She then opined that those charges were reasonable for the type of surgery performed on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   James S. Bryan, a safety professional for Sprint at the time of the collision, testified by deposition that Sprint does not require their spotters to undergo any special training because it is a \"common sense task.\" And he noted that Myers declined medical attention immediately following the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Cecil Wyatt, a pipeline inspector who was working on Myers's property at the time of the collision, testified by deposition that on the day of the collision, he heard a \"commotion\" and went over to the gate. When he arrived, he saw Myers sitting on\n   his four-wheeler with the bumper of the truck \"up against\" it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Dr. Jerry Bob Blacklock, a board-certified neurosurgeon, testified that, in his opinion, the necessity of Myers's four-level fusion surgery did not arise from the January 2014 collision. Instead, he opined that Myers would have needed the surgery at some point in the future, regardless of the collision because he suffered from arthritic degenerations, i.e., \"bone spurs\" that press on the spinal cord and are not caused by a traumatic injury. From Blacklock's review of Myers's imaging tests, he concluded that Myers did not have any herniated discs in his cervical spine. And he opined that Myers's initial motor and neurologic exams were inconsistent with an individual who had experienced a recent spinal cord injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dr. Blacklock further testified that he is familiar with the costs associated with a four-level fusion surgery and the charges associated with Myers's surgery were not reasonable. First, he reviewed a bill from L2 Surgical regarding the hardware that was put into Myers's spine for $33,195. Blacklock opined that this amount was unreasonable and the hardware should have cost between $3,000 and $5,000, at a maximum. Next, he reviewed a bill from Spring Central Hospital, where Myers had his surgery, in the amount of $201,570.54. Blacklock opined that this bill was also unreasonable and the cost for a four-level fusion surgery should have been $40,000, at a maximum. He then reviewed a bill from Dr. Kotecha, the surgeon who performed Myers's surgery, for $68,587.09. Blacklock opined that this charge was also not reasonable and should have cost no more than $3,000 to $16,000. Finally, he reviewed a bill from Sentry Neuromonitoring, LLC for the monitors used during Myers's surgery for $6,075.00. And Blacklock opined that this amount was approximately three times what he would expect to be charged for that type of equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Richard Baratta, Ph. D., a biomedical engineering expert, testified that, from his review of the evidence in this case, the 18-wheeler could not have struck Myers at a speed of greater than three miles per hour. And he explained that a contact speed of three miles per hour or less was insufficient to herniate discs in a cervical spine unless there were pre-existing injuries present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The jury found that the negligence of Sprint, Baggett, and Myers proximately caused Myers's injuries. It attributed sixty-four percent of the liability to Sprint, thirty-five percent to Baggett, and one percent to Myers. And the jury awarded Myers damages in the amount of $315,000 for past medical expenses, $15,000 for past physical pain, $500,000 for future physical pain, $50,000 for future mental anguish,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   $75,000 for past physical impairment, and $2,000,000 for future physical impairment. The trial court entered judgment on the verdict against Sprint and Montgomery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sprint filed post-trial motions for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, to modify the verdict, and for a new trial, which were all denied. Montgomery paid its portion of the judgment, and Sprint appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In its first, second, and fourth issues, Sprint contends that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's negligence finding against Sprint\n   and its damages award to Myers of $2 million for future physical impairment and $500,000 for future pain. In its fifth issue, Sprint argues that the evidence is factually insufficient to support the jury's proportionate-responsibility findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We will sustain a legal-sufficiency, or \"no-evidence,\" challenge if the record shows one of the following: (1) a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) rules of law or evidence bar the court from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a scintilla; or (4) the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of the vital fact.\n   <em>\n    City of Keller v.

After Baggett hit\n   the gate, he did not move for approximately one to two minutes, during which time Myers drove up on his four-wheeler. At this time, Myers took a photograph of the trailer's contact with the gate. And the second spotter is visible in this photograph, standing behind the 18-wheeler, but in front of Myers. At some point, before the spotter who could \"see everything\" gave Baggett the \"all-clear\" to drive off, the trailer of the 18-wheeler struck Myers.

Moreover, the jury heard testimony from Myers and Dr. Kotecha of muscle atrophy in Myers's right arm due to nerve damage from the injury.

Further, while Myers did not need any prescription pain medications at his last follow-up visit with Kotecha, his lifting of anything heavier than 20-30 pounds or any repetitive bending, twisting, or lifting motions, which would be normal actions for someone living on a ranch or with a young child, could subject him to further injury.
