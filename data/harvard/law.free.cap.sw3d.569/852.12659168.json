RODRIGUEZ, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Hugo Bustamante Jr. appeals the trial court's granting of Appellees' motion for summary judgment upon their plea to the jurisdiction and traditional motion for summary judgment. In four issues, Bustamante contends: (1) the trial court erred in concluding the legal malpractice claim was property of the bankruptcy estate because the claim accrued after conversion to Chapter 7; (2) even if the malpractice claim was property of the bankruptcy estate, the claim was orally disclosed at a hearing on the Chapter 7 case and was subsequently abandoned when the Chapter 7 trustee filed a report of no distribution; (3) the Appellees should be equitably estopped from using a judicial estoppel defense to the claims brought by Bustamante; and (4) Bustamante had standing to bring suit, either as a representative of the debtor corporation or individually on his own behalf. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hugo Bustamante Jr. was the sole shareholder and president of a closely-held corporation, Carlube, Inc. Carlube began experiencing financial difficulties, and Bustamante hired Miranda &amp; Maldonado, P.C. to represent Carlube in a Chapter 11 reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code. In his capacity as president of the corporation, Bustamante signed an engagement contract for legal services on behalf of Carlube and the Law Firm filed the Chapter 11 proceeding in June 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2013, the U.S. Trustee filed a motion to convert Carlube's bankruptcy case from a Chapter 11 reorganization to a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding. The court heard the motion approximately a week later. At the hearing, the U.S. Trustee stated he was moving for conversion for three reasons: first, Carlube had not been approved to continue to use cash collateral and therefore could not operate its business; second, Carlube had essentially broken even over the six months prior to the motion and therefore a workable reorganization plan was unlikely; and third, Carlube had not filed a reorganization plan in over six months. Counsel for Carlube, Gabriel Perez, urged the court to give his client one last opportunity at reorganization, asserting an adequate plan was possible and requesting Carlube receive a thirty-day approval to use cash collateral. The court opined that based on its review of the financial statements covering the preceding six months, the business was not making a profit and was still incurring new debt and it was therefore not capable of reorganization. It granted the motion to convert the case to Chapter 7 and denied Carlube's motion to use cash collateral. Now proceeding under Chapter 7, a hearing was held in April 2013 on a motion to show cause because Carlube had continued to operate and pay expenses despite the conversion to Chapter 7. The Chapter 7 Trustee did not attend the hearing, but a representative of the U.S. Trustee's office was present. The U.S. Trustee's representative, however, stated that his office was not taking any position in the case and he was there \"just to listen.\" At this hearing, counsel for Carlube stated on the record that Bustamante had told him he intended to sue him for malpractice for the conversion of the case to Chapter 7. He also noted his firm had filed an application to withdraw as counsel for Carlube. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court ordered Bustamante to discontinue operations that would result in depletion of the bankruptcy estate. The Law Firm was allowed to withdraw as counsel, and Carlube was thereafter listed as a pro se debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August 2013, the Chapter 7 Trustee filed a report of no distribution, indicating he had terminated his efforts to liquidate assets, that no funds were available for distribution to creditors, and that he had no objection to closing the case. The Chapter 7 case was closed the following month. Carlube involuntarily forfeited existence of its corporate charter in January of the following year due to failure to pay franchise taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bustamante sued Carlube's former attorneys for malpractice, asserting causes of action for professional negligence, negligent misrepresentations, breach of fiduciary duty, and gross negligence. In part, Bustamante claimed the Law Firm failed to timely extend the deadline on the cash collateral order and allowed it to expire, which resulted in a creditor moving to lift the bankruptcy stay. He also asserted the Law Firm had assured him it would file a reorganization plan within three and one-half months of filing the Chapter 11 petition but never did, which he claimed resulted in the conversion of the case to Chapter 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Law Firm filed a plea to the jurisdiction and motion for summary judgment, asserting Bustamante lacked standing because the legal malpractice claim was the property of Carlube's bankruptcy estate, thus giving the Chapter 7 Trustee exclusive standing to bring the claim. The Law Firm also asserted Bustamante had no standing to pursue the claim either individually or as a representative of Carlube. The trial court sustained the Law Firm's plea to the jurisdiction, granted the motion for summary judgment, and dismissed all of Bustamante's claims. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Accrual of the Malpractice Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his first issue, Bustamante contends the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment because his legal malpractice claim accrued only after the case converted to Chapter 7. He contends that because the only legal harm was the conversion, no right to sue existed until after the case was converted. Because a Chapter 7 estate incorporates only the property of the debtor existing at the time of the conversion, the claim could not be part of the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a trial court's granting of a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Merriman v.

Thus, there was no issue with allowing the plaintiffs to pursue their personal injury claim because the claims had revested in the debtors when the plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court.

He asserts that after having informed them of his intent to sue, the Law Firm intentionally left the lawsuit off of the amended bankruptcy schedules and should not now benefit from their malfeasance. While such an allegation could be relevant in equity, the Law Firm never raised a judicial estoppel defense in its plea to the jurisdiction or motion for summary judgment. Instead, the Law Firm asserted Bustamante lacked standing to assert a claim because the Chapter 7 Trustee had exclusive standing and this fact deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over Bustamante's claims. As already noted, subject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred by estoppel, and to the extent Bustamante is arguing the Law Firm should be equitably estopped from raising it, his contention is overruled.\n   <em>\n    Tourneau Houston, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11248287\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/24/907/#p910\">\n    24 S.W.3d at 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Alternatively, if Bustamante is requesting we rule the Law Firm is equitably estopped from raising a judicial estoppel defense in the future, his contention is premature. While judicial estoppel could be raised to estop a plaintiff from pursuing a claim he intentionally left off his bankruptcy schedules, the Law Firm did not raise it as a defense.\n   <em>\n    Cleaver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9215029\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/140/771/#p774\">\n    140 S.W.3d at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because we have already determined the Chapter 7 Trustee has exclusive standing to bring the malpractice claim against the Law Firm, we need not address Bustamante's contentions that he has representative or derivative standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.R.APP.P. 47.1.
