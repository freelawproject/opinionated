State\n   </em>\n   , No. 06-17-00177-CR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202976138\">\n    2018 WL 2976138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Tex. App.-Texarkana June 14, 2018). I have no quarrel with the court of appeals's reliance on the fact that Appellant agreed to reset his case, but I cannot agree with its conclusion that the delay on the part of the State was due to simple negligence given the record in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant was arrested in November 2015, and his DNA sample was taken on February 26, 2016. He was indicted just over a week later. On November 22, 2016, a year after Appellant was arrested and about nine months after the DNA sample was taken, the State announced it was \"not ready\" for trial because the Hunt County Sheriff's Office had still not submitted the DNA sample for testing. According to a prosecutor, \"even though [the district attorney's office] ... repeatedly requested that [Appellant's] sample be sent for testing, the [Hunt County Sheriff's Office] claimed 'they got busy' and had not completed the task.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The DNA sample was finally submitted for testing on December 5, 2016, which was 283 days after it was taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Despite the \"round the clock\" duties of law enforcement, surely the Hunt County Sheriff's Office could have found time to submit a single DNA sample for testing sooner than 283 days after it was taken. Unfortunately, the record was not developed on this point (although it could have been).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without additional information from the prosecution or the police to justify such an extraordinary delay in submitting a DNA sample for testing, I cannot agree with the court of appeals's presumption that the delay was attributable to simple negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ADMISSIBILITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I also note that it is in the State's best interest to submit DNA samples for testing and to comply with discovery requests for the testing as promptly as possible to avoid exclusion of the evidence by the trial court. Some courts have done just that.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Sanavongxay\n   </em>\n   , Appellee was charged with committing an aggravated robbery on December 8, 2008. According to documentation from the prosecutor,\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Barker\n    </em>\n    , the United States Supreme Court said that,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    A deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense should be weighted heavily against the government. A more neutral reason such as\n    <em>\n     negligence\n    </em>\n    or overcrowded courts should be weighted less heavily but nevertheless should be considered since the ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government rather than with the defendant.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <em>\n     Barker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n     407 U.S. at 531\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n     92 S.Ct. 2182\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added) (footnote removed).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     State v.

There followed another call on October 28, an e-mail on November 10, and calls on November 17 and 20 and December 4. The prosecutor called the detective again on December 8, and apparently still getting no response, called his sergeant the same day.
