TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 141.004. The court here approved the transfer but did so in two different orders, creating a dispute between the parties over which order should control. One of the parties moved to compel arbitration of this dispute and others under an arbitration provision included in their transfer agreement. The trial court denied the motion, and the court of appeals affirmed, concluding that the dispute over which order controlled was not an arbitrable issue despite the existence of an arbitration agreement that assigned issues of arbitrability to the arbitrator.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657889\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/559/169/#p175\">\n    559 S.W.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2016) (mem. op.). Because the parties agreed to have the arbitrator decide issues of arbitrability, we conclude that the court of\n   appeals erred in determining that the dispute here was one that could not be arbitrated. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment and remand the case to the trial court with instructions to grant the motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Rickey Newsome settled a personal injury suit several decades ago and has since received structured settlement payments from Allstate Insurance Company. RSL Funding and its related entities offer lump-sum payments to purchase structured-settlement agreements from recipients like Newsome. Newsome assigned 120 monthly payments of varying amounts to RSL in exchange for a payment of $53,000. Their contract included a mandatory arbitration clause that identified the Federal Arbitration Act as the controlling law. The clause delegates to an arbitrator not only contractual disputes but also whether a dispute is arbitrable. The relevant part reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Disputes under this Agreement of any nature whatsoever ... shall be resolved through demand by any interested party to arbitrate the dispute.... The parties hereto agree that the issue of arbitrability shall likewise be decided by the arbitrator, and not by any other person. That is, the question of whether a dispute itself is subject to arbitration shall be decided solely by the arbitrator and not, for example by any court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under the Structured Settlement Protection Act, a court must approve a transfer of structured-settlement payments before the transfer is effective. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 141.004. The court that approves the transfer is the court of original jurisdiction that authorized the settlement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657889\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/559/169/#p175\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 141.002(2)(A). But if the original court no longer has jurisdiction, approval must be sought from a district court or other designated court in the payee's county.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657889\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/559/169/#p175\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 141.002(2)(B). Because the original court signed the judgment on the structured settlement decades before this transfer, it no longer retained jurisdiction, and so RSL petitioned a district court in Newsome's resident county to approve the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court signed an order approving the transfer that included the requisite statutory findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657889\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/559/169/#p175\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 141.004 (stating the \"express findings\" the court must make to approve the transfer). The order, however, included an additional requirement in a handwritten note by the judge that provided: \"Transferee to pay Mr. Newsome the sum of $53,000 in 10 days from this order being signed or transferee will be required to pay Mr. Newsome $106,000.\" The transferee did not pay the $53,000 within the allotted ten days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Seven months later, Newsome wrote a letter to the judge complaining that he had not been paid. The district court responded by ordering the parties to mediation, which resulted in an agreed motion to remove the ten-day payment penalty from the order approving the transfer. The court granted the motion and issued a corrected order nunc pro tunc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After several more months passed without payment, Newsome filed a new pleading in the district court, titled \"Original Petition for Bill of Review and Application for Injunctive Relief.\" This pleading attacked both the original and nunc pro tunc approval orders. Newsome argued the nunc pro tunc order was void because it corrected a judicial error after the expiration of the court's plenary power. He further asserted that the court's original transfer order therefore remained in full force and effect and subject to enforcement. But Newsome also asked the district court, in the alternative, to vacate the original\n   approval order, although he did not assert a basis for doing so or specifically request that relief in the bill of review's prayer. A subsequent motion for summary judgment elaborated on the basis for Newsome's alternative request, asserting that the original transfer order should be vacated because RSL had not complied with it. RSL responded that it had not yet paid Newsome because of his refusal to accept the agreed purchase price of $53,000 and his failure to cooperate in transferring the settlement payments to RSL. RSL moved to compel arbitration of the dispute under the parties' contract, while Newsome pursued his motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court granted Newsome's summary judgment motion in part, declaring the nunc pro tunc order void, but the court did not decide whether the original transfer order should also be set aside. Instead, the court reserved judgment on Newsome's alternative claim for future proceedings. The court also denied RSL's motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   RSL took an interlocutory appeal from the district court's order denying arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 51.016 (authorizing interlocutory appeal). In a divided decision, the court of appeals affirmed the district court's order, reasoning that Newsome's bill of review, which challenged the approval orders' validity, offered \"nothing for an arbitrator to determine\" because approval of such transfers under the Structured Settlement Protection Act was a \"purely judicial function.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657889\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/559/169/#p175\">\n    559 S.W.3d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A dissenting justice disagreed, arguing that the parties had agreed to arbitrate all matters raised in Newsome's bill of review, including whether the nunc pro tunc order was effective and whether the penalty added by the trial court properly altered the parties' transfer agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657889\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/559/169/#p175\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657889\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/559/169/#p175\">\n    at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Schenck, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   RSL petitioned this Court to review the order denying arbitration, and we granted its petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that there are three types of disagreements in the arbitration context: (1) the merits of the dispute; (2) whether the merits are arbitrable; and (3) who decides the second question.\n   <em>\n    First Options of Chi., Inc. v.

Newsome does not challenge the validity or effect of the arbitration clause itself. He contends that the arbitration clause is inapplicable here because this dispute must be decided by a court due to the bill of review and Structured Settlement Protection Act context. He also submits that under the Structured Settlement Protection Act no binding agreement (including an arbitration provision therein) exists until a court resolves\n   the present dispute regarding the validity of the approving court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The dispute thus presents two legal questions for us to decide. First, does an arbitral delegation clause in a court-approved structured settlement transfer agreement apply when the validity of the approving court order is at issue? The court of appeals held it does not.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657889\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/559/169/#p175\">\n    559 S.W.3d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, does a dispute about the validity of approving court orders under the Structured Settlement Protection Act affect the existence of an enforceable arbitration agreement? The court of appeals did not answer this question. Our review of these legal determinations is, of course, de novo.\n   <em>\n    Forest Oil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8192561\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/268/51/#p61\">\n    268 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   55 &amp; n.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We first consider the court of appeals' conclusion and Newsome's arguments that the case should not be sent to arbitration because of its unique circumstances-a bill of review attacking approving court orders under the Structured Settlement Protection Act.

But as with the mechanic's lien in\n   <em>\n    CVN Group\n   </em>\n   , we find no inconsistency here between the statute's requirement that courts approve structured-settlement transfers and the arbitration of issues related to that approved transfer.

We thus cannot decide here whether a transfer agreement lacking court approval under section 141.004 is void on public policy grounds or unenforceable for any other reason that does not go to contract formation because the doctrine of separability reserves such decisions for the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Newsome, however, also argues that section 141.004 of the Structured Settlement Protection Act creates a condition precedent to contract formation. That indeed was the holding of a court of appeals in another case Newsome cites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rapid Settlements\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8462484\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/202/456/#p461\">\n    202 S.W.3d at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Assuming that holding to be correct, a court would have an opportunity to decide at the outset whether a valid court order approved a structured-settlement-transfer agreement because the existence of the court order goes to contract formation, which the court decides before compelling arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan Stanley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299373\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/293/182/#p187\">\n    293 S.W.3d at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whether we may decide in this appeal if court approval is an issue of the underlying contract's formation depends on whether Newsome properly raised that issue below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The primary thrust of Newsome's bill of review was for the trial court to declare the nunc pro tunc order void so Newsome could enforce the original approval order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because Newsome's bill of review pleads that the approval order is valid and created an enforceable contract, the possible voidness of the nunc pro tunc order does not affect the existence of the agreement to arbitrate. The contract containing the agreement to arbitrate exists even if a question exists about whether the nunc pro tunc order corrected only a clerical error. Newsome seeks to enforce a contract approved by a court that contains an arbitration agreement and thereby concedes the existence of the agreement to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   But Newsome's bill of review contains an \"alternative\" allegation that both the nunc pro tunc order and the original approval order are void, and Newsome mentions that possibility again in his appellate briefing without explanation. In fact, Newsome has no theory to support his conclusory attack on the original order. He did not even raise the issue in his trial court brief opposing RSL's motion to compel arbitration. Indeed, Newsome's petition for bill of review barely mentions the possibility, and his briefing in this Court is no better. A brief must provide citations or argument and analysis for the contentions and failure to do this can result in waiver. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i), 38.2(a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Ross v. St. Luke's Episcopal Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6864473\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/462/496/#p500\">\n    462 S.W.3d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 500 (Tex. 2015). Newsome has failed to present any theory, analysis, or authority that puts the validity of the original approval order and thus formation of the contract to arbitrate in issue, and we conclude that the doctrine of separability reserves to the arbitrator all other questions raised in the district court. The court of appeals therefore erred in affirming the trial court's order denying arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Having found the court of appeals erred and no merit in Newsome's alternative grounds to affirm, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment and remand the case to the trial court with instructions to grant the motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The Fifth, Sixth and Federal Circuits apply the exception.
