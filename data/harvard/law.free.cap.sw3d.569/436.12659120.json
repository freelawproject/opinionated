ARDINI, JR., JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This appeal involves the validity of a real estate foreclosure sale. The Wesleys, plaintiffs below, appeal judgments entered by the Circuit Court of Jackson County granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\") and Kozeny &amp; McCubbin, L.C. (\"K&amp;M\"). Wells Fargo cross-appeals the denial of its request for attorneys' fees. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 21, 2004, Kenneth Wesley (\"Kenneth\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   borrowed $58,500 from Wells Fargo to purchase property located at 5417 Brooklyn Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri (\"the Property\"). Kenneth executed a promissory note (\"the Note\") in favor of Wells Fargo, and he and his wife, Quantessal, executed a Deed of Trust. The Deed of Trust named Alan South as Trustee and allowed Wells Fargo to remove the Trustee and appoint a Successor Trustee by recorded instrument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 4, 2005, Kenneth entered into a Loan Modification Agreement with Wells Fargo, with the first payment due\n   on January 1, 2006. In July 2006, Wells Fargo sent Kenneth a demand letter after he had failed to make several payments on the Note. On August 21, 2006, Kenneth was notified that he was in default, that he owed $61,398.11, and that all payments under the Note were \"accelerated and declared immediately due and payable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In an Appointment of Successor Trustee dated August 9, 2006, Wells Fargo removed Alan South as Trustee and appointed K&amp;M-a Missouri limited liability company-as Successor Trustee. The Appointment of Successor Trustee was recorded in the Jackson County Recorder's Office on September 6, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A foreclosure sale was held on September 22, 2006. K&amp;M provided notice of the sale to the Wesleys, however they did not attend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Andrea Fogarty (\"Fogarty\"), a K&amp;M employee trained as a sales crier, appeared at the foreclosure sale. She publicly announced that she was crying the sale on behalf of K&amp;M, Successor Trustee. She followed the written instructions and information provided by K&amp;M for crying the Wesleys' foreclosure sale. Wells Fargo made a partial credit bid of approximately $49,000, and the Property was sold to Wells Fargo as the highest and best bidder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 22, 2006, K&amp;M issued a Successor Trustee's Deed stating that K&amp;M had sold the Property to Wells Fargo at the foreclosure sale. The Successor Trustee's Deed was recorded in the Jackson County Recorder's Office on September 26, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Almost ten years later, on September 16, 2016, the Wesleys filed a single-count Petition against Wells Fargo, K&amp;M, and Spruce St. Matthew Baptist Church (\"the Church\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was subsequently replaced by a First Amended Petition. The Wesleys sought a judgment declaring that no valid foreclosure sale took place, that the Successor Trustee's Deed was void, and that Kenneth was the legal owner of the Property. The Wesleys alleged that the foreclosure sale and resulting Successor Trustee's Deed were void because the sale was not conducted by a member or manager of K&amp;M. Wells Fargo and K&amp;M answered by denying the allegations. Wells Fargo additionally filed a three-count counterclaim for Action on the Note (Count I), Declaratory Judgment (Count II), and Equitable Lien (Count III).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Wesleys, Wells Fargo, and K&amp;M filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 8, 2017, the trial court granted the motions for summary judgment filed by Wells Fargo and K&amp;M. The trial court concluded that the foreclosure sale was valid because K&amp;M called the foreclosure sale through its duly appointed agent and employee, and the presence of a member or manager of K&amp;M was not required to validate the sale. The trial court additionally found that K&amp;M was not a proper party to the action because the Deed of Trust did not vest title in K&amp;M, and the record failed to establish that K&amp;M had any interest in the property. The trial court entered separate judgments,\n   one in favor of Wells Fargo and one in favor of K&amp;M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 12, 2017, the trial court issued an order denying the Wesleys' Motion for Summary Judgment to Set Aside Successor Trustee Deed and Declare Sale Void. The trial court found the Wesleys failed to establish they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and it repeated the conclusions of law it had made in the judgments entered in favor of Wells Fargo and K&amp;M. On December 14, 2017, Wells Fargo voluntarily dismissed its counterclaims without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wells Fargo filed a Motion to Amend the Court's Judgment for the Limited Purpose of Expressly Awarding Wells Fargo's Attorneys' Fees or, in the Alternative, Motion for Attorneys' Fees (\"Motion for Attorneys' Fees\"). Wells Fargo sought $43,340.08 in attorneys' fees and $3,766.12 in costs for defending this action, arguing they were entitled to those fees and costs under the Deed of Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 16, 2018, the Wesleys filed their notice of appeal. On January 22, 2018, Wells Fargo filed a notice of cross-appeal with respect to its Motion for Attorneys' Fees. On February 27, 2018, the trial court denied Wells Fargo's Motion for Attorneys' Fees based on the statute of limitations as well as other grounds contained in the Wesleys' opposition to the motion. Wells Fargo filed an amended notice of cross-appeal on March 13, 2018, and the appeals were consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Additional facts are set forth throughout the opinion as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before addressing the merits of the appeals, we must determine our jurisdiction.

The Wesleys raised several objections to Wells Fargo's motion: (1) enforcement of any provision of the Deed of Trust was barred by the statute of limitations; (2) Quantessal was not obligated to pay any sums secured by the Deed of Trust, including any attorneys' fees, because she did not sign the Note and was not an owner of the Property; (3) Wells Fargo's attempt to seek attorneys' fees from Quantessal violated Revised Regulation B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act; (4) portions of the attorneys' fees and costs claimed by Wells Fargo were related to Wells Fargo's counter-claims, which Wells Fargo voluntarily dismissed; (5) the amount of attorneys' fees claimed was not reasonable; and (6) the Wesleys' cause of action did not jeopardize Wells Fargo's interests in the Property, rendering the Deed of Trust provisions pertaining to attorneys' fees inapplicable in this case. The trial court denied Wells Fargo's motion based on the arguments raised by the Wesleys in their opposition, including a finding that enforcement of the provisions for attorneys' fees in the Deed of Trust was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Wells Fargo raises a single point on appeal challenging the trial court's ruling.

The Point Relied On fails to reference \"the legal reasons for the claim of error\" or \"explain in summary fashion why, in the context of the case, those legal reasons support the claim of error.\" For example, the trial court discussed extensively in its order denying Wells Fargo's motion that the statute of limitations barred enforcement of the cost-shifting provision in the Deed of Trust.
