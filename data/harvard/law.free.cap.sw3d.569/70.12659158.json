BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts Giving Rise to this Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is a middle-aged man who enjoyed success in his career as a dancer. He grew up in the small town of Caruthersville, Missouri but eventually moved to Europe to further his career as a performer, choreographer, and dance instructor. At around the age of fifty, Plaintiff began experiencing pain and other symptoms of arthritis in his hip. In 2009, Plaintiff underwent a right hip resurfacing surgery, in which metal components were installed in his right hip. In 2012, Plaintiff's right hip pain recurred. Also around that time, Plaintiff was notified the metal components installed during his 2009 surgery had been recalled and that he would have to undergo another surgery to revise the prior one. Plaintiff then returned to Missouri for a right hip replacement surgery, which was performed by Dr. Ryan Nunley at Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri in January 2013. During this surgery, Smith &amp; Nephew, Inc. (\"Smith &amp; Nephew\") hip replacement components were installed into Plaintiff's right hip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A few months after the January 2013 surgery, Plaintiff started to experience pain in his left groin area. Plaintiff reported to Dr. Patrick Knight, an orthopedic surgeon and one of the owners of Defendant AOS, who then referred Plaintiff to the care of Defendant AOS's new surgeon, Dr. Redjal. Dr. Redjal performed a successful total hip replacement surgery on Plaintiff's left hip in November 2013. Plaintiff felt great immediately after this surgery, he participated in physical therapy while he was still in the hospital, and he was able to walk on crutches at the time he was discharged from the hospital. On his way to a postoperative follow-up appointment with Dr. Redjal on November 21, 2013, Plaintiff stopped at a McDonald's restaurant where he slipped on a wet floor and fell against a wall. Thereafter, Dr. Redjal referred Plaintiff to Dr. Jimmy Bowen, a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician who worked for Defendant AOS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Bowen diagnosed Plaintiff with osteitis pubis, a condition causing groin pain that can be treated successfully without surgery. By March 2014, Plaintiff was doing well on the right hip but was still suffering from persistent but improving groin pain on the right side. Dr. Bowen referred Plaintiff back to Dr. Redjal to explore whether there was a problem with the right hip implant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 16, 2014, Dr. Redjal performed what he testified was an \"exploratory\" surgery on Plaintiff's right hip at Saint Francis Medical Center in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. However, Dr. Redjal said prior to the surgery he actually intended to replace the polyethylene liner from Plaintiff's acetabular component. During surgery, Dr. Redjal employed a power corkscrew device to remove the polyethylene liner from the acetabular cup, which was not the recommended technique to perform this task. After the liner was removed, Dr. Redjal could not get a new one to lock into the cup. Therefore, Dr. Redjal was forced to remove the entire acetabular component from Plaintiff's right hip and install a new one. During this process, Dr. Redjal removed a substantial amount of\n   attached pelvic bone and fractured Plaintiff's pelvis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff was not informed of the pelvic fracture prior to his discharge from the hospital. In the months following his surgery, Plaintiff was ordered to bear weight on his right leg and to undergo physical therapy with Dr. Bowen. Plaintiff had significant difficulty with his postoperative instructions because he was experiencing pain, clicking, and loosening of the right hip implant while standing or walking. Finally, on October 23, 2014, Plaintiff made Dr. Redjal feel the hip implant move inside his body; thereafter, Dr. Redjal ordered a CT scan. This scan revealed Plaintiff's acetabular component was dislocated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Redjal was subsequently discharged from his employment with Defendant AOS. Plaintiff had an appointment with Dr. Knight on December 23, 2014 during which Dr. Knight informed Plaintiff there was a problem with his April 16, 2014 surgery and Plaintiff's right leg was not attached. Dr. Knight then referred Plaintiff to the care of Dr. Douglas McDonald, who saw Plaintiff on February 11, 2015. At that time, Dr. McDonald determined Plaintiff's acetabular component was malpositioned and not fixed in bone. Dr. McDonald performed a subsequent surgery to repair Plaintiff's right hip, but it was unsuccessful. As of the time of trial in September 2017, Plaintiff's right hip implant was unattached to his pelvis, Plaintiff could not voluntarily move his right leg, he could not walk without crutches, and he experienced significant limitations in his day-to-day activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Relevant Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently filed his first amended petition (\"petition\") alleging six claims against four defendants: Smith &amp; Nephew, Rich House Inc. d/b/a McDonald's (\"McDonald's\"), Defendant AOS, and the underlying defendant Dr. Redjal. Specifically, Plaintiff asserted one claim of products liability against Smith &amp; Nephew (\"Count I\") related to the allegedly defective implants installed in Plaintiff's right hip during the January 2013 surgery performed by Dr. Nunley. Plaintiff also alleged one claim of premises liability against McDonald's (\"Count II\") based on McDonald's failure to discover, warn, or remove an allegedly unsafe condition, which caused Plaintiff to fall on November 21, 2013. Plaintiff's petition set forth three claims of medical malpractice against Defendant AOS and the underlying defendant Dr. Redjal (\"Counts III, IV, and V\") arising from Dr. Redjal's negligent treatment of Plaintiff as discussed above. Finally, Plaintiff asserted one claim of negligent supervision, retention, and referral against Defendant AOS (\"Count VI\"). Plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages based on his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Prior to trial, Plaintiff settled his claims against Smith &amp; Nephew and McDonald's. Therefore, he proceeded to try his case on Counts III, IV, and V against Defendant AOS and Dr. Redjal as well as Count VI against Defendant AOS. In support of his claims, Plaintiff testified and presented the testimony of: his retained expert orthopedic surgeon Dr. David King; Defendant AOS owners and employees Dr. August Ritter, Dr. Knight, Dr. Brian Schafer, and Dr. Bowen; Dr. McDonald, who was also designated as an expert; Smith &amp; Nephew representative Michael Swailes; and Plaintiff's retained expert life care planner Nurse Jan Klosterman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the close of Plaintiff's evidence, the trial court ruled there was insufficient evidence to support Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages on Count VI. The trial court ultimately submitted Counts III, IV, and V to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Plaintiff, awarding him $4,451,875\n   in compensatory damages and $5,000,000 in punitive damages. Defendant AOS appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant AOS raises six points on appeal. In Defendant's first and second points on appeal, which we address together for ease of analysis, Defendant asserts the trial court erred in its rulings relating to evidence of the underlying defendant Dr. Redjal's qualifications and treatment of other patients. In its third and fourth points on appeal, which we also address together, Defendant alleges instructional error as to the verdict directors. In its fifth point on appeal, Defendant contends the court erred in sua sponte limiting its cross-examination of Plaintiff about evidence from his Facebook page and in denying its offer of proof on the subject. And in Defendant's sixth and final point on appeal, it alleges trial court error regarding its requested reduction under section 537.060 RSMo 2000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether the Trial Court Erred with Respect to Evidence of Dr. Redjal's Qualifications and Treatment of Other Patients\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its first and second points on appeal, Defendant AOS asserts the trial court erred in its rulings relating to evidence of the underlying defendant Dr. Redjal's qualifications and treatment of other patients. In Defendant's first point on appeal, it argues the trial court erred in admitting evidence of Dr. Redjal's qualifications and treatment of other patients because the evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial in light of Defendant's admission of respondeat superior. In its second point on appeal, Defendant maintains the court erred in denying its motion for mistrial and subsequent motion for new trial based on the admission of such evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court has considerable discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence.\n   <em>\n    Koelling v.

App. E.D. 2018). Thus, we defer to a trial court's evidentiary ruling, we presume the ruling is correct, and we will reverse based on evidentiary error only if the court clearly abused its discretion.\n   <em>\n    Koon v. Walden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655640\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/539/752/#p761\">\n    539 S.W.3d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761 (Mo. App. E.D. 2017). We also review the trial court's decision to deny a motion for mistrial or a motion for new trial for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Palmer v. Union Pacific R. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7326949\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/843/#p851\">\n    311 S.W.3d 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 851 (Mo. App. E.D. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   An abuse of discretion occurs when the court's ruling is \"clearly against the logic of the circumstances then before\n   the court and is so unreasonable and arbitrary that it shocks the sense of justice and indicates a lack of careful, deliberate consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    Koelling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657815\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/558/543/#p550\">\n    558 S.W.3d at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted). An abuse of discretion will not be found if reasonable minds could differ as to the propriety of the trial court's action.\n   <em>\n    Koon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655640\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/539/752/#p761\">\n    539 S.W.3d at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We will only reverse the trial court's ruling if it has resulted in a glaring or substantial injustice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655640\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/539/752/#p761\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7326949\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/843/#p851\">\n    311 S.W.3d at 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Relevant Facts and Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Prior to trial, Defendant filed a motion in limine asserting Plaintiff should not be allowed to introduce evidence showing Dr. Redjal failed the examination for board certification as an orthopedic surgeon on three occasions. The trial court denied Defendant's motion in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   During trial, Defendant objected to Plaintiff's presentation of evidence related to Count VI, which was Plaintiff's claim for negligent supervision, retention, and referral against Defendant AOS. In response, Plaintiff maintained evidence of Dr. Redjal's qualifications and treatment of other patients was relevant and permissible because he was pursuing punitive damages on that claim. The trial court overruled Defendant's objections, and Plaintiff presented evidence showing, (1) Dr. Redjal failed his board certification examination on three occasions; (2) when Dr. Redjal was trying to obtain his license to practice medicine in Missouri, he had difficulty getting a favorable recommendation from the California institution where he completed his residency; (3) Dr. Redjal's residency director from the California institution wrote a letter stating Dr. Redjal's overall performance was not acceptable; and (4) in late 2014, Defendant AOS ended its professional relationship with Dr. Redjal due to his poor treatment of other surgical patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After the court announced it would not submit Plaintiff's claim of punitive damages on Count VI to the jury, Defendant's counsel requested a mistrial, because the jury had already heard the preceding evidence relevant to that claim. No other relief was requested. The trial court denied Defendant's request for a mistrial, as well as its subsequent motion for new trial arguing the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Relevant Law, Defendant's Arguments, and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As a general rule, a plaintiff is not allowed to pursue claims against an employer asserting alternative theories of liability in cases where the employer has admitted to respondeat superior liability for its employee's negligence.\n   <em>\n    McHaffie By and Through McHaffie v. Bunch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020088\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/891/822/#p826\">\n    891 S.W.2d 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 826 (Mo. banc 1995) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

App. W.D. 2013). However, this rule is subject to an exception when the plaintiff brings a claim for punitive damages against the employer.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093282\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/400/386/#p391\">\n    400 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   391-94 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McHaffie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020088\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/891/822/#p826\">\n    891 S.W.2d at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   Court aptly explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The rationale for the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    McHaffie\n   </em>\n   was that, where vicarious liability was admitted ..., the employer's liability was necessarily fixed by the negligence of the employee. Thus, any additional evidence supporting direct liability claims could serve only to waste time and possibly prejudice the defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The same cannot be said, however, when a claim for punitive damages based upon the direct liability theories is raised. If an employer's hiring, training, supervision, or entrustment practices can be characterized as demonstrating complete indifference or a conscious disregard for the safety of others, then the\n   plaintiff would be required to present additional evidence, above and beyond demonstrating the employee's negligence, to support a claim for punitive damages. Unlike in the\n   <em>\n    McHaffie\n   </em>\n   scenario, this evidence would have a relevant, non-prejudicial purpose. And because the primary concern in\n   <em>\n    McHaffie\n   </em>\n   was the introduction of extraneous, potentially prejudicial evidence, we believe that the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    McHaffie\n   </em>\n   does not apply where punitive damages are claimed against the employer, thus making the additional evidence both relevant and material.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093282\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/400/386/#p391\">\n    400 S.W.3d at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). The\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   Court also held that in order for a plaintiff to be entitled to the punitive damages exception, he is required only to plead sufficient facts to support a claim of punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093282\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/400/386/#p391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093282\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/400/386/#p391\">\n    at 393-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We first address Defendant's argument that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence about Dr. Redjal's qualifications and treatment of other patients. The trial court's rulings admitting this evidence were made during pre-trial discussions of motions in limine and during trial when Defendant objected to the evidence. As such, these rulings were made prior to the trial court's pronouncement that it would not submit Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages on Count VI to the jury. Accordingly, when the court decided the evidence was admissible, Plaintiff was still pursuing its punitive damages claim against Defendant AOS on the theory of negligent supervision, retention, and referral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Implicit in its ruling, the trial court found Plaintiff was entitled to the punitive damages exception because he pled sufficient facts to support his claim for punitive damages on Count VI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093282\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/400/386/#p391\">\n    400 S.W.3d at 391-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of the allegations pled in Plaintiff's petition as well as the fact Defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of Plaintiff's allegations with a motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment, we cannot say the trial court's decision to admit the evidence of Dr. Redjal's qualifications and treatment of other patients for this purpose was clearly against the logic of the circumstances then before the court or demonstrated a lack of careful consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koelling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657815\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/558/543/#p550\">\n    558 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   550 ;\n   <em>\n    Koon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655640\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/539/752/#p761\">\n    539 S.W.3d at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Paragraph First Subsection (b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Paragraph First subsection (b) required the jury to find Dr. Redjal \"damaged\n   the liner and cup and removed excessive bone during the right hip surgery on April 16, 2014[.]\" As to this subsection, Plaintiff presented the following evidence on the issues of standard of care and causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The evidence adduced at trial indicated the acetabular cup implanted in Plaintiff's hip contained a locking mechanism, which connected the cup to a plastic polyethylene liner that could be removed while the cup remained in place. Swailes, the Smith &amp; Nephew representative present during Plaintiff's surgery, testified Smith &amp; Nephew provided a tool to remove the polyethylene liner from the specific type of acetabular cup installed in Plaintiff's hip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Swailes was aware Dr. Redjal did not like to use the recommended tool but preferred to use a power corkscrew device to remove the polyethylene liner. The two had discussed this issue prior to Plaintiff's April 16, 2014 surgery and may have had the same conversation on the day of the surgery. In fact, Swailes testified he warned Dr. Redjal against using the power corkscrew device to remove the polyethylene liner from Plaintiff's acetabular cup because there was a risk the corkscrew device would damage the cup's locking mechanism and it would not be able to accept a new liner. Swailes also told Dr. Redjal to be careful not to drill into the locking mechanism. Nevertheless, Dr. Redjal refused to use the Smith &amp; Nephew tool, but instead used the power corkscrew device. During Plaintiff's surgery, Dr. Redjal struggled to remove the polyethylene liner, damaged the liner by drilling into it several times, and was unable to replace it with a new liner because the liner would not lock into the acetabular cup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Dr. King, Plaintiff's retained expert orthopedic surgeon, testified the standard of care required Dr. Redjal, upon determining he needed to remove the polyethylene liner from Plaintiff's acetabular cup, to use the specific tool designed to remove the liner. Dr. Redjal failed to do so, and in Dr. King's opinion based on the evidence and deposition testimony he reviewed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Redjal damaged the locking mechanism of the acetabular cup through his use of the power corkscrew device. Although Dr. King acknowledged other surgeons used the power corkscrew device, to his knowledge those doctors only employed that method when the implants being worked on did not have a designed tool to remove its polyethylene liner. Dr. King stated Dr. Redjal deviated from the standard of care in the technical way he performed Plaintiff's April 16, 2014 surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, Dr. King's testimony indicates that because Dr. Redjal had damaged the liner and cup through his use of the power corkscrew device, he was unable to lock a new liner into the cup and was thus forced to remove the entire acetabular component to install a new one. Along with the acetabular component, Dr. Redjal removed an excessive amount of bone from Plaintiff's hip. Dr. King and Dr. McDonald both testified Dr. Redjal deviated from the standard of care in doing so. These actions resulted in damage to Plaintiff because by Dr. Redjal's own admission made to Dr. Schafer, who was an owner of Defendant AOS and the chairman of orthopedic surgery at Saint Francis Medical Center, Dr. Redjal \"cracked\" Plaintiff's pelvis while trying to get the cup out. Further, Dr. McDonald found the destruction of and fractures to Plaintiff's pelvis as well as the malposition of the new acetabular component\n   resulted from Dr. Redjal's failures during the April 16, 2014 surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We find, in considering Plaintiff's expert testimony in the context of all the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to submission of Instruction Four, Plaintiff presented substantial evidence from which the jury could have found Dr. Redjal violated the standard of care by damaging the liner and cup and removing excessive bone during the right hip surgery on April 16, 2014, and that as a result, Plaintiff sustained damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8341147\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/210/397/#p410\">\n    210 S.W.3d at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While Defendant complains Dr. King's testimony did not track the exact language of subsection (b) that Dr. Redjal \"damaged the liner and cup,\" he was not required to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7302013\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/284/591/#p595\">\n    284 S.W.3d at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (similarly finding). Dr. King clearly stated Dr. Redjal was required by the standard of care to use the specific tool designed to remove the polyethylene liner, and Swailes testimony confirmed there was such a tool designed to remove the liner from Plaintiff's specific acetabular component. Because of his deviation from the standard of care, Dr. Redjal damaged the liner and cup and removed excess bone along with the acetabular component. Furthermore, the expert testimony, when read as a whole, constitutes substantial evidence probative on the issue of causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7302013\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/284/591/#p595\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 595-96 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fletcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299324\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/296/474/#p478\">\n    296 S.W.3d at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, subsection (b) was consistent with and supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Paragraph First Subsection (d)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Paragraph First subsection (d) required the jury to find Dr. Redjal \"delayed treatment of the fractures which occurred during the April 16, 2014 surgery[.]\" With respect to this subsection, the following evidence was presented as to the standard of care and causation. Dr. King testified to a reasonable degree of certainty that Plaintiff's condition after the April 16, 2014 surgery could have been improved by: having Plaintiff stop weight bearing on his right leg; informing Plaintiff about the fractures; obtaining additional imaging to determine the exact pattern of the fractures; and then developing a plan as to how to restore Plaintiff's anatomy to where it should be. Dr. King testified it was necessary for Plaintiff to stop weight bearing because bearing weight on his right leg would cause the fracture line to expand, prevent healing, and cause Plaintiff's implant to shift. Dr. King said an immediate additional surgery would have been required as part of the action plan to restore Plaintiff's anatomy to where it should be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Furthermore, Dr. King opined Dr. Redjal failed to comply with the standard of care if he put Plaintiff on a weight bearing regimen after the April 16, 2014 surgery. Based on the postoperative medical records, that is exactly what Dr. Redjal did when he ordered Plaintiff to be thirty pounds weight bearing on April 16 and May 1, 2014, then ordered him to be full weight bearing on May 22, 2014. The medical records also reveal from after the April 16, 2014 surgery through October 2014 Dr. Redjal was encouraging Plaintiff to bear more weight on his right leg, the opposite of what he acknowledged was the appropriate treatment of a pelvic fracture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Additionally, Dr. King and Dr. McDonald both testified about the records of Plaintiff's physical therapy and appointments with Dr. Redjal subsequent to the April 16, 2014 surgery.

Instruction Nine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We now turn to Instruction Nine, which was the verdict director read to the jury as to Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages against Defendant AOS and Dr. Rejdal. Instruction Nine provided in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   If you find in favor of [P]laintiff under [Instruction Four], and if you believe that: First, Defendant Hamid Redjal, M.D. either:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (a) performed unnecessary right hip surgery on April 16, 2014; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (b) damaged the liner and cup and removed excessive bone during the right hip surgery on April 16, 2014; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (c) failed to inform Plaintiff Benny Bell of fractures which occurred during the April 16, 2014 surgery; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (d) delayed treatment of the fractures which occurred during the April 16, 2014 surgery; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (e) instructed Plaintiff Benny Bell to participate in physical therapy and to put weight on the right leg despite persistent pain after the April 16, 2014 surgery; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Second, defendant knew or had information from which defendant, in the exercise of ordinary care, should have known that such conduct created a high degree of probability of injury, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Third, defendant thereby engaged in willful, wanton or malicious misconduct,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Then, in addition to any damages to which you find plaintiff entitled under [Instruction Four] you may award plaintiff an additional amount as punitive damages in such sum as you believe will serve to punish defendant and deter defendant and others from like conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Initially, we must clarify Defendant's argument with respect to the preceding Instruction Nine. Defendant's brief on appeal asks this Court to decide its third point on appeal by employing the standard of review and general law applicable for analyzing the submissibility of a punitive damages claim. However, we find Defendant's argument as preserved throughout the proceedings is more appropriately characterized as a challenge to the submissibility of the punitive damages instruction because Defendant argues the evidence is insufficient as it relates to the language of Instruction Nine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wieland v.

Paragraph First Subsection (a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Paragraph First subsection (a) required the jury to find Dr. Redjal \"performed unnecessary right hip surgery on April 16, 2014[.]\" Plaintiff presented the following evidence as to whether Defendant engaged in this conduct with a complete indifference to or in conscious disregard for Plaintiff's safety. A few months after Plaintiff's successful November 2013 left total hip replacement surgery performed by Dr. Redjal, Dr. Bowen determined Plaintiff suffered from osteitis pubis, a condition causing groin pain that can be treated successfully without surgery. Plaintiff thought he was finally on the right track to recovery, and Dr. Bowen thought Plaintiff would only need a more sophisticated injection to treat the osteitis pubis. While Plaintiff had recovered \"99.9%\" of his ability to function on the right hip, he was still experiencing some persistent but improving groin pain on the right side. For this reason, Dr. Bowen referred Plaintiff back to Dr. Redjal to explore whether there was a problem with the right hip implant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Dr. Redjal initially considered surgical intervention during an appointment with Plaintiff on March 6, 2014. Based on x-rays performed prior to that appointment, Dr. Redjal concluded they showed possible loosening of Plaintiff's right hip implant. However, Dr. King testified the relevant x-rays performed prior to this March 6 appointment did not show loosening of Plaintiff's hip implant components. Similarly, Dr. McDonald, who subsequently treated Plaintiff and was designated as an expert in this case, found the x-rays did not indicate the component was failing, loosening, or exhibiting wear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Dr. Redjal also reviewed an ultrasound performed by Dr. Bowen prior to the March 6 appointment. Dr. Redjal noted the ultrasound revealed fluid around the right hip arthroplasty device. However, Dr. McDonald testified joint fluid was expected after arthroplasty and relatively common in patients who had previously had a metal-on-metal implant. Dr. McDonald further testified the amount of fluid in Plaintiff's hip was not a cause for concern and did not suggest his right hip component was loose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Based upon his readings of the x-rays and ultrasound, Dr. Redjal planned to get a bone scan and then consider whether surgical intervention was necessary. On March 12, 2014, the bone scan was performed, which revealed there was no loosening or infection on the components in Plaintiff's right hip. Although Dr. Redjal admitted the radiology report confirmed there was no loosening of the components shown by the bone scan, the next medical record he authored states Plaintiff was \"[s]tatus post right total hip replacement with loosening of components.\" Dr. Redjal's record also only noted the bone scan was negative for infection, but he apparently ignored the bone scan finding that it was negative for loosening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Although Dr. Redjal ordered the bone scan to determine if surgical intervention was needed, the medical records prove he knew there was no loosening of the components but proceeded with the April 16, 2014 surgery anyway. Dr. Redjal performed the surgery prior to conducting additional tests to determine the actual cause of Plaintiff's right groin pain, which Dr. King testified were available. Accordingly, the evidence showed the April 16, 2014 surgery was not necessary or required under the surrounding circumstances\n   and in light of Plaintiff's then existing physical condition. We find the foregoing evidence constituted substantial evidence from which the jury could have found Dr. Redjal performed unnecessary right hip surgery on April 16, 2014 with a complete indifference to or in conscious disregard for Plaintiff's safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8341147\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/210/397/#p410\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    bb.

During the surgery, Dr. Redjal struggled to remove the polyethylene liner, damaged the liner by drilling into it several times, and was unable to replace it with a new liner because the liner would not lock into the acetabular cup. Dr. King opined Dr. Redjal damaged the mechanism that locked the polyethylene liner into the acetabular cup through his action of \"drilling some sort of corkscrew device into it and yanking it out versus using the tool that's designed to remove it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Because Dr. Redjal disregarded the warning of Swailes to either use the tool provided by Smith &amp; Nephew to remove the liner or to be careful not to drill into the locking mechanism, Dr. Redjal damaged the locking mechanism on the acetabular cup implanted in Plaintiff's hip and was unable to install a new polyethylene liner. Therefore, he was forced to remove the entire acetabular component, taking with it a significant amount of Plaintiff's bone, in order to install a new component with a functional locking mechanism. We find the foregoing evidence constituted substantial evidence from which the jury could have found Dr. Redjal damaged the liner and cup and removed excessive bone during the right hip surgery on April 16, 2014 with a complete indifference to or in conscious disregard for Plaintiff's safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8341147\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/210/397/#p410\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    cc.

When Dr. Redjal was subsequently approached by Dr. Schafer about what occurred during Plaintiff's April 16, 2014 surgery, Dr. Redjal admitted he \"cracked\" Plaintiff's pelvis during the surgery when he tried to remove the acetabular cup. Dr. Redjal also admitted during his deposition testimony that the postoperative x-rays revealed a fracture line on the pubic ramus. Further, Dr. Redjal acknowledged the radiology report generated prior to Plaintiff's discharge from the hospital, which confirmed the broken pubic ramus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Notwithstanding Dr. Redjal's knowledge of Plaintiff's pelvic fracture, Dr. Redjal did not tell Plaintiff he had any broken bones or fractures in his hip prior to Plaintiff's discharge from the hospital.

However, the medical records indicate Dr. Redjal did not follow what he testified would be the appropriate treatment for a pelvic fracture because he ordered Plaintiff to bear weight on his right leg after the surgery. Despite the fact the radiology report generated prior to Plaintiff's discharge from the hospital said \"finding suspicious for comminuted fracture of the right pelvis extending through the right acetabular region\" and recommended a CT scan for further insight, Dr. Redjal did not order a CT scan. In fact, nothing in the postoperative records indicates Dr. Redjal was checking on or treating Plaintiff's pelvic fractures. Dr. McDonald found Dr. Redjal's records were inaccurate because they did not mention Plaintiff's fractures and repeatedly said the implants were in the appropriate position when they were not. It was not until October 23, 2014, over six months after surgery, that Dr. Redjal ordered a CT scan on Plaintiff's pelvis \"to see what was going on with the bone healing.\" By that point, Plaintiff's acetabular component was dislocated and his fractures had worsened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   We find the preceding evidence constituted substantial evidence from which the jury could have found Dr. Redjal delayed treatment of the fractures which occurred during the April 16, 2014 surgery with a complete indifference to or in conscious disregard for Plaintiff's safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9456201\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/62/509/#p524\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    ee.

Dr. McDonald testified that in Plaintiff's condition after the surgery, physical therapy and weight bearing would not help Plaintiff and would cause the implant to shift further upward. Nonetheless, Dr. Redjal ordered Plaintiff to be thirty pounds weight bearing immediately after his surgery despite his knowledge the appropriate treatment for a pelvic fracture was for the patient to avoid weight bearing so the fracture could heal on its own. Dr. Redjal again ordered Plaintiff to be thirty pounds weight bearing on May 1 and to be full weight bearing on May 22, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Plaintiff was ordered to begin physical therapy six weeks after the April 16, 2014 surgery. However, Plaintiff was not successful at physical therapy because he was only able to do very little due to his pain. After Dr. Bowen wrote a letter to Dr. Redjal explaining Plaintiff's difficulties doing his exercises, Plaintiff visited Dr. Redjal at which point he was leaning to his left side and could not straighten his hips. Dr. Redjal lifted Plaintiff up on top of his right leg and told Plaintiff to keep it there. However, when Plaintiff tried to walk, his implant was moving up and down inside of his hip with each step he took. Dr. Redjal told Plaintiff to tell Dr. Bowen to \"stop treating [Plaintiff] like a baby.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   About two-and-a-half months after surgery, Plaintiff was still telling Dr. Redjal he was having difficulty bearing weight on the right leg but Dr. Redjal was reinforcing that he needed to put weight on it. On August 28, 2014, Dr. Redjal signed and acknowledged a physical therapy note from the day before in which Dr. Bowen said Plaintiff was complaining of pain, clicking, and loosening of the right hip when standing or walking; the note also declared \"further evaluation on the right hip appears needed.\" However, it was not until October 23, 2014, over six months after surgery, that Dr. Redjal ordered a CT scan of Plaintiff's pelvis \"to see what was going on with the bone healing.\" By that point, Plaintiff's acetabular component was dislocated and his fractures had worsened. We find this evidence constituted substantial evidence from which the jury could have found Dr. Redjal instructed Plaintiff to participate in physical therapy and to put weight on the right leg despite persistent pain after the April 16, 2014 surgery with a complete indifference to or in conscious disregard for Plaintiff's safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9456201\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/62/509/#p524\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Conclusion as to Defendant's Claim that Instruction Nine was not Supported by Sufficient Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In sum, the evidence adduced at trial reveals the following course of events. When Plaintiff first complained of persistent but improving groin pain, x-rays, an ultrasound, and a bone scan were performed. Although Dr. Redjal planned to get the bone scan and then consider whether surgical intervention was necessary, he consciously disregarded the negative results of such scan and rushed into an unnecessary, or at the very least, premature\n   surgery on Plaintiff's right hip. During this surgery, Dr. Redjal willfully refused to use the proper tool to remove the polyethylene liner and failed to heed the Smith &amp; Nephew representative's warning not to damage the locking mechanism on the acetabular component implanted in Plaintiff's right hip. Due to these failures, Dr. Redjal damaged the polyethylene liner as well as the locking detail in the acetabular component, which led to him having to remove Plaintiff's entire right hip implant, removing excessive bone along with it, and fracturing Plaintiff's pelvis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Although Dr. Redjal was conscious of the fact he fractured Plaintiff's pelvis during surgery based on postoperative x-rays, he failed to report the fractures in his medical records, failed to properly diagnose them, and failed to inform Plaintiff about them. To make matters worse, Dr. Redjal failed to follow what he considered the appropriate treatment for a pelvic fracture, failed to follow-up or monitor the healing of the fractures, and consistently encouraged Plaintiff to undergo painful physical therapy and bear weight on the right leg. We find this string of negligent acts by Dr. Redjal, performed while he was conscious of surrounding circumstances and existing conditions indicating that his actions would naturally and probably result in injury to Plaintiff, were done with a complete indifference to or in conscious disregard for Plaintiff's health and safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385676\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/523/496/#p515\">\n    523 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   520 ;\n   <em>\n    General Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8463490\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/200/1/#p24\">\n    200 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   24 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655640\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/539/752/#p761\">\n    539 S.W.3d at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Based on the foregoing conduct established by substantial evidence, we conclude the trial court did not err in submitting the verdict director Instruction Nine to the jury because Plaintiff presented sufficient evidence showing Dr. Redjal acted with a complete indifference to or in conscious disregard for Plaintiff's safety as to each of the five disjunctive acts submitted in Paragraph First.

However, that is not what the instruction submitted in this case. Instead, subsections (c) and (d) used the term \"fractures\" immediately followed by the limiting language \"which occurred during the April 16, 2014 surgery.\" The inclusion of this limiting language, which has been entirely ignored by Defendant on appeal, helped adequately define the ultimate facts necessary for the jury to understand Plaintiff's theory of negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lindquist\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8941002\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/168/635/#p653\">\n    168 S.W.3d at 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dr. McDonald also found the x-rays taken right after the April 16, 2014 surgery showed \"complete destruction of the acetabulum, fractures of the medial wall, [and] fractures through the inferior pubic rami.\" Dr. McDonald concluded the fractures occurred during the surgery. While the parties and witnesses used the terms \"fractures\" and \"fracture\" interchangeably to describe what happened to Plaintiff's pelvis during the April 16, 2014 surgery, we are required by our standard of review to view the evidence in the light most favorable to submission of the instruction and disregard the evidence to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huelskamp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6832728\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/475/162/#p173\">\n    475 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   173 ;\n   <em>\n    Fletcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299324\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/296/474/#p478\">\n    296 S.W.3d at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Thus, because the phrase \"fractures which occurred during the April 16, 2014 surgery\" as used in Paragraph First subsections (c) and (d) of Instruction Four\n   was sufficiently explained and thereby given meaning by the evidence presented at trial, we conclude the verdict director did not constitute a roving commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klotz\n   </em>\n   , 311 S.W.3d at 767 and\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088733\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/114/351/#p370\">\n    114 S.W.3d at 370-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (similarly finding).

The Facebook posts, allegedly written by Plaintiff in April 2017 (five months prior to trial), indicated he had been accepted to undergo hip surgery in Germany and he would finally be able to walk again after the surgery was completed. Because information related to any future surgery had not been produced during discovery, Defendant's counsel requested a mistrial due to the fact they were not able to ask Plaintiff's expert about whether the future surgery affected her opinions as to Plaintiff's future condition and damages. No other relief was requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel then explained Plaintiff, desperate to find a doctor to help him walk again, had been searching all over the United States and Europe trying to find such a doctor. Plaintiff allegedly made contact with a surgeon in Germany, but the surgeon had not examined or agreed to treat him. Plaintiff's counsel said he had not made any arrangements for Plaintiff to undergo surgery in Germany. For these reasons and because he was not a retained expert, Plaintiff did not disclose the foregoing\n   information to Defendant's counsel prior to or during the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   As part of the preceding discussion, the trial court expressed its opinion that evidence from a witness's Facebook page is \"the worst hearsay that you can possibl[y] bring into any courtroom.\" Having heard the parties' arguments and one of the relevant Facebook posts, the trial court denied Defendant's request for a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   During Defendant's cross-examination of Plaintiff the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   [Defendant's counsel]: [ ].

During a discussion at the bench, the court said it would not allow Defendant's counsel to impeach Plaintiff with the Facebook evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   On subsequent re-direct examination, Plaintiff's counsel asked Plaintiff the following questions over Defendant's objections, which were overruled by the trial court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   [Plaintiff's counsel]: [Plaintiff], do you right now have any plans or arrangements or connection with a surgeon in Germany or anybody else -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   [Plaintiff's counsel]: To address your right hip[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   [Plaintiff]: I am looking for somebody to help me because I have looked all over the [United] States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   [Plaintiff's counsel]: That's all I asked of you.

Defendant's Argument and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   On appeal, Defendant argues the trial court erred in preventing Defendant's counsel from eliciting more information as to Plaintiff's alleged plans to undergo a future surgery in Germany. As to prejudice, Defendant asserts the topic was relevant to Plaintiff's claim for future medical and non-medical expenses, which were testified to by Plaintiff's expert life care planner, Nurse Klosterman. Because Nurse\n   Klosterman's testimony was presented prior to Plaintiff's, the Facebook posts were not discovered prior to her testimony and Defendant did not address the matter during her cross-examination. Nurse Klosterman testified as to a cost projection for Plaintiff's future expenses based on the assumption there were no surgical options available to improve Plaintiff's condition, but according to Defendant, if Plaintiff were to undergo \"a surgical procedure that allows him to ambulate without assistance and resolves even some of his complaints, the accommodations recommended by [Nurse] Klosterman [and included in her cost projection] would be unnecessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Initially, we emphasize that the trial court did not wholly prevent Defendant from inquiring into the subject of Plaintiff's plans to seek additional treatment in Europe or from asking about Plaintiff's alleged Facebook posts, which would have been erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koelling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657815\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/558/543/#p550\">\n    558 S.W.3d at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the trial court may not \"rule off limits an entire area of inquiry which has a bearing upon the witness's veracity\");\n   <em>\n    Merk v.

As previously stated, Defendant's argument as to prejudice is that the future surgery would change cost projections related to Plaintiff's future medical and non-medical expenses. However, Plaintiff's testimony before the jury as well as the offer of proof both show that at the time of trial, there was no actual prospect of a future surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Moreover, although Defendant's counsel did not have the specific Facebook evidence about Plaintiff's potential future surgery until they were preparing to cross-examine Plaintiff, counsel certainly knew a hypothetical surgery would possibly be available to Plaintiff prior to their examination of Nurse Klosterman. Specifically, Dr. King testified a \"salvage-type\" of procedure could have been available to possibly improve the condition of Plaintiff's hip. Dr. King explained that in this extreme type of surgery, a pelvic reconstruction specialist would insert a new metal structural cage and attach it to remaining bone as an attempt to stabilize Plaintiff's hips. Even in light of Dr. King's testimony, which was presented prior to Nurse Klosterman's testimony, Defendant did not challenge the fact that Nurse Klosterman's findings and report were based on the\n   assumption there were no surgical options available to improve Plaintiff's condition. Because Defendant had the opportunity to ask Nurse Klosterman about how a future surgery would affect her cost projections, Defendant's argument he was prejudiced by being deprived of this opportunity is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we find the trial court's rulings relating to Defendant's cross-examination of Plaintiff did not prejudice Defendant by materially affecting the merits of the action or by depriving Defendant of a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ContiGroup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299952\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/292/380/#p392\">\n    292 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   392-93 ;\n   <em>\n    Byers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8365163\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/238/717/#p726\">\n    238 S.W.3d at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, Defendant argues the court erred in denying its post-trial motion to amend the judgment to account for a reduction because it properly pleaded the affirmative defense of statutory reduction and renewed its request throughout the trial.
