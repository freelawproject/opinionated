The circuit court denied Naylor's motion without appointing counsel, which the State concedes was error. We agree, reverse the court's judgment, and remand for the appointment of counsel and further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Naylor was charged with one count of first-degree child molestation, a class B felony, in that \"on or between March 1, 2014 and May 1, 2014 in the County of Johnson, State of Missouri, [Naylor] knowingly subjected B.P. (DOB: 7/3/2002) who was less than fourteen years old to sexual contact by rubbing his penis on B.P.'s stomach and grabbing her buttocks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 1, 2015, Naylor signed a Petition to Enter Plea of Guilty (\"plea petition\"), in which he admitted to committing first-degree child molestation as charged. Paragraph 12 of the plea petition provided that: \"I understand that if I am indigent, and I file my own pro se [Rule 24.035] motion, counsel will be appointed for me, and my counsel will have up to thirty days to file an amended motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 5, 2015, Naylor and his counsel appeared before the court to enter a guilty plea. Naylor testified at the plea hearing that he was 30 years old, blind, and able to read and write in Braille. Naylor also testified that he had been diagnosed with the following conditions: PTSD, Tourette's syndrome, OCD, mental retardation, ADHD, \"Asperger Syndrome, part of the autism spectrum,\" and infantile cerebral palsy. Naylor stated that he understood that the range of punishment for the offense was 5 to 15 years' imprisonment and that there was no plea agreement. Naylor also stated that his attorney had read him the plea petition, he understood the plea petition, and he had signed each page of the plea petition. The court accepted Naylor's guilty plea, ordered a sentencing assessment report, and set a sentencing hearing for May 5, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Naylor and his counsel appeared at the sentencing hearing. The court sentenced Naylor to twelve years in the Missouri Department of Corrections (\"DOC\"). The court advised Naylor of his rights under Rule 24.035 and that he was required to file his Rule 24.035 motion \"within 180 days of the date [he was] delivered to the custody of the Department of Corrections.\" The court advised that \"there [was] no cost for filing the motion\" and if Naylor could not afford a lawyer the court would appoint one for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 18, 2016, Naylor filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Rule 24.035 motion, in which he alleged that he was delivered to the DOC on May 7, 2015. Naylor sought to vacate his conviction and sentence on two grounds: (1) \"Ineffective assistance of counsel\" in that he \"was coerced into open Plea by counsel [and] wanted a jury trial\" and (2) \"Violation of 4\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Amendment Rights\" in that he \"was denied jury trial/trial by counsel.\" Naylor's signature\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeared at the bottom of the motion, along with a notation that the motion was prepared by two fellow inmates \"Due to Movant [sic] Disabilities.\" Included with the motion was a \"Forma Pauperis Affidavit,\" in which Naylor averred that he was unable to afford\n   the cost of an attorney and requested the court appoint one for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court conducted a case review hearing on August 29, 2016. The prosecutor appeared, but no one appeared on behalf of Naylor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prosecutor advised that Naylor \"went into custody on August 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2015, so the 180 days past that would have been February and [the motion] wasn't filed until August of [2016].\" The court agreed that the motion was filed \"out of time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 2, 2017, the court denied Naylor's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Rule 24.035 motion as untimely. The court found that, assuming Naylor was delivered to the DOC on August 11, 2015-the later of the two alleged delivery dates-the motion was due on or before February 8, 2016 and Naylor did not file his motion until August 18, 2016. The court found \"no abandonment on the part of the Public Defender, as the Movant did not seek to file his Motion to Vacate until the time limits under Rule 24.035 expired.\" The court did not appoint Naylor counsel at any time during his post-conviction proceedings. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We review the denial of a post-conviction motion under Rule 24.035 to determine if the motion court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.
