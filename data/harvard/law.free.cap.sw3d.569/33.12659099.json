Martin, Judge\n   Russell Scott Lynch (\"Lynch\") appeals from the trial court's judgment dismissing his petition for declaratory judgment. Lynch argues that he is entitled to receive credit against sentences imposed in St. Charles County for time spent in jail in connection with St. Louis County charges, and for time spent in a long-term treatment program. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 22, 2010, Lynch pleaded guilty in St. Charles County in Case No. 0711-CR06162-01 to two charges, represented by Lynch to be burglary and stealing. On the same date, judgment was entered sentencing Lynch to seven years in the Department of Corrections for burglary and three years in the Department of Corrections for stealing, with these sentences to run consecutive to one another, but concurrent with sentences imposed in four cases from St. Louis County: 07SL-CR06306-01, 07SL-CR06299-01, 07SL-CR07249, and 07SL-CR05800-01. In addition, the St. Charles County judgment imposed long-term treatment pursuant to section 217.362\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for twenty-four months. Thereafter, by order dated November 18, 2010, Lynch was released on probation pursuant to section 217.362, with custodial release occurring on December 12, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 25, 2016, Lynch's probation in the St. Charles County case was revoked, and his previously suspended sentences were executed. As with the initial judgment, the order revoking probation provided that Lynch's sentences would be served consecutively with one another, and concurrently with sentences in the above referenced St. Louis County cases. According to Lynch, he was delivered to the Department of Corrections on September 6, 2016, and he is presently incarcerated at the Northeast Correctional Center in Bowling Green, Missouri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In all four of the St. Louis County cases, Lynch pled guilty on October 2, 2008, and was placed on probation on December 28, 2009, for three years, with the obligation to remain in custody for two years, and an anticipated custodial release date of December 9, 2010. It appears from the record that long-term treatment pursuant to section 217.362 was also ordered in each of these cases. The record indicates that Lynch successfully completed a two-year treatment program on January 18, 2010, but that other cases required him to remain detained in the Department of Corrections until December 12, 2010, the date which corresponds with Lynch's release pursuant to the probation order entered in the St. Charles County case. Lynch requested early release from the custodial component of the probation orders in the St. Louis County cases (which required him to remain in custody until December 9, 2010), but that request was denied on October 22, 2010. The records support the conclusion that Lynch was either ultimately discharged from probation in the St. Louis County cases, that he is not presently incarcerated in connection with any\n   claimed violation of the terms of probation in those St. Louis County cases, or both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 1, 2017, Lynch filed a petition for declaratory judgment (\"Lynch's petition\") against the Missouri Department of Corrections (\"Department of Corrections\") in the Circuit Court of Cole County. Lynch's petition asserted that the Department of Corrections erroneously refused to give Lynch credit against the service of his sentences in the St. Charles County case for two time periods: (i) the time he spent in the St. Louis County jail until his delivery to the Department of Corrections for his sentences in the St. Charles County case, and (ii) for the time he spent in a long-term treatment program in connection with the St. Louis cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lynch's petition claimed that he was entitled to 400 days of credit for the time he spent in custody in the St. Louis County jail from September 11, 2007, to October 15, 2008. Lynch attached exhibits to his petition to support this claim, including copies of his Department of Corrections face sheet, the Department of Corrections' decision following his complaint about credit for the time he spent in custody, and docket sheets from each of the cases for which he was held in custody in the St. Louis County jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lynch's petition further claimed that he was entitled to credit for the entire time he spent in a section 217.362 long-term treatment program, and that the Department of Corrections only gave credit for fifty-seven days, calculated from the time he was sentenced on October 22, 2010, in the St. Charles County case, until December 12, 2010, the day he was released on probation in the St. Charles County case. Lynch's petition did not identify the number of additional days credit to which he believed he is entitled, or the time frame for the additional credit to which he believed he is entitled. Lynch attached exhibits to his petition to support this claim, including copies of his Department of Corrections face sheet, the Department of Corrections' decision following his complaint about credit for the time he spent in custody, documentation from the classification hearing following his successful completion of the long-term treatment program, and docket sheets from his St. Charles County case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Department of Corrections filed a motion to dismiss Lynch's petition on January 2, 2018 (\"Motion to Dismiss\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Motion to Dismiss argued that Lynch had previously litigated his request for credit for the time he spent in the St. Louis County jail, and that he was collaterally estopped from litigating the same issue in his petition for declaratory judgment. To support this argument, the Department of Corrections attached a copy of a judgment (\"Habeas Judgment\") entered by the Circuit Court of Pike County (\"habeas court\") wherein the court entered judgment on Lynch's request for habeas release on the same grounds alleged in the declaratory judgment petition. The Habeas Judgment\n   found that a habeas petition was not the proper method to compel jail-time credit because the one-year credit sought by Lynch would not entitle him to immediate release. Thus, the Habeas Judgment concluded that Lynch's habeas claim was not cognizable. Nonetheless, the Habeas Judgment addressed the merits of Lynch's claim and concluded that Lynch failed to prove that his time in custody in St. Louis County jail was related to the St. Charles County case for which he was currently serving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Motion to Dismiss also argued that Lynch's petition failed to allege facts entitling him to relief in connection with the claim for credit for time spent in a long-term treatment program. In particular, the Motion to Dismiss argued that the allegations in Lynch's petition addressed only the time frame for which the Department of Corrections had already awarded Lynch fifty-seven days credit. The Motion to Dismiss asserted that \"Lynch does not contend that he should receive credit for time spent in custody before sentencing, and he does not contend that he should receive credit for time spent on probation after probation release.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lynch filed a response to the Motion to Dismiss which reiterated the arguments in his petition for declaratory judgment and which attached additional exhibits. Thereafter, the trial court issued its memorandum, order, and judgment (\"Judgment\") granting the Motion to Dismiss and entering judgment in favor of the Department of Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Judgment concluded that Lynch's claim for 400 days of credit for the time he spent in the St. Louis County jail until his delivery to the Department of Corrections in connection with the St. Charles County case had already been determined in the Habeas Judgment. The Judgment noted that \"[t]he Pike County Circuit Court determined that state habeas was not the proper vehicle by which to litigate jail time credit issues, but it also concluded the claim was meritless.\" (Citations omitted.) As such, the Judgment concluded that \"[p]rinciples of res judicata and collateral estoppel prevent Lynch['s] repetition of the first claim.\" The Judgment further concluded that Lynch had already received credit for fifty-seven days in connection with the long-term treatment program, and that his petition did not state any facts identifying or requesting \"credit for time spent in custody before sentencing ... and ... credit for time spent on probation after probation release.\" Thus, the Judgment found that Lynch's petition failed to allege facts that entitled him to any additional relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lynch appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Lynch's single point relied on argues both that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Department of Corrections, and that the judgment from which he is appealing was a judgment on the pleadings. His point relied on states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"history\" id=\"p-23\">\n   The Circuit Court of Cole County erred in granting summary judgment to the respondent because the circuit court did not have all the facts in this case matter presented to the courts properly and in detail[.] [T]his petitioner was acting pro se and did not properly present all the case[ ] laws and evidence[ ] in this ... matter to the circuit court[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   This petitioner will show that [there] is a legal right to judgment and this movant will show material facts required to support [a] claimed right to judgment....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Now on appeal from a judgment on the pleadings, the courts accept the facts alleged in the losing party['s] petition as true. The court [will] uphold the judgment\n   if the facts plead[ed] by the losing party were insufficient as a matter of law, but in this case[ ] matter if the courts look at all the facts in this cases and all the [exhibits] in the legal file they will see that this matter should be reversed in favor of this petitioner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Citations omitted.) Perpetuating the confusion, the argument portion of Lynch's brief does not address whether or how the well-pleaded facts in his petition stated a claim for relief as to prohibit dismissal of the petition, and instead argues about the merits of the claims raised in his petition. The Judgment granted the Motion to Dismiss in reliance on a matter outside the scope of Lynch's petition with respect to the credit for time spent in the St. Louis County jail, but with respect to Lynch's claim for credit for time spent in the long-term treatment program, the Judgment limited its determination to whether the facts pleaded in Lynch's petition stated a claim for relief. We therefore address the claims separately, as the Judgment's disposition of each claim requires us to apply differing standards of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The claim for credit for time spent in the St. Louis County jail\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Department of Corrections denominated its response to Lynch's petition as a Motion to Dismiss. Yet, with respect to Lynch's claim that he was entitled to credit for the time he spent in the St. Louis County jail, the Motion to Dismiss attached the Habeas Judgment, and then relied on the Habeas Judgment to argue that Lynch was collaterally estopped from asserting that claim for credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is an affirmative defense, the proof of which ordinarily requires reliance on matters outside the pleadings to demonstrate that the issue asserted by the plaintiff has been previously litigated to a final judgment.\n   <em>\n    Noble v.

App. W.D. 2010). Nonetheless, our Supreme Court has held that a pleading designated as a motion to dismiss may be an appropriate mechanism for raising this defense because collateral estoppel is essentially a \" 'defense[ ] ... alleging the plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.' \"\n   <em>\n    Chesterfield Vill., Inc. v.

Despite the Department of Corrections' introduction of a matter outside the pleadings, the trial court did not give notice that it was treating the Motion to Dismiss as a motion for summary judgment. Instead, the trial court allowed Lynch to file a response to the Motion to Dismiss. Lynch's response included additional exhibits for the trial court to consider.

The trial court erred in entering judgment in favor of the Department of Corrections in reliance on this defense with\n   respect to Lynch's claim for credit for the time he served in the St. Louis County jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The claim for credit for time spent in a long-term treatment program\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Lynch's second claim for credit concerns the time he spent in a long-term treatment program. The Motion to Dismiss argued that Lynch's petition failed to state a claim for relief for this time beyond the fifty-seven days of credit already afforded. The trial court agreed, and the Judgment granted the Motion to Dismiss on the basis alleged in the Motion to Dismiss. Specifically, the Judgment concluded that Lynch's claim failed as a matter of law because he did not allege in his petition the time frame for which he should receive credit beyond the fifty-seven days of credit already received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \" 'We review the grant of a motion to dismiss\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and will affirm the dismissal on any meritorious ground stated in the motion.' \"\n   <em>\n    Isom v.

As the Judgment found, Lynch's petition does not allege that he was entitled to credit for any time spent in custody before he was sentenced for the St. Charles County offenses on October 22, 2010, or for time spent on probation after his release on probation in connection with the St. Charles County offenses on December 12, 2010. There are no factual allegations in the petition that would support a claim for credit for the time spent in a long-term treatment program beyond the credit already afforded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The trial court did not err in granting the Motion to Dismiss insofar as the Judgment concluded that Lynch's petition failed to allege facts that would entitled him to any further credit for the time spent in a long-term treatment program beyond the fifty-seven days credit already afforded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Judgment is affirmed insofar as it concluded that Lynch's petition failed to state facts supporting a claim for additional credit for time spent in a long-term treatment program. The Judgment is reversed insofar as it concluded that Lynch's claim for credit for time he spent in the St. Louis County jail before being transferred to the Department of Corrections for crimes committed in St. Charles County was barred by the affirmative defense of collateral estoppel. This matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    All statutory references are to RSMo.

The Motion to Dismiss identifies James Hurley (\"Hurley\") as the respondent. According to the record, Hurley is a former warden of the Northeast Correctional Center in Bowling Green, the correctional institution where Lynch is an inmate. There is no indication in the record that the trial court substituted Hurley as the properly named party in lieu of the Department of Corrections. Nonetheless, the trial court's judgment uses a case caption that identifies Hurley as the respondent. Plainly, Hurley could only have been the Respondent in his official capacity. Though the official record in this appeal is required to use the same case caption as that which appears on the trial court's judgment, we refer to the Department of Corrections as the respondent throughout this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <em>\n     King\n    </em>\n    was cited with approval in\n    <em>\n     Chesterfield Village\n    </em>\n    for the proposition that collateral estoppel could be raised in a motion to dismiss.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9397894\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/64/315/\">\n     64 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    318 n.1.
