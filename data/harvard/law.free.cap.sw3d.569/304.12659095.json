RODRIGUEZ, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Louis Hinojos appeals a grant of summary judgment entered against him in favor of State Farm Lloyds and Raul Pulido (State Farm). In three issues, Hinojos contends: (1) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his breach of contract claim because he had raised a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether the appraisal was timely paid and to whether State Farm proved Hinojos had accepted the appraisal payment; (2) the trial court improperly granted summary judgment on his extra-contractual claims because his entitlement to recovery does not depend on his entitlement to damages under his breach of contract claims; and (3) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim under the Texas Prompt Pay Act because State Farm did not establish that it paid Hinojos his appraisal award, or alternatively the award was paid outside of the sixty-day statutory-window. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 3, 2013, Luis Hinojos's home was damaged by a hail storm. Hinojos had insured his home with a State Farm homeowners policy and reported a claim for the damage the same day. A few days later on June 12, State Farm sent one of its adjusters, Raul Pulido, to inspect the home for damage. Hinojos was present for the inspection. After completing his inspection, Pulido estimated the damage to the home at $755.02, replacement cost value, which did not exceed Hinojos's policy deductible of $1,290.00. Pulido discussed his findings with Hinojos and State Farm sent Hinojos a letter stating that because the damage was less than the deductible, nothing would be paid on the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hinojos decided to hire a public adjuster to inspect the home to render a second opinion. The public adjuster identified hail damage to the roof and contacted State Farm and requested they re-inspect the home. Upon re-inspection on June 28, State Farm determined there was interior\n   damage from roof leaks and estimated those damages at $3,859.22. There was additional damage to the home's shingles and other exterior roofing components, but State Farm expressly denied those claims based on its assessment that they were not caused by wind and hail. State Farm notified Hinojos of its findings on July 5 and sent him a check on August 7 for $1,995.11, representing the cash value payment after deducting $574.11 for recoverable depreciation and the policy's deductible of $1,290.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Six months later, Hinojos sued State Farm, asserting breach of contract, unfair settlement practices, violation of the prompt payment provisions of the Texas Insurance Code, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud. In response, State Farm invoked the policy's contractual appraisal provision. This provision creates a method for determination of damages when the parties cannot agree: each of the parties select a disinterested appraiser, and the two appraisers choose an umpire. Under the contract, an agreement on the amount of the loss by any two of the three binds the parties to that assessment of damages. An appraisal report, signed by one of the appraisers and the umpire, was sent to State Farm on December 31, 2015, setting the amount of loss at $38,269.95 replacement cost, or $26,259.86 actual cash value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 7, 2016, State Farm sent Hinojos's counsel a check for $22,974.75, reflecting deductions for the prior payments, the deductible, and $12,010.09 in depreciation. But due to a clerical error the check was sent to the wrong address: \"1322 Park Drive\" instead of Hinojos's counsel's address, \"1322 Space Park Drive.\" At a status conference on January 28, Hinojos's counsel informed State Farm he had not yet received the check for the appraisal award. State Farm reissued the check, sent it to the correct address, and notified counsel that Hinojos could claim the $12,010.09 withheld for depreciation value if he completed roof repairs by December of the following year, slightly under two years from the issuance of this second check. There was trouble with this payment too. The check included Bank of America as a payee because it had been listed as Hinojos's mortgage holder, but this was no longer the case, thus making the check non-negotiable. Hinojos's counsel returned the non-negotiable check to State Farm, and they received the check on April 25, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Meanwhile, State Farm had moved for summary judgment on March 30, asserting Hinojos was estopped from maintaining a breach of contract claim as a matter of law because it had timely paid the contractual appraisal award, and asserting Hinojos had no extra-contractual claims because it timely investigated his claim and he had no independent injury. The hearing for State Farm's motion for summary judgment was held on May 5, at which time the trial court granted summary judgment for State Farm on all claims. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    The Breach of Contract Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his first issue, Hinojos contends summary judgment was improper because he raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the appraisal was timely paid and whether State Farm had proven he had accepted the appraisal payment. State Farm asserts these issues were waived, but contends that even if they were not: (1) refusal to accept payment or a reservation of rights cannot invalidate a contractual appraisal provision; and (2) the appraisal check was timely sent to Hinojos's counsel and any alleged delay was due to the acknowledged clerical errors,\n   and clerical errors do not create fact issues regarding the timeliness of payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a trial court's granting of a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Merriman v.

But he contends genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to the timely payment of the appraisal award and his acceptance of the award. Regarding acceptance, Hinojos contends that because he reserved all rights in law and equity in a letter dated June 10, 2015, he \"specifically refused to accept any payment of an appraisal award as settlement of his entire claim,\" and therefore State Farm cannot show he accepted the award. Because he did not raise this issue before the trial court, however, this portion of his first issue is waived. TEX.R.CIV.P. 166a(c). We\n   note that even if it were not waived, a party may not defeat a contractually binding appraisal award by simply rejecting the payment.\n   <em>\n    Garcia v. Lloyds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374802\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/514/257/#p272\">\n    514 S.W.3d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2016, pet. denied) (\"[Plaintiff] cannot defeat an otherwise valid and binding appraisal award simply by rejecting [Insurer's] payment of the award.\");\n   <em>\n    Brownlow v.

(mem. op.)(\"[Insurer] participated in the appraisal process and tendered the amount awarded by the umpire. Because [Insurer] complied with the requirements of the contract, it cannot be found to be in breach.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As to the timeliness of the payment under the contract, Hinojos asserts State Farm's only evidence of a timely payment was a transmittal letter, which he summarily contends is insufficient to show timely payment. He cites no case law supporting the contention that this evidence was insufficient for its purpose. He further asserts the clerical errors that delayed his being able to negotiate the payment-the incorrect address and incorrect payee-though uncontested, raise a genuine issue of fact regarding the timeliness of payment. Once again, the challenge for Hinojos is he did not raise the issue of timeliness of payment as a reason to avoid summary judgment on his breach of contract claim. While he did address timeliness in his response to State Farm's motion, he did so in a separate section asserting a claim distinct from the breach of contract claim addressed in State Farm's motion for summary judgment. In his reply brief, Hinojos attempts to address this deficiency by pointing to a statement made in the factual background section of his response to the motion for summary judgment, in which he stated, \"[a]s of the filing of its motion for summary judgment, State Farm has failed to properly pay the appraisal award.\" He asserts that a payment never made is inherently not timely, and thus the issue was properly raised to the trial court. This argument is unpersuasive. In filing a written answer or response, the non-movant must expressly present to the trial court any issues defeating the movant's entitlement to summary judgment, and issues not expressly presented to the trial court will not be considered on appeal as a grounds for reversal.

The basis of those claims contend State Farm breached the statutory prohibition against unfair settlement practices and the common-law duty of good faith and fair dealing. Hinojos maintains the trial court erred because his entitlement to recovery on his extra-contractual claims does not turn on his breach of contract claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Applicable Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   An insurance policy is a contract that establishes the respective rights and obligations to which an insurer and an insured have mutually agreed.\n   <em>\n    RSUI Indem.

He contends the Court did not preclude extra-contractual claims where, as here, the insurer was found not to have breached the contract, but the insured\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   entitled to coverage under the policy. We do not find this distinction persuasive. When an insurer has fully paid an appraisal award, no additional benefits are being wrongfully withheld under the policy, and in that situation, the only way an insured can recover any damages beyond policy benefits is where a statutory violation or act of bad faith caused an injury independent of the loss of benefits.\n   <em>\n    National Security Fire &amp; Casualty Company v.

Hinojos has not alleged an independent injury here. Because Hinojos has received the benefits he was entitled to under the policy via the appraisal award and has not alleged any act so extreme as to cause independent injury, he failed to raise an issue of material fact on his statutory and bad faith claims.\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386202\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/523/840/#p848\">\n    523 S.W.3d at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, Hinojos asserts the invocation of the appraisal process and the payment of the appraisal award should allow him to receive interest penalties under the statute because the appraisal payment was ultimately paid outside the sixty-day statutory-window. Alternatively, he asserts State Farm never paid the appraisal award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Applicable Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Texas Prompt Pay Act establishes a series of procedural deadlines and requirements that facilitate the timely processing and payment of claims by insurers. Section 542.055(a) of the Act provides that not later than the fifteenth day after an insurer receives notice of a claim, the insurer shall: (1) acknowledge receipt of the claim; (2) commence any investigation of the claim; and (3) request from the claimant all items, statements, and forms the insurer reasonably believes will be required from the claimant. TEX.INS.CODE ANN. \u00a7 542.055(a). Within fifteen business days of the insurer receiving all items, statements, and forms from the claimant, the insurer must notify the claimant in writing of the acceptance or rejection of a claim. TEX.INS.CODE ANN. \u00a7 542.056(a). To ensure timely processing of payment of claims, Section 542.058(a) requires the insurer to pay a claim within sixty days of receiving all of the items, statements, and forms reasonably requested and required of the claimant or else pay damages as provided by Section 542.060(a). TEX.INS.CODE ANN. \u00a7 542.058(a). The damages provided under that section are 18 percent interest on the amount of the claim per year, plus reasonable and necessary attorney's fees.

This was because, while State Farm had timely paid the plaintiffs the initial estimate of $18,742.15, the time required by the appraisal process meant they were not paid the final amount-the amount determined by the appraisal process-until well outside of the sixty-day statutory limit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9023585\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/155/340/#p344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court of appeals rejected this argument, holding that the appraisal process was invoked only after State Farm made a reasonable payment on the claim well within the sixty-day limit and therefore did\n   not affect their compliance with the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9023585\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/155/340/#p344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Similarly, after its initial inspection of Hinojos's home, State Farm re-inspected the home on June 28, 2013, at his request and found damage of $3,859.22. It notified Hinojos of its findings on July 5 and sent him a check for the damage on August 7, well within the sixty-day statutory limit. Hinojos disagreed with the amount and filed suit six months later, which led to the invocation of the policy's appraisal process and ultimately to the larger award he was subsequently tendered. Hinojos urges us to ignore the \"good-faith defense\" of\n   <em>\n    Breshears\n   </em>\n   and to instead \"follow other courts that have routinely refused to apply the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Breshears\n   </em>\n   \" to claims under the Texas Prompt Pay Act. But none of the cases cited by Hinojos, with the exception of an unpublished opinion of the Northern District of Texas, support his contention that the subsequent larger award from the appraisal process means State Farm did not reasonably pay until after the sixty-day deadline had passed. Further, none of those cases are appraisal cases. As to the single favorable district court opinion cited,\n   <em>\n    Graber v. State Farm Lloyds\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the Fifth Circuit substantially disagreed with it, stating \"[t]he most fundamental problem with\n   <em>\n    Graber\n   </em>\n   is that it did not recognize an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   court's duty to follow state courts' interpretation of state law rather than the interpretation the federal court thinks makes the most sense[,]\" elaborating that\n   <em>\n    Graber\n   </em>\n   had improperly relied on a nonappraisal case in rejecting the good faith defense.\n   <em>\n    Mainali Corporation v.

Accordingly, because State Farm made a reasonable payment on Hinojos's claim within the sixty-day statutory limit, the subsequent payment resulting from the appraisal process did not mean State Farm violated the prompt payment deadlines of the insurance code.\n   <em>\n    Breshears\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9023585\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/155/340/#p344\">\n    155 S.W.3d at 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
