Martin, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Joshua Perkins (\"Perkins\") appeals the denial of his Rule 24.035 motion following an evidentiary hearing. Perkins argues that the motion court clearly erred in failing to conduct an abandonment inquiry after appointed counsel filed a statement in lieu of an amended motion, and in denying a claim in his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion that his guilty plea was involuntary because he was not advised of the range of punishment. Because the filing of a timely statement in lieu of an amended motion does not necessitate an abandonment inquiry, and because the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion Perkins thereafter filed was untimely and did not constitute the reply to a statement in lieu of an amended motion authorized by Rule 24.035(e), the motion court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State charged Perkins with the class A felony of assault of a corrections officer in the first degree (Count I) and the class B felony of committing violence against an employee of the Department of Corrections (Count II). Perkins appeared with counsel at a plea and sentencing hearing on May 5, 2016. At the hearing, the State initially announced the agreed upon sentence to be concurrent 20-year terms of imprisonment on each count, to run consecutively with any sentence Perkins was currently serving. Perkins stated that he understood the State sought a 20-year sentence on Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Later in the hearing, the State offered to drop Count II if Perkins pleaded guilty to Count I for a 20-year term of imprisonment to be served consecutively with a sentence he was already serving. Perkins agreed. The plea court reiterated the State's offer of a 20-year sentence on Count I, explaining to Perkins he had the right to decline the offer and go to trial. Perkins responded that he did not want to go to trial. The plea court found Perkins's guilty plea was freely and voluntarily entered with an understanding of the nature of the charge and the range of punishment. The plea court also explained to Perkins that there would not be a sentencing assessment report \"because we've already agreed with what the sentence is going to be.\" The plea court sentenced Perkins to a 20-year term of imprisonment on Count I, to run consecutively with any existing sentence. The plea court did not reference the mandatory minimum and maximum penalties for Count I. Perkins did not appeal the judgment of conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Perkins filed a timely\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for post-conviction relief on June 22, 2016. When prompted to list all known claims for vacating, setting aside, or correcting his conviction and sentence, Perkins identified no known claims, and instead wrote \"To be amended by appointed counsel.\" The motion court appointed the public defender as counsel for Perkins. The transcript of Perkins's guilty plea and sentencing was filed on July 29, 2016. By operation of Rule 24.035(g),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   any amended motion was due by September 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 27, 2016, appointed counsel filed a statement in lieu of an amended motion pursuant to Rule 24.035(e). Counsel attested that he had reviewed plea counsel's files, the transcript from Perkins's guilty plea and sentencing, Perkins's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion, and correspondence from Perkins. Based on this review, appointed counsel determined that there were no claims to be raised in an amended motion. Counsel also stated that he provided a copy of the statement to Perkins prior to filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 3, 2016, within ten days of appointed counsel's filing of the statement in lieu of an amended motion, Perkins filed a motion requesting an extension of time to file an amended motion, and also filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion. Perkins's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion asserted several claims for post-conviction relief from his underlying guilty plea, but did not expressly challenge the assertions in appointed counsel's statement in lieu of an amended motion. Relevant to this appeal, Perkins's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion alleged his guilty plea was not voluntary because the plea court failed to advise him of the minimum and maximum sentences he could receive for Count I, and that he would have more than likely gone to trial had he known the range of punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 13, 2016, the motion court granted Perkins's motion for an extension of time to file an amended motion and treated the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion as timely filed. Following an evidentiary hearing, the motion court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law on Perkins's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion. On Perkins's claim that his plea was involuntary because the plea court failed to inform him of the range of punishment, the motion court found that Perkins received the agreed upon sentence established by his plea agreement with the State. The motion court also found that Perkins understood the punishment he would receive per the plea agreement, and that he repeatedly stated he did not want to go to trial. Accordingly, the motion court held that Perkins was not prejudiced by the plea court's failure to inform him of the range of punishment. The motion court denied all other claims in Perkins's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion, none of which are the subject of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[R]eview of a denial of a post-conviction motion under Rule 24.035 is limited to a determination of whether the motion court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

In Point One, Perkins argues that the motion court clearly erred in failing to conduct an abandonment inquiry following appointed counsel's filing of a statement in lieu of an amended motion. In Point Two, Perkins maintains that the motion court clearly erred in denying the claim in his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion that his plea was involuntary because the plea court failed to inform him of the range of punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Point One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his first point on appeal, Perkins contends that the motion court clearly erred in failing to conduct an abandonment inquiry following appointed counsel's filing of a statement in lieu of an amended motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 24.035(e), when counsel is appointed to represent a postconviction movant, counsel \"shall ascertain whether sufficient facts supporting the claims are asserted in the [\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   ] motion and whether the movant has included all claims known to the movant as a basis for attacking the judgment and sentence.\" Following this investigation, \"appointed counsel must file either an amended motion to compensate for any deficiencies in the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion or, in the alternative, a statement explaining the actions counsel took to ensure that no amended motion is needed.\"\n   <em>\n    Vogl v.

In addition, \"[t]he statement shall be presented to the movant prior to filing.\" Rule 24.035(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Latham v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657334\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/397/#p399\">\n    554 S.W.3d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 399 (Mo. banc 2018), our Supreme Court recently held that postconviction counsel's failure \"to file either an amended motion or a statement in lieu of an amended motion within the 60-day deadline in Rule 24.035(g) create[s] the presumption [that] postconviction counsel failed to comply with the postconviction rules and, thereby, abandoned [movant].\"\n   <em>\n    Latham\n   </em>\n   did not hold, however, that the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     timely\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   filing of a statement in lieu of an amended motion creates a presumption of abandonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Perkins concedes that his appointed counsel's statement in lieu of an amended motion was timely filed. We reject Perkins's suggestion that the mere filing of a timely statement in lieu of an amended motion creates a presumption of abandonment requiring an abandonment inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Perkins nonetheless argues that appointed counsel's statement in lieu, though timely filed, created a presumption of abandonment because it otherwise failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 24.035(e). \"[W]hen the record raises a presumption of abandonment because appointed counsel has failed to comply with the requirements in Rule 24.035(e) ... a motion court must conduct a sufficient independent inquiry of a postconviction movant's claim of abandonment.\"\n   <em>\n    Vogl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925593\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/437/218/#p226\">\n    437 S.W.3d at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Appointed counsel's statement in lieu advised that appointed counsel had ascertained \"that there are no claims to be raised in an amended motion, and there are no additional facts to be included in support [of] what [Perkins] has stated in his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to vacate, set aside, or correct judgment or sentence.\" In support of these assertions, appointed counsel noted that he had reviewed (i) plea counsel's files, (ii) the transcript of Perkins's plea and sentencing hearing, (iii) Perkins's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion, and (iv) correspondence from Perkins. The statement in lieu also asserted that a copy of the statement had been provided to Perkins prior to its filing. The statement in lieu facially complied with the requirements of Rule 24.035(e), refuting a claim of abandonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Vogl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925593\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/437/218/#p226\">\n    437 S.W.3d at 228-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Perkins nonetheless complains on appeal that an abandonment inquiry was required by the record because appointed counsel did not have any in person conversations or discussions with Perkins before deciding to file a statement in lieu of an amended motion. However, Perkins never raised this concern with the motion court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even had he, the assertion would not have supported a claim of facial noncompliance with Rule 24.035(e). Although Rule 24.035(e) requires appointed counsel to ascertain whether a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion includes all claims known to a movant, and to set forth the steps taken to do so, it does not address how those steps must be taken by appointed counsel. Relevant here, Rule 24.035(e) does not require appointed counsel to set out facts demonstrating that he or she spoke directly with a post-conviction movant in order to ascertain whether the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion asserts all facts and/or claims known to a movant. Perkins's assertion that appointed counsel did not meet with\n   or talk to him directly fails to suggest facial noncompliance with the statement in lieu requirements imposed by Rule 24.035(e), where appointed counsel's statement in lieu asserts that he communicated with Perkins, in writing, as part of his investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Perkins also claims that an abandonment inquiry was required by the record because his initial\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion asserted no claims at all, and instead indicated in the section where claims were to be asserted that the motion would \"be amended by appointed counsel.\" That is immaterial, however, to whether appointed counsel facially complied with the requirements of Rule 24.035(e). Appointed counsel's statement in lieu of an amended motion set out facts demonstrating the actions taken in ascertaining that the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion set forth all facts and claims known to the movant, and that there are no claims to be raised in an amended motion. The statement in lieu of an amended motion was not rendered facially deficient merely because Perkins's initial\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion asserted no claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Perkins alternatively argues that the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion he filed within ten days of the statement in lieu of an amended motion necessitated an abandonment inquiry. Perkins argues that his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion constituted the reply to a statement in lieu of an amended motion authorized by Rule 24.035(e), and that when a reply is filed, an abandonment inquiry is required. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rule 24.035(e) provides movants with recourse to challenge a statement in lieu of an amended motion. After discussing what a statement in lieu must address, the last sentence of Rule 24.035(e) provides that \"[t]he movant may file a reply to the statement not later than ten days after the statement is filed.\" Beyond characterizing the reply as a reply\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     to the statement in lieu\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Rule 24.035(e) is otherwise silent with respect to the purpose of the reply, and with respect to the required content of a reply. And Rule 24.035(e) is silent with respect to the obligation imposed, if any, on the motion court if a timely reply is filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Our Supreme Court recently addressed these issues in\n   <em>\n    Latham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657334\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/397/#p399\">\n    554 S.W.3d at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Latham\n   </em>\n   described a statement in lieu of an amended motion as \"the mechanism by which postconviction counsel informs the motion court of counsel's determination that an amended motion is unnecessary because, through counsel's actions, postconviction counsel believes all facts and claims known to the movant are included in the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657334\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/397/#p399\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657334\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/397/#p399\">\n    at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Such notice [referring to appointed counsel's obligation to present the movant with a copy of the statement in lieu before it is filed] is also a prerequisite to providing the movant a chance to file a reply.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The reply gives the movant an opportunity to respond to postconviction counsel's assertions that all facts and claims known to the movant are included in the pro se motion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .

And because Perkins's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion was not the reply authorized by Rule 24.035(e), the trial court was not obligated to consider the pleading as a reply in the manner directed by\n   <em>\n    Latham\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Point One is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Point Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In Point Two, Perkins argues that the motion court clearly erred in denying the claim asserted in his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion that his guilty plea was involuntary because the plea court failed to advise him of the mandatory minimum and maximum penalties for Count I, the charge to which he pleaded guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Before addressing the merit of Perkins's point on appeal, we address the State's contention that the motion court had no authority to entertain Perkins's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion because it was not timely filed. The State maintains that counsel's filing of a statement in lieu of an amended motion does not grant a post-conviction movant an additional ten days within which to file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion. Additionally, the State argues that the motion court had no authority to grant Perkins an extension of time to file an amended motion when the motion requesting an extension of time was filed after the time to file an amended motion had lapsed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We agree with the State. Although Rule 24.035(e) authorizes the filing of a reply to a statement in lieu of an amended motion, we have already explained that Perkins's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion is not the reply authorized by Rule 24.035(e), and that\n   <em>\n    Latham\n   </em>\n   did not authorize treating the mere assertion of new claims as the reply authorized by Rule 24.035(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   It is true that Perkins's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   amended motion was accompanied by a motion for an extension of time to file the amended motion (which the trial court granted). However, by the time the motion for an extension of time was filed, the time to file an amended motion authorized by Rule 24.035 had expired. In 1990, the Missouri Supreme Court held that under then Rule 29.15(f), the discretion of the motion court to extend the time to file an amended motion must be exercised\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     within the time the amended motion is initially due\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Clemmons v.

We disagree. In\n    <em>\n     Moore\n    </em>\n    , the statement in lieu was found to be tantamount to a confession of abandonment, as appointed counsel's statement indicated that appointed counsel \"reviewed the file 'with the exclusion of the transcripts of the guilty plea hearing, the sentencing hearing ..., and movant's pro se motion....' \"\n    <em>\n     Moore\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10012652\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/934/289/\">\n     934 S.W.2d at 292\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
