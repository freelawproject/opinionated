After a jury trial, the trial court rendered a judgment in favor of landowners Joseph and Debbie Chambers, ruling that (1) the express easements provide the entire tract with an unqualified right of access to a public road via the adjacent landowners' private road and parking lot; and (2) an implied easement by necessity gives the same unqualified right of access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The adjacent landowners, who are burdened by these easements, appeal. First, the burdened landowners contend that the trial court erred in ruling that the express easements provide an unqualified right of access to the entire tract, because the express easements benefit only a portion of the tract and replaced an earlier, abandoned easement that granted access only for uses associated with drilling for oil and gas. Second, the burdened landowners contend that the trial court erred in ruling that the Chambers have an easement by necessity across the private road and parking lot because no evidence demonstrates a present necessity for access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   We conclude that the express easements benefit a portion of the Chambers tract, and not the entire tract, because they unambiguously limit the land benefitted by describing it. We further conclude that the express easements granting access do not limit that access to uses associated with drilling for oil and gas on the benefited tract. Thus, we reject the burdened landowners' contention that access is limited to that needed for oil and gas activity. Because the express easements grant a right of ingress and egress to a portion of-and not the entire-tract, we reverse the judgment declaring that the express easements benefit the entire tract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   With respect to the second contention, challenging the trial court's finding of an easement by necessity, we conclude that no evidence supports a finding of present necessity. Express easements exist and benefit a portion of the tract, and the remainder of the tract is contiguous with the portion benefited by the express easements. Thus, we reverse the judgment granting an implied easement by necessity. We remand the case for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion and for further proceedings to address maintenance costs and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Chambers own 32 acres near, but not touching, Space Center Boulevard (the \"Chambers tract\"). Adjoining the Chambers tract, and between the Chambers tract and Space Center Boulevard, is land owned by Clearpoint Crossing Property Owners Association and 11500 Space Center, LLC, and leased by Cullen's, LLC (the \"Clearpoint tract\"). The Chambers tract is landlocked, lacking direct access to a public road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Exxon Mobil Corporation previously owned the Chambers tract. In November 2007, Exxon abandoned an earlier easement that gave the Chambers tract access across the Clearpoint tract, in exchange\n   for the two express easements at issue in this case. In one easement, Clearpoint conveyed an easement across its land via a private road; in the other, 11500 Space Center conveyed an easement across a parking lot. Together, the two easements gave Exxon access from the Chambers tract to Space Center Boulevard. Both easements are perpetual, irrevocable, and run with the land to benefit Exxon's successors and assigns. The easements state that their purpose was to give \"free and uninterrupted pedestrian and vehicular ingress to and egress from\" a parcel of the Chambers tract identified as \"Drill Site BB,\" which they describe as a 7-acre tract within the larger 32-acre property. Exxon had owned Drill Site BB before acquiring the entire 32 acres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following diagram illustrates the general location of the properties relative to one another (though not to scale):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As the diagram shows, while the express easements state that they exist to provide access to Drill Site BB, that access is indirect, because Drill Site BB is on the opposite end of the Chambers tract from the Clearpoint tract and Drill Site BB's boundaries do not abut the Clearpoint tract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After buying the Chambers tract, the Chambers began using the easements to clear the land in preparation for growing\n   hay on 20 acres and for building air-conditioned storage units on another 5 acres. This lawsuit arose after Clearpoint opposed this use of the easements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties tried their dispute to a jury. Clearpoint and 11500 Space Center contended that the express easements are limited in scope and grant the Chambers access to benefit Drill Site BB, not the entire tract, and for the sole purpose of furthering drilling activities. Clearpoint and 11500 Space Center also disputed whether the Chambers were entitled to an implied easement by necessity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Chambers countered that the express easements grant access to the entirety of their 32-acre property for any purpose. They also maintained that they were entitled to an easement by necessity granting an unqualified right of ingress and egress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The jury found that the express easements granted a right of ingress and egress to benefit the entire Chambers tract. In addition, the jury made three predicate findings in the Chambers's favor as to whether they had a necessity easement. Specifically, the jury found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 the Chambers tract was severed from the Clearpoint tract in May 2004;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 an easement across the Clearpoint tract at that time would have provided access from the Chambers tract to a public road; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 the Chambers tract had no other access to a public road on that date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based on these findings, the jury further found that Clearpoint and 11500 Space Center were entitled to $ 15,000 and $ 25,000, respectively, for reimbursement for maintenance, improvement, and repair of the easements benefiting the Chambers tract. The jury found that both sides had incurred reasonable and necessary attorney's fees: it found that Clearpoint and 11500 Space Center had incurred $ 102,088.29 in fees in the trial court; the jury found that the Chambers incurred $ 55,000 in fees in the trial court and awarded $ 15,000 in the event of an appeal to the court of appeals and $ 20,000 should it be necessary to file a petition for review to the Supreme Court of Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on the jury's verdict, the trial court rendered a judgment declaring that (1) the express easements give the Chambers an unqualified right of ingress and egress to and from their entire property, not just Drill Site BB; and (2) the Chambers have a necessity easement as an additional easement across the Clearpoint tract in the same location and for the same purpose as the express easements. It awarded $ 15,000 to Clearpoint and $ 25,000 to 11500 Space Center in maintenance costs. It awarded the Chambers their attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Express Easements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Clearpoint and 11500 Space Center contend that the trial court erred in ruling that the express easements give the Chambers a right of ingress and egress to and from the entirety of their 32-acre property. Clearpoint and 11500 Space Center further contend that these express easements convey only the rights conferred by the earlier, abandoned easement. The earlier easement provided for access to the 7 acres comprising Drill Site BB and only for drilling-related activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The two November 2007 easements respectively provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   a 50-foot wide road access easement (the \"Easement\") on, over, under, across, along and through the land (hereinafter called the \"Easement Area\") being 25-feet wide on either side of the centerline as depicted and described in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof for the purpose (the \"Easement Purpose\") of providing Grantee, Grantee's invitees, and Grantee's successors and assigns, free and uninterrupted pedestrian and vehicular ingress to and egress from the property described in Exhibit \"B\" attached hereto and made a part hereof (\"Drill Site BB\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   a 50-foot wide road access easement (collectively, the \"Easement\") on, over, under, across, along and through the land (hereinafter called the \"Easement Area\") described in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof for the purpose (the \"Easement Purpose\") of constructing, maintaining, operating, repairing, and removing a road over the Easement Area in order to provide Grantee and Grantee's invitees, successors and assigns, free and uninterrupted pedestrian and vehicular ingress to and egress from the property described in Exhibit \"B\" attached hereto and made a part hereof (\"Drill Site BB\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The language of these easements is plain: it provides the Chambers with the right to go across the Clearpoint tract \"free and uninterrupted\" to access Drill Site BB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Contrary to Clearpoint and 11500 Space Center's contention, these easements do not limit the right of ingress and egress that runs with the Chambers tract to uses associated with drilling-related activities. No language in the easements supports such a limitation. Clearpoint and 11500 Space Center rely on language from the earlier, abandoned easement for this limitation. The abandonment instrument, however, expressly states that two new easements would \"replace\" that earlier one. Accordingly, we reject Clearpoint and 11500 Space Center's reliance on the earlier easement to support a drilling-activity limitation on the right of access that benefits Drill Site BB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But Clearpoint and 11500 Space Center are correct that the express easements grant access to and from Drill Site BB, not anywhere else on the 32-acre tract. Both easements say so, and Exhibit \"B\" to each easement specifically identifies Drill Site BB as a 7-acre parcel, not to include the much larger 32 acres comprising the whole of the Chambers tract. The right to exclude others is an essential attribute of real property ownership; thus, the law protects landowners who convey unambiguous easements by ensuring that the limited access afforded to others will not be interpreted as granting rights of ingress or egress broader than those easements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marcus Cable\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9323252\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/90/697/#p700\">\n    90 S.W.3d at 700, 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We therefore hold that the trial court erred in declaring that the express easements grant access to the entire Chambers tract. As a matter of law, unambiguous easements like these can only be used to access the land specified in the conveyance; they do not entitle the Chambers to directly access other parts of their tract.\n   <em>\n    Storms v.

The Chambers do not identify a particular ambiguity. The express easements are, perhaps, atypical in that the Clearpoint tract is not adjacent to Drill Site BB and the easements consequently grant access indirectly by way of a route through the Chambers tract.

Drill Site BB's northern and eastern boundaries, in turn, adjoin the remainder of the Chambers tract.

Nor does there appear to be any Texas authority deciding who bears the costs of maintenance or repairs when an easement is used by both the dominant and servient estates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The relevant restatement provision, however, states that, unless an easement states otherwise, joint use by the owners of the dominant and servient estates \"gives rise to an obligation to contribute jointly to the costs reasonably incurred for repair and maintenance of the portion of the servient estate or improvements used in common.\" RESTATEMENT ( THIRD ) OF PROPERTY ( SERVITUDES ) \u00a7 4.13(3) (2000);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   28A C.J.S.\n   <em>\n    Easements\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 226 (2008) (\"When joint regular use of the easement is made by both the dominant and servient estates, both estates have the obligation to contribute jointly to the costs of reasonable repairs unless the easement itself indicates otherwise.\"). This rule of joint contribution has been adopted in a significant number of other jurisdictions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Village Green Condo. Ass'n v.

App. 2013) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Supreme Court of Texas likely will adopt the rule of joint contribution articulated in the restatement when called on to decide the question for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   First, the Court has relied on the restatement as an accurate statement of the law of servitudes.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tarr v. Timberwood Park Owners Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657540\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/556/274/#p279\">\n    556 S.W.3d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 279 (Tex. 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    Marcus Cable Assocs. v.

Absent a conflict with existing Texas law, the restatement is a reliable guide for filling this gap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Second, the joint-contribution rule has a substantial common-law pedigree, dating back at least as far as the first half of the Twentieth Century.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bina v. Bina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=239%20N.W.%2068\">\n    239 N.W. 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 71 (Iowa 1931). And the general principle that parties with mutual interests in real property share responsibility for maintenance goes back still further. At common law, a cotenant could compel his fellow cotenants to unite for repairs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Edmund R. Meitus,\n   <em>\n    The Rights, Duties &amp; Liabilities of Tenants in Common Inter Sese\n   </em>\n   , 24 MARQ. L. REV. 148, 152 (1940) (discussing writs\n   <em>\n    de reparatione facienda\n   </em>\n   ). Early in its history, Texas adopted the common law as its own.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   George C. Butte,\n   <em>\n    Early Development of Law &amp; Equity in Texas\n   </em>\n   , 26 YALE L.J. 699, 700 (1917) (Republic of Texas in 1840 adopted English common law so far as it was not inconsistent with Texas's constitution and statutes). The principle that parties who have concurrent rights in the same real property must shoulder the costs necessary to preserve it together remains Texas law today.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wooley v. West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10158227\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/391/157/#p160\">\n    391 S.W.2d 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160 (Tex. App.-Tyler 1965, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (cotenant who incurs costs necessary to preserve property entitled to reimbursement from others to extent that he paid their share of costs);\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10159833\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/363/312/#p316\">\n    363 S.W.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316 (Tex. Civ. App.-Houston 1962, no writ) (cotenants\n   collectively responsible for care and upkeep of property).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Third, the joint-contribution rule is consistent with Texas law in another significant respect. Texas law already imposes on an easement holder a duty to maintain any easement that he alone uses and imposes the costs of doing so solely on him, unless he and the owner of the servient estate have agreed otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberts v. Friendswood Dev. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10007252\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/886/363/#p367\">\n    886 S.W.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 367 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, writ denied) (holder of easement has duty to maintain it);\n   <em>\n    West v.

App.-Austin 1922, writ ref'd) (owner of land subject to easement not obligated to maintain or repair it or bear costs of doing so absent contrary agreement). The joint-contribution rule's default imposition of cost-sharing between the owners of the dominant and servient estates absent a contrary agreement between them thus parallels existing Texas law as to the allocation of costs associated with the maintenance of easements when there is no agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   I therefore concur in the court's denial of en banc reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Justice Goodman, concurring in the denial of en banc reconsideration by separate opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   En Banc Court consists of: Chief Justice Radack and Justices Keyes, Higley, Lloyd, Kelly, Goodman, Landau, Hightower, and Countiss.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
