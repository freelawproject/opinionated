In Issues One, Two, and Three, Endeavor contends the trial court (1) erred by holding there is no debt owed to Endeavor for the Invoices; (2) erred in finding that no debt is owed on the Invoices; and (3) erred in finding the lien claimed by Endeavor had been extinguished. In Issues Four, Five, and Six, Endeavor contends the trial court (4) erred in holding that because the lien had been extinguished, Endeavor could not prevail on its claims; (5) erred in holding it would not be equitable and just for the trial court to award Endeavor attorney's fees; and (6) erred in holding Endeavor is not entitled to recover attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This consolidated case is about an oil-and-gas contractor who went belly up and the subcontractors who are seeking to satisfy invoiced obligations not fully paid in the contractor's bankruptcy. The somewhat convoluted facts are as follows. In 2008, Endeavor Energy Resources, L.P., Big Dog Drilling, and Rig Movers Express performed oil-and-gas-related work on a well known as the A. G. Hill No. 1 Well. The well was located on mineral leases in Winkler County, Texas, known as the Section 6 Leases, and were at the time one-hundred percent owned by Heritage Consolidated Services and Heritage Standard Corporation. Heritage contracted with Lakehills Productions to provide materials and services on the A.G. Hill No. 1 Well, and Lakehills hired Endeavor, Big Dog, and Rig Movers as subcontractors. The Subcontractors performed the work as required and invoiced Lakehills for payment. But Heritage had stopped making payments to Lakehills, and Lakehills in turn did not pay the Subcontractors for their work. On December 23, 2008, the Subcontractors recorded statutory mineral property liens against Heritage and its ownership in the leases and the well, collectively covering $1,178,294.71 in amounts invoiced to Lakehills.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July 2009, having still not\n   received payment on the invoices, the Subcontractors filed separate suits to foreclose the liens, order a judicial sale of the well and the leases, and find Heritage jointly and severally liable for paying the invoiced amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   But before the Subcontractors filed their foreclosure suits, a separate dispute had arisen over an agreement involving the Section 6 Leases between Heritage and three other parties: Jeff Ragland, Dennis Rosini, and George G. Staley. Staley was a well-regarded geologist who had been hired by Heritage to overcome operational problems with the well and make it produce in paying quantities, for which he would receive an interest. In June 2009, as part of a settlement agreement, Heritage assigned working interests in the leases and well to the parties, with Staley receiving a 17.75 percent interest and Rosini and Ragland each receiving respective one-percent interests. Rosini and Ragland subsequently assigned their one-percent interests to Staley, leaving Staley with a 19.75 percent interest in the Heritage leases. Because the liens had been filed before these assignments were made, Staley took the assignments subject to the liens, but Staley never personally assumed an obligation to pay the invoices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Subcontractors' suits to foreclose their liens against Heritage proceeded, and Staley and the others were added as Heritage's successors in interest. More than a year later in September 2010, while those suits were still pending, Heritage filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The state trial court severed out the Subcontractors claims against Heritage to allow them to continue to pursue their claims against the remaining defendants in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Now proceeding in bankruptcy court, the Subcontractors filed proofs of claim to recover the invoiced amounts from Heritage. They also jointly filed an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court regarding the priority, and validity, of their respective debts and liens. Heritage moved for summary judgment in the adversary proceeding, claiming it did not owe the invoiced amounts and that the Subcontractors' liens were invalid. The bankruptcy court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of Heritage on all claims, and its decision was affirmed on appeal to the federal district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Fifth Circuit reversed, finding a fact question existed regarding whether Heritage owed the debt to the Subcontractors, and the case was remanded to the bankruptcy court for a determination of the validity of the debts. In June 2015, Heritage and the Subcontractors reached a settlement agreement to dismiss the adversary proceedings. This agreement provided that Heritage would acknowledge its liability for the debts, and the total amount owed to the Subcontractors would be reduced to a stipulated amount of $1,493,628.21, which represented the original invoiced amounts plus fifty percent of their prepetition interest and attorney's fees. It also provided that $300,000 of the Stipulated Amount would be an allowed secured claim in Heritage's bankruptcy, thus ensuring its payment, and the remaining $1,193,628.21 owed would be classified as a general unsecured claim. Paragraph seven of the agreement provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   7. Upon approval of this Stipulation, the parties agree that a dismissal with prejudice shall be filed in the Adversary Proceeding, with each party bearing their own costs and attorneys' fees and further agree that, other than the continued indebtedness of the Stipulated Amount under the terms of this Stipulation, Heritage and the Trustee on the one hand, and Endeavor and Acme on the other, release each other and their respective counsel, agents, subsidiaries, and affiliates from all claims, causes of action, rights, demands, actions, costs, judgments, expenses, damages and liabilities whatsoever, at law or in equity, whether known or unknown, that arise out of or relate to the facts and circumstances made the basis of the Adversary Proceeding, or that were or could have been asserted in the Adversary Proceeding and/or the Proofs of Claim. In that regard, Endeavor and Acme acknowledge and agree that their recovery hereunder shall be in full and final satisfaction of their putative claims and liens against any interests of Heritage and/or the Trust in Section 6 Assets, and they shall not assert or enforce any claims and liens against any such interests, including, without limitation, any interest currently attributed to Trius in Section 6 Assets and/or recovered by the Trust through enforcement of claims against Trius in Section 6 Assets. This release is not intended to release any claims or liens owned or held by Endeavor or Acme against George Staley, J.R. Operating Company, Dennis Rosini and their successors and assigns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The bankruptcy court approved this settlement in August 2015, and the Subcontractors received payment from Heritage in accordance with the Stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Subcontractors then returned to state court to attempt to foreclose on the interest held by Staley, who by this point had passed away and had left the interest to his wife, Sandra H. Staley, and to recover attorney's fees. The trial court consolidated the Subcontractors' suits and a bench trial was held in March 2017 on partially stipulated facts. The parties stipulated that Staley was not personally liable\n   for the debts on the invoiced amounts and that the Subcontractors were only seeking a judgment to foreclose the liens as to Staley's interest in the well. At trial, Staley asserted the liens had been extinguished because the underlying debt had been extinguished-that the Subcontractors had expressly released the underlying debt of the invoiced amounts owed by Heritage in exchange for a priority interest in the bankruptcy proceeding and an allowance of the remaining balance as an unsecured claim, which Heritage had otherwise contested it owed. Staley contended the only claim reserved against her and her late husband's estate by the release was a claim for unjust enrichment, and because no lien existed against Staley the line reserving a lien against him was without effect. The Subcontractors in turn argued the Stipulation was not a release of the underlying debt of the invoiced amounts but merely an agreement to priority status in the bankruptcy. At trial, the Subcontractors orally agreed to withdraw their claim for unjust enrichment, which was their only claim against Staley personally. The trial court held in favor of Staley, finding no debt was owed to the Subcontractors on the invoiced amounts due to the Stipulation Agreement in the bankruptcy. Because no debt was owed to the Subcontractors on the invoiced amounts, the court concluded the lien was extinguished and the plaintiffs could not succeed on their claims and foreclose on Staley's interest. It also concluded that because the Subcontractors could not succeed on their claims, they were not entitled to attorney's fees. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    The Underlying Debt and the Stipulation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Issues One, Two, and Three, Endeavor contends the trial court erred in concluding the debts of the Invoiced Amounts were no longer owed because the underlying debt and lien were extinguished by the bankruptcy stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Endeavor frames the first three issues as legal and factual sufficiency challenges to the trial court's findings on the effect of the settlement agreement on the underlying debt and its lien on the mineral lease.

Citing\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   , Endeavor contends the Stipulation did not contain express language releasing the lien or underlying indebtedness, and therefore the debts could not have been extinguished. Alternatively, Endeavor contends the language in paragraph seven specifically reserving their \"claims and liens\" against George Staley establishes that it was not the mutual intent of the parties to release the underlying debt. Endeavor also points to a line in the Stipulation reserving \"the continuing indebtedness of the Stipulated Amount,\" to show the debt of the Invoiced Amounts was not intended to be extinguished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The present case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   , the agreement reached by the corporation and lien claimants provided that a judgment would not be enforced against the corporation, dismissed the pending suit without prejudice, and expressly stated ownership of the debt and liens would be transferred to a trustee who would seek to foreclose the liens.\n   <em>\n    Atkins Petroleum Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11750510\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/799/463/#p468\">\n    799 S.W.2d at 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But here, the language of the Stipulation expressly releases not only the underlying debt owed by Heritage but the lien against Heritage as well. The Stipulation states\n   Endeavor's \"recovery\"-Heritage's acknowledgment of the debt's validity, the priority status in bankruptcy of part of the Stipulated Amount, and the rest of the Stipulated Amount as an unsecured claim-would \"be in full and final satisfaction of their putative claims and liens against any interests of Heritage and/or the Trust in [Section 6 leases and A. G. Hill No. 1 Well]....\" The Stipulation also stated each side released the other from all claims whatsoever \"that arise out of or relate to the facts and circumstances made the basis of the Adversary Proceeding, or that were or could have been asserted in the Adversary Proceeding and/or the Proofs of Claim.\" This is the type of language we acknowledged in\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   would demonstrate a mutual intent to discharge a debt by accord and satisfaction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11750510\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/799/463/#p468\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 468. While Endeavor contends the language reserving \"claims and liens\" held against Staley preserves the debt and lien, the only lien on record is against Heritage for the debt of the Invoiced Amounts, which was specifically reduced to the Stipulated Amount by the terms of the Stipulation. If Staley had received his interest in the well prior to the perfection of the mechanic's lien, and if the lien affidavit had been perfected as to\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   Heritage and Staley, then perhaps Endeavor could argue severance and have reserved a right to proceed separately against Staley's interest after settling with Heritage in bankruptcy court. Instead, the Stipulate Amount was given partial priority in the bankruptcy, thus ensuring payment by Heritage of at least some part of that amount, in exchange for \"full and final satisfaction\" of their claims and liens against Heritage. Thus, by its terms, the Stipulation was an accord and satisfaction because it was the mutual intent of the parties \"that payment of the new amount will amount to full satisfaction of the existing claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Atkins Petroleum Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11750510\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/799/463/#p468\">\n    799 S.W.2d at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Endeavor contends that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   requires us to presume the lien holder did whatever was to the lien holder's advantage, and it would not be to Endeavor's advantage to release the entire debt for only a fraction of what it was owed. But this is a misreading of\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   . There, we held the issue of whether a merger of the estates extinguished the debt and liens was controlled by the intention of the lienholder, as he has the election to keep it alive, and in case of ambiguity as to his intent it would be presumed he intended whatever was to his advantage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atkins Petroleum Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11750510\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/799/463/#p468\">\n    799 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   468 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   50 Tex.Jur.3d Liens, \u00a7 28 (1986) ). The issue of merger is not contended here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Endeavor further asserts their lien rights could not be affected by a subsequent agreement, citing the Fifth Circuit's holding in the case involving Heritage's bankruptcy, where that court interpreted Texas law and our holding in\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   . Endeavor asserts the court there held that a subsequent agreement cannot alter or change a lien holder's rights, and therefore nothing in the Stipulation could affect Endeavor's lien. This is, however, a misreading of the Fifth Circuit's reasoning. The passage cited by Endeavor from that case dealt with whether the Subcontractors' status as subcontractors could be affected by a subsequent agreement\n   between the main contractor and other interest holders, a point that was relevant to their ability to enforce a lien against Heritage under Section 56 of the Property Code.\n   <em>\n    In re Heritage Consol., L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231801,4184028\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/507/\">\n    765 F.3d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 515-16 (5th Cir. 2014). The Fifth Circuit held the subsequent agreement did not affect their status as subcontractors, quoting our decision in\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   that the lien claimants' status cannot be converted \"by another contract to which they are not privy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231801,4184028\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/507/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 516 (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atkins Petroleum Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11750510\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/799/463/#p468\">\n    799 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   465-66 ). By contrast, Endeavor was a party to the agreement here, and its status as a lien holder can be changed by an accord and satisfaction because Texas law provides that satisfaction of a debt automatically extinguishes a lien securing that debt.\n   <em>\n    Jarvis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095219\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/390/631/#p642\">\n    390 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   642 ;\n   <em>\n    Clayton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10278772\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/33/787/#p789\">\n    33 S.W.2d at 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, Endeavor also asserts liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected by discharge, and therefore, any agreement between it and Heritage in the bankruptcy could not have affected the lien. Indeed, liens do pass through bankruptcy under certain circumstances, as when they are not provided for and paid in full under a confirmed plan or are not extinguished by operation of Section 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    In re Kleibrink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3650258\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/346/734/#p748\">\n    346 B.R. 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 748 (Bankr.

But here, as we have already noted, the Stipulation provided that the acceptance of liability by Heritage and the granting of the priority status of part of the Stipulated Amount would \"be in full and final satisfaction of their putative claims and liens against any interests of Heritage....\" A secured-lien holder in bankruptcy can consent to the discharge of his lien via agreement and secured-lien holders commonly do so.\n   <em>\n    Matter of Penrod\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413464,6120530\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/50/459/\">\n    50 F.3d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 462-63 (7th Cir. 1995) (\"[S]ecured creditors commonly give up their preexisting liens for other interests in the reorganized firm.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Accordingly, because Endeavor's debt was extinguished via the Stipulation, the trial court did not err in concluding Endeavor could not foreclose on its putative lien against Staley's interest.

The trial court concluded, \"It would not be equitable and just for the Court to award attorneys' fees to Plaintiff when Plaintiff has failed to prevail on its claims.\" Section 53.156 of the Texas Property Code requires a court to award costs and attorney's fees in an action to foreclose a lien as it deems \"are equitable and just.\" TEX.PROP.CODE ANN. \u00a7 53.156.
