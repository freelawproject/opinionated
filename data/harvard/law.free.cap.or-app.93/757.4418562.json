Dept. v. Lauffenberger, </em>88 Or App 642, 746 P2d 259 (1987), which affirmed the juvenile court\u2019s decision to grant custody of his child to the maternal grandparents, subject to father\u2019s right of visitation. He argues that we applied the wrong standard when we stated that \u201cit is in the best interests of the child to remain with her grandparents.\u201d 88 Or App at 646.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We grant the petition in order to reconsider our decision in the light of <em>Hruby and Hruby, </em>304 Or 500, 738 P2d 977 (1987), which was decided after our initial opinion in this case. We adhere to our original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Our original opinion cited ORS 419.474(2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the governing standard and said that the statute imposes a \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d test. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Lauffenberger, supra, </em>88 Or App at 645. We hold that ORS 419.474(2) and ORS 419.507(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are the governing law, that those statutes establish a \u201cbest interests\u201d standard, and that nothing in <em>Hruby and Hruby, supra, </em>changes those principles. That being so, we need only explain why <em>Hruby </em>does not apply in order to adhere to our former opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\"><em>Hruby </em>involved a private custody dispute between a parent and a non-parent. In contrast, in the present case, the juvenile court took jurisdiction of the child in 1984 and made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>her a ward of the court in early 1985. She was committed to the legal custody of CSD, which placed her with her grandparents under supervision by CSD. <em>See generally </em>ORS 419.507. When the juvenile court took jurisdiction, pursuant to ORS 419.476(1)(e),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it found that the child\u2019s physical and emotional needs were not being met.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ORS 419.500. The juvenile court\u2019s decisions to take jurisdiction, to make the child a ward, and to place her in the temporary custody of CSD have not been challenged directly, nor have the findings that underlie those decisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Juvenile court jurisdiction, wardship, and CSD custody mean two things. First, they mean that the juvenile court statutes, rather than the common law that was the subject of <em>Hruby, </em>dictate the basis for a custody decision. Second, they mean that, even if the common law is pertinent, the predicate finding that the child\u2019s basic needs were not met by her parents weakens, and perhaps destroys altogether, the \u201ccompelling\u201d presumption in their favor on which <em>Hruby </em>rests and on which father relies here. The court in <em>Hruby </em>appeared to recognize both distinctions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">\u201cIn child custody disputes between natural parents <em>and other private parties, </em>this court early resolved the tension between the custodial rights of natural parents and the <em>parens patriae </em>power of the state by applying some variant formulation of the rule that a natural parent was entitled to the custody of his or her children <em>unless that parent was unfit or unable to care for the children properly; absent such a threat to the children\u2019s welfare, </em>their interests, much less the interests of nonparents seeking their custody, were of no concern.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number><em>\u201c4 Cf. </em>ORS 419.476(1) (definition of children within jurisdiction of juvenile court) * * 304 Or at 506. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In other words, after the child has been \u201cremoved from the control of the parents,\u201d ORS 419.474(2), and has become a ward of the court, ORS 419.507(1), the presumption in favor of the biological parents ceases to apply. Presumably those events occurred because the child was at risk. <em>See Hruby and Hruby, supra, </em>304 Or at 510. At a minimum, <em>Hruby </em>left open the question of whether it applies to juvenile proceedings and did not invite the use of \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d as the controlling standard in such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Moreover, the <em>Hruby </em>court explained that ORS 109.119, the statute that allowed the non-parents in both <em>Hruby </em>and this case to intervene, is procedural only and does not alter the substantive law regarding who should have custody of the child. 304 Or at 515. By contrast, ORS 419.474(2), although general in nature, applies substantively to the \u201ccare, guidance and control\u201d of this child. Similarly, ORS 419.507(1) states a substantive rule for placement of a child who is a ward of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Father argues that the phrase \u201cpreferably in the child\u2019s own home,\u201d in ORS 419.474(2), creates a preference for him that parallels the common law preference expressed in <em>Hruby. </em>We disagree. The statute suggests continuity for the child, but the phrase in question does <em>not </em>mention the parents.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The child is now eight-and-a-half; since she was two, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>she has lived in her grandparents\u2019 home continuously, and, even before that, she spent much of her time there. The child\u2019s \u201cown home\u201d is her grandparents\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Two themes permeate ORS chapter 419. First, before the aid of the juvenile court can be invoked, it must be proved that the parents have failed their child. Second, and consequently, the best interests of that neglected or damaged child are the court\u2019s compass in its intervention. The statutes thus reflect a tension between competing values: unity of the nuclear family and welfare of the child. The juvenile court must weigh all appropriate factors \u2014 such as the child\u2019s age and sex, the problem that led to the juvenile court proceeding, the level of parental cooperation with treatment plans, and continuity of placement \u2014 none of which has a \u201ccompelling\u201d priority over other factors. To hold that a \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d standard applies, as the dissent urges, would be to change direction and run contrary to the course that the legislature has set.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">In summary, <em>Hruby </em>does not apply. ORS 419.474(2) and ORS 419.507(1) do. ORS 419.474(2) directs the juvenile court to promote \u201cthe child\u2019s welfare\u201d and to \u201csecure for the child care that best meets the needs of the child.\u201d ORS 419.507(1), which governs placement of children who are made wards of the court, requires the juvenile court to place the child where \u201cit would be in the best interest and welfare of the child.\u201d The juvenile court applied that standard, and so did our original opinion. For that reason, we adhere to that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Reconsideration granted; former opinion adhered to.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\"> In his brief and his petition for review, father also objects to the juvenile court\u2019s failure to hear witnesses. The court acted on the basis of representations by counsel for both parties as to what the evidence would show, as well as exhibits and the pleadings, affidavits, and other documents in the court\u2019s case file. The court did not, as father apparently would have liked, hear witnesses. However, father did not make that objection to the juvenile court. Therefore, we need not address it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\"> ORS 419.474(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-9\">\u201cThe provisions of ORS 419.472 to 419.597, 419.800 to 419.839 shall be liberally construed to the end that a child coming within the jurisdiction of the court may receive such care, guidance and control, preferably in the child\u2019s own home, as will lead to the child\u2019s welfare and the best interest of the public, and that when a child is removed from the control of the parents of the child the court may secure for the child care that best meets the needs of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b801-10\"> ORS 419.507(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-11\">\u201cA child found to be within the jurisdiction of the court as provided in ORS .419.476(1), may be made a ward of the court.

Reflow, Seabert, </em>24 Or App 365, 545 P2d 894, <em>rev den </em>(1976), used \u201cbest interests,\u201d while <em>State ex rel. Juv.

In <em>Reflow, </em>we expressly noted \u201cthat continuity in one unchanging family environment, especially for young children, is probably the most important single element necessary to a child\u2019s wholesome development.\u201d 24 Or App at 373. G. <em>W. </em>also emphasized continuity in its analysis. 27 Or App at 553. In <em>Reflow, </em>the child was living with non-parents, to whom we awarded custody; in G. <em>W., </em>it was the father in whose home the child lived who obtained custody. <em>G.W. </em>is also factually distinguishable from the present case in additional respects; for example, the child\u2019s three siblings had been awarded to the father, and the sole basis for the trial court\u2019s award of custody to an aunt and uncle appears to have been the child\u2019s preference. Our original opinion in this case, similarly, relied on the juvenile court\u2019s explanation that its custody decision \u201cwas based on the need for stability and continuity.\u201d <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Lauffenberger, supra, </em>88 Or App at 644.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b804-7\">DEITS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Axv\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">I concur with the majority opinion of Judge Graber that, under ORS 419.474(2) and ORS 419.507(1), the applicable standard in this case is the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d and that, under that standard, the child should remain with her grandparents. However, in my opinion, even if the test is not \u201cbest interests of the child,\u201d and the standard articulated in <em>Hruby and Hruby, </em>304 Or 500, 738 P2d 977 (1987), applies, the result should be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">In <em>Hruby, </em>the court established the standard for determining custody involving a natural parent and a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>party: The natural parent should have custody unless there is a compelling reason not to award custody to the parent. The court recognized that the standard for determining custody in this type of case has varied considerably and has not been precisely articulated. The standard, sometimes used in the past, that a natural parent must be shown to be unfit before custody will be denied, was clearly rejected. The court also rejected the standard at the other end of the spectrum, \u201cthe best interests of the child,\u201d which allows consideration only of the needs of the child. Instead, the court adopted a test between those two extremes: A fit parent is entitled to custody unless there are \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for placing the child in the custody of another. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-4\">\u201cWe do not use the adjective \u2018compelling\u2019 in an effort to provide more precision to our holding through the use of that word in other contexts. We might have as easily used words such as \u2018good cause,\u2019 <em>Ex parte Barnes, supra, </em>54 Or at 550, or \u2018most cogent,\u2019 <em>Gheen v. Gheen, supra, </em>247 Or at 19. Because of the variety of circumstances in which custody disputes arise, any standard for determining custody will of necessity be somewhat vague. We use \u2018compelling\u2019 to emphasize that in a custody dispute between a natural parent and some other person, a court should not be concerned with attempting to maximize a child\u2019s welfare, but with determining whether the child will receive adequate care and love from its natural parent and whether the child will be otherwise unduly harmed, physically or psychologically, by giving custody to the natural parent.\u201d 304 Or at 510.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The circumstances of this case are quite distinguishable from the facts in <em>Hruby. </em>In that case, the parents separated two months after the child\u2019s birth. Because neither parent was then able to care for the child, the father placed the child with his sister. The father sought and obtained custody of the child in the dissolution judgment. He was in the Navy and was stationed in a succession of West Coast cities. Because of that, his sister continued to care for the child. However, he visited the child frequently and regularly paid his sister support for the child. Even though the child developed a parent-child relationship with her aunt and uncle, she also had an emotional attachment to her father. In 1985, the father remarried and sought to regain physical custody of his child. The court concluded that there was no compelling reason not to give him custody and did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>In this case, the child was with her parents for approximately the first two years of her life. However, during that time, she stayed with her maternal grandparents for extended periods of time. After the parents separated in 1982, she began living with the grandparents permanently. Father entered the military service in March, 1983. Both before entering the military and during his service, he had very limited contact with the child. In January, 1984, CSD filed a petition seeking jurisdiction over the child, alleging that both parents had failed to provide for her physical and emotional needs and that she was suffering from emotional problems resulting from the lack of a stable parent figure and a stable living situation. Father was aware of that proceeding and the concerns of CSD. He appeared at the first hearing on the matter. However, he did not appear at any subsequent hearings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In April, 1984, the trial court placed the child in the temporary custody of the grandparents. In August, 1984, the court held that the jurisdictional allegations in CSD\u2019s January, 1984, petition were proven and found the child to be within the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">In September, 1984, CSD began writing to father, asking him to participate in the development of a permanent plan for the child. In June, 1985, CSD wrote to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-5\">\u201cThe purpose of this letter is to emphasize Children\u2019s Services Division\u2019s eagerness to work with you so that you may be in a position to provide a permanent home for Brenda. It is imperative that a permanent home, preferably with her parent, be found for her soon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\">\u201cIn the past few months I have mailed six letters. You have responded to only one. I made arrangements to have Children\u2019s Services in Umatilla County work with you and you did not show for their appointments. I set up a visitation schedule; as you requested, and you appeared for only one visit. I arranged to meet with you on a Saturday, which was the time you suggested and you did not appear. I am very concerned with your overall lack of progress and your lack of follow through with commitments you have made. Time is running out and this pattern must not continue if you expect to regain custody of Brenda!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>\u201cAs I have stated previously, you have the right to a review hearing if you disagree with Children\u2019s Services Division\u2019s actions or wish Court clarification of an issue regarding your child. Please inform me if you wish to have a hearing scheduled. In addition, please be advised that you have the right to have an attorney. If you are without funds, one can be appointed to represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-4\"><em>\u201cIF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU BEFORE JULY 15, 1985, </em>to develop a plan for Brenda I WILL FILE A TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS PETITION, in order to free Brenda for adoption.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">CSD did file a petition to terminate father\u2019s parental rights, but, in April, 1986, the court denied the petition. In that proceeding, CSD recommended that custody remain with the grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Father also failed to provide financial support for the child. While in the military service he provided support only after CSD secured a military allotment for the child. During the six months after leaving the service in January, 1986, he had provided only $100 to the grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Although father was aware of CSD\u2019s serious concerns about the welfare of his daughter, which eventually resulted in her being made a ward of the court, he did virtually nothing. The only explanation he offered as to why he did not maintain contact with the child or participate in CSD\u2019s planning for her was that he was in the military service on a secret mission. As explained by his attorney in a memorandum accompanying father\u2019s trial court motion to reconsider: \u201cFather was assigned to a secret mission, on 24-hour call and could not travel more than 50 miles without advance permission.\u201d However, even assuming that father\u2019s ability to travel was limited, he failed to maintain any contact with his child or CSD.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Applying the <em>Hruby </em>standard, I conclude that father\u2019s lack of commitment to or interest in his child\u2019s well being for a substantial period constitutes a compelling reason not to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>custody to him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Just as a parent\u2019s inadequate care of a child may support a conclusion that giving that parent custody would be harmful, a parent\u2019s total lack of care or concern for a child for an extended period of time may also support that conclusion. Father\u2019s almost total absence from this child\u2019s life for an extended period outweighs his current good intentions. Father\u2019s track record of care and concern for his daughter, considered together with the fact that father\u2019s absence has resulted in the development of a stable living situation for her with the grandparents, convince me that \u201cthe child [would not] receive adequate care and love from his natural parent\u201d or that the child would be otherwise \u201cunduly harmed, physically or psychologically by giving custody to the natural parent.\u201d <em>Hruby and Hruby, supra, </em>304 Or at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The dissent completely disregards father\u2019s past history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-5\">\u201cFather\u2019s past inattentiveness toward his child is not determinative of his present intentions and abilities. Under <em>Hruby, </em>we should evaluate father\u2019s current capacity and intentions.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Although it cannot be assumed that a person who has not properly carried out parental responsibilities in the past will never reform, the \u201ctrack record\u201d is highly relevant to determining whether he can provide adequate care and love to the child now. Our decision here, as in most cases, must be based on what has occurred in the past, regardless of how much we would like to believe a parent\u2019s promise to \u201cdo better next time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Because our previous decision is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s recent clarification of the standard applicable in a custody dispute between a natural parent and a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>party, I would allow the petition for reconsideration and adhere to our former decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Richardson, J., joins in this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> Father appeared at the first hearing and requested the appointment of counsel. The affidavit supporting the request showed his military pay to be $900 per month. His request was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-9\"> The dissent does not dispute that father\u2019s absence or failure to provide support occurred, but asserts that we should not use that against father because, on this limited record, we do not know the reasons for father\u2019s actions. However, father had the opportunity to offer an explanation of his conduct at the hearing. Although, as the dissent points out, the trial court limited the hearing, father did not object to the procedures and did not attempt to offer evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\"> The dissent errs in its application of the <em>Hruby </em>standard by deciding that, because the father in this case is presently \u201cfit,\u201d there is no compelling reason not to award him custody.

Under <em>Hruby, </em>a fit parent may be denied custody if there is good cause to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b808-9\"> The dissent characterizes father\u2019s behavior as \u201cinattentiveness.\u201d I question whether, if a mother had acted as father has in this case, having had virtually no contact with his child, having failed to provide any nurturing whatsoever for the child and having failed to cooperate in a meaningful way with CSD, her behavior would be called \u201cinattentiveness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b809-5\">NEWMAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AK9\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In our original opinion, <em>State ex rel Juv.

We might have as easily used words such as \u2018good cause,\u2019 <em>Ex parte Barnes, supra, </em>54 Or at 550, or \u2018most cogent,\u2019 <em>Gheen v. Gheen, supra, </em>247 Or at 19. Because of the variety of circumstances in which custody disputes arise, any standard for determining custody will of necessity be somewhat vague. <em>We use \u2018compelling\u2019 to emphasize that in a custody dispute between a natural parent and some other person, a court should not be concerned with attempting to maximize a child\u2019s welfare, but with determining whether the child will receive adequate care and love from its natural parent and whether the child will be otherwise unduly harmed, physically or psychologically, by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number><em>giving custody to the natural parent.\u201d </em>304 Or at 510. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">To establish a \u201ccompelling reason,\u201d the evidence must show that the child will <em>not </em>receive adequate care and love from its natural parent or will be unduly harmed physically or psychologically by giving custody to the natural parent. The burden is on the party who seeks to deprive the natural parent of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The juvenile court took jurisdiction of the child in 1984. It made her a ward of the court in 1985 and gave temporary custody to CSD. The majority recognizes that that disposition was temporary. 93 Or App at 760. <em>See </em>ORS 419.576. Then, after completion of CSD\u2019s unsuccessful proceeding in April, 1986, to terminate father\u2019s parental rights, the court conducted the dispositional hearing from which father appeals. The grandparents intervened under ORS 109.119 and asked for custody. Father asked that the child be placed in his custody. CSD recommended that the court place the child in the grandparents\u2019 custody. The prior jurisdictional rulings do not change the fundamental dispositional issue \u2014 whether father or the maternal grandparents should have custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The language of <em>Hruby </em>is broad:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">\u201cIn child custody disputes between natural parents and other private parties, this court early resolved the tension between the custodial rights of natural parents and the <em>parents patriae </em>power of the state by applying some variant formulation of the rule that a natural parent was entitled to the custody of his or her children unless that parent was unfit or unable to care for the children properly; absent such a threat to the children\u2019s welfare, their interests, much less the interests of non-parents seeking their custody, were of no concern.\u201d 304 Or at 506.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Father, as the natural parent, still has a preferential right to custody. His rights also have constitutional underpinnings. \u201cThe fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State.\u201d <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 US 745, 753, 102 S Ct 1388, 71 L Ed 2d 599 (1982); <em>see also State v. McMaster, </em>259 Or 291, 486 P2d 567 (1971). The proceeding under ORS 419.476(1) (e) that made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the child a ward of the juvenile court did not terminate father\u2019s parental rights. Indeed, in the termination proceeding in April, 1986, the court dismissed CSD\u2019s petition to terminate father\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Without citation of authority, the majority erroneously holds that \u201cafter the child has been \u2018removed from the control of the parents,\u2019 ORS 419.474(2), and has become a ward of the court, ORS 419.507(1), the presumption in favor of the biological parent ceases to apply.\u201d 93 Or App at 761. Then it quickly backs away from this assertion, stating that \u201cat a minimum, <em>Hruby </em>left open the question of whether it applies to juvenile proceedings.\u201d 93 Or App at 761. The <em>Hruby </em>standard, however, applies even if the child is a ward of the juvenile court, CSD has temporary custody and recommends that the third parties \u2014 the grandparents \u2014 receive custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the natural parent\u2019s right to a custody preference against third parties does not disappear if the juvenile court finds that the child is within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">ORS chapter 419.474(2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> recognizes the natural parent\u2019s preference when it states that placement is to be \u201cpreferably in the child\u2019s own home.\u201d In <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. G. W., </em>27 Or App 547, 551, 556 P2d 993 (1976), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">\u201cThe general rule is that preference in placement, if a child is within the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction, is to be given to the natural parent. <em>State v. Peterson, </em>3 Or App 52, 471 P2d 853 (1970); <em>Prindel v. Collins, 4 </em>Or App 618, 481 P2d 540 (1971). <em>[Former] </em>ORS 419.474(2) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">\u2018The provisions of <em>[former] </em>ORS 419.472 to 419.590, 419.800 to 419.480 and subsection (2) of 419.990 shall be liberally construed to the end that a child coming within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>the jurisdiction of the court may receive such care, guidance and control, <em>preferably in his own home, </em>as will lead to the child\u2019s welfare and the best interest of the public, and that when a child is removed from the control of his parents the court may secure for him care that best meets the needs of the child.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-4\">\u201cIn <em>Prindel, </em>we affirmed the court\u2019s order which \u2018gave due consideration to that legislatively declared policy\u2019 (4 Or App at 620) by awarding custody to the child\u2019s fit natural mother rather than continuing custody with the child\u2019s paternal grandparents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Moreover, although ORS 109.119, under which the grandparents intervened here and the aunt intervened in <em>Hruby, </em>refers to the \u201cbest interests of the child,\u201d <em>Hruby </em>nevertheless adopted a standard of \u201ccompelling reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The majority erroneously asserts that the grandparents should get custody now because the juvenile court found that the child\u2019s emotional and physical needs were not being met in 1985, when it made the child a ward of the court. 93 Or App at 760. In <em>this </em>proceeding in 1986 \u2014 the dispositional <em>proceeding </em>\u2014 the <em>court found that the father was fit. </em>Moreover, it did not find or believe that the child would not receive adequate care or love from father or would be unduly harmed by placement with him. It stated that it could \u201cjust as easily\u201d have awarded custody to father and that \u201cthat is the best interest for this child.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Father\u2019s <em>past </em>inattentiveness toward his child is not determinative of his present intentions and abilities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under <em>Hruby, </em>we should evaluate father\u2019s current capacity and intentions. He has attended parenting classes and has otherwise cooperated with CSD. He has created a stable home environment with his new wife and children. The record suggests strongly the conclusion that father has matured.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The reason that the trial court gave for awarding custody to the grandparents was that they could best provide the child with a stable home. Yet in <em>Hruby, </em>where the child also had not known a home with the father, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">\u201c[C]ourts will deprive natural parents of the custody of their children only in order to protect the children from some compelling threat to their present or future well-being. Apart from these concerns, it is irrelevant to the court\u2019s custody determination that the children might have a better home or might have greater financial, educational or social opportunities in the custody of another.\u201d 304 Or at 509.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The record here does not show a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d to deny father custody of his own child.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">In our original opinion, we erroneously applied a \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard. The majority opinion on reconsideration continues that error. We should have given, and should now give, preference to father over the grandparents, because a compelling reason to the contrary is absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b813-9\">Buttler and Warden, JJ., and Van Hoomissen, Judge pro tempore, join in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\"> The child was made a ward of the court under ORS 419.476(l)(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b811-8\"> <em>Hruby </em>states that ORS Chapter 419, the juvenile court statute, also implicitly recognizes the natural parent\u2019s common law right to custody of his children. 304 Or at 505 n 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b811-9\"> ORS 419.474(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-10\">\u201cThe provisions of ORS 419.472 to 419.597, 419.800 to 419.839 shall be liberally construed to the end that a child coming within the jurisdiction of the court may receive such care, guidance and control, preferably in the child\u2019s own home, as will lead to the child\u2019s welfare and the best interest of the public, and that when a child is removed from the control of the parents of the child the court may secure for the child care that best meets the needs of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\"> The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">\u201cYou see, [the grandparents] have a track record, and if you bet on a horse and you bet on one that ran eight races and won all eight races then you feel pretty safe putting a couple of bucks on the nose on that one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-9\">\u201c[Father] has no track record, so we are going to find out, ladies and gentlemen.

In response to CSD inquiries regarding placement and custody of his daughter, he stated that he would not consent to an adoption but that in early 1985 he did not consider himself to be an appropriate placement for his daughter, because he had to travel back and forth between Maryland and Oregon on his military duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
