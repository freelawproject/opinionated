Petitioner\u2019s replication, <em>see </em>ORS 34.670, sets forth the causes of the alleged improper ventilation and circulation and then alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201cThe effects of the stale and unclean air on [p]etitioner are substantial. She awakens each morning with clogged sinuses and a severe headache. [Her] skin is constantly dry and irritated and she has a persistent sore throat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">She does not allege that she did not suffer the ailments before her confinement at OWCC, that her physical ailments are linked medically to the lack of ventilation and circulation of air or that she has sought medical treatment that has failed to alleviate her ailments. She therefore has failed to state ultimate facts sufficient to constitute a basis for habeas corpus relief. <em>Scott v.

Cupp, </em>283 Or 21, 581 P2d 934 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
