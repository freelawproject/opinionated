At the Reformation they were withdrawn from the church, and paupers thrown upon the public. Henry 8 was glad to find some other way of supporting them, and Elizabeth encouraged private persons to found charities with the same view. But-since her day, the source of the power .which chancery has exercised over charities in England has been the prerogative of the crown, and this prerogative law never could have been introduced into the colonies. Jurisdiction over the three subjects of lunatics, infants, and charities. has always gone together, and been claimed because the king is said to be <em>parens patrie. </em>1 Bla. Com. 303; 3 Bla. Com. 47.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-13\">The king, in his judicial capacity, through the chancellor, and exercising an extraordinary jurisdiction, takes control of these things. 3 Bla.

Sir Francis More, 188; Hobart, 138; 13 Vesey, 248.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-16\">It must be an extra-judicial function to set aside a will. How <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>could this power have passed over to a revolutionized and republican state ? In England, if the chancellor could not entertain jurisdiction, he referred the case to the king, who acted under his sign manual, but to whom can an American chancellor refer it? In air elective-republic it is impossible to have 'such a person. These vague charities cannot be sustained unless by virtue of some peculiar law, and it is an alarming event that two millions of properly are put into perpetual mortmain for the benefit of persons not even incorporated, not even a religious or mechanical society.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-5\">\u2022 The municipal law of Pennsylvania consists of the law of nations, the common law of England, and some ofithe British statutes. The report of the judges made to the legislature in 1808, (3 Binney, 620,) says that parts of the statutes 7 Edward 1; 13 Edward 1; 15 Richard 2 3 and 23 Henry 8, commonly called statutes of mortmain, are in force in the state. 1 Dallas, 67, 70, 444, 114.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-6\">The old remedy of assize was revived because the statute of Edward was considered to be in force in consequence of the report. 17 Serg. and Rawle, 174. The preface to the report says it was necessary to examine the -whole code. But the statute of Elizabeth is not included amongst those m ferae. How then can it get in, unless by some act of the legislature, which is not contended ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-7\">If the statute was in affirmance of the common law, the judges would have reported it as being in operation, because the common law was itself in force. 9 Serg. and Rawle, 348, 349.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-8\">The first constitution of Pennsylvania, art. 7; art. 3, sect. 3, and 24 sect. (1 Dallas\u2019s Laws, appendix,) show that there is no power provided to carry out the king\u2019s prerogative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-9\">[Mr. <em>Jones </em>then went into a minute and critical examination-of the colonial records of Pennsylvania, to show that from the proceedings of the governor and assembly it was not believed that a power existed to sustain these religious - charities, referring, amongst other matters to the charter of the Presbyterian church in 1772.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-10\">After the Revolution, the first case that occurred to test these principles was 17 Serg. and Rawle, 88, Witman <em>v. </em>Lex; but the bequests in this case were good by the common law without the aid of the statute of Elizabeth, which was decided not to be in force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-11\">2.

By the laws of Pennsylvania it is blasphemy to attack the Christian religion, but <em>in </em>this case <em>nothing is t\u00f3 </em>be taught but the doctrines <em>of a </em>pure morality, and all th\u00e9 advantages of early impressions upon the youthful mind are entirely abrogated.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-7\"><em>Binney, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-8\">(Argued that under the true construction of the will, the heirs of Girard could not take even if the devise for the college'should be set aside; because the city of Philadelphia- would come in as residuary legatee; the income of the fund being applied, in such case,. to \u201c diminishing the burden of taxation,\u201d and other public objects specifically pointed out. This part of the argument is omitted, because the decision of the court is placed upon other grounds. Mr. Binney then proceeded to comment on the objections to the devise, which had been made by the counsel on the other side.) '</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AS9\">The objection made by the counsel on the other side is twofold: first, that the city is incapable of taking a legal estate by devise; and second, that the trust is void, because the beneficiaries are too uncertain. The first point was not pressed, and is considered as abandoned. As to the second, this charity is as precise as any which has ever been established. The trust is to build upon a place specially marked' out (the children are to be poor, bom in Philadelphia, then New York, then New Orleans. The description is specific and limited. In England, a charity, however gener\u00e1l, always succeeds; there is no case in which it has failed. The only question there is about its administration; whether by the chancellor in his ordinary jurisdiction, or under the sign manual of the crown. The statute 32, 34 Henry 8, which forbade devises to corporations in mortmain, never was in force in Pennsylvania. The settlers agreed in England upon the laws which should govern them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>White andBrockden\u2019s History of Laws, Appendix 1, says that Wills, &amp;c., in writing and attested should have the <em>same </em>force as to land that conveyances had.

That of March (sect. 10, 11) gives the corporation power to carry out the trust; enacts that no road.shall pass through the land, and gives' power to appoint officers. Both acts acknowledge and assist the trust, and imply that the corporation had power to take it. This is evidence of an existing power. 4 Peters, 503.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-10\">The charter of Philadelphia, (page 73 of city ordinances,) in the 16th section, grants a general power to make laws''for the welfare of the people.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-11\">The case in 1 Vesey, 534, does not warrant the inference drawn from it by the counsel on the opposite side.

Suppose a marriage settlement for life with power to devise. Where is the estate beyond the life until the power is executed ? It vests in no one. A charitable use is -only a power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>of appointment, and the children, in this case, when named, have a good right to the use. So it is in churches. When a minister is elected, he takes the estate according to the foundation; and so also with schoolmasters, who have sometimes a freehold. Shelford, 762, 763, 765, 767, 730.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-4\">If the trustee will not nominate, chancery will. 3 P. W. 146 ; 3 Atkyns, 164.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">The tenure of the <em>cestui que use </em>is fixed; the boys of merit are to remain in the college until they are from fourteen to eighteen years of age. They are easily ascertainable. It is true that no one has a claim \u2019until the appointment is made. But this is the case with many trusts of private property where the estate is uncertain until certain issue arc bom. Where there is a power to name some one of \u2019kin to take, a remote relation may be selected. 1 Atkyns, 469; 4 Russel, 292. A power to appoint amongst \u201c poor relations\u201d may be either a charity in the legal sense of the term, or an ordinary provision of kindness. 7 Vesey, junr. 436; 2 Atkyns, 328; 17 Vesey, jun. 371; 1 Shoales and Lefroy, 111; Boyle on Charities, 31-34. The only difference between the two is that in the first case, it will last longer than in the other. A power of appointment is- sometimes vested -in particular persons from special confidence, and sometimes it passes to heirs. Charities are kept up for ever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">Uncertainty is indispensable to all charities. If any one has a right to claim by law, it ceases to be a' charity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\">Where did the favour with which charities are regarded, and\u2019the motive by which they are established, spring from ? The doctrine is traced up to the civil law. But where did Justinian get these ideas ? They came from Constantine,-the first Christian emperor, and they can be traced up to a higher source than that \u2014 the Bible. The Anglo-Saxons received all their principles from the same authority. Orphan-houses were exempted from taxation. - Originally the injunction of the Bible was to \u201chonour thy father and thy mother;\u201d but the domestic affeetions are selfish, and it was reserved for Christianity to enjoin the duty of \u201c loving thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d The Jewish lawyer asked who his neighbour was, and it was hard to convince him that a Samaritan could be so. There was the same difficulty as now respecting the uncertainty of the beneficiary. The lesson of charity is taught too in the case of the woman who; iii her humility, claimed only the crumbs that fell from the table, and in the beautiful parable of visiting the sick and the prisoner: \u201c Inasmuch as ye have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>done it to the least of these, ye have done it unto me.\u201d Even in the older Jewish records, we find the same lesson of philanthropy taught where the sheaf is left for the unknown and unacknowledged stranger. It is the uncertainty of the person upon whom the benefit may fell that gives merit to the action. A legacy to a friend is no charity. The first trustee for a charity was St. Paul. The sick are always uncertain; and to all hospitals, the objection now made would apply. 2 Domat. 169, title 2, sect. 3; 2 Vesey, 273; 1 Vernon, 248; 7 Vesey, 76; 17 Vesey, 371, that it becomes a charity as soon as uncertainty begins. Ambler, 422 ; 5 Rawle, 151; manuscript-case from Pennsylvania, not yet reported, that beneficial societies are not charities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-5\">[Mr. <em>Binney </em>then proceeded with his own argument, and stated the following points:</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-6\">1. That such uses as those in Mr. Girard\u2019s will are good at the common law in England, which is the common law of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-7\">2. That the city being in possession of the trust, nothing more is necessary for them, as they want no remedy whether there would be one at common law or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-8\">3. That such trusts are entitled to protection in equity, upon the general principles of equity jurisdiction, which protects all lawful trusts whether there be a trustee or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-9\">4. That they in fact enjoyed this protection in chancery before the 43. Eliz. by the original jurisdiction of that court, and have had it ever since.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-10\">5. That '43 Eliz. is only an ancillary remedy, long disused in England from its inconvenience, and is supplied by chancery, not as an usurper' on the statute, but as the rightful original tribunal for such trusts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-11\">6. That whatever the 43 Eliz. imparted to the law of Charles, except the mere remedy by commission from the lord chancellor, is thoroughly adopted in Pennsylvania, together with the great body of the equity code of that kingdom.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-12\">7. That the law in Pennsylvania is the same as the law in all the other states except Virginia and Maryland,</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-13\">1. Such .uses were good at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-14\">They can be traced up to an early period, anterior to Richard 2, and the principle upon which they are founded even up to the time of the Conquest. 4 Reeve, 80; Moore, 122. The principle of these charities is also engrafted upon the old English tenures. Co.

Some of the early statutes recognised them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\">The stat. 17 Edward 2, chap. 12, passed in 1334, related to the Knights Templars; at the dissolution of the order, the lands were assigned to the Knights of St. John for the same godly uses to which they'had been applied, viz.: relieving the poor, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">There arose'a contest between religious houses and the king about mortmain, and afterwards about superstitious uses. Monastic houses were the conservators of public records and the sources of instruction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-8\">15 Richard 2, chap. 5, was the last of the statutes of mortmain. Chap. 6 allowed spiritual corporations to hold the property of the church and the glebe, subject to making donations for the poor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaX\">Henry 4, chap. 2, allowed the vicar to be endowed, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-10\">2 Henry 5, chap. 5, recited that abuses existed in charities and ordered a commission of inquiry to reform them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-11\">23 Henry 8, chap. 7, (see 4 Pickering, 239,) called the statute of mortmain, aimed \u00e1 blow at these, charities. It was passed in 1531, and the king was married to Anna Boleyn in 1532.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-12\">27 Henry 8, chap. 25, was the first poor law of England</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-13\">1 Edward 6, chap. 14, (5 Pickering, 267,) endeavoured to preserve some of the charities from destruction. Boyle, 263, note, refers to this .statute, which required commissioners to execute charities for the benefit of the poor. See also stat. 2 Edward 6, (5 Pickering, 299;) stat. 1 and 2 Philip and Mary, chap. 8, (6 Pickering 234.) The monasteries were by this time put down and the charities destroyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-14\">Then came the statute 39. Elizabeth, chap. 5, from which the Pennsylvania act of 1791 is taken; this statute was continued in force until repealed by 9 George 2. From the circumstance that the charities were put down by the destruction of the monasteries arose the neces\u00e1ty of the 39 and 43 of Elizabeth, which intended to lessen the evil of pauperism by hunting up charities, but which established no new principle in the laws of England. 4 Inst. 66.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-15\">2 Gibson\u2019s Codex, 1155, where the statute of 39 Elizabeth is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>found. This last law is a general one, and covers a larger extent of ground than the 43 Elizabeth, chap. 4. Chapters 2 and 3 show the character of chap. 4. Ghap. 2 is a poor-law, and so is chap. 3, for mariners. The 43 Elizabeth enumerates twenty-one charities, but the . 39th comprehends all lawful ones. Hospitals were included in the latter but not in the former. The stat. 7 Jac. 1, chap. 3, has for its object to bind out poor boys. In Girard\u2019s case the boys must not only be poor, but orphans, a double merit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">There is a dictum of Lord Roslyn in 3 Vesey, jun. 726, in relation to a will being an appointment at common law; but the point decided in that case has nothing to do with the present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-6\">But there is not' a single case where the validity of a charitable use has been directly questioned at law; wherever the question came up, it was always incidentally.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-7\">The Year-Book of 38 Edward 3 forms the basis of Co. Litt. sect. 383. There was a. condition subsequent, which, if violated, gave the heir a right to enter. What was then called a condition is now called a trust. Sugden on Powers, 121; Perkins, 563; Anderson\u2019s Rep. 43, 108; 3 Dyer, 255 d, same in Jenkins, 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-8\">The last case mentioned occurred in the 8 and 9 Elizabeth, and is the Trinity College case. The question was, whether a devise to-the college, which was not a spiritual corporation, was good, and it was ruled to be .so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-9\">The Skinner\u2019s case occurred in 24 and 25 Elizabeth, (Moore, 129,) where the use was to pray for the soul of the donor. So much of the use as was esteemed superstitious was set aside, and the rest confirmed. See also Moore, 594, (or same case in Popham, 6,) where the'heir of the executor who had a trust-estate recovered from the heir of the donor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-10\">In Porter\u2019s case, 1 Co. Rep. 22, (92), the question was not raised whether a charitable use was good at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-11\">We see from these cases what the condition of England was about the time of 34 Elizabeth. The statute 23 Henry 8 did not go into effect for twenty years. Duke, 360; 4 Co. Rep. 116; 8 Co. Rep. 130.</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-12\">All these cases sustained charities for the poor and were anterior to 39 Elizabeth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-13\">This court has affirmed the validily of charities at common law. A dedication to pious,uses is sustainable only upon that ground. 6 Peters, 498, 431; 12 Wheat. 582; 10 Peters, 712; 2 Peters, 256; 9 Cranch, 212; 4 Peters, 487; 4 Serg. and Rawle, 212.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>The common law of England is in force in Pennsylvania.

The city is in possession, and wants no remedy; If the use is good, the owner of the legal estate cannot recover. 2 Dowl. and Ryland, 523; 5 Maddock, 529, (429.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">But it is said that the use is not- good because the proposed college is unchristian. The bill filed in-the cause makes no such objection. If zeal for the promotion of religion were the motive of the complainants, it would have been better to have joined with .us in asking the state to cut off the obnoxious clause than to\"use the plea in stealing away the bread of orphans.- We are not here to defend Mr. Girard\u2019s religious belief, whatever it was.- During his life he exhibited his philanthropy at a perilous moment. When the yellow fever burst upon Philadelphia in 1794, almost every one fled, regardless of his properiy. Girard walked the wards of hospitals, not subdued by the goans of the dying or deterred by the fear of death to himself. All .that he had was freely given to alleviate the wretched sufferers. More charitable even than the good Samaritan, he had not only poured oil upon their wounds, but stood .by them to the last. The difficulties that surrounded his plan of a college were great. His desire was to include the orphan poor of all sects, Jew,s as well as Christians, and those who had no religion at all. He might have placed it under the protection of some one religious denomination, but then it would have become a religious establishment, and met with opposition from other quarters. If all sects were to be admitted, what could he do other than what he did ? If any clergyman was to be admitted, he would of course teach the doctrines of his -own church. No two' sects would agee. ' Some would adopt one part of the Bible, some another.' If they ageed as to what was to be left out as apocryphal, they would, differ about the translation of the rest. The Protestant would not receive the Douay Bible. See the difficulties that exist in New York about the introduction of the Bible as a school-book. Girard did what was in conformity with law, and often done practically. He had to abandon his scheme or prevent discord by adopting the plan-which he followed. The purest principles of morality are to be taught. Where are they found ? Whoever searches for them must go to the source from which a Christian man derives his faith \u2014 the Bible. It is therefore affirmatively recom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>mended, and in such a way as to preserve the sacred rights of .conscience. No one can say that Girard was a deist. He has not said a word against Christianity. In the Blucher school in Liverpool there are no preachers. There is no chaplain in the University of Yirginia. By excluding preachers, Girard did not mean to reflect upon Christianity. It is true they cannot hold office. But the Constitution of New York excludes clergymen from offices, civil or. military. If the situation of a schoolmaster is an office, then a clergyman cannot be a public teacher. Girard only says that laymen must be instructors, \u25a0and why cannot they, teach .religion as well as science? Sunday-schools \u00bfre not prohibited.. It is said .by the opposite counsel that these poor victims 'are cast into a prison and shut up for the sake of an experiment. .But there is no prohibition against their going out to church \u2014 to as many churches as their friends choose to t\u00e1ke them to. All that is done by the will is to secure the college from controversy. It is optional- with the friends of the orphans whether, to permit them to go there or not. Cannot.the trustees erect a hospital, without the walls where the sick can be sent and have the services of clergymen when necessary ? But religion can be taught in the college itself. What, for example, is,there to prevent \u201cPaley\u2019s Evidences\u201d from being used as a school-book ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-5\">The law of Pennsylvania is not infringed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIf\">In the case of Updegraff, (11 Serg. and Rawle, 400,) the court said that Christianity was part of the law.' But it was Christianity with liberty of conscience to all. men. This is exactly what Girard thought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACa\">By the 3 sect. of the 3 art. of the constitution of Pennsylvania, \u00ab all men have a right to worship according to their conscience,\u201d \u2022 If worship, were prohibited in the college, (which it is not,) it would not be against law. The constitution says that \u00f1o man is disqualified who acknowledges, the existence of God and believes in a future .state \u00f3f rewards and punishments. Christianity is a part of the law, so that blasphemy can be punished, but not for-the purpose of i\u00f1vading the conscience of other persons. But, at all events, the conege is not yet built nor the regulation enforced. It is .too soon now to set it a\u00e1de. The city is in possession of the property, and. so it must remain.

The heir brought an. ejectment in 1776, and the church took the opinions of Wilcox and Wilson, both of whom affirmed that the bequest was good\u2019 at- law. In 1779, the cause was ended without' a decision of the question.

Lord Roslyn hag. said that chancery did not take cognisance of charitable uses before the statute of Elizabeth, but Lords Redesdale and Eldon say otherwise. Roslyn is known to us as the insulter of Dr. Franklin, and now the sain\u00e9 great people whom he represented, are harrassed because this same Lord Roslyn doubted almost the statute of Elizabeth.' When the rubbish of three centuries is swept away and the old records of England brought to light and published, there is evidence enough that the law of charities before the time of Elizabeth was the same that it is now in Pennsylvania. But the counsel on the other, side complain that they cannot understand the law of Pennsylvania.' It is not necessary that they should; for all that is asked by us is, that she may be suffered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>enjoy the contributions of her own wise and good, accumulating from the time that the first white man came there to settle with the Bible in his hand. Girard came there after the constitution of 1776 and before that of 1791; he lived in an atmosphere of charities in Philadelphia ; he saw Franklin\u2019s charity established and upheld by law, administered by the city, and never heard its validity questioned. No tribunal in the state was ever asked or would be permitted to. question Franklin\u2019s charity. Girard knew where to find the best legal advice, and undoubtedly had it. In Pennsylvania no argument would be listened to, such as we have heard here. We are invited to explain the law by those who do not want to understand it. It has been said by the other side, that no law can be considered as settled which has not been mooted; that is, that if. all the courts,' for an indefinite period, decide in the same way, it is of no account unless some ingenious and subtle mind calls the law into question. In one case, this court waited for the state court in Ohio to expound its laws, and then followed the decision. In another case, the court in Tennessee cortstrued its laws; this court adopted it. 'The-court in Tennessee reversed its decision; this court did so too. The present is a question of -Pennsylvania law, and we have heard the last decision 'of its highest state court in January, 1844, read from the manuscript report. This concurs with all previous decisions; and yet the counsel on the other side say that they want a fixed system of law. Virginia and Maryland are the only- two states where the law is otherwise, and -they followed what they understood to be the decision of this court in the case of the Baptist Association. The question is not whether the Pennsylvania law is right or wrong, for we do not wish to impose it upon any one else. But the only quesr tion is, what does the law of Pennsylvania say upon the point. Girard\u2019s will was made by the advice of the best counsel that could be found; it was proved as soon as he died; the executors went on to perform their trust, in presence of the proper courts and with, universal consent; they paid large sums over to the city. The claimants then brought an ejectment, and exhibited this will to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, who found no\u2019 objection to it. The city of Philadelphia brought a suit under it for some property; no judge nor counsel ever hinted that the will was void. Five years passed. The legislature had passed a law immediately recognising the will as existing and valid in all its parts. . The'preamble doesso. In the case of the Town of Pawlet, Mr. Justice Story says, <em>\u201c </em>the crown\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>has recognised the existence of the town.\u201d Does the recognition of this will by the legislature go for nothing ? The capacity of performing certain acts is admitted by the legislature, and is this not as effectual as a recognition by the crown ? Ten charities are going on now in Philadelphia. Custom and usage make the common law of England.' Why has'not Pennsylvania anight to enjoy her common law, not imported in parcels and packages from England, but modified and altered by circumstances and made suitable to the people.</p>\n<p data-order=\"213\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-5\">If we are not strong enough to stand alone, we might ask support from the other states whose law is the ssTme with ours. Where did the doctrine of charities spring from ?' and from what quarter did it enter into the heart of man ? We are authorized to denounce as an infidel or worse, the man who hath not charity in his heart. As surely as the pilgrims acknowledged a higher power, so surely did they recognise the obligation, to take care of their fellow-creatures. The people of the state are now a hospitable and charitable people, and wo be to him who endeavours to intercept the flow of the current. Where money is given to the poor, is any on'e at liberty to take it ? Thou shalt not steal. This is property under the protection of the court, and the right to it as sacred as that of any man to the enjoyment of his own. The voice of Pennsylvania is accordant and unbroken. We are called upon to examine what the chancellor did before the 43'.of Elizabeth, three centuries ago; but this does not concern us. - It is now settled even there, that no charity shall fail; if it is indefinite, the king shall administer it. Whether there are trustees or not, whether there be a corporation or not, all take. This charity would be safe in England; and*yet it is said we must lose it unless we can show how matters were conducted three hundred years ago. This is,a heavy burden to lay on a charity. In Pennsylvania, as in England, the ladr of charity established itself. No man can say when it began; it has always existed as far as we know. What is the common law of England ? Leaving out its being the perfection of reason, it is such an application of rul\u00e9s as will promote the welfare of society. The law of' charity has existed in England for sixteen hundred years,' some centuries before Alfred. Before Penn came over, there was a settlement of Swedes near Philadelphia, at Weccacoe, a brave- and. moral people. They built a place of worship, and about 1700 a better ope which remains to this day. The charter of that church bears-date in 1765, but the first church was built in 1677. Where was- the law of charities for these hun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>dred years.? and what protected the graves around the church all this time? The same law that exists still. Christ Church was seventy years without a charter. In Walnut street there was a chapel abhorrent to English law, where mass was said. It stood until it was taken down and replaced by a larger one. Who ever offered to take away this church ? What is the condition of the Philadelphia Library with its 50,000 volumes ? It has always acted without a' charter. Story supposes that the rudiments of this law of charities came from the civil law. Thurlow and Eldon thought so. too. , In 1138, the civil law came into England, and the canon law soon afterwards, and is part of the law of that country to this day. But how did it get into the civil law ? It is said from Constantine. But wherever Christianity went, charity went too. Gibbon says \u00ab the apostate Julian complained that Christians not only relieved their own poor, but those of the heathen also.\u201d The revealed law is part of the law of England. Blaekstone says so. When did Christianity come into England? It.reached Rome in the time of the apostles, where Paul and Peter both suffered. But when England ? Some say at the same time that it was carried to Rome, and was there trodden down for a time. The latest period-is 597, the arrival of Augustine. An archbishop of Canterbury was then appointed, and there has been one ever since. If Christianity carried the law of charity to Rome, it must have done so to England too. It was a part of the common law after the sixth century. Where is there a spot upon earth, where Christianity is found, that the law of charity does not exist .also? Alfred sent an embassy to the Christian churches in Syria, in the ninth century, and had the ten commandments translated into Saxon. From one great source have flowed two sorts of charities, one religious, the other more general. The only difficulty that ever existed' in Pennsylvania related to the first class \u2014 religious charities. In the 14th century lived Wickliffe, called the day-star of the Reformation; a man confounded with turbulent men, but a professor of divinity and singularly learned. It was an object in that day to save England from paying tribute to the pope. From that time a religious struggle ensued. Henry 8 found the Roman Catholic religion firmly estar blish\u00e9d, the revealed law being p\u00e1rt of the law of England. All parties admitted this. From the time of Augustine down, the common law had been undergoing changes to suit the spirit of the age, but the revealed law was a part of it all the time. Tothill, 126, quoted by Judge Baldwin in McGill and Brown. To this, same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>great source we owe the idea of a paternal power in \u00a1the state \u2014 a <em>parens patria </em>\u2014 not the king, nor the chancellor, but a power existing somewhere to take care of the sick, the widow, and the orphan.Take this away and we become a nation of savages. . If there is no protection for the infant and the aged, the charm of civilization is lost. In Pennsylvania all this is cared for; by hospitals and houses of refuge. No power is able to stop the flow of charity, be ause there is liberty of conscience. The same law that enjoins upon -a witness in court to tell the truth, instructs him to give to the poor. One is not less binding than the other. All that is asked of government is, that under the protection of law, the great duty of charity may be. fulfilled; and it is proposed now to say to every one that he shall not do so; that his gift shall be forfeited. The law of charitable uses furnishes this protection. In the 17 Edward 2, in 1324, the Knights Hospitallers were made new trustees of a charity when the Templars were dissolved. Story (Equity, 403, 412) says, that charities are liberally construed, and in 415, \u201c if the bequest be for charity, no matter how uncertain the beneficiaries may be, a court will sustain the legacy.\u201d See also 3 Peters, 484 ; 4 Wheat. 41; 7 Vermont Rep. 289.</p>\n<p data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-5\">A bequest is not void for uncertainty of persons. 7 Cranch, 45; 2 Story, 206; 6 Peters, 436, 437 ; 2 Peters, 256.</p>\n<p data-order=\"215\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-7\">The law of charities existed in England prior to the time of Elizabeth. 2 Russell, 407.</p>\n<p data-order=\"216\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-8\">The opinion given by Judge Baldwin in the case of McGill and Brown, embraces all the law of Pennsylvania. The law 'of this court is not different. The two cases cited in the decision of the Baptist Association' appear now to be reported differently in five different books, arid this court afterwards said that a dedication to pious uses should be protected. The case of the Baptist Society is reported in 3 Peters. If the counsel-on the other side construe this case rightly, then all charitable uses are swept away; but how then did it happen that Chief Justice Marshall afterwards said that eleemosynary corporations are to be encouraged. There cannot be a right without a full remedy; and if a man has a right to give, his- donation must be protected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"217\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-10\">The constitution of 1776, sect. 46, says, \u201c all religious or charitable societies ought to be encouraged and protected.\u201d What does the 43 Elizabeth do ? It directs charities to be looked up, amounting to twenty-one. Is not the fundamental law of a state of as much potency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>as a British statute ? \u2022 The latter only looks to the past; the former .to the future. The statute only includes twenty-one; the constitution takes in alb It says \u201c other pious and charitable purposes.\u201d These words must be understood in their appropriate sense, according to their meaning in England at that time. It is of higher authority than the British statute, because it prohibited the legislature from doing any thing contrary to the principle which it established. The constitution is a great land-mark; no one can dispute its authority without treating the people of Pennsylvania with disrespect. In Beatty and Kirk, (580,) the court say \u201c the bill of rights of Maryland recognises the statute of Elizabeth 'to some extent.\u201d Why is not. a recognition to the full extent by- Pennsylvania equally valid? Pennsylvania even adopts \u201csuperstitious uses,\u201d as they are called in England. Her settlers were of every shade ' of opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"218\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-5\">The monasteries in England were seized upon by Henry 8) but the rapacity of his favourites was even greater than his own. England presents now a great contrast of rich and poor. Some of the largest fortunes are owing to the benefactions of this king, such as that held by the- family of Russel. The owner of. the \u201c poor flat, Bedford level,\u201d complained that Burke received \u00bf\u00a3800 a year. Religious supremacy was established in the king. He laid down six articles,- containing the points in dispute between himself and Rome. Who can tell what was then held to be \u201cn superstitious use?\u201d At the end of. the Reformation, it was punishable to believe what the statute of 31 Henry 8 ordered. ' The test of \u00absuperstitious .uses\u201d . was constantly changing down to the time of Charles 2; the Presbyterians, Independents, <em>See., </em>when uppermost, all trying to compel conformity. Then our ancestors came, abhorring religious s'upremacy,- bringing with them liberty of conscience, and' the whole law of religious charities. They asked the crown to give them religious endowments, but not charities, and were at last compelled to take the act of 1730. Churches of all sects had been built, even Roman Catholic. In Magill and Brown, page 55, note, Judge Baldwin mentions forty-six charities, none of which were religious. The statutes 23 Henry 8, chap. 19, and 13 Elizabeth, chap. 1, make decrees of synodis a part of the law of the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"219\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-7\">The Pennsylvania act of 1791, (Purdon\u2019s Digest, p. 181,) recites that any persons who mean to associate for the purposes of charity, may be incorporated with the approbation of the attorney-general. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>There never has happened a case where the property of any religious society, Jew or Catholic, was seized upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"220\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-5\">There are two objections made\u2019 to the validity of the devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"221\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-6\">1.

If any man who has charge of an orphan boy is afraid to send him to the' college, he may keep him away without censure. It is merely an invitation to come. The constitution of Pennsylvania respects all scruples of conscience, and if children were to be dragged in and kept by force, it would be a violation of its principles,' Rut the will in effect say<em>s </em>obey conscience and yield it to nobody.\u201d This scruple is of recent origin. It is not alleged in the bill. Perhaps the complainants felt no scruples then, but do now. If they slumbered so long, they ought to have some charity for Mr. Girard, in whose breast they never awaked.. But a great prize is now to be reached, and the judgment may be affected by the will.

That it is \u00e1, superstitious use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"225\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-10\">2. That, it is inseparable from the trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"226\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-11\">The question is more suitable to a theological board than a court of justice. That the law of charity is the law of the land, is not a proposition depending upon theological inquiry. In Baxter\u2019s case, the court was not called upon to say which party was right, but only to decide what it was that the statute,said; and because Baxter was \u00bf non-conf\u00f3rmist, the trust was declared void. What could a Pennsylvania judge haye done in such a case ? He would find liberty of conscience established by the constitution; that in the constitution of the United States it is provided that Congress shall make no law affecting religion; and that Mr..Madison once affixed his veto to a bill incorporating a church under an apprehension that it trenched upon this delisate ground. It never was held \"that a charitable devise must make provision for religious education. In the list of forty-six before cited, thirty-seven are for mere charity. Does' any one desire that the .old times in religion, should return, when a man was allowed to do good only in a particular way, and in no other ? What was the spirit that led to burning the convent near Boston ? Precisely this. Religious acrimony now destroys property, if it does not doom to the stake! \u2019 .</p>\n<p data-order=\"227\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>We have nothing to do with Mr. Girard\u2019s religious opinions. If any one thinks he can lead a better life, with equal humility and more zeal, let him try. Instead of there being any thing against religion in the will, there is a manly and unaffected testimony in its favour. The boys are directed to \u201c adopt such religious tenets as mature reason may preferany tenet, without exception. The will then holds religion to be inseparable from human character, but thinks the best way of forming that portion' of the character is by attending to it,at mature age. It is a speculative question. Can it be said that Girard had' no respect for religion ? He shewed a religious heart by bestowing upon the poor what God had given' him, so that, like Franklin\u2019s legacy, \u201c it might go round.\u201d His desire was that the children should be educated in the manner which he thought the best, to make them religious. Who is to decide whether it is the best way or not ? The objection assumes -that the Bible is-not to be taught at all, or that laymen are incapable of teaching it. There is not the least evidence of an intention to prohibit it from being taught. On the contrary, there is an obligation to teach what the Bible alone can teach, viz. a pure system of morality.</p>\n<p data-order=\"228\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-5\">Is it true that ministers alone can teach religion ? The officer at the. head of the institution (Professor Bache) is a religious man. Can he not expound religion as well as .science to his pupils ? The laymen are the'support, at last, of all churches. The next position will be that clergymen are responsible, for every thing, and that a man can do nothing for himself. Every one has to teach his own children. Why can he not equally instruct those of other, people ? The orphans are not to enter the college until a contract is made for them by som\u00e9body, According to the common law, an infant can bind himself so some extent by a contract. So he can here. It must be. sanctioned by his guardians too. No one objects to a child being bound out in a. vessel where, of course, there is a great chance of his dying without the benefit of religious -services, and where bis voice, when in extremes, cannot reach an ear which, it is said, it ought to do. We must, upon this doctrine, condemn the House of Refuge. But we may trust that the cry of a child will be heard in mercy, although it may not reach the- ear of a priest. If a father should refuse to instruct his children in religion, can the state interpose ? Suppose that the will had made no provision on the subject,- and. the governors of the college had adopted this same regulation, would the court have denounced it as a violation of their duty? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The case of the University of Virginia is far beyond this. There is no professor of theology, nor instruction in divinity. These things are purposely omitted, from a fear that the institution might become sectarian. If Virginia permits it, she is' the judge of its propriety and not we. But Girard has neither prohibited religious instruction nor a professorship. What will the United States do with the Smithsonian legacy ? \u2018Congress cannot connect religion with it. Clothing and- feeding the poor are worthy objeots. Girard is said to have expressed himself in terms derogatory to Christianity. Suppose he had' used a different phraseology, and said that none but laymen should be admitted into the college. This would not have been objectionable, and yet precisely the same result have been brought about. Children are to be fed and clothed. This is not a superstitious use, and must stand. Will you destroy the patient, if there is'an uhsound limb ? The case is lrft with the court with a perfect conviction that it will not put the knife to the throat of this most useful charity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"229\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ar\"><em>Webster, </em>for the appellants, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"230\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-6\">The complainants in this eause are the next of kin to Stephen Girard, who cpme here to try the' validity of a devise, purporting to establish what' has been called a charity. The counsel on the opposite side have assailed their motives, accusing them of,wishing to -steal,the bread of the, orphan, and have censured them for coming to this court instead of resorting to the tribunals of Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs are foreigners, and have a right to come here under the Constitution of the United States. Are they to be reproached for it ? But the answer to this .objection has already been furnished by the opposite counsel, wiien they say that in Pennsylvania, the complainants would not have been permitted to question the devise. Here, they are sure of a patient hearing.. The cause was not argued in the Circuit Court, because the question arose in that court in -1833, upon the construction of the will of Sarah Zane,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> apd the court, in its opinion, decided the point. It would,, therefore, have been useless to renew the argument there, but the best way was to bring the subject directly up for review.</p>\n<p data-order=\"231\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-7\">It was said by the opening counsel, (Mr. <em>Jones,) </em>that in England charities are often superintended by- the king in virtue of his prerogative,' and that no analogous power can exist in a republican govem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>ment, where there can be no <em>parens </em>patries; and it was also said that in order to establish a peculiar and local common law in Pennsylvania, one decision is not enough, but there must be a series of decisions to sustain a system of law. Both these positions are correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"232\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-5\">But the attention of the court will be directed in the first place to that clause in the will which excludes clergymen, &amp;c.j from the college; and it is worthy of reflection whether the devise must not be maintained, if maintained at all, upon the ground of its being a charitable devise, and as such entitled to special favour. It is a proposition of the highest magnitude, whether in the eye of jurisprudence it is any charity at all; the affirmative cannot be supported by law, or reasoning, or decisions. There are two objections to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"233\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-6\">1. The plan, of education is derogatory to the Christian religion, tending to weaken men\u2019s respect for it and their conviction of its importance. It subverts the only foundation of public morals, and therefore it is mischievous and not desirable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"234\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-7\"><em>2. </em>It is contrary to the public law and policy of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p data-order=\"235\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-8\">The clause is pointedly opprobrious to the whole clergy; it brands them all without distinction of sect. Their very presence is supposed to be mischievous. If a preacher happens to have a sick relative in the college, he is forbidden to visit him. How have the great body of preachers deserved to be denied even the ordinary rifes of hospitality ? In no country in the Vrorld is there a body of men who have done so'much good as the preachers of the United States; they derive no aid from government,, constitute no hierarchy, but live by the voluntary contributions of those to whom they preach. It astonishes the old world that we can get on in this way. We have done something in law and politics towards our contribution for the benefit of mankind; but nothing so importantto the human race as by establishing the great truth that the clergy can live by voluntary support. And yet they are all shut out from- this college. Was there ever an instance before, where, in any Christian country, the whole body of the clergy were denounced? The opposite counsel have gone as far back as Constantine in their history of charities; but have they found or can they find a single case, where opprobrium is fixed upon the whole clergy ? We have nothing to do with Girard\u2019s private character, which has been extolled for benevolence. Be it so. We are asked if he cannot'dispose of his property.' But the law cannot be altered to' suit Girard. What is eharity ? It is the indulgence, of kind affections \u2014 love\u2014sympathy for our fellow-creatures. In a narrow sense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>it means alms, relief to the poor. \u2022 But the question is, what is it in a legal sense ? The object here is to .establish a school of learning arid shelter; to give a better education. The counsel upon the other side are right in speaking of charity as an emanation of Christianity. But if this be so, there can be no charity where the authority of God is derided and his word rejected. If it becomes an unbeliever, it is no longer charity. There is no example in the books of a charity where Christianity is excluded. There may be a charity for a school without a positive provision for Christian <em>teachers; </em>but where they are expressly excluded, it cannot be such a charity as is entitled to the special favour and protection of a court. It is said by the counsel on the other side that Pennsylvania is not an infidel state, but a Christian community; and yet children who are orphans, with no parents to look after them, are directed to be shut in to stay until they approach manhood, during the age when the character is formed, and if they happen tohave any connections or friends who are clergymen,- they are excluded from ever seeing .them. There \u00e1re two objectionable- features in-this..restriction in the will. The first is, that all clergymen are excluded from the college; and the second, that a cruel experiment is to be made upon these orphans, to' ascertain whether they cannot be brought up without religion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"236\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-5\">[Mr. <em>Webster </em>here read a passage from one of the works of the late Bishop White upon this point.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"237\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-6\">The doors of the coll\u00e9ge are open, to infidels. The clause, as it stands, is as derogatory to Christianity as if provision had been made for lectures against it. If it be said that infidels will not be encouraged, the answer is, that a court can only- judge of the tendency of measures. The trustees must not be supposed to violate the will. But it is said by the counsel that lay teaching can be substituted for clerical. There are at least four religious sects which do -not allow this mode of teaching religion; and it is as much against the spirit of the will as teaching by clergymen. The object is to have no religious teaching at all, because in this way controversy will be avoided. Lawyers are as much sectarians as clergymen, and lay teaching leads- as directly to controversy as lay preaching. The intention of the will is, that the boys shall choose their own religion when they grow up. The idea was drawn from Paine\u2019s Age of Reason, 211, where it is said \u201c let us propagate morality unfettered by superstition.\u201d Girard had no secrets, and therefore used the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>words which he considered synonymous with \u201c superstition,\u201d viz. : \u201c religious tenets.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"238\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-6\">Ministers are the usual and appointed agents of Christ. In.human affairs, where the ordinary means of attaining an object are rejected, the object is understood to be rejected also; much more is this the case when the means are of divine authority. In the New Testament preaching is ordered both before and after the crucifixion. \u201cIf any man refuse to hear,\u201d &amp;c. \u201c Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel \u00bfa every creature.\u201d Different sects have different forms of worship, but all agree that preaching is indispensable. These appointed agencies have been the means of converting all that part of the world which is now Christian. What country was ever Christianized by lay teaching? By what sect was religious instruction ever, struck out of education ? None. Both in the Old and New Testaments its importance is recognised. In the Old it is said \u201c Thou shalt diligently teach them to thy children,\u201d and in the New, \u201c Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not.\u201d But'this will requires religion to be put off till mature years, as if a knowledge of man\u2019s duty and destiny was not the earliest thing to be learned. Man is the only sentient being who- knows that he is eternal; the question \u201c If a man dies, shall he live again ?\u201d can be solved by religion alone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"239\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-8\">' Is this school a charity ? What is to become of the Sabbath. It is not intended to say that this institution stands upon the same authority as preaching, but still it is a part of' Christianity. All sects have a day which is holy, and hold its observance to be important. Lay teachers will not do. Where are the children to go to church, even if they go out of the college? There is no Christian father or\u2019 mother who would not rather trust their children to the charily of the world at large, than provide in this way, for their bodily comforts. The single example of the widow\u2019s mite, read as it has been to hundreds of millions of people, has done more good than a hundred marble palaces. No fault can be found with Girard for wishing a marble college to bear his name for ever, but it is not valuable unless it has a fragrance of Christianity about it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"240\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-9\">The reasons which the testator gives are objectionable and derogatory to Christianity; they assume that a difference of-opinion upon some religious tenets is' of more importance than a Christian education, and in order to get rid of superfluous branches, they lay the axe to the root of the tree itself. The sam\u00e9 objection is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>by all the lower and vulgar class of the opponents of Christianity. <em>True </em>first step of infidelity is to clamour against the multitude of sects. Volney, 84, (Ruins of Empires,) says, \u201c they all preach damnation against each other, and all cry out \u2018 our holy religion.\u2019 \u201d The opposite counsel say that Girard was in a difficulty, because if he had thrown open the college to all sects indiscriminately,, they would not have agreed with each other: But if it had been so, these orphan children would not have been in a worse condition than other children, and what father would not have preferred that his children should go to, this college -under any form, than no form of religion ? All sects believe in a future state and in a creator of the world. Suppose we carried out these principles of exclusion into our social relations. Differing as We do about \u2019government, it would tear up society by the roots. All preachers unite in many points; they would all agree with Franklin, who is reported in the letters of John Adams to his wife, to-have said in the days of trouble, \u201clet us have prayers.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"241\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A91\">[Mr. <em>Binney </em>here cited the following authorities to show that Jewish charities can be sustained. 1 Ambler, 228, note; 2 Swanston, 487; 7 Vesey, 417 ; Sheltford, 107 ; Boyle, 27.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"242\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-5\">Mr. <em>Webster </em>said the distinction between the Jewish cases and the present is, that the former were within the ordinary rules of law, whereas this devise could only be sustained by being brought under the peculiar favour of the court, as if belongs to that class of charities. But what would be the' condition of a youth coming fresh from this college? He could nof be a;witness in any court. He had never been taught to believe in a future state of rewards and punishments, because this is a \u201c tenet\u201d upon which he is enjoined not to make up his mind until he can examine for himself. What parent would bring up his child to the age of eighteen years without teaching him religion ? What is an oath in heathen lands as well as our own ? It is a religious appeal, founded upon a conviction that perjury will be punished hereafter.. But if no superior power is acknowledged, the party cannot be a witness. Our lives and liberties and property all rest upon the sanetity of oaths. It is said that there will be no teaching against Christianity in this college, but I deny it. The fundamental doctrine is, that the youthful heart is not a proper receptacle for religion. - This is not the charity of instruction. In monasteries education was always blended with, religious, teaching. The statute 4 Henry 4, chap. 12, in 1402, established charities of religion, (2 Pickering, 433,) and directed the schoolmaster to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>divine service, and instruct the children. 1 Edward 6, chap. 14, to the same effect. 2 Swanston, 526, 529, says that care was always taken to educate youths in the. doctrines pf Christianity, which is a part of the common law of England. That it is so, see 1 Benson, 296; 2 Strange, 834 ; 3 Merivale, 405 ; 2 Burn\u2019s Ecclesiastical Law, 95; 2 Russell, 501; Younge and Collyer\u2019s Reports in Chancery; 413, Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Cullum, a full authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"243\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\">\u25a0 In this last case there was a charity for the use of the parish, but no provision for religious education. The court said that if the fund were to be applied to education at all, a part of it must go to religious education; not the particular doctrines of the Church of England,but religion in a more, comprehensive sense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"244\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-6\">Bache, in his Course of Education in Europe, describes a monitorial school in .'Liverpool-upon Bell\u2019s plan, b.ut divine service is performed every Sunday. In Shepherd, 105, the cases are summed up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"245\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-7\">As to the Smithsonian legacy and the University of Virginia, the former is not carried out, and- the latter is no charity. Upon this branch of the case the whole argument may be presented in the following question, \u201c Is a school; founded .clearly on the principles of infidelity, a charity in the appropriate sense of that word ?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"246\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-8\">2. What is the law or public policy of Pennsylvania?</p>\n<p data-order=\"247\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-9\">\u25a0 If there be a settled policy there, no gift or devise to overturn it can be recognised. It is an independent \u00e1tate, a popular government recognising all guarantees of popular liberty. It is lawful to speak or write against all these guarantees, such as trial by jury, &amp;.c\u201e but if the aid of a court be asked to carry on these- attacks', it will be refused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"248\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-10\">Mr. Girard in his lifetime might have paid people to write against the right of suffrage, but it is a different thing when it assumes the shape of a charitable devise, and requires the strong aid of a court to carry out the design. The Christian religion is as much a part of the public law as any of these guarantees.' The charter says that Penn came over to spread the Christian religion; and the legislatures have often acted upon this principle, as where they punished the violation of the Lord\u2019s day. That it is a part of the common law, see 11 Serg. and Rawle, 394, Updegraff <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth. So the court set aside a trust because it was inconsistent with public policy. See the case of the Methodist church, 5 Watts. The policy of a country is established either by law, or courts, or general con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>sent. That Christianity is a part of the public law of Pennsylvania by general consent, if there were no other .source of authority, the churches, meeting-houses, spires', arid even grave-yards over the face of the country all show.

The doctrine of <em>cy-pres </em>cannot apply and give the benefit to some other society. It would b\u00e9 an extravagant application of the doctrine. Who is to supply the place of the trust stricken out? The trustee cannot. It is a case where there is no doubt of the intentions of the testator. They are positive. In other ca\u00e1es there is room for discretion, but none here. The testator calls these articles restrictions and limitations. Courts of equity have gone to an extravagant, length in <em>cy-pres </em>cases, but it is impossible to reach this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"251\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anx\">7 Vesey, 490, said that if authority were out of the way, the gift would-be void, and the case be one .of intestacy'; but the court thought itself bound to follow authority and decree that the testator should be charitable in the court\u2019s way. See also Strange, 127, Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Dowling. But the entire doctrine of <em>cy-pres </em>is rejected by the Pennsylvania courts. See 17 Serg. and Rawle, 93; 1 Watts, 226.</p>\n<p data-order=\"252\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-10\">As to the second division of the argument of the case; what is the law' of Pennsylvania with respect to such devises ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"253\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-11\">This court will adopt the construction which' the courts of a state place upon its laws. 2 Cranch, 87; 11 Wheat. 361; 2 Peters, 58; 6 Peters, 290; 12 Wheat. 153. There have been four cases decided in Pennsylvania, viz.: 17 Serg. and Rawle, 88, Witman <em>v. </em>Lex; 1 Pennsylvania Rep. 49, McGin <em>v. </em>Aaron; 3 Rawle, 170, Mayor, &amp;c. <em>v. </em>Elliott, 7c.; 1 Watts, 218, Methodist Church <em>v. </em>Remington. All these cases are in our favour, except a single <em>dictum. </em>in one of them. The opposite counsel .are obliged to reject the points decided in two. In the first cas\u00e9 it was decided that the statute of Elizabeth was not in force, and the devise was not so uncertain as to be void. The second was a gift to a congregation for a house of religious worship; in the third there was no uncertainty in the <em>cestui que trust, </em>and in the fourth the trust was declared void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"254\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-12\">The old records of England do not militate against the decision of this court in the case of.the Baptist association.. (4 Wheat. 1.) There is believed to be no case in them of an indefinite charity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>perpetuity sustained by the authority of chancery prior to the time of Henry 8. Corporations competent to take, whether aggregate or sole, are not included within this .remark. Decisions before the 43 Elizabeth are apt to be misunderstood, because the term \u00ab charity\u201d is applied to cases where there is no uncertainly, 1 Proceedings in Chancery, 208. Of the fifty cases cited from the old records, only three are given at length; in one of which the objects of the trust are specially declared, .and in the other two there was a license from the king.

But where a court of chancery charges itself with the whole administration of. the charity, it takes possession of the fee as an incident to this power. In Pennsylvania there is no such authority anywhere, and this court cannot exercise it. What is done in England is done by virtue of the statute of Elizabeth,, which has n.o force in this case. Suppose the corporation had renounc\u00e9d the trust, what would have become of the fe\u00e9 ?' Could the court in such case have divested the heirs of the fee and appointed another trustee ? There is no power to remodel a trust as in England, or to exercise a right of visitation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"258\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-6\">There is a want of power in the trustee to administer the charity-. The fee must rest in the entire body of the corporation whilst others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>' axe administering the trust. It is true that sometimes trusts have been conferred on the head's of corporations, and the whole body been held responsible. But the will here can give no power. There is no connection between this trust and the powers of the corporation. The school is out of the city, and the only interest'which the city has in it is that some of. the poor may be provided for. But suppose a defalcation to' taire place. The mayor, &amp;c.j are chosen for the purpose of laying city taxes for city purposes. Can they levy a tax to replace the. sum thus abstracted ? Are the whole people of the city responsible, by taxation for an abuse of trust ? Yet they are a part of the corporation which is the trustee. The 16 section of die charter contains the power' to hold land, but tins does not go far enough. If the city cannot execute the trust, what becomes of it ? It was the intention of the testator. that a particular trustee and no other should execute it, and if that trustee is incapable of doing it, the trust must fail altogether.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"259\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-5\">' By the Pennsylvania statutes of 1730, 1791, and 1833, the policy of the state is shown to be that a moderate limit is fixed for the amount of property held for religious or charitable purposes, first of \u00bf6500, and afterwards $2000. These laws are intended to act upon just such devises as this. Can it be said, with these laws in view, 'that an unincorporated body, such as these boys, or any one in trust for them, can hold property to the amount of $2,000,000 <em>? </em>The policy of the state is to prevent large amounts in perpetuity, and if any one desires to exceed the limits fixed in those laws he must apply to the legislature for a special permission.

In Pennsylvania, in case of a judgment against a corporation, any money on its way to the treasury can be arrested. In Bridgeport, Connecticut, the corporation issued bonds upon which there was a judgment, and private property in dwelling-houses seized in execution; yet these persons could not prevent the bonds from being issued. There is no security anywhere for any species of property except by holding corporations to a strict exercise of their power. No good can be looked for horn this college. If Girardhad desired to bring trouble, and quarrel, and struggle upon the city, he could have done it in np more effectual -way. The plan is unblessed in design and unwise in purpose. If the court should set it aside, and I be instrumental in contributing to that result, it will be the crowning mercy of my professional life.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"263\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b165-12\"> SCHEDULE OF CASES FROM CHANCERY PROCEEDINGS IN TIME OF ELIZABETH.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">[Proceedings in Chancery, Vol. I.]</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">\n<em>Becord Commission.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-16\"><em>Babington </em>v. <em>Gull, clerk. </em>Bill complaining that plaintiff\u2019s mother had placed 600 marks in the hands of defendant, for the purpose of founding a chantry in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>church of St. Peter of Haworth', iu Nottinghamshire,.which he' had neglected to do.</p>\n<p id=\"AIX\">Answer of William Gull, that he had received the money mentioned in the bill, for the purpose therein; bpt adding that if the endowment of the chantry' were.not completed within four years, which are not expired, the money was to be applied in finding three priests to sing daily in the said, church; and that he is willing to pay the said money according to the direction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The prayer is, the plaintiff being without remedy of common law, to issue subpoenas, and to call defendant before him to be examined, and to'do and receive according as faith, reason, and'good conscience require; and this for the love of God, and in way of charity.</p>\n<p id=\"A7D\"><em>Wakering </em>v. <em>Bayle. </em>(Henry VI.)

Counsel on both sides concur that the dissolution of monasteries, and of certain ecclesiastical aggregate and sole corporations, and the recusancy and consequent disfranchisement of many incumbents of ben\u00e9fices of this descripci\u00f3n, had, by the time of Elizabeth, caused many charities, previously valid, rj fail for want of their anterior support of corporate trustees or administrateThe recitals and enactments of the statutes of this and the previous reigns, and particularly of the 39 and 43 Eliz. maybe explained by a due regard to this portion of the previous history of England. This is affirmed on both sides of the argument. It is not perceived that any just reasoning on this foundation tends to support the proposition that indefinite uncertain charities could subsist-'without the aid of an incorporation. On the contrary, the natural inference appears to he, that they could not be otherwise maintained, without statutory assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Judicial recognitions of charities before 39 and 43 Eliz. are liable to be misapplied, unless due cafe be observed in ascertaining the definition of a charijy as understood at'that day. The cases in which nothing more is said than thjjt the trust, or use, or purpose was a charitable one, prove nothing. Whatever the true modern, technical definition-may be, the passages cited from Reevefe\u2019 History prove, that the term charity in the olden time-was frequently .applied to trusts which were neither uncertain in their objects, nor perpetual in their-duration; in other words, to subjects for which a trust could have been maintained according, to the ordinary rules of property, as contradistinguished from the Tides of charities. Edwards <em>v. </em>Kimpton, read from (Record Commission) 1 Ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>lendar of Proceedings in Chancery, 280, was the case of a rent granted for the relief of the converts inhabiting the house belonging to-the Master of the Rolls. In Lyon <em>v. </em>Hews, same publication, vol. 2, p. 44, both bill and answer mention works of charity as the objects of the trust to be enforced, and qtate that the property had been left for religious and charitable purposes. But the-purposes and objects of this trust were specifically declared, and were, 1st. Finding a priest by a year in a certain church; 2d. Making an aisle in the porch of the same church; 3d. Marriage of five poor maidens; and 4th. Amending the highways in the lane behind the mews. Of these uses none was to be extended to a perpetuity, and none was in any greater degree uncertain than must necessarily be the case with objects of a power or discretion exercisable within the period of a perpetuity. So in Alderman Symond\u2019s case, in Moore\u2019s Readings, Duke, 163; the \u201c charitable use,\u201d decreed before the statute, \u201c upon ordinary and judicial equity in chancery,\u201d though not described as to its objects, appears to have been 'one of which a final disposition could be made within a reasonable period. The case in 38 Assizes, 222, (a) Vol. 3, was one in which the distribution, for the good of the testator\u2019s soul, was to be made by his executors; i. e. within a life in being. Of the fifty cases quoted from these Calendars, three only are stated at length. 'Of the rest nothing\u2019 more than a meager abstract is presented. Of the three which are given at large, one, Lyon <em>v. </em>Hews, is mentioned above. In each-of the two others, a patent or license had been obtained from the crown, enabling the trustees to hold the land conformably to the provisions of the trust. In many of the other cases, the proceedings, if given in full, would doubtless indicate the same thing. The statutes of mortmain must otherwise have prevented the grants from being available. One of the-cases mentioned in the Calendar,vol. 2, p. 264, Newton <em>v. </em>Kitteridge, a bill to protect the complainant\u2019s title against an inquisition for charitable uses, by which his land had been found to have been given to the poor of Aldham, certainly occurred after, and was \u2022 founded on the 43 or 39 Eliz. The same thing is probably true of very many of the others of which the date is not given. It is remarkable that although all of the cases in the Calendar on various subjects are entitled as of the reign of Elizabeth, or of earlier reigns, some of them, in the places where abstracted, are stated to have occurred during the usurpation, and others at dates in the reign, of James I. Of all the cases in the Calendar, only seven, including the three above mentioned, are shown to have occurred before the statute 39 Eliz. But all this is perhaps unimportant here. Upon such examination as'has been practicable, it is apprehended that none of the cases previous to 39 Eliz,, and none of those'of uncertain date, can be said affirmatively to have beenjnstances of indefinite perpetual charity.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">To understand some of them it is necessary to refer to 1 Edw. 6, c. 14, which made masters of grammar schools corporations sole; and to understand a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>larger number of them, it will be right to refer to the doctrine which prevailed before the statute, of Elizabeth, under which, gifts of chattel <em>&lt; </em>to the poor of a municipal or religious' corporation, were sustained as gifts to the corporation; a doctrine which affirms the competency of the corporation, and the incapacity of the poor. This doctrine is thus laid down in the note to the case in 38 Assizes, mentioned above.' It is there stated to have been the opinion of. the court that if a man give bond or other thing, to A. and B., parishioners of a certain church, and to the parishioners of the said church, the gift is good, and it vests in the church, <em>See. </em>The same doctrine, in those days, was held in the case of land where there had.been a license or dispensation with the mortmain acts. Of course the same rule applied where there was a trust for a corporation, or for its poor, or its members. If the purpose's of the. grant were consistent with th\u00e9 objects of the charter, the gift could be sustained independently of the peculiar law of charities. Now, with the exception of four or five instances where the charity does not appear to have been of undefined duration, and of which the date, whether before or after the statute 39 Eliz. does not appear, it is believed, subject to correction, that in all the cases cited from this Calendar, and not already particularly noticed, there had been a grant or devise to, or in trust for, a municipal or private corporation; and in most instances the pm;:&gt;eediflg was by, or on behalf of,.such a corporation. These cases, therefore, furnish strong negative evidence that the law before the statute^ 39 and 43 Eliz. did not rest on the \u2019\u2019same footing as it has since stood upon. If it had been thus established, the trustees for the inhabitants of a municipality, or for the poor of a parish or a church, would not have needed the protection <em>o\u00ed </em>the corporations and <em>quasi </em>corporations, under whose capacity to take and to enjoy, they appear to have thought it necessary'to shelter themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"266\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b193-5\">Mr. Justice STORY</author>\n<p id=\"AZP\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">This cause has been argued with great learning and ability.

[See statement of the reporter.]</p>\n<p id=\"A3T\">These are the material clauses of the will which seem necessary \u2022to be brought under our review in the present controversy. By a codicil dated the 20th of June, A. D. 1831, the testator m\u00e1de the following provision: \u00ab Whereas I, Stephen Girard, the testator named in the foregoing will arid testament, dated February 16th, 1830, have since the execution thereof, purchased several parcels and pieces of land and real estate, and have built sundry messuages, all of which, as well as any real estate that I may hereafter purchase, it is my intention to pass by said will; and whereas, in particular, I have recently purchased from Mr. William Parker, the mansion-house, out-buildings, and forty-five acres and some perches of land, called Peel Hall, on the Ridge road, in Penn Township: Now, I declare it to be my intention, and I direct, that- the orphan establishment, provided for in my said will, instead of being built .as therein directed-upon my square of ground between High and Chestnut and Eleventh and Twelfth streets, in the city of Philadelphia, shall be built upon the estate so purchased from Mr. W. Parker, and I hereby devote the said estate to that purpose, exclusively, in the same manner as I had devoted the said square, hereby directing that all the improvements and arrangements for the. said orphan establishment, prescribed by my said will, as to said square, shall be made and executed upon the said estate, just as if I had in my will devoted the. said estate to said purpose \u2014 consequently, the said square of ground is- to consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>tute, and T declare it to be a part of the residue and remainder'of my real and personal estate, and given and devised for the same uses and purposes as are declared in section twenty of my will, it being my. intention, that the said square of ground shall be built upon, and improved in such a manner as to secure a safe and nermanent income for the purposes stated in said twentieth section.\u201d The testator died in the same year; and his will and codicil were duly .admitted to probate on the 31st . of December of the same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The legislature of Pennsylvania passed the requisite laws to carry into effect the will, so far as respected the bequests of the $500,000 for the Delaware Avenue and the $300,000 for internal improvement by canal navigation, according to the request of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The present bill is brought by the heirs at law of the testator, to have the devise of the residue and remainder-of the real-estate to the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of Philadelphia in tru^t ,as aforesaid to be declared void, for the want of capacity of -the supposed devisees to take lands by devise, or if capable of taking generally by devise for their own use and benefit, for want of Capacity'to take such lands' as devisees in trust'; and because the objects of the charity for which the lands are so devised in trust are altogether vague, indefinite, and uncertain, and so no trust is created by the said will which is capable of being executed or of being cognisable at law or in equity, nor' any trust-estate devised that can vest at law or in equity in any existing or possible <em>cestui que trust; </em>and therefore the bill insists that as the trust'is void, there is a resulting trust thereof for the heirs at law of the testator '; and the bill accordingly seeks a declaration to that .effect and the relief consequent th\u00e9reon, and for a discovery and account, and for other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The principal questions, to which the arguments at the bar have been mainly addressed, are; First, whether the corporation of the city of Philadelphia is capable of taking the bequest of the real and personal estate for the erection 'and support of a college upon the trusts and for the uses designated in the will: Secondly, whether these uses are charitable uses valid in their nature and capable of being carried into effect consistently with the laws of Pennsylvania: Thirdly, if not, whether, being void, the fund falls into the residue of the testator\u2019s estate,- and belongs to the corporation of the city, in virtue of the residuary clause in the will; or it belongs, as a resulting or implied'trust, to the heirs and next of kin of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">As to the firs: question, so far as it.respects the capacity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>corporation to take the real and personal estate, independently of the trusts and uses connected therewith j there would not seem to be any reasonable ground for doubt. The act of 32 and 34 Henry 8, respecting wills, excepts corporations from taking by devise; but this provision has never been .adopted into the laws of Pennsylvania or in force there. The act of 11th of March, 1789, incorporating the city of Philadelphia, expressly provides that tire corporation, thereby constituted by the name and style of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens of Philadelphia, shall have perpetual succession, \u00ab and they and their successors shall at all times for ever be capable in law to have, purchase, take, receive, possess, and enjoy lands, tenements and hereditaments, liberties, franchises and jurisdictions, goods, chattels, and effects-to them and their successors for ever, or for any other or less estate,\u201d &amp;c., without any limitation whatsoever as to the value or amount thereof, or as to the purposes to which the same were to be applied, except so far as may be gathered -from the preamble of the act, which recites that the then administration of government within the city of Philadelphia was in its form <em>\u201c </em>inadequate to (lie suppression of vice and immorality, to the advancement of the public health and order, and to the promotion of trade, industry, and happiness, and in order to provide against the evils occasioned-thereby, it is necessary to invest, the inhabitants thereof with more speedy, rigorous, and effective powers of government than at present established.\u201d Some, at least, of these objects might certainly be promoted by the application of the city property or its income to them \u2014 and especially the suppression of vice and immorality, and the promotion of trade, industry, and-happiness. And if a devise of real estate had 1 een made to the city directly for such objects, it would be difficult to perceive why such trusts should not be deemed within the true scope of the city charter and protected thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Bui without doing more at present than merely to glance at this consideration, let us proceed to,the inquiry whether the corporation of the city can take real and personal property in trust. Now, although it was in early mnes held that a corporation could not take and hold real or personal estate in trust upon the ground that theie was a defect of one of the requisites to create a good, trustee, viz., the want of confidence in the person; yet that doctrine has been long since exploded as unsound, and .too artificial; and it is now held, that where the corporation has a legal capacity to take real or personal estate, there it may take and hold it upon trust, in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>manner and to the same extent as a private person may do. It. is true that, if the trust be rep.ugnant to, or inconsistent with the proper ^purposes for which the corporation was created, thaf may furnish a \u2022ground why it may not be compellabl\u00e9 to execute it. But that will furnish no- ground to declare the trust itself void, if otherwise, unexceptionable ; but it will simply require a new trustee to be substituted by-the proper court, possessing equity jurisdibtion, to enforce and perfect.the objects .of the trust. This will be sufficiently obvious upon an examination of the .authorities; but a single case may suffice. In. Sonley <em>v. </em>The Clockmaker\u2019s Company, 1 Bro. Ch. R. 81, there was a devise of freehold estate to the testator\u2019s wife for life, with remainder to his brother C. in tail male, with remainder to the Clockmaker\u2019s Company, in trust to sell for the benefit of the testator\u2019s nephews and nieces. The devise being to a corporation, was, by the English statute of wills, void, that statute prohibiting devises to corporations, and the question was, whether the devise being so void, the heir at law took' beneficially or subject to the trust. Mr. Baron Eyre, in his .judgment, said, that although the devise to the corporation be void at law, yet the trust is sufficiently created to fasten itself upon tiny estate the law may raise. This is the ground upon which courts of equity have decreed-, in cases where no trustee is named. Now, this was a. case not of a charitable devise, but a trust created for nephews and nieces; so that if steers .wide from the doctrines which have been established as to devises to corporations for charities as appointments under, the statute of 43 Elizabeth: <em>a, fortiori, </em>the doctrine of this case mrist apply with increased stringency to a case where the corporation is. capable at law to take the estate devised, but- the trusts fire utterly dehors the purposes of the incorporation. In such a case, the trust itself being good, will be executed by and under the authority of a court of. equity. Neither is there-any positive objection in point of law to a corporation taking property upon a trust'not strictly within th\u00e9 scope of the direct purposes of its institution, but collateral to them; nay, for the benefit of a stranger or of another corporation. In the case of Green <em>v. </em>Rutherforth, 1 Ves. R. 462, a devise was made to St. John\u2019s College in Cambridge of th\u00e9 perpetual advowspn of a rectory.in .trust, that whenever the church should be void and his nephew be capable of being presented thereto, they should present him.; , and on the next avoidance should present one of his name and kindred, if there should be any one capable . thereof in the college; if' none such, they should present the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>senior divine then-fellow of the college, and on his refusal the next senior divine, and so downward; and, jf all \u25a0 refused, they should-present any other person they should think fit. Upon the argument-of the .cause, an objection was-taken that the case was not cognisable in a court of equity, but fell within the jurisdiction of /the visitor.Sir John Strange (the Master of the Rolls) who assisted Lord H\u00e1rdwicke at the hearing of the cause, on that occasion said: \u00ab A private person would, undoubtedly, be compellable to execute it (the trust;) and, considered as a trust, it makes no difference who are the trustees, the power of this court operating on them in the capacity of trustees. And thbugh they are a collegiate body whose founder has given a Visitor to superintend his own foundation and bounty; yet as between one claiming under a separate benefactor and these -trustees for special purposes, the court will look on them as trustees only, and oblige-them to execute it under direction of the court.\u201d Lord Hardwicke, after expressing his concurrence in the judgment of the Master of the Rolls, put the case of the like trust being to present no member of another'college, and held that the court would have jurisdiction to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">But if the purposes of the trust be germane to the objects of the incorporation.; if they relate to matters which will promote, and aid, and perfect those objects; if they tend (as the charter of -the city of Philadelphia expresses it) \u201c to the suppression of vice and immorality, to the advancement of the public health and order, and to the promotion of trade, industry, and happiness,\u201d where is the. law to be found which prohibits the corporation from taking the devise upon such -trusts, in a state where the statutes of mortmain do not exist, (as they do not in Pennsylvania,) the corporation itself having a legal capacity to take the estate as well by devise as otherwise ? We know of no authorities which inculcate such a doctrine or prohibit the execution of such trusts, even though the act of incorporation-may have for its main objects mere civil and municipal government and regulations and powers. If, for example, the testator by his present will had devised certain estate of the valufe of $1,000,000 for the purpose of applying, the income thereof to supplying the city of Philadelphia with good Emd wholesome water for the use of the citizens, from the river Schuylkill, (an object which some thirty or forty years ago would have been thought of transcendant benefit,) why, although not specifically enumerated among the objects of 'the charter, wc rid not such a devise upon such a trust have been valid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>and within' the scope of the legitimate purposes of the corporation, and the corporation capable of executing it as trustees ? We profess ourselves unable to perceive any sound objection to the validity of such a'trust; and we know of no authority to sustain any objection to it. Yet, in substance, the trust would be as remote from the express provisions of the charter as are the objects (supposing them otherwise maintainable) now under, our .eonsideratibn. In short, it appears to us that any .attempt to narrow down the-powers given to the corporation so \u25a0 as to exclude it from taking property upon trusts'for purposes confessedly charitable and beneficial to the city or the public, would be tp introduce a doctrine inconsistent with sound principles, and defeat instead of promoting, the true- policy of the state.' We think, then, that the charter of the city does invest the corporation with powers and rights to take property upon trust for charitable purposes, which are not otherwise obnoxious to legal animadversion; .and, therefore,, the objection that it is incompeteht to take or administer a trust is unfounded in principle or authority, under the law of Pennsylvania;</p>\n<p id=\"AeA\">It is manifest that the legislature of Pennsylvania aeted uf&gt;on this interpretation of the charter of the. city, in passing the acts of the 24th of March,' and the 4th of April, 1832, to carry into effect certain improvements and execute certain trusts, under the will of Mr. Girard. The preamble to the trust act,, expressly states that it is passed \u201c to effect the improvements contemplated by-the said testator, and to'execute, in all other respects, the trusts created by his will,\u201d as to which, the. testator had desired the legislature to pass the necessary laws. The tenth section of the same act, provide? \u201c That it shall be lawful for the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of Philadelphia, to exercise all such jurisdiction, enact all such ordinances, and to do and execute all such acts and things whatsoever, as may be necessary and convenient for the full and entire acceptance, execution, and prosecution of any and all the devises, bequests, trusts, and provisions contained in the said will, &amp;c., &amp;c.; to carry which into effect,\u201d the testator had desired the legislature to enact the necessary laws. But what is more direct to the present purpose, because it imports a full recognition of the validity of the devise for the erection of the college, is the provision of the 11th section of the same act, which declares That no road or street shall be laid out, or passed through the land in the county of Philadelphia, bequeathed by the late Stephen Girard for the erection of a college,, unless the same shall be recommended by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the trastees or directors of the said college, and approved by a majority of the select and common councils of the city of Philadel-. phia.-\u201d The other act is also full and direct to the same purpose, and provides \u201c That the select and common councils of the city of Philadelphia, shall be and they are hereby authorized to provide, by ordinance or. otherwise, for the election or appointment of such officers and agents as they may deem essmtial to the due execution of the duties and trusts enjoined and created by the will of the late Stephen Girard.\u201d Here then, there is a positive authority conferred upon the city authorities to act upon the trusts under the will, and to administer the same through the instrumentality of agents appointed by them. No doubt can then be entertained, that the legislature meant to affirm the entire validity of those trusts, and the entire competency of the c\u00f3rporation to take and hold the. property .devised upon the trusts named in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">It is true that this is not a judicial decision, and entitled to full weight and confidence as such. But it is a legislative exposition and confirmation of the competency of the corporation to take the property and execute the trusts; and if those trusts were valid in' point of law, the legislature would be estopped thereafter to contest the competency of the corporation to take the property and execute the trusts, either upon a <em>quo warranto </em>or any other proceeding, by which it should seek to devest the property, and invest other trustees with tlie execution of the trusts, upon the ground of any supposed incompetency of the corporation. And if the trusts were in themselves valid in point of law, it is plain that neither the heirs of the testator, nor any other private persons, could have any right to inquire into, or contest the right of the corporation to take tlie property, or to execute the trusts; but this right would exclusively belong to the state in its sovereign capacity, and in its sole- discretion, to inquire into and contest the same by a <em>quo </em>warranto, or other proper judicial proceeding. In this vi. w of the matter, the recognition and confirmation of the devises and trusts of the will by the legislature, are of the highest importance and potency.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We are, then, led directly to the consideration of the question which has been so elaborately argued at the bar, as to the validity of the trusts for the erection of the college, according to the requirements and regulations of the will of the testator. That the trusts are of an eleemosynary nature, and charitable uses in a judicial sense, we entertain no doubt. Not only are charities for the maintenance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>and relief of the poor, sick, and impotent, charities in the sense of the common law, but also donations given for the establishment of colleges, schools, and seminaries of learning, and especially such as are for the education of orphans and poor scholars.</p>\n<p id=\"A1um\">The statute of the 43 of Elizabeth,- ch. 4, has been adjudged by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania not to be in force in that state. But then it has been solemnly and recently adjudged by the same court, in the case of Zimmerman v. Andres, (January term, 1844,) that \u201cit is so considered rather on account of the inapplicability of its regulations as to the modes of proceeding, .than in reference to its conservative provisions.\u201d \u201cThese have been in force here by common usage. and constitutional recognition; and not only these, but the more extensive range of charitable uses which chancery supported before that statute and beyond it.\u201d Nor is this any new doctrine in that court; for it was formally promulgated in the case of Witman <em>v. </em>Lex, 17 Serg. and Rawle, 88, at a much earlier period, (1827.)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Several objections have been taken to the present bequest to extract it from the reach of these decisions. In the first place, that the corporation of the city is incapable by law of taking the donation for such trusts. This objection has been already sufficiently considered. In the next place, it is said, that the beneficiaries who are to receive the benefit of the charity are too uncertain and indefinite to allow the bequest to have- any legal effect, and hence the donation is void, and the property results to the heirs. And in support of this argument we are pressed by the argument that charities of such an indefinite nature are not good at the common law, (which is admitted on all sides to be the law of Pennsylvania, so far as it is applicable to its institutions and constitutional organization and civil rights and privileges) and hence, the charity fails; and the decision of this court in .the case of the trustees of the Philadelphia Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s Executors, 4 Wheat. R. 1, is strongly relied on as fully, in point. - There are two circumstances which materially distinguish that case from the.one now before the court. The first is, that that case arose under the law of Virginia, in which state the statute of 43 Elizabeth, ch. 4, had been expressly and entirely abolished by the legislature, so that no aid whatsoever could be derived from its provisions to sustain the bequest: The second is, that the donees (the trastees) were an unincorporated association, which had no legal capacity to take and hold the donation in succession for the purposes of the trust, and the beneficiari\u00e9s also were uncertain and indefinite. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Both circumstances, therefore, concurred; a donation to trustees inca-, pable of taking, and beneficiaries uncertain and indefinite. The court, upon that occasion, went into an elaborate examination of the doctrine of the common law on the subject of charities, antecedent to and independent of the statute of 43 Elizabeth, ch. 4, for that was still the common law of Virginia. Upon a thorough examination of all the authorities and all the lights, (certainly in no small degree shadowy, obscure, and flickering,) the court came to the'conclusion-that, at the common law, no donation to charity could be enforced in chancery, where both of these circumstances, or rather, where both of these defects occurred. The court said: \u00ab We find no dictum that charities could be established on such an information (by. the-attorney-general) where the conveyance was defective or the donation was so vaguely expressed that the donee,-, if not a charity, would <em>be </em>incapable of taking.\u201d In reviewing the authorities upon that occasion, much reliance was placed upon Callison\u2019s case, Hobart\u2019s Rep. 136; (S. C. cited Duke on Charities, by Bridgman, 368, Moore, R. 888,) and Platt <em>v. St </em>John\u2019s College, Cambridge, Finch. Rep. 221; (S. C. 1 Cas. in Chan. R. 267, Duke on Charities, by Bridgman, 379,) and the ease reported in 1 Chancery Cases, 134. But these cases, as also Flood\u2019s case, Hob. R. 136, (S. C. 1 Equity Abridg. 95, pl. 6,) turned upon peculiar circumstances. Collison\u2019s case was upon a devise in 15 Henry 8, and was before the statute of\u2018wills. The other cases were cases where the donees could not take at law, not being properly described, or not having a competent capacity to take, so that there was no legal trustee; and. yet the devises were held good as valid appointments under the statute of 43 Elizabeth. The dictum of Lord Loughborough in Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Bowyer, 3 Ves. 714, 726, was greatly relied on, where he says: \u00abIt does not- appear that this court at that period (that is before the statute of wills) had cognisance upon information for the establishment of charities. Prior to the time of Lord Ellesmere, as far as tradition in times immediately following goes, there were no such informations as this on which I am now sitting, (an information to establish a college under a devise before the statute of mortmain of 9 Geo. 2, ch. 36;) but they made out their case as well as they could at law.\u201d In this suggestion Lord Loughborough had under his consideration Porter\u2019s case, 1 Co. Rep. 16. But there a devise was made in 32 Henry 8, to the testator\u2019s wife, upon condition for her to grant the lands, &amp;c., in all convenient speed after his decease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>for the maintenance and continuance of a certain free-school, and almsmen and almswomen for ever. The heir entered for and after condition broken, and then conveyed the same lands to Queen Elizabeth in 34 of her reign; and the queen brought an information of intrusion against Porter for the land in the same year. One question was, whether the devise was not to a superstitious use, and therefore void under the act of 23 Henry 8, ch. 2, or whether it was. good as a charitable use. And it was resolved by the court that the use was a good charitable use, and that the statute did not extend to it. So that here we haVe a plain case of a charity held good, before the statute of Elizabeth, upon the ground of the common law, there being a good devisee originally, although the condition was broken and the use was for charitable purposes in some respects indefinite. Now if there was a good devisee to take as trustee, and the charity was good at the common law, it seems somewhat difficult to say,, why, if no legal remedy was adequate to redress it, the Court of Chancery might not enforce the trust, since trusts for other specific purposes, were then, at least when there were designated trustees, within the jurisdiction of chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">There are, however, dicta of eminent judges, (some of which were commented upon in the case of 4 Wheat. R. 1,) which-do certainly support the doctrine that charitable uses might be enforced in chancery upon the general jurisdiction of the court, independently of \u00bfhe statute of 43 of Elizabeth; and that the jurisdiction had been acted upon not only subsequent but antecedent to that statute. Such was the opinion of Sir Joseph Jekyll in Eyre <em>v. </em>Countess of Shaftsbury, (2 P. Will. R. 102, 2 Equity Abridg. 710, pl. 2,) and that of Lord Northington in Attorney-General v. Tancred, 1 Eden, R. 10, (S. C. Ambler, R. 351, 1 Wm. Black. R. 90,) and that of Lord Chief Justice Wilmot in his elaborate judgment in Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Lady Downing, Wilmot\u2019s Notes, p. 1, 26, given after an examination of all the leading authorities. Lord Eldon, in the Attorney-General <em>v. </em>The Skinner\u2019s Company, 2 Russ. R. 407, intimates in clear terms his doubts whether the jurisdiction of chancery over charities arose solely under the statute of Elizabeth; suggesting that the statute has perhaps been construed with reference to a supposed antecedent jurisdiction of the court) by which void devises to charitable purposes were sustained. Sir John Leach, in the case of a charitable use before the statute of Elizabeth, (Attorney-General <em>v. </em>The Master of Brentwood School, 1 Mylne and Keen, 376,) said: \u201c Although at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>his time no legal devise could be made to a corporation for a charitable use, yet lands so devised were in equity bound by a trust for the charity, which a court of equity would then execute.\u201d In point of fact the charity was so decreed in that very case, in the 12th year of Elizabeth'. But what is still more important is the declaration of Lord Redesdale, a great judge in equity, in the Attorney-General <em>v. </em>The Mayor of Dublin, 1 Bligh R. 312, 347, (1827,) where he says: \"We are referred to the statute of Elizabeth with respect to charitable uses, as creating a new law upon the subject of charitable uses. That statute-orily created a new jurisdiction; it created no new law. It created a new and ancillary jurisdiction, a jurisdiction created by commission, &amp;c.; but the proceedings of that commission were made subject to appeal to the Lord Chancellor, and he might reverse or affirm what they had done, or make such order as he might think fit for reserving the controlling jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery as it existed before the passing of - that statute; and there can be no doubt that by information by the attorney-general' the same thing might be done,\u201d He then adds, \u00ab the right which the attorney-general has to file an information, is a right of prerogative. The king, as <em>parens </em>patria, has a right, by his proper officer, to call upon the several courts of justice, according to the nature of their several jurisdictions, to see that light is done to his subjects who are incompetent to act for themselves, as in the ease of charities and other cases.\u201d So that Lord Redesdale maintains the jurisdiction in the broadest terms, as founded in the inherent jurisdiction of chancery independently of the statute of 43 Elizabeth. In addition to these dicta and doctrines, there is the very recent case of the Incorporated Society <em>v. </em>Richards, 1 Drury and Warren R. 258. where Lord Chancellor Sugden, in a very masterly judgment, upon a full survey of all the authorities, and where the point was directly before him, held the same doctrine as Lord Redesdale, and expressly decided that- there is an inherent jurisdiction in equity in cases of charity, and that charity is ore of those objects for which -a court of equity has at all times interfered to make good- that, which at law was an illegal or informal gift; and that cases of charity in courts of equity in England were valid independently of and previous to the statute of Elizabeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Mr. Justice Baldwin, in the case of tire will .of Sarah Zane, which was cited at the bar and pronounced at April term of the Circuit Court, in 1833, after very extensive and learned researches into the ancient English authorities and statutes, arrived at the same conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>sion in which the district judge, the late lamented Judge Hopkinson, concurred; and th'at opinion has a more pointed bearing upon the present case, since it included a full review of the Pennsylvania laws and doctrines on the subject of charities.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">But very strong additional light has been thrown upon this subject by the recent publications of the Commissioners on the public Records in England, which contain a..very curious and interesting collection of the chancery records in the- reign of Queen Elizabeth, and in the earlier reigns. Among these are found many cases in which the .Court of Chancery, entertained jurisdiction over charities long before, the statute of 43 Elizabeth; and some fifty of these cases, extracted from the printed calendars, have been laid before us. They establish in the most satisfactory and conclusive manner that cases of charities where there were trustees appointed for general and indefinite charities, as well as for sp'ecific charities, were familiarly known to, and acted upon, and enforced in the Court of Chancery. In some of these cases the charities, were not only of an uncertain and indefinite nature,, but, as far as we can gather from the imperfect statement in the printed records, they were also cases where there were either no trustees appointed, or the trustees were not competent to take. These records, therefore, do in a remarkable manner, confirm the opinions of Sir Joseph Jekyll, Lord Northington, Lord Chief Justice Wilmot, Lord Redesdale, and Lord Chancellor Sugden.' Whatever doubts, therefore, might properly be entertained upon the subject when the case of the Trustees of the Philadelphia Baptist Association <em>v. </em>Hart\u2019s Executors, 4 Wheat. 1, was before this court, (1819,) those doubts are entirely removed by the late and more satisfactory sources of information to which we have alluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">If, then, this be the true state of the' common law on the subject of charities, it would, upon the general principle already suggested, be a part of the common law of Pennsylvania. It would be no answer to say, that if so it was dormant, and that no court possessing equity powers now exists, or has existed in Pennsylvania, capable of enforcing such trusts. The trusts would nevertheless be valid in point of law; and remedies may from time to time be applied by the legislature' to supply the defects. It is no proof of the non-existence pf equitable rights, that there exists no adequate legal remedy to enforce them. They may during the time slumber, but they are not dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\u2022But the very point of the positive existence of the law bf charities in Pennsylvania, has been (as already stated) fully recognised and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>enforced in the state courts of Pennsylvania, as far as their remedial process would enable these courts to act. This is abundantly established in the cases cited at the bar, and especially by the case of Witman <em>v. </em>Lex, 17 Serg. and Rawle, 88, and that of Sarah Zane\u2019s will, before Mr. Justice Baldwin and Judge Hopkinson. In the former case, the court said \u201c that it is immaterial .whether the person to take be <em>in, esse^or </em>not, or whether the legatee were at the time of the bequest a corporation capable of taking or not, or how uncertain the objects may be, provided there be a discretionary power vested anywhere over the application of the-testator\u2019s bounty to those objects; or whether their corporate designation be mistaken. If the intention sufficientty appears in the bequest, it would be valid.\u201d In the latter qase certain bequests given by the will of Mrs. Zane to the Yearly Meeting of Friends in Philadelphia, an unincorporated association, for purposes of general and indefinite charity, were, as well as other bequests of a kindred nature, held to be good and valid; arid were enforced accordingly. The case then, according to'- our judgment, is completely closed in by the principles and authorities already mentioned, and is that of a valid charity in Pennsylvania, unless it is rendered void by the remaining objection which has -been taken to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">This objection is that the foundation of the college upon the principles and exclusions prescribed by the testator, is derogatory and hostile to the Christian religion, and so is void, as being against the common law and public \u25a0 policy of Pennsylvania; and .this for two reasons: First, because of the exclusion of all ecclesiastics, missionaries, and ministers of any sect from holding or exercising any station or duty in the college, or even visiting the same: and Secondly,-because it limits the instruction to be given to the scholars to pure morality, and general benevolence, arid a love qf truth, sobriety, and industry, thereby excluding, by implication, -all instruction in the Christian religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In considering this objection, the court are not at liberty to travel out of the record in order to ascertain what were the private religious opinions of the testator, (of which indeed we can know nothing,)'nor to consider whether the scheme of education by him prescribed, is such as we ourselves should approve, or as is best adapted to accomplish the great aims and ends of education, Nor are we at liberty to look at general considerations of the supposed public interests and policy of Pennsylvania upon this subject, beyond what its constitution- and laws and judicial decisions make known to us. The question, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>is the public policy of a state, and what is contrary to it, if inquired into beyond these limits, will be found to be one of great vagueness and uncertainty, and to involve discussions which scarcely come within the range of judicial duty and functions, and upon which men may and will complexionally differabove all, when that topic is connected with religious polity, in a country composed Of such a variety of religious sects as our country, it is impossible not to feel that it would be attended with almost insuperable difficulties, and.involve differences of opinion almost endless in their variety. We disclaim any right to enter upon such examinations, beyond what the state constitutions, and laws, and decisions necessarily bring before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">It is also said, and truly, that the Christian religion is a part of the common law of Pennsylvania. But this.proposition is to be received \u2022with its appropriate qualifications, and in connection with the bill of rights of that state, as found in its constitution of government. The constitution of 1790, (and the like provision will, in substance, be found in the constitution of 1776, and in the existing constitution of 1838,) expressly declares, \u00ab That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences; no man can of right be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry against his consent; no human authority can, in any case whatever, contr\u00f3l or interfere with the rights of conscience \u2022; and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship.\u201d' Language more comprehensive for the complete protection of every variety \u00f3f religious opinion could scarcely be used; and it must have been intended to extend equally to all sects, whether they believed in Christianity or. not, and whether they were Jews or infidels.' So- that We are compelled to admit that although Christianity be a part of the common law of the state, yet it is so in this qualified sense, that its divine origin and truth are admitted, and therefore it is not to be maliciously and openly reviled and blasphemed against, to the annoyance of believers or the injury of the public. Such Was the doctrine of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Updegraff <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 11 Serg. and Rawle, 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">It is unnecessary for\" us, however, to consider what would be the legal effect of a devise in Pennsylvania for the establishment of a school or college, for the propagation of Judaism, or Dejsm, or any other form of infidelity. Such a case is not to be presumed to exist in a Christian country; and therefore it must be made out by clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>and indisputable proof. Remote inferences, or possible results, or speculative tendencies, are not to be drawn or adopted for such purposes. There must be plain, positive, and express provisions, demonstrating not only that Christianity is not to be taught; but that it is to be impugned or repudiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Now, in the present- case, there is no pretence to say that any such positive or express provisions exist, or are even shadowed forth in the will. The testator does not say that Christianity shall not be taught in the college. But only that no ecclesiastic of any sect shall hold or exercise any station or duty ir&gt; the college. Suppose, instead of this, he had said that no person but a layman shall be an instructor or officer or visitor in the college, what legal objection could have been made to such a restriction ? . And yet the actual prohibition is in- effect the same in substance. But it is asked; why. ar\u00e9 ecclesiastics excluded, if it is. not because they are the stated and appropriate preachers of Christianity ? The answer may be given in the very words of the testator. <em>\u201c </em>In making this restriction,\u2019^ says he, \u00abI do not mean to cast any reflection upon any sect or person whatsoever. But as there is such a multitude of sects and such a diversity of opinion amongst them, I desire to keep the tender minds of the orphans, who are to derive advantage from this bequest, free from the excitement which dashing doctrines and sectarian controversy are so apt to produce.\u201d Here, then, we have the reason given; and the question is not, whether it is satisfactory to us or not; nor whether the history of religion does or does not justify such a sweeping statement; but the question is, whether the exclusion be not such as the testator had a right, consistently with the laws of Pennsylvania, to maintain, upon his own notions of religious instruction. Suppose the testator had excluded all religious instructors but Catholics, or Quakers, or Swedenborgians; or, to put a stronger -case, he had excluded all religious instructors but Jews, would the bequest have. been void on that account ? Suppose he had excluded all lawyers, or all physicians, or all merchants from being instructors or visitors, would the prohibition have been fatal to the bequest ? The truth is, that in cases of this.sort, it is extremely difficult to draw any. just and satisfactory line of distinction in a free country as to the qualifications or disqualifications which may be insisted upon by the dbnor of a charity as to those who shall administer or partake of his bounty.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">But the objection itself assumes the proposition that Christianity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>is not to be taught, because ecclesiastics are not to be instructors or officers. But this is by no means a necessary or legitimate inference from the premises. Why may not laymen instruct in the general principles of Christianity' as well as ecclesiastics. There is no restriction tas to the religious opinions of the ^instructors and officers. They may be, and doubtless, under the auspices of the city government, they will always be, m\u00e9n, not only distinguished for learning and talent, but for piety and elevated virtue, and holy lives and characters. And we cannot overlook the blessings, which such men by their conduct, as well as their instructions, may, nay must impart to their youthful pupils. Why may not the Bible, and especially the New Testament, without note or. comment, be read and taught as a divine revelation in the college \u2014 its general precepts expounded, its evidences explained, and its glorious principles of morality inculcated ? What is there to prevent a work, not sectarian, upon the-general evidences of Christianity, from being read and taught in the college by lay-teachers ? Certainly there is nothing in the will, that proscribes- such studies. Above all, the testator positively enjoins, \u201c that all the instructors-and teachers in the college shall take pains to instil into the minds of .the scholars the purest principles of morality, s'o that on their entrance into active life they may from inclination and habit evince benevolence towards their fellow-creatures, and a love of truth, sobriety, and industry, adopting at the same time such religious tenets as their matured reason may enable them to prefer.\u201d Now, it may well be asked, what is these in all this, which is positively enjoined, inconsistent with the spirit or truths of Christianity? Are not these truths all taught by Christianity, although it teaches much more ? Where can the purest principles of morality be learned so clearly or so perfectly as from the New Testament? Where, are benevolence, the love of truth, sobriety, and industry, so powerfully and irresistibly'inculcated as in. the sacred volume?' The testator has not. said how these great principles are to be taught, or by whom, except it be by laymen, nor what books are to be used to explain or enforce them. All that w\u00e9 can gather from his language is, that he desired to exclude sectarians and sectarianism from the college, leaving the instructors and officers free to teach the purest morality, the love of truth, sobriety, and industry, by all appropriate means; and o,f course including the best, the surest, and the most impressive. The objection, then, in this- view, goes to this, \u2014 either that the testator has totally omitted to provide for religious instruction in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>scheme of education,-(which, from what has -been already said, is an inadmissible interpretation,) or that it includes but partial and imperfect instruction in those truths. In either view can it be truly said that it contravenes the known law of Pennsylvania upon the subject of charities, or is not-allowable under the article of the bill of rights already cited? -Is an omission to provide,for. instruction in Christianity iri any scheme of school or college education a fatal defect, which avoids it-according to the law of Pennsylvania? If the instruction provided for -is incomplete and imperfect, is it equally fatal ? These questions are propounded, because we are' not aware that any thing exists in the constitution or laws of Pennsylvania, or the judicial decisions of its tribunals, which would justify us in pronouncing that such defects would be so fatal. Let- us take the case of a charitable donation to teach poor orphans reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, and navigation, and excluding all other studies and instruction; would the donation be void, as a charity in Pennsylvania, as being deemed derogatory to Christianity ? Hitherto it has been supposed, that a charity for the instruction of the poor might be good and valid in England even if it did not go beyond the esta-' blishment of a grammar-school. And in America, it has been thought, in the absence of any express legal prohibitions, that the donor might select the studies, as well as the' classes of persons, who were to receive his bounty without being compellable to make religious instruction a necessary part of those studies. It has hitherto been \u2022thought sufficient, if he does not require any thing to be taught inconsistent with Christianity.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Looking to the objection therefore in a mere juridical view, which is the only one in which we are at liberty to consider it, we are \"satisfied that there is nothing in the devise establishing the college, or in the regulations and restrictions contained therein, which are inconsistent with the Christian religion, or are opposed to any known policy of the state of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">This view of the whole matter renders it unnecessary for us to examine the other and remaining question, to whom, if the devise were void, the property would belong, whether it would fall into the residue of the estate devised to the city, or become a resulting trust for the heirs at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Upon the whole, it is the unanimous opinion of the court, that the decree of the Circuit Court of Pennsylvania dismissing the bill, ought to be affirmed, and it is accordingly affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ORDER.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the .eastern district of Pennsylvania, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, It is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court, that the decree of the said Circuit Court, in this cause be, \u00e1nd the same is hereby affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
