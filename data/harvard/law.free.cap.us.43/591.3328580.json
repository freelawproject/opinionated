The defendant further'gave in evidence a Certificate of confirmation for the said lot to John Forbes and Company,- who were the successors of Pantoh, Leslie and Company, the original grantees; which is also made a part of this bill of exceptions, and marked B, by which it will appear that 304 feet were confirmed to Forbes and Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-7\">The defendant also proved that one Curtis Lewis, some time in 1822 or 1823, sunk some flat boats in the canal called Forbes and Company\u2019s, and proceeded to fill up the lots now sued for, but ttat one James Inerarily, one-of the firm of Forbes and Company, dispossessed him in the night, and erected a smith\u2019s-shop, and continued in possession about nine months, when Curtis Lewis regained possession by writ of forcible entry arid detainer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>It further appeared in evidence that the ridge-in Water street was .about fifteen or twenty feet in width, and that it was covered by the ordinary .tides for about one-third of its width, up to the year 1822, and that all the land east of Water street, as at present laid out, up to 1813, was below the ordinary high-water-mark.- It further appeared that the firm of Forbes and Company entered upon the lot granted to-them as aforesaid, and-made valuable improvements on it, and fulfilled the conditions of the grant, and on the 25th May, 1824, held the land to the west of Water street without dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-5\">It further appeared that the first improvements on the lot east of Water street were made by Curtis Lewis, except the -canal, and improvements along it, of John Forbes and Company; but it was also in evidence that, in 1811, a witness had seen the servants of Wm.

The deferidant then passed.the grant to the witnesses, who, upon an inspection -of the same, were of opinion that the -figures 09, in the date of 1809, on the face of the grant, had been altered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-10\">The plaintiff then offered witnesses who proved, that having inspected it with a spy-glass, the alteration was from 1810 to 1809. Plaintiffs also proved that Cayetano Perez was commandant at Mobile in 1810.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-11\">The defendant further gave in evidence that he had made valuable improvements on the lot sued for since the 8th day of January. 1836,-to the value of $7000; whereupon the plaintiffs, by their counsel, prayed the court to charge the jury, First, that the said Spanish grant made to William Pollard -was ratified and confirmed by the 8th article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>of the- treaty of amity, settlements and limits, between the United States and his Catholic Majesty, dated 22d February, 1819; which charge the court refused to give; to which the plaintiffs, by their counsel,: excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-5\">The plaintiffs theh, by their counsel, prayed the court to charge the jury that the act of Congress pf-26th May,-1836, confirmed the'said Spanish grant to Pollard;, which charge the court refused to give, but on the contrary, charged the jury, .if they believed the evidence to be \u2022 true, the fee-simple to .the. premises sued for were vested in Forbes and'Company, and that th\u00e9 acts of Congress of 1824 and 1836, and the patent in pursuance thereof, were utterly void, so. far as relates to the-premises in question, and that no title vested in the lessors of plaintiff by virtue of said acts off Congress and said patent; to which charge the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-6\">The plaintiffs, by their counsel, then prayed the court to charge the jury, that if they should.find that an alteration had been made in the date of Pollard\u2019s Spanish grant,.advantage could'not be taken.of.it in an action of ejectment, but by a <em>sd. fa. </em>in the name of the general government, or a bill in equity ; which charge the court refused to give, but, on the contrary, charged, that if they should believe that the date, had been altered, that they should find for the defendant, unless they were satisfied from the evidence-'that, though' altered, it was made in fact whilst Perez was' commandant; that the alteration pf the. date would not affect the .grant.-if Perez'was commandant at the time .of. the execution; but that if-altered, the law would not presume that the grant was made while Cayetano .Perez-, was. commandant, but that this must be shown by the evidence; to which charge, so given, and the refusal to charge as prayed,, th\u00e9'plaintiffs .excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-7\">.

It has been before stated, that this 'opinion of the court was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the stat\u00e9 of Alabama. The following extract from the opinion of the latter court, is given, in order that the remarks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>made by the Supreme Court of the United States may be fully understood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-5\">\u201c If the law, as laid down by a majority of the court, in the lessee of Pollard\u2019s heirs <em>v. </em>Kibbe, 14 Peters, 353, is to be regarded as decisive of the law applicable to the plaintiff\u2019s title, and as excluding all objection to it, then the answer given by the Circuit Court to the second charge prayed is confessedly' erroneous. Of the authority of that case we have nothing to say. We may, however, be permitted to remark, with- all deference, that we should yield to it more willingly, if it had the sanction of a majority of the -Supreme Court. We are aware that, as reported, the judgment seems to have been concurred in by five of the justices; but we have in our possession a manuscript copy of the opinions of Justice Thompson, McLean, Barbour, and .Catron, and the judgment that was rendered; at-the foot of which is the following memorandum:' \u2018Dissenting justices, Ca-tron, Barbour, and Wayne. Mr. Chief Justice Taney did not sit in this case.\u2019 Attested as follows, \u2018True copy, test. Wm. Thos. Carroll, C. S. C., U. S.\u2019 That Mr.- Justice McKinley was absent during the- entire term, appears from a note of the reporter. If the attestation of the clerk be correct, then but four' of the justices concurred in reversing the judgment of-this court. And to all this, it may be added, that Mr. Justice M.cLeari did not agree to the judgment of reversal, so far as We are informed by his opinion, upon the ground that the- grant to William Pollard in 1809 was a \u2018 new .grant\u2019 within the meaning of the .act of the 26th of M\u00e1y, 1824. But he .yielded his assent to the conclusion of Mr. Justice Thompson, (as we understand it,) because the. second section of that statute required the improvement to be made on the lot east of Water street, and to entitle the proprietor of the lot, immediately -west of the water-lot, the improvement should have been made by himself. These were ques.\u00a1tions, which, it seemed to us, were wholly unimportant to.be considered, unless Pollard\u2019s, was a \u2018new grant,\u2019 since it is an undisputed principle, that the plaintiff must recover upon the strength of his own title, and'not upon the weakness of his adversaries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-6\">\u201c We have taken this view of the case referred to, with the most profound respect for the Supreme Court of th\u00e9 United States, and have only to say, that we hope art opportunity may soon be afforded for a re-examination of the act of 18,24. \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-7\">Coare, for the plaintiff in error.;</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-8\">. <em>Sergeant, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>Coxe. </em>contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-5\">1.

In Pollard\u2019s lessee <em>v. </em>Kibbie; the paper was said to have been executed on December 12, 1809, and the court took this for granted. It was the foundation of the opinion. 14 Peters, 351. But this record shows that the date was altered, arid that 1809 was not the trufe one.

The plaintiff derived -no right from the act of 1836, or the patent under it. That act is .only a quit claim on the part of. the-United States, but they had nothing to grant. All their title had previously been granted to Forbes and Company, or to the city of Mobile, and the defendant unites those titles. The grant to Forbes and Company ran to the water; they had fulfilled all the conditions, had entered and made improvements before the act of 1824 passed. There was no Water street; nothing to divide them from the river. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The act of 1824 vested a title <em>per se, </em>and the parties had nothing to dp but go into court and show the facts in evidence. If the act of 1836 be considered as explanatoryof that of 1824, it is dangerous to construe a general act by a private one, obtained by a party for his own benefit. The true construction of that of 1824 is that the improvement must be made on the old loi; that every one who went to the water should not be cut off from it. It supposes an inchoate right to the lot in front, because an exception is, if a party has alienated the lot in front. He must, therefore, have had a right to alienate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b611-5\">In Esclava\u2019s case, the record showed that the party who owned the old lot had improved both the old and new..

But the plaintiff has a patent under the act of 1836. If the plaintiff had recovered below, and the defendant had excepted to instructions, the question about the grant would have come up. The President\u2019s proclamation was in 1810, but no act of Congress was passed until 1811, and the country was not taken possession of until after that act. The record shows that evidence was given on the trial that Perez was commandant in 1810.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b611-11\">The volume of State Papers referred to, shows that Perez issued a grant in May, 1811, and\" even as late as November, 1811.

It presents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>the same titles, and, substantially, the same facts, that were before this court in Pollard\u2019s heirs <em>v. </em>Kibbie, 14 Peters, 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The first'instruction asked by the plaintiff of the state Circuit Court is, that the Spanish grant made to William Pollard was ratified and confirmed by the eighth article, of the treaty with Spain of 1819, by which the Florida\u2019s were acquired. This the court refused to give; and correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">It is the settled doctrine of the judicial department of this government, that, the treaty of 18\u00cd9 ceded' no territory west of the river Perdido, but only that east of it: and therefore all grants made by Spain after the United States acquired.^ the country from France, in 1803, are void, if the lands granted lay west of that river; because made on territory acquired by the treaty of 1803; which extended to the Perdido east. It was thus held in Foster and Elam <em>v. </em>Neilson, <em>2 </em>Peters, 254, and again in Garcia <em>v. </em>Lee, 12 Peters, 515, and is not now open to controversy in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">2. Tire plaintiffs then, by their counsel, prayed the court to charge the jury that the act of Congress of 26th May, 1836, confirmed the said Spanish grant to Pollard; which charge the court refused to give, but, on the contrary, charged the jury, if they believed the evidence to be true, the fee-simple to the premises sued for were vested in Forbes and Co., and that the act of Congress of 1824, and 1836, and the patent in pursuance thereof, were utterly, void, so far as relates to the premises in question, and that no title vested in the lessors of plaintiff by virtue of said acts of Congress and said patent; to which charge the plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The questions raised by the -instruction asked and refusedand .that given, will be .examined so far only as to decide the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">This court held, when-Pollard\u2019s title was before it, formerly, that Congress had the power to grant the land to him by the act of 1836: on this point there was no difference of opinion at that time among the judges. The difference to which the Supreme Court of Alabama, in .the prese'nt case refers-, (in its opinion in the record',) grew out of the construction given by a majority of the court to the act of 1824, by which the vacant lands east of Water street, were granted to the city- of Mobile. That grant excepted out of it,, all lots to which, \u201c the Spanish government had made a new grant, or order of survey for the same, during the time at which they had the power to grant the. same.\u201d If Pollard\u2019s was such \u201c a new grant,\u201d then the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>covered by it was.excepted and did not pass to the city; and the act of 1836, and the patent founded on it, passed the title to Pollard.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">After the country west of the Perdido had been acquired by the treaty of 1803, the Spanish government continued to exercise jurisdiction over the country, including the city of Mobile, for some -nine years; the United States not seeing proper to take possession, and Spain refusing to surrender it, on the assumption that the country had not been ceded by that kingdom to France in the treaty of 1800; and of course that it did not pass to this country by our treaty with France. That Spain had no power to grant the soil, during the time she thus wrongfully held the possession, is settled by the cases cited of Foster and Elam <em>v. </em>Neilsoh; and Garcia <em>v. </em>Lee. But the right necessarily incident to the exer\u00f3ise of jurisdiction over the country and people rendered it proper that permits to settle and improve, by cultivation; or to authorize the erection of establishments for mechanical purposes, should be granted. And to this end the concession to Pollard, of December, 1809, was made. He set forth in his petition to the commandant, that he had a mill established on his plantation, and often came to Mobile with planks and property from it; and that he wished a place propitious and suitable for the landing and safety thereof; and havifig found a vacant piece at the river side, between the canal of Forbes and Co. and the public wharf, he solicits the commandant to grant him said lot on the river bank, to give more facility to his trading. This lot, the governor granted to. Pollard for the purpose set forth by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The use, for the purpose solicited, during the time the Spanish ahthprities were exercised, could be properly grant\u00e9d: of this there can be no doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Very many permits to settle on the public domain and cultivate, ' were also granted about the same time; which were in form incipient concessions of the land, and intended by the governor to give .title, and to receive confirmation afterwards from the king\u2019s deputy, so as to perfect them into a complete title. Pollard\u2019s was also of this description. Although the United States disavowed that any right to the soil, passed by such concessions; still they were not disregarded as giving no equity to the claimant: on the contrary, the first act of Congress passed (of April 25, 1812) after we got possession of the country, appointed a commissioner to report to Congress on them in common with all others originating before the treaty of 1803 took effect. The third section orders all persons, claiming lands, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the previously disputed territory \u201c by virtue of any grant, order of survey, or other evidence of claim, whatsoever derived from the French, British, or Spanish governments, to be laid before the commissioner, with a notice in writing, stating the nature, &amp;c., of the claim.\u201d On these, (by sec. 5,) the commissioner had power given him to inquire into the justice, and validity of the claims; and in every case it was his duty to ascertain whether the lands claimed had been inhabited and cultivated; at what time the inhabitation and cultivation commenced ;\u2022 when surveyed and by whom; and by what authority \u2014 and into every matter affecting their justice and validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">By sec. 6, abstracts were to be furnished to the secretary of the treasury, of the claims, arranged in classes, according to their respective merits; and these abstracts, &amp;c., were to be laid before Congress, for their determination thereon, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">By. sec. 8, the commissioner was ordered to report to Congress at its next session, a list of all actual settlers on the land in his district, who had no claims derived from either the French, British,\u2019 or Spanish governments, and the time such settlements were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">In January, 1816, the report of commissioner (Crawford) was laid before Congress. 3 Am. State Papers, 6, \u201cPublic Lands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The 14th sec. of the act of March 26th, 1804, declares all grants void if made for lands within the territories ceded by the French republic to the United States, by the treaty of the 13th of April, 1803, (and which had been acquired by France from Spain,) that had been made after the date above. Provided, that the law should not be construed to make void any <em>bona fide </em>grant made by the Spanish government, to an actual settler on the lands granted, for himself, and for his wife and family, &amp;e. On Pollard\u2019s claim the commissioner reported unfavourably, because it ha<em>d </em>not been inhabited nor cultivated.\u201d 3 State Papers, 18. The bill of exceptions refers to this report as it stands-in the book, as part of the bill of exceptions, and as such it is treated by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">In April, 1818, by a resolution of the senate, it was referred to the secretary of. the treasury to furnish a plan, for an adjustment of the claims reported on by the commissioners east and west of Pearl river: and on the 7th of December, 1818, the secretary made his report'in the form of a bill. 3 State Papers, 391. On all the imperfect claims favourably reported on, by the commissioners, derived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>from the authorities of Spain before the 20th of December,. 1803, a confirmation was recommended: And the land that had been cultivated on or before that day, should be confirmed also, as if the titles had been completed. And as to all the other claims favourably recommended to Congress by the commissioners, the claimant should be entitled to a grant therefor, as a donation \u2014 not to exceed to any one person more than six hundred and forty acres: That all settlers before the 15th of April, 1813, shall receive a grant for the land claimed, not exceeding six hundred and forty acres, if actually inhabited and cultivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">On this report the act of March 3d, 1819, was founded \u2014 and by sec. 2, each settler with title-papers, had confirmed to him his habitation as a donation, not to exceed one thousand two hundred and eighty acres; and this irrespective of the time when the settlement was made, if previous to the 15th of April, 1813; but the grant not to exceed six hundred and forty acres to such settlers as had presented no written evidences of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">By the 7th, 8th, and 9th sections, those who had filed their notices of claim before the commissioner, and which had not been recommended for confirmation, were allowed to the 1st of July, 1820, to file additional evidence in support of the claim with the register and receiver, of the land-offices respectively established by that act, in the country divided by Pearl river; who had the sam\u00e9 powers conferred on them that the commissioner previously had. New claims might also be filed. On these the register and receiver were to report ; of course, after the 20th of July, 1820. The land-office for the country including Mobile was at Jackson court-house. Thus the matter stood for eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">By th\u00e9 act of March 3d, 1827, further time was given to the first of September, 1827, to claimants whose evidences of claim had been previously filed with the commissioner, to produce further evidence and \u201c to present their titles and claims, and the evidence in support of the same, to the register and receiver, of the land-office at St. Stevens.\u201d By sec. 2, they were ordered to hold their sessions at the city of Mobile, and there examine the suspended claims on the same principles the commissioner had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Thus suspended and protected, stood the title of Pollard when the act of-1824 was passed granting to the city of Mobile the river front. And from any thing appearing to the contrary, it stood equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>protected until confirmed by the act of 1836., It was for the sovereign power to judge of its merits; it had never been rejected, and was awaiting the final action 'of Congress. Furthermore; it was from its situation as a city lot not subject to entry in a land-office, being in no survey of the public lands: and it is a fair construction' of the exception to the act of 1824, to hold Pollard\u2019s claim was intended to be within the following exception; as- well as the one commented on in Pollard <em>v. </em>Kibbie: That is\u2014\u201cProvided, that nothing in this act contained shall be construed to affect the claim or claims, if any such there be, , of any individual, or of any body politic or corporate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">We think Pollard\u2019s was a claim of an individual within the exception, and-was so deemed by Congress; as the United States, by the first section, only profess to grant' their right to the city front: and except all lots confirmed by Congress by that, or any previous act \u2014 and also such \u201c to which an equitable title existed in favour of any individual under this, or any former act.\u201d Then in the second section, the provision examined in th** case of Pollard <em>v. </em>Kibbie has direct reference to protection by excepting lots \u2014 \u201cto which'the Spanish government had made a new grant or order of survey,\u201d &amp;c. It is obvious the previous obscurity and confusion were intended to be explained by the proviso : simply expressed, that nothing'which preceded should affect any individual claim \u2014 regardless of the fact whether it was good or bad, so it was a recognised claim by the United States'. That Pollard\u2019s was so, is most apparent by the protection afforded to it: and such is the unanimous opinion of this court, for the reasons formerly and now given, taken together. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Pollard\u2019s patent is therefore valid, unless the second instruction given be true \u2014 that the act of Congress of 1836, and the patent founded on it be void, as relates to the subject in .controversy; and therefore the lessors of the plaintiff derived no title from these sources, because the fee-simple of the premises was in John Forbes and Co.,, when Pollard took his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">It was held in the City of Mobile <em>v. </em>Elava, 16 Peters, 247, that the improvements referred to in the act of 1824, by virtue of which a title was given to the owner of the old water-lot west of Water street, to the lot immediately east of it, must have been made on the new, and eastern water-lot: second, that such improvement must have, been made, by the proprietor of the old lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Forbes and Co. had none such, and therefore took no benefit under the act of 1824.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">If the instruction intended to maintain that Forbes and Co., as riparian proprietors of the lot west of Water street, could claim all the land east of it, to the channel of the river, then we think the court erred: and we take it for granted the court so intended; as by no other means could the land sued for be claimed by Forbes and Co. from any evidence in the record. Their lot was a grant of 1802, for 80 feet fiymt, by 304 feet deep, west of what is now Water street; and bounded on the east by the street as it now exists. High tide formerly reached it; low tide did not: But we deem this an immaterial circumstance. Forbes and Co.\u2019s grant was a specific town lot bounded by streets, then existing or expected to exist; it fronted to the east on a contemplated street, reserved to the public use, as ungranted property; and it never was contemplated by the grant to give any right to the soil beyond its fixed boundary east, as actually surveyed. It does conform, and must conform, to .the city arrangement of lots : if it was held otherwise, then every other proprietor of an old front lot could claim over the mud-flat to the channel of the river, as a riparian owner; sweeping through the city property as it now exists by filling up, and raising the flat, to the extent east of probably a thousand feet, or more. We deem such an assumption entirely inadmissible : and therefore think the court also erred in the second instruction given, as well as in refusing that asked on part of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">With the third instruction this court cannot interfere : and the jury having found for the defendant, no question arises on the fourth instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">For the reasons assigned, we order the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">ORDER.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript'of the record from the Supreme Court of the state of Alabama, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, It is now here ordered and adjudged by this court that the judgment of the said Supreme Cpurt of the state of Alabama be, and the same is hereby reversed'with costs; and that this cause be, and the same is hereby remanded to the said Supreme Court, that further proceedings may be had therein, in conformity to the opinion of this court, and as to law and justice shall appertain.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
