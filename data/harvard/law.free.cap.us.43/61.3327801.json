That the decree was not final, and</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-11\">2. That the case was brought up in an improper manner.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b73-12\">Mr. Justice McLEAN</author>\n<p id=\"Ad0\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">This is a writ of error to the Circuit Court for the eastern district of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">Under the mode of proceeding in Louisiana, a petition was filed by the defendant i\u00e1 error, in the Circuit Court, against Williams and Rightor, on a promissory note given by them for the payment of $5000 with interest, &amp;c. And no ans.wer being made, a judgment was entered, by default, against the defendants. An execution was issued, which was levied on a certain tract of land which, on being offered for sale by the marshal a second time, was purchased by John McCollum the plaintiff in error, on a credit, of twelve months. For the payment of the purchase-money-at the time stated, McCollum gave bond and security.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">At the expiration of twelve months, under the law of Louisiana, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>an execution was issued on the bond, which has the effect of a judgment. A levy was made on certain'slaves, by. the marshal, who returned that-after giving notice of sale, all proceedings were stayed Qn'th\u00e9 execution by injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The injunction was obtained by the plaintiff in error on petition, representing that the title to the land purchased by him at marshal\u2019s sale, and for which the above bond was given, had failed; and that he had been evicted from the premises. \u2022 That certain irregularities had taken place in the sale, &amp;c. \u2022 An injunction was prayed for, and that the bond might be decreed to be cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">On the 14th of February, 1842, \u201c the court ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the injunction granted in this case be dissolved with 20 per cent, damages, 10 per cent, interest^ and $300 amount of fees of counsel employed to be allowed as special, damage, and for costs of this suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">A motion is made to dismiss the writ of error, on the ground that it does not lie in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u2022' The proceeding on the bond may have been authorized under the Louisiana practice, there being no distinction in the courts of that state betwe\u00e9n a proceeding at law and in chancery'. But the relief sought against the bond is mainly appropriate to a' chancery jurisdiction, where such a jurisdiction is 'established. This being the case, the proceeding at law, though'conformable to Lo\u2019-'siana practice in the state courts, was wholly irregular: In th .\u2022 federal courts, the jurisdictions of law and chancery, in Louis'ana and in all the other states, are distinctly maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">If this be viewed as a chancery proceeding, a writ of error does not lie, for a decree in chancery can only be removed to this court, from the Circuit Court, by an appeal. But an appeal will only lie from- a final decree; and'the decree in this case was not final, as the bill was not dismissed. The writ of error is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">ORDER.-</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">. This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for-the eastern, district of Louisiana, and it appearing to -the court that the case is removed here by a writ of error to an interlocutory order or decree in chancery,. It is, therefore, now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that this writ' of error be, and the same is hereby dismissed; and that this cause be, and the same is hereby remanded to the said Circuit Court, with directions to proceed therein according to law and justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
