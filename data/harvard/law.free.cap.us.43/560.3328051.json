He admitted those facts, but denied that the assets in his hands as executor were liable to the payment of the debts of the firm of Daniel Cawood and Company, and required the complainant to make proof of it. He further alleged a deficiency of personal assets:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>In October, 1839, Cawood filed his answer, admitting, in substance, the facts set forth in the bill, but neither admitted nor denied the insolvency of the-firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-5\">The case was referred to a commissioner with instructions to adjust the accounts of the executor and also of the firm of Cawood and Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-6\">In May, 1841, the commissioner made an elaborate report, the particulars of which it is. not necessary to state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-7\">In November, 1841, on the motion of John West, claiming to be interested in the subject-matter of the \u2019suit, it was ordered by the court that the complainant have leave to amend his bill and make John West a defendant. The case was again referred to a commissioner with instructions to state, settle, and report to the court the account of William C. Gardner as executor of Joseph Mandeville, \u25a0deceased, stating the personal estate of the said Mandeville left by him at his death, and how much, thereof has come to the hands of the executor, the value- of it, and how the same have been disposed <em>of; </em>particularly whether any of the legacies have been paid out of the personal estate, and to what amount; and also the value of the personal assets still in the\u2019 hands of the executor; and that he report any special matter that he may deem pertinent, or either party may require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-8\">In December, 1841, the complainant, under the above order, filed his amended bill, making West a party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-9\">In April, 1842, West demurred to the bill, because the. other legatees of Mandeville were not made defendants, and because the complainant had not, by his bill, shown a case in which he was entitled to relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-10\">In May, 1842, the commissioner made a report, under the above reference, staling that Gardner, as executor, had then in his hands, assets, amounting to $1036 70.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-11\">In June, 1842, the demurrer was argued, and the court being of opinion that the general assets of the estate of the said Joseph Mandeville, deceased, in the hands of his executor, William C. Gardner, one of the said defendants, are not chargeable with any debt contracted by the defendant Cawood, in the name of the firm of Daniel Cawood and Co., after the death of the former, partner of the firm, the said Joseph Mandeville; and being of opinion that the defendant\u2019s said demurrer is well taken and fully sustained in argument, and that the complainant\u2019s bill contains no matter, allegation, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>charge laying any foundation for equitable relief in the premises, dismissed the bill with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-5\">The complainant, Burwell, appealed from this decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-6\"><em>JVe'ale </em>and <em>Coxe, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-7\"><em>Smith </em>and <em>Jones, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-8\"><em>Neale, </em>fpr the appellant, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-9\">1.

That John West was not a necessary or proper party, he being the residuary legatee of the late Joseph Mandeville, and the bill only sought to make the personal estate of Mandeville liable,</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-11\">3. That the surviving partner being insolvent, the creditors were well warranted in filing their bill in equity against the executor of Mandeville and the surviving partner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-12\">4. That the general assets of the estate of .Mandeville are liable for the debts contracted, as well after as before Mandeville\u2019s death, by the late firm of Daniel Cawood and Co.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-13\">5. That Mandeville\u2019s real estate descended upon his heirs-at-law.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-14\">If the surviving partner be insolvent, the effects in the hands of the . legal representatives of the deceased partners are liable in. equity for the partnership debts. Such debts are both joint and several, and equally a charge upon the assets of the deceased partner, and against the person and estate, of the surviving partner. 3 Kent\u2019s Commentary, 57; Hamersly <em>v. </em>Lambert, 2 Johns.

By the codicil to his will, Mandeville directs that his interest in the co-partnership of Daniel Cawood and himself, under the firm of Daniel Cawood and Co., shall be continued therein until the expiration of the time limited by the articles of co-partnership. The business to be conducted by Daniel Cawood, and the profit and loss to be distributed in the manner the articles provide.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-9\">The articles of co-partnership, do not state what is the amount of capital put in by either party, all it states is the money or goods then furnished or that might thereafter be put in by either party, shall stand' to his credit in account current, and bear interest \u2014 and all profits and loss\u00e9s to be .equally divided:</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-10\">If, then, the articles of co-partnership would have bound the general assets of Mandeville had he lived until the 1st September, 1838, (assuming that at that time the firm was insolvent,) then w\u00e9 contend that the codicil makes his estate equally liable for all debts contracted by Daniel Cawood and Co. prior to the 1st September, 1838, although Mandeville died in. July, 1837. Because, if he could bind his estate by deed while living, so could he, by will, after his death'\u2014 and in this case the codicil to his will affirms the obligation and continues his liability under the deed-of co-partnership, until the 1st September, 1838. It is conceded, that he might have limited his liability, either in the articles of co-partnership, or in the codicil to his will, but not having done so in either, and coupling the two p&amp;pers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>together, the only fair construction to be put upon them both, makes his estate generally liable for all debts due from the late firm of Ca-wood and Co. prior to the 1st September, 1838, less what that firm is able to pay towards their discharge.\u2019 7 Peters, 586.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aql\">Had the firm of the late Daniel Cawood and Co. made money, to whom would the profits have belonged, after payment of Mandeville\u2019s debts and legacies ? \u2019 Clearly and beyond all doubt, to John West, the residuary legatee; ,and who would have claimed those' profits? the answer is, John West; and he could and he would have successfully claimed them, for as residuary legatee, he, and he alone, would have been entitled to them under Mandeville\u2019s will, and bad must be the rule which works only one way. Entitled, then, to the profits, with the right to demand them, and, still more, to coerce their payment if refused, he should, upon principles of equality and justice sustain losses,if any were made. And .it is worthy of remark that although Mr. West removed to the town of Alexandria immediately after Mandeville\u2019s death \u2014 was present when the will was probated in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Alexandria county, September, 1837, and well knew the contents of Mandeville\u2019s will and codicil thereto- \u2014 and was also an eye-witness to Cawood\u2019s proceedings under'the codicil, yet did he remain entirely silent upon the subject, thereby acquiescing therein, as it would. certainly seem, until the November term, -1841, of the Circuit Court of Alexandria county, when, for the very first time, we were informed that he intended to defeat,' if he could,' all claims on Mandeville\u2019s estate, contracted with the firm of Daniel Cawood and Co. subsequent to the death of Mandeville, however just they might be. Does he then come into court with clean hands and for just purposes ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-6\">Had he intimated his intention, as here stated, before the credits were given, none would ever have been given-; for it was perfectly notorious, to- .every person dealing with the firm of Daniel Cawood and Co., that the surviving partner was utterly insolvent from the. beginning to the ending of his connection in business with the late-Mr. .Mandeville, unless the business should prove a profitable one.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-7\">Wqst being, by the will, the recipient of the profits, after payment of- debts and legacies, had a direct interest in -.the \u2022 business, and-having such interest, may be looked upon as a <em>quasi </em>partner. therein, and consequently his right to the. residuum of Mandeville\u2019s estate is in subordination to the paramount claims of <em>bona fide </em>creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-8\">The essence of a partnership consists in the mutual' participation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>of profit and loss; there can be no partnership without this. If the testator by his will continues the partnership after his death, (as in this case,) he continues it for the benefit of his representatives ; he makes them partners with the surviving partner; they are entitled to a joint participation in the profits, and ought they not, in sheer justice, to bear their portion of all losses ? For if they did not, the distinctive features of a partnership would be lost sight of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-6\">Mandeville, by his will, directs the partnership subsisting between him and Cawood to be continued for the period fixed by the articles ; and the profit or loss, of the same, to be shared, as provided by them. The articles are thus made part of the will. The intention of the testator must govern; it is the \" polar star which is to guide the decision,\u201d and the intention must be gathered from the testator\u2019s language. In this case, there is neither a patent nor latent ambiguity on the face of the will or the articles of co-partnership\u2014 it is therefore clear (judging from the language employed in both) that Mandeville intended a continuance of the partnership, under the terms and conditions of the articles, according to their expressed as-well as legal effect. They expressly provide for an equal participation in the profits, and an equal burden in all losses; their legal effect is, to render'liable the general estate of both parties, to the just claims of creditors, in .the event of losses. Now if the. partnership is continued in the same manner after the testator\u2019s death,'by Kis express directions, as it existed- -before, must not his estate be liable to the demands .of subsequent creditors.?-</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-7\">If this is not so, then in the event of heavy profits his estate is entitled -to an equal portion, but if there are losses, however large, ,his estate is exonerated \u2014 the whole falls on the surviving partner\u2014 ruinous -to him and unjust and fraudulent as to creditors! This negatives the idea of a partnership, which.is a communion, not of profit alone, but also' of \u2019loss. This case is distinguishable from that of Pitkin and Pitkin, 7 Conn. Reports, 307. The testator in that case directed, that his interest, consisting of- so much, to wit: (here he specifically enumerates it,) is to be continued in the firm, after his death, for the term of four years. His interest, which is thus continued, is clearly defined, and clearly restricted, and is not a general direction of the continuance of the partnership. This language is too plain for creditors to misunderstand dr misinterpret, and if under such circumstances they'trust the partnership,-which finally proves insolvent, they have no right to look to the general, assets of, -the testator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>for he has'only pledged so much for the partnership engagements, of which -the creditors had due notice, and if they suffer, it is the result of their own imprudence. The distinction is plain and obvious-: one is a general partnership, wherein the separate estate of each party -is liable; the other, a special partnership, of which creditors had notice, and therefore they can only look to those funds specially provided to meet all losses. Were it otherwise, there would be no difference between a general and special partnership.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-5\">But the appellee, in the court below, contended that the demurrer was well taken and would hold, and cited the following authorities in support thereof, to wit: \u2014 Edwards on Bills and Pleadings, 123; 1 Johns. Chan. Reports, 438; 1 Sch. and Lefroy, 386; 2 Sch. and Lefroy, 159; 3 Maddoek\u2019s Chancery Reports., 791; Mylne and Keene\u2019s Reports, 116. And it was further contended, that upon a fair construction of Mr. Mandeville\u2019s will, John West is residuary devisee, and not, as declared by the testator, residuary legatee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-6\">As to a fair construction of the will \u2014 is Mr. West a residuary devisee, or residuary legatee ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-7\">Mandeville, the testator, by his will, makes him, in plain terms, his residuary legatee, and upon a - careful inspection of the whole will it is not perceived how he .is to be considered a residuary devisee. Mr. Mandeville waS a remarkably intelligent man, \u2014 well understood the true import of words, and if he intended to make Mr. West his residuary devisee, why did he not say so? Why speak of his \u201cheirs\u201d if he intended that Mr. West should be his residuary devisee ? If residuary devisee, then there was an end to all heir-ships, and the reason which he assigned for appointing two executors was just as false as it was clearly absurd. Assuming, then, that he well understood the technical meaning of \u201c residuary legatee,\u201d then Mr. West-should not have been made a party \u2014 and touching the construction of wills, we find, in the great case of Thelluson and Woodford, 4 Ves. jun. 329, that the Master of the Rolls, when deciding upon that case, makes, among others, these remarks: \u201c The intention is to be collected from the whole will taken together. Every word is to have its effect. Every word is to be taken accord?, ing to the natural and common import; and if words of art are used, they are to be construed according to the technical sense, unless upon the whole will it is plain the testator did not so intend.\u201d So in Kennon and McRoberts and wife, 1 Wash. Rep. 130, the president of the court observes: \u201cIn Hodgson and Ambrose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Doug. 323, a distinction is made which seems to be a sensible one, to wit: ' &lt; If the testator use legal phrases, his intention should be construed by'legal rules: if he'use those that are common, his intention, according to the common understanding of the words he uses, shall be the rule.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-5\">The above are a few of the many cases that might be adduced, but they are deemed quite sufficient for the-present occasion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-6\">As to the-authorities relied on:</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-7\">So far from ousting, the court of jurisdiction in this case, they most conclusively establish it; consequently, they must have been cited and relied on to sustain that part of the demurrer which objects for want of proper parties, and as such we shall shortly review them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-8\">Edwards on Bills \u00e1nd Pleading, 123. In that case it is said: \u201c If a testator directs his debts to be paid out of his personal property, and'the deficiency to be made up out of his real estate, and the personal property is not sufficient to pay the debts, a judgment creditor will have <em>to </em>make the personal representative and heir-at-law parties.\u2019? Is Mr. West\u2019an heir-at-law in this case ? Again, in the same book and same page, \u201cneither the heir-at-law nor the personal representative were parties; in fact, the will had not been proved; there was no personal estate, and th\u00e9 executor refused to act, but the Master of the Rolls (Leach) ordered it to stand- over for administration with the will annexedj and with leave to make the administrator and heir parties.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-9\">\u25a0 In the present case, has not the will been proved; the personal estate ascertained and duly administered, and a deficiency of personal assets clearly shown?</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-10\">Where, then, is the -analogy ? and was this case decided under the .influence of the statute of the 5 Geo. 2, ch. 7, or was it made upon common law principles ? .This would seem to be a necessary inquiry, because that statute enlarges the remedies of judgment creditors against the real estate of their debtors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4UK\">The cases of Giffard and Hart, reported in 1 Sch. and Lefroy, 386, and Plunket and Joice, 2 Sch. and Lefroy, 158, have no application to -the present case, unless it shall first be made clearly to-appear that the appellee occupies the same ground that he would do were he the heir-at-law of the late Mr. Mandeville.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-12\">Wiser <em>v. </em>Blachly et al., 1 Johns. Chan. Rep. 437. In this case the chancellor permitt\u00e9d the devisee of Vail to be made a party, because he had a direct interest in the event of the.suit \u2014 was devisee; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>and the bill sought to make liable the timber on the very land devised to him. But in the present c.ase, is West devisee ? Very different are the rights of devisees and legatees; a difference too well defined and understood to need the slightest notice on our part. But these principles have no application to the present case, inasmuch as the bill does not seek to charge the real assets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Att\">The case Ex parte Garland, 10 Ves. jun. 110 <em>et seg. </em>also relied on to defeat this claim, has no bearing upon the merits of this cause. There a certain sum, to wit \u00bf6600, was embarked in the trade by the testator, and no more; and that trade carried on by the widow and executrix of the testator, and not by a copartner, under original articles of copartnership with the testator, wherein no sum is named, as in this case. In that case, distribution had long been made before the bankruptcy of the executrix; in this case, none has ever been made \u2014 in that case, the profits of the trade were to be applied for his widow\u2019s use, and for the maintenance and-education of his children; but in this case, the profits, (if any) are to become a part of Mr. Mandeville\u2019s personal estate. Where, then, is the similarity between the two cases ? It scarcely deserves, <em>en </em>passant, a notice. The Lord Chancellor in his decree employs the following language: \u201cin this case,\u201d he remarks, \u201c I fear I shall be under the necessity of contradicting the authority of a judge I most highly respect, fe\u00e9ling a strong opinion that only the property declared to be embarked in the trade, shall be answerable to the creditors of the trade. If I am not bound by decision, the convenience of mankind requires me to hold, that the creditors of the trade, as such, have not a claim against the distributed assets, in the hands of third persons under the direction of the same will which has authorized the trade to be carried on for the benefit of other persons. My opinion upon this case is, that it is impossible to hold that the trade is to be carried on, perhaps for a .century, and at the end of that time the creditors- dealing with the trade, are, merely because it is directed by the will to be carried on, to pursue the general assets distributed, perhaps to fifty families.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-6\">But in this case, it was to be carried on, for about thirteen or fourteen months only, and without the slightest inconvenience either -to \u201cmankind\u201d generally, or to the devisees and legatees of Mr. Mandeville in particular; nor has there been a distribution, either in part, or whole, of Mr. Mandeville\u2019s personal estate.

On the 3d of June, 1837, Mandeville made his last will, by which in the introductory clause he said: \u201c I do hereby direct the disposal which I desire of my \"earthly remains after my decease, and of such real and personal property as I may possess when called hence to a future state.\u201d He then proceeded to make sundry bequests of' his real and personal estate to different persons; and then added: \u201c If my personal property should not cover the entire amount of legacies I have or may give, my executors will dispose of so much of my real estate as will fully pay the same.\u201d He immediately added: \u201cJohn West, one of the defendants, formerly of Alexandria, now of Mobile, I hereby make my residuary legatee, recommending him to consult with and follow the advice of my executors in all concerning what I leave to him.\u201d- The testator on the 11th of July, 1837, made the following codicil to his will. \u201c It is my will that my interest in the copartnership subsisting between Daniel Cawood and myself, under the firm of Daniel Cawood and Company, shall be continued thereon until the expiration of the-term limited by the articles between us; the business to be continued by the said Daniel Cawood, and the profit or loss to be distributed in the manner the said articles provide.\u201d The testator \"appointed Robert J. Taylor and William C. .Gardner (one of the defendants) executors of his will, and died in July, 1837. His will and codicil were duly proved after his death, and Taylor having renounced the executorship, Gardner took upon himself the administration of the estate under letters testamentary granted to him by the Orphans\u2019Court of Alexandria county.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Cawood, after the testator\u2019s death, carried on the copartnership in the name of the firm, and failed in business before the regular expiration thereof, according to the articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The present bill was originally brought against Cawood and Gardner, as executors of Mandeville, by the plaintiff, Burwell, alleging himself to be a creditor of the firm upon debts contracted with him by Caw'ood, on' behalf of the firm, after Mandeville\u2019s death, viz. on a promissory note, dated the 28th of July, 1838, for $800, and on an acceptance of a bill of exchange drawn by Burwell on the same day for $1000, in favour of one William H. Mount, both of which remained unpaid. The bill charged the failure of Cawood in trade, and his inability to pay the debts due from the firm. It also charged that Gardner, the executor, had assets sufficient to satisfy all the debts of- the testator, and-all the debts of Cawood and Company; and it sought payment of the debt due to the plaintiff out of those assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The defendant, Gardner, put in, an answer denying that he had such accurate information as to enable him to say whether the partnership funds in the hands of Cawood were sufficient to pay the debts of the -firm or not; and not admitting that the assets of the testator in his hands were liable to the payment of the debts of the firm, and requiring proof of such liability, and alleging that he had not' assets of the testator in his hands sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s claims, after satisfying two specified judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The defendant, Cawood, not having made any answer at this stage, of the cause, the bill was thereupon taken against him <em>pro </em>confesso\u2014 subsequently he put in an answer; and thereupon it was, by consent of the plaintiff, and Cawood, and Gardner the executor, referred to a master to take an account of the assets of the testator, of the debts due to him, of the value- \u00f3f his real estate, and to settle the accounts and transactions of the firm of Cawood and Company until its termination, and of the individual partners with the firm, to take an account of the assets of the firm, and the outstanding debts of the firm, and the debts due thereto, See.; and also to ascertain whether the debt due to the plaintiff arose in the partnership transactions, and is now due.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Cawood, by his answer, admitted generally the facts staled in the bill; \u25a0 but he also alleged that he neither admitted nor denied the in-sol vehey of the firm, averring \"that he had satisfied claims against the firm since it terminated to the amount of about $14,000 from the firm funds, and was engaged in the collection of.the outstanding debts due thereto, and that the 'firm still owed debts to .the amount of about $7000.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">' The master made his report in May, 1841; the details of which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>is not necessary to mention. In November, of the same year, it was referred to another commissioner to take an account of the assets of Mandeville in the hands of his executor, who afterwards made a.report accordingly.- At this stage of the proceedings, John West (the residuary legatee, so called in the will) claiming to be interested in Ihs subject-matter, the bill was amended by making West a party; and he filed a demurrer to the bill. The demurrer was afterwards set down for argument, and the court being of opinion that the assets of Mandeville in the hands of his executor (Gardner) were not chargeable with any debt contracted by Cawood in the name of the firm, after the death of Mandeville, sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the bill with costs. From this decree of dismissal the present appeal has been taken to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The argument has spread itself over several topics, which are not in our judgment now properly before us; whatever may have been their relevancy in the court below. The real question, arising before us upon -the record, is, whether the general assets of the testator, Mandeville, in the hands of his executor, are liable for the payment of the debt due to the plaintiff, which was contracted after Mandeville\u2019s death. If they are not, the bill was properly dismissed^ ever might be the remedy of the plaintiff against Cawood, if the suit had been brought against him alone, for equitable, relief, upon Avhich we give no opinion. In general the surviving partner is liable atlaAV only; and no decree can be made against him, although he may be a proper party to the suit in equity, as being interested to contest the plaintiff\u2019s demand, unless some other equity intervenes; and so it Avas held in Wilkinson <em>v. </em>Henlerson, 1 Mylne and Keene, 582, 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The bill, as framed, states the insolvency of C\u00e1wood, and seeks no separate relief against him, and therefore, if it is maintainable at all, it is so solely upon the ground of the liability of the general assets of Mandeville to pay the plaintiff jointly with the partnership funds in the hands of Cawood. In respect to another' suggestion, that West was not a necessary party to the bill, in his character of residuary legatee of the personalty, that may be admitted; at-the same time it is as clear,that as he had an interest in that residue, if Mandeville\u2019s general assets were liable for the plaintiff\u2019s debt; and therefore, the plaintiff might at his option join him in the suit, and if West did not object, no other person would'availhimselfof the objection of his misjoinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Then', as to the liability of the general assets of Mand\u00e9viJle in the hands of his executor for the payment of the plaintiff \u2019s debt \u2014 we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>of opinion that they are not so liable; and shall now proceed to state the reasons'for this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">By the general rule of law, every partnership is dissolved by the death of one of the partners. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> It is true that it is competent for the partners to provide by agreement for the continuance of the partnership after such death; but then it takes place in virtue of such agreement only, as the act of the parties, and not by mere operation of law. A partner too may by his will provide that the partnership shall continue notwithstanding his death; and if it is consented to by the surviving partner, it becomes obligatory, just as it would, if the testator, being a sole trader, had provided for the continuance of his trade by his executor, after his death. But, then, in each case the agreement or authority must be clearly made out; and third persons, having' notice of the death, are bound to inquire how.far the agreement or authority to continue it extends, and what funds it binds, and if they trust the. surviving party beyond the reach of such agreement, or authority, or fund, it is their own fault,' and they h.ave no right to complain that the law does not afford them any satisfactory redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">A testator, too, directing the continuance of a partnership, may, if he so choose, bind his general assets for all the debts of the partnership contracted after his death. But he may also limit his responsibility, either to the funds already embarked in the trade, or to any specific amount to be invested therein for that purpose; and then the creditors can resort to that fund or amount only, and not to the general assets of the testator\u2019s estate, although the partner, or executor, or other person carrying on the trade may be personally responsible for all the debts contracted. This is clearly established by the case Ex parte Garland, 10 Ves. 110, where the subject was very fully discussed by Lord Eldon, and Ex parte Richardson, 3 Madd. 138, 157, where the like doctrine was affirmed by Sir John Leach, (then Vice-chancellor,) and by the same learned judge, when Master of the Rolls, in Thompson <em>v. </em>Andrews, 1 Mylne and Keene, 116. The case of Hankey <em>v. </em>Hammock, before Lord Kenyon, when Master of the Rolls, reported in Cooke\u2019s Bankrupt Law, 67, 5th ed., and more fully in a note to 3 Madd. Rep. 148; so far as may be, thought to decide that the testator\u2019s assets are generally liable under all circumstances, where the .trade is directed to be carried on-after his death, has been completely overturned by other later cases, and expressly overruled by Lord Eldon in 10 Ves. 110, 121, 122, where he stated that it stood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>alone, and he felt compelled to decide against its authority. The case of Pitkin <em>v. </em>Pitkin, 7 Conn. Rep. 307, is fully in point to the same effect, and indeed, -as we shall presently see, runs <em>guatuor pedibus </em>with the present.</p>\n<p id=\"AfU\">And this leads us to remark, that nothing but the most - dear and unambiguous language, demonstrating in the most positive manner that the testator intends to make his general assets, liable for all debts contracted in the continued trade' after his death, and not merely to limit it to the funds embarked in that trade, would justify the court in arriving at such a conclusion from th\u00e9 manifest inconvenience thereof, and the utter impossibility of paying off the legacies bequeathed by the testator\u2019s will, or distributing the residue of. his estate, without in effect saying at the same time'that the payments may all be re-called, if the trade* should become unsuccessful or ruinous. Such a result would orditiarily be at war with the testator\u2019s intention in bequeathing such legacies and residue, and would, or might postpone the settlement of the estate for a half-century, or until long after the trade or continued partnership should terminate. Lord Eldon, in 10 Ves. 110, 121, 122, put the inconvenience in a strong light, by suggesting several cases where' the doctrine would create the most manifest embarrassments, if not utter injustice; and he said, that the convenience of mankind required him to hold, that the creditors of the trade, as such, have not a claim against the. distributed assets in the hands of third persons, under the directions in the same will, which has authorized the trade to be carried on for the benent of other persons. This, also, was manifestly the opinion of Sir John Leach in the cases 3 Madd. Rep. 128; 1 Mylne and Keene, 116, and was expressly held in the case in 7 Conn. Rep. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad9\">Keeping these principles in view, let us now proceed to the examination of the will and codicil in the present case. There can, we think, be no doubt, that the testator intended by his will to. dispose of the whole of his estate, real and personal. The introductory words to his will already cited, show such an intention in a clear and explicit manner. The testator there says: \u201cI do hereby direct the disposal which I desire of my earthly remains after my decease, and of such real and personal estate as I may possess, when called hence to a future state.\u201d He, therefore, looks to the disposal of all the- estate he shall die possessed of. It is said that, admitting such to be his intention, the testator has not carried it into effect; -because the residuary clause declares John West his \u201cresiduary legatee\u201d only, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>not his residuary devisee also; and that we are to interpret the words of the will according to their legal import as confined altogether to the residue of the personal estate. This is, in our judgment, a very narrow and technical interpretation, of the words of' the will. The language used by the testator shows, him to have been an unskilful man and not versed in legal phraseology. The cardinal rule in the interpretation of wills is, that the language is to be interpreted in subordination to the intention of the testator, and is not to control that intention, when it is clear and determinate. Thus, for example, the word \u201c legacy\u201d may be construed to apply to real estate where the context of the will shows such to be the intention of the testator. Thus in Hope <em>v. </em>Taylor, 1 Burr. Rep. 269, the word \u201c legacy\u201d was held to include lands, from the intentipn of the testator deduced from the -context. The same doctrine was fully recognised in Hardacre <em>v. </em>Nash, 5 Term Rep. 716. So, in Doe dem. Tofield <em>v. </em>Tofield, 11 East, 246, a bequest of \"all my personal estates\u201d was construed upon the like intention to include real estate. But a case more directly in point to the present, and differing from it iri no essential circumstances, is Pitman <em>v. </em>Stevens, 15 East, 505. There the testator, in the introductory clause of his will, said: \u201cI give and bequeath all that I shall die possessed of, real and personal, of what nature and kind soever, after my just debts is paid. I hereby appoint\" Capt. Robert Preston my residuary legatee and executor.\u201d The testator then proceeded to give certain pecuniary legacies, and finally recommended his legatee and executor to be kind and friendly to his brother-in-law J. C., &amp;c., and begs him to do something handsome for him at his death, &amp;c. The question was, whether Preston was entitled to the real estate of the testator, under the will; and the court held that he was; and that the words \u201c residuary legatee and executor,\u201d coupled with the introductory clause and the recommendation clearly established it. Upon that occasion, Lord El\u00edenb'orough, after referring to the words of the introductory clause, said: \u201c Then he appoints Capt. P.. his residuary legatee and executor \u2014 residuary, legatee and executor of what ? of all that he should die possessed of, real and personal, of what nature and kind soever; that'is, of all he should not otherwise dispose of. The word \u2018 legatee,\u2019 according to the cases, particularly Hardacre <em>v. </em>Nash, may be. applied to real estate, if the context requires it, as was said by Lord Kenyon upon the word \u2018 legacy.\u2019 Then, in the subsequent parts of the will, he contemplates that his residuary legatee and executor will have the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>position of his whole funds, but after some legacies and annuities, he recommends him to be kind and friendly to his brother-in-law, &gt;&amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In 'the present case it is plain that the testator contemplated some positive benefit to West, when he designated him as his residuary legatee; and yet, at the same time, he contemplated that his personal property might not be sufficient to .cover the amount of legacies, given by his will; and in that event he directs his executors to dispose of so much of his real estate as will .fully pay his legacies; so that, if we restrain the words \u201c residuary legatee\u201d to the mere personalty, we shall defeat the very intention of the testator, apparent upon the face of the will, to give some beneficial interest to West, in an event which he yet contemplated as not improbable. On the other hand, if we give an enlarged and liberal meaning to the residuary clause as extending to the real estate, it will at once satisfy the introductory clause, and upon a deficiency of the personal assets will still leave an ample amount to the beneficiary, who appears to have been an object of the testator\u2019s' bounty. But if this interpretation should be (as we think it is not) questionable; one thing is certain, and that is, that the-testator did not contemplate that his personal assets would not be more than sufficient to pay all his debts; for he does not Charge his, real estate with his debts, but only with his legacies, in case of any deficiency of personal assets; and the residuary clause, if it were limited to the mere residue of his personal assets would also show that the\u2019 testator did not provide for any debts which should arise from any subsequent transactions after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">If this be so, then we are to look to the codicil to see whether any different intention is there disclosed in clear and unambiguous terms. In the first place, the language of the codicil is just such as the testator might properly have used, if he intended no more than to pledge his funds already embarked in the partnership for the payment of the partnership debts. The codicil says, \u201c It is my will that m<em>y </em>interest\u2019 in. the copartnership^ &amp;c., shall be continued therein .until the expiration of the term limited' by the articles.\u201d Now, his interest in the firm then was his share cf the capital stock and profits, after the payment of all debts and liabilities due by the firm. It is this interest, and not any new capital which he authorizes t\u00f3 be, embarked in the firm. He does not propose to add any thing to his existing interest, but simply to continue it as- it then was. How, then, Can this court say; that he meant to embark all his personal assets in the hands of his executor as a pledge for the future debts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>or future responsibilities or future capital of the firm ? That would be to enlarge the meaning of the words used beyond their ordinary and reasonable signification. And besides, it is plain that the testator did not mean to have the payment of his legacies indefinitely postponed, until the expiration of the articles, and the ascertainment and final adjustment of the concerns of the firm, which might perhaps extend to ten or. twenty years. So that to give such an enlarged interpretation to the terms of the codicil, (as is contended for,) for the codicil must be construed as if it were incorporated into the will, would be to subject the legatees to all the fluctuations and uncertainties growing ' out of the \u25a0 future trade, and might deprive the residuary legatee of every dollar intended for his benefit. There is another consideration of the matter, which deserves notice. Would the real estate of the testator, upon a deficiency of his personal assets, be liable for the debts of the firm contracted after his death, by mere operation of law, as it would be for such debts as were contracted in his lifetime ? If it would, then it is apparent, that all the legatees and devisees might in the event of the irretrievable and ruinous insolvency of the firm be deprived of all their legacies and devises, although the legacies were charged upon the real estate. If it would not, then it is equally apparent that the testator did not contemplate any liability of his general assets, real and personal, for the payment of any debts, excepting those which were subsisting at the time of his death. There is yet another consideration, not unimportant .to be brought under review. It is, that the whole business of the firm is to be conducted by Ca-wood alone, and that neither the executor nor the legatees are authorized to interfere with or to scrutinize his transactions. Such an unlimited power over his whole assets by a person wholly unconnected with the administration of his estate could scarcely be presumed to be within the intention of any prudent testator. If to. all these we add the manifest inconveniences of such an interpretation of the codicil, thus suspending for an indefinite time the settlement of the estate and the payment of the legacies, it is not too much to say, that no court of justice ought upon principle to favour, much less to adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">And, certainly, there is no authority to support it; at least none, except Hankey <em>v. </em>Hammock, which cannot now, for the reasons already stated be deemed any authority whatsoever. On the other hand, the case Ex parte Garland, 10 Ves. 110, and Ex parte Richardson, 3 Madd. Rep. 138, although distinguishable from the present in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>some of their circumstances, were reasoned out and supported upon the broad and general principle that the assets of the testator were in no case bound for the debts contracted after his death by the persons whom he had authorized to continue his trade, but the rights of such new creditors were exclusively confined- to the funds embarked in the trade and to the personal responsibility of the party who continued it, whether as trustee, or as executor, or as partner \u2014 unless, indeed, the testator had otherwise positively and expressly bound his general assets. The case of Pitkin <em>v. </em>Pitkin, 7 Conn. Rep. 307, is, however, (as has been already suggested,) directly in point. There, the testator, by his will directed, \u201c that all his interest and concern in the hat manufacturing business, &amp;c., as then conducted under said firm, should be continued to operate in the same connection for the term of four years after his decease, &amp;c.\u201d The court there held, after referring to the cases in 10 Ves. 110, and 3 Madd. Rep. 138, that the general assets of the testator were not liable to the claims of any creditors of the firm who became such after the testator\u2019s death; and that such creditors had no lien on the estate in the hands of the devisees under the will, although they might eventually participate in the profits of the trade. There was another point decided in that case, upon which we wish to be understood as expressing no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Upon the whole, our opinion is, that the decree of the Circuit Court dismissing the bill ought to be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">order.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holden in and for the county of Alexandria, and was argued by counsel.
