That the plaintiffs below made out no case establishing their right to recover \u2014 in other words, that they did not show any interest or property to be in them in the prize drawn on the said day of December, 1840, which is in substance one of the prayers refused by the court, viz.: <em>\u201c </em>if plaintiffs paid the amount of said prize, under the belief that said ticket had be\u00e9n fairly drawn,\u2019 the plaintiffs cannot recover.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-12\">2. That the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that, under the act of Virginia referred to, said lottery was illegal.

The question whether the prohibitory .act of Virginia was constitutional, was decided in the highest court of that state, and brought up to this court, wher\u00e9 it is now pending. The court of Virginia decided that it did not impair the obligation of contracts. 1 Robinson, 7l3, Phalen <em>v. </em>Common-, wealth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>In support of the general position above tak\u00e9n, he cited, 11 Wheat. 258, 265, 268; 10 Bingh. 107; 5 T.

So far as he is concerned, the law annuls the pretended drawing of the prize he claimed; and in poiht of law, he did not draw the lottery; his fraud avoids not only his acts, 'but places him in the same position as if there had been no drawing in fact; and he had claimed and received the money of the plaintiffs, by means of any other false pretence, and he is estopped from avowing that the lottery was in fact drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Such being the legal position of Catts, the case before us is simply this: Phalen and Morris had in their possession $&gt;12,500, either in their own right, or as trustees for others interested in the lottery, no matter which, the legal right to this sum. was in them, the defendant claimed and received it by false arid fraudulent pretences, as morally criminal as by larceny, forgery, or peijury; and the only question before us is, whether he can .retain it by any principle or'rul\u00e9 of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The transaction between the parties did not originate in the drawing of an illegal lottery; the money was not paid on a-ticket which was entitled to, or drew the prize; it was paid and received.on the false assertion of that fact; the contract which the law raises between them, is not founded on the drawing of the lottery, but on the obligation to.refund the money which has been received by falsehood and fraud, by the assertion of a drawing which never took place. To state is to decide such a case; even if the instructions prayed by the defendant had been btoad\u00e9r than they were. The instructions prayed were, 1. That if. the jury believed from the evidence, that the lottery was drawn under the law of. Virginia, and the contract referred to, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the lottery was illegal; and if plaintiffs paid the amount of said prize, under the belief, that said ticket had been fairly drawn, the plaintiff , cannot recover; 2. That if the jury shall believe from the evidence, that in December, 1840, when the lottery was drawn, the defendant was an infant, the plaintiffs are not \u00e9ntitled to recover in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">A party cannot assign for error, the refusal of an instruction to which he has not a right to the full extent as stated, and in its pref cise terms; the court is not bound to give a modified instruction varying from the one prayed: here they were asked to instruct the jury, that the belief of \u2022 the plaintiff that the ticket had been fairly drawn, and the consequent payment, prevented a recovery, without referring to the fact in evidence, that that belief was caused by the false and fraudulent assertions of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The second instruction asked was, that the plaintiffs could not recover, if the defendant was a minor in December, 1840, which the court properly refused, because they were not asked to decide on the effect of his minority when the money was received in February, 1841; and because, if he had then been a minor, it would have been no defence to an action founded on his fraud and falsehood.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The- first instruction, if granted, would have excluded from the consideration of the jury,, all reference to the fraud which produced such belief in the plaintiff, and they must have given it the same effect, whether it was founded in fact, nr caused by the false asseveration of the -fact by the defendant, knowing it was a falsehood, and. thus depriving the jury of the right to decide on-the whole evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The second .instruction'asked would, if granted, have also taken from the jury thq right of finding for'the plaintiff, if the defendant had been of full age when the fraud was successfully consummated by\u2019the receipt of the money, which was the only fact on which the law could raise a promise to repay, for certainly none could be raised at any previous time; so that had these instructions been given, the verdict must .have been rendered for the defendant without taking into view the only evidence on which the plaintiff relied, whether it was available in law or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">For these .reasons, the judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed, with costs. . -</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">ORDER.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">This cause -came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of-the United States for the District of-.Columbi\u00e1, holden in and for the county of Alexandria, and was argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>by counsel.- On consideration whereof, It is now here.ordered and adjudged by this court,' that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause -be, and the same is .hereby affirmed with costs and damages, at the rate of six per cent. per. annum..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
