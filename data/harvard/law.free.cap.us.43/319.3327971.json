The plaintiff contended first, and now contends, that the defendants did not offer competent proof, sufficient to show, even <em>primd fade, </em>that the said County Court, under whose alleged order the said administrator made the sale, ever acquired jurisdiction of the matter in relation to which it was alleged to have made the order; and that, therefore, the order was a nullity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-15\">The jurisdiction of that court depends on a law of the territoiy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Michigan, made on the 27th day of July, a. d. 1818. (Laws Michigan, vol. i. p. 37.) By that law it is enactedj in section 1, that when ,the goods and chattels of a person deceased shall not be sufficient to pay his debts, then, \u201c upon representation thereof, and the same being made to appear, to the Supreme Judicial Court, or to the County Court in the county where the deceased last- dwelt, or where his real estate lies,\u2019(.the said courts are authorized to license the executor or administrator to sell his real estate, <em>\u201c </em>so far as shall be necessary to satisfy the just debts of the deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-5\">The same law enacts, in section 3, <em>\u201c </em>that every representation made as aforesaid shall be accompanied by a certificate from the judge of probate.\u201d The contents of which certificate are particularly prescribed..</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-6\">It also enacts in the same section, that \u00abthe said courts, previous to their passing on the said representation, shall order due notice ..to be given to all parties or their guardians, to-show cause against the granting of the license.

The plaintiff contends, that in order to give to the administrator\u2019s deed any legal validity and effect, it was necessary to prove that notice of the notifications described and required in the said 1st section of the laws of Michigan, and that the evidence to prove this of Baird\u2019s and Arndt, was incompetent and wholly insufficient for the purpose. And he contends, that the decisidns of the District Court upon this matter were erroneous on several grounds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-6\">1. In admitting incompetent proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-7\">2.

The plaintiff contended' at the trial, and contends here, that the lands claimed in the action could not legally be sold by the administrator under any order or judgment of any court, as the real estate of Pierre Grignon, for the payment of his debts. And that the patent passes a perfect title to plaintiff\u2019s lessors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-11\">The law of Michigan above referred to, and in part set forth, authorizes the sale of the \u201c houses, lands or tenements,, of the deceased.\u201d The estate in question was not such. Thelitle'of Pierre Grignon at his death, if .any, was equitable only, resting on the pleasure or justice of government, and could not be taken in execution or sold for his debts. The patent of 21st December, 1829, vested the title directly in the heirs. But the District Court decided otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-12\">7th. The plaintiff .contends that if the license has any effect, it proves that the administrator represented that the said Pierre .was seised, at the time of his death, as in his demesne, as of fee of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>est\u00e1te claimed in the action; that the said representation was untrue; that the order of sale was founded in part upon that representation, and affirms it; and is for' that cause erroneous and invalid, and does not support the administrator\u2019s deed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-5\"><em>Lord </em>and Crittenden, for the defendants in error, made the following points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-6\">1. By the act of Michigan, of July 27, 1818, the Counfy Court of Brown county had jurisdiction to order the sale of- the lands of an intestate for payment of debts, whenever the goods and chattels should not be sufficient to answer the same: and such jurisdiction was to be exercised upon representation of such insufficiency, and the same being'made to appear to the County Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-7\">\u25a0 2. The court thus having jurisdiction, the want of evidence, however necessary and essential that evidence, to warrant its order, was merely, error: and it-cannot be shown by strangers to the order, \u25a0do overturn the title of a purchaser. The order cannot be impeached collaterally.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayn\">3. The license, which is the order exemplified for the purchaser\u2019s protection, and the minutes, show every fact on which the jurisdiction of the court rests, and show such an order as the court was by law authorized to make.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-10\">4. The jurisdiction being shown, not only is the order unimpeachable collaterally for errors in making it, but every proper requisite to the act of jurisdiction is to be .presumed as a conclusion of law ; and it is to be presumed, in every-collateral suit, that there was no error or irregularity; no want of-citation, notice or evidence..</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-11\">5. There is no express saving of the fights of infants; The statute authorizes the sale as.a proceeding <em>in rem. </em>The lands were liable to be sold under judgments recovered against the administrator for the intestate\u2019s debt, so that the sale by the administrator was merely a conversion from real to personal estate \u25a0; in reference to the sale of which, in either mode, he was accountable. There is, therefore, no ground to impeach the order, on the supposition that infants, were interested, and were not notified, ev\u00e9n if such supposition was not precluded by the presumption of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-12\">6. .The acts <em>in'pais, </em>after the order of sale, were left by the court to be found by the jury, considering all the evidence. - Such -acts could not be-required to be established, at the distance of thirteen years, except by showing a substantial compliance with the law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>A substantial compliance is all which is at any time necessary in carrying out a sale by order of a court. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\">7. The plaintiff did not attempt by any evidence directly, to impeach the proceedings, by showing want of notice, want of evidence, want of strict conformity to law, although Paul Grignon, the administrator, and Augustine Grignon, the. purchaser, had both united to defeat the sale- under the order by a subsequent conveyance, and were both produced as witnesses for the plaintiff. The plaintiff must therefore fail if the order and license are evidence at all, although not .conclusive: as a presumption subject to contradiction, it must be taken against the plaintiff, who might contradict it if false, and does not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">8. The interest of Pierre Grignon in these lands, at the time of. his death, was an interest existing at the date of the act of Congress of February 21, 1823, and so liable to be sold by his administrator, as goods, chattels, lands, or, tenements. The purchaser, by the administrator\u2019s sale, acquired as good a title as the intestate could in his lifetime convey for a valuable consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-7\">The patent issued after his death enured to the benefit of his assigns, the defendants deriving their title'under him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-8\">Numerous authorities were cited by the counsel upon each side, in support of their respective points: but the reporter was necessarily absent during the argument of the cause, and-is therefore unable to cite them.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b345-9\">Mr. Justice BALDWIN</author>\n<p id=\"ABD\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">This case comes here on a writ of error from the Supreme Court of the Territory of Wisconsin, the premises in controversy w.ere formerly owned by one Peter Grignon, to whom they were confirmed by an act of Congress, passed 21st February, 1823, to be found in 3 Story\u2019s Laws, 1877.

In 1824, letters qf administration on .the estate of Peter Grignon - were duly granted to Paul Grignon, the brother of the deceased, who gave bond for the performance of -the trust, according to law.

D. 1826.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">Robert Irwin, Jun., <em>Clerk B C.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">At the trial numerous questions of evidence arose, and many instructions were asked of the court, to whose opinion the plaintiffs excepted; but we do not deem it necessary to notice them in detail, as in our opinion the whole merits of the controversy depend on one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>single question, had the County Court of Brown county jurisdiction of the subject on which they acted ?</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Jurisdiction has been thus defined by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u201cThe power, to hear and determine a cause is jurisdiction,; it is <em>coram judice- </em>whenever a case is presented which brings, this power into action; if the petitioner presents such a case ,in his petition, that on a demurrer the court would render a judgment in his favour, it is an undoubted case of jurisdiction; whether on an answer denying and putting in issue the allegations of the petition, the petitioner .makes out his case, is the exercise of jurisdiction, conferred by the filing a petition containing all the requisites, and in the manner required by law.\u201d 6 Peters, 709. \u201cAny movement by-a court is necessarily the exercise of jurisdiction; so, to exercise any judicial power over the subject-matter and the parties, the question is whether, on the case before a court, their action is. judicial, or extra-judicial, with, or without the authority of law, to render a judgment or decree upon the rights of the' litigant parties. If the law confers the power to-render a judgment or decree, then the court has jurisdiction, what shall- be adjudged or decreed between the parties, and with which is the right of the case, is judicial action by hearing and determining it.\u201d 12 Peters, 718; S. P. 3 Peters, 205. It is a case of judicial cognisance, and the proceedings are judicial. 12 Peters, 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">This is the line which denotes jurisdiction and its exercise, in cases <em>in. personam, </em>where there- are adverse parties, the court must have power over the subject-matter and the parties; but on a proceeding to sell the real estate of an indebted intestate, there are no adversary-parties, the proceeding is <em>in rem, </em>the administrator represents the land, (11 S. and R. 432;) they are analogous to proceedings in the admiralty* where the only question of jurisdiction is the power of .the court over the thing, the subject-matter before them, without regard to the persons who may have an interest in it; all the world are parties. In .the Orphans\u2019 Court, and all courts who have power to sell the estates of intestates, their action operates, on the estate, not on the heirs of the intestate, a purchaser claims not their title, but one paramount. 11 S. and R. 426. The estate passes to .him by operation of law., 11 S. and R. 428. The sale is a proceeding in. .rem, to -which .all claiming under the intestate are parties, (11 S. and R. 429,) which directs the title of the deceased. 11 S. and R. 430.</p>\n<p id=\"AHH\">As the jurisdiction of such courts is irrespective of the parties in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>interest, our inquiry in this case is whether the County Court of Brown county had power to act in the estate of Peter Grignon, on the petition of the administrator under the law of Michigan, providing, that where the goods and chattels of a decedent are not sufficient to answer his just debts; on representation ther\u00e9of, and the same being made to. appear to the County Court where he dwelt, or where his real estate lies, it may license the executor of administrator to make sale of so mubh as will satisfy the debts \u00e1nd'legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">' No other requisites to tli\u00e9 jurisdiction of the County Court are prescribed than the death of Grignon, the insufficiency of his personal estatuto pay his debts, and \u00e1 representation thereof to the Bounty-Court where he dwelt or his real estate was situate, making these facts appear to the court. Their decision was the exerciseof jurisdiction,. which was conferred by the representation; for whenever that was before the court, they must hear and determine whether it was true or not; it was a subject on which there might be judicial action. The record of the County Court shows, that there was a petition representing some facts by the administrator, who prayed ah order of sale; that the court took those' facts which were alleged in the petition into consideration,, and for these ahd divers other good reasons ordered that he be empowered t\u00f3 sell. It did then appear-to-the court that.there Were facts and reasons before them which brought their power into action, and that it was exercised by. granting the prayer 'of the petitioner, and the decree-of the court does not sp\u00e9cify the facts and- reasons, or' refer to the evidence on which they were made to appear to the judicial eye; they must have been', and the law presumes that they were such a's to justify their action. 14 Peters, 458. But though-the order of the court sets forth no facts on which-it was. founded, the license to the administrator is full ahd explicit, showing what was considered and adjudicated on the petition and evidence, and that every requisition of the law had been complied with before the Order was. made, by proof of the existence of all the fact's on which the power to make it' depended. 3 Peters, 202.; 2 Peters, 1;65. We all know that even in. the old states, the records of these and similar proceedings are very imperfectly kept, that where it consists of separate pieces of paper-, they are often misl\u00e1\u00edd or lost by the carelessness of clerks, and their frequent changes; regular entries of the proceedings are not entered oh the'docket as in adversary cases, nor are the facts set forth in the petition.entered at'large; and it is no matter of surprise that in so new and remote part of the country as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the place where these proceedings were had, this state of things . should exist. Nor is it necess.ary that a full or perfect account should appear in the records of the contents of papers on files, or me judgment of the court on matters preliminary to a final order; it is enough that there be something of record which shows the subject-matter before the court, and their action upon it, that their judicial power arose and was exercised by a definitive order, sentence, or decree. 2 Peters, 165. The petition in the present case called tor a deci\u00e1on of the court that the facts represented did or did not appear to them to be sufficiently proved; they decided that they did so appear, whereby their power was exercised by the authority of the law, and it became their duty to order the sale, unless in a case under the 3d section. The subsequent provisions of the act of Michigan' relate exclusively to acts and- proceedings in the execution of the order of sale or are directory to the administrator to accompany the representation with a certificate of the judge of probate, and to thecpnrt, before passing on such representation, to order notice to be given to the parties concerned, to show cause why the license should not be granted; but these provisions do not affect the jurisdiction of the court, they apply only to its exercise. After the court has passed on the representation of the administrator, the law presumes that it was accompanied by the certificate of the judge of probate, as that was a requisite to the action of the court; their order of sale is evidence of that or any fact which was necessaiy to give them power to make it, and the same remark applies to the order to give notice to the parties. This is a familiar principle in ordinary adversary actions, in which it is presumed after verdict, that the plaintiff has proved every fact which is indispensable to his-recovery, though no evidence appears on the record to show it; and the principle is of more universal application in proceedings <em>in rem </em>after a final- decree by a court of competent jurisdiction over the subject-matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The granting, the- license-to sell is an adjudication upon all the facts necessary to give, jurisdiction, and whether they existed or not is wholly immaterial, if no appeal -is taken; the rule is the same \"whether the law gives an appeal or not; if none is given from the final decree, it is conclusive on all whom it concerns. The record is absolute verity, to contradict which there can be no averment or-evidence; .the court having power to make the decree, it can be impeached only by fraud in the party who obtains it, 6 Peters, 729. A purchaser under it is not bound to look beyond the decree; if there\u00e1s error in it, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>most-palpable kind, if the court which rendered it have, in the exercise of jurisdiction, disregarded, misconstrued, or disobeyed the plain provisions of the law which gave them the. power to hear and deter-, mine the case before .-them, the title of a purchaser is as much protected as if the adjudication-would stand the test of a writ of error,; so where an' appeal is given but riot taken in the time prescribed by law. These principles are settled as to all courts of record which hpm an original general jurisdiction, over any particular subjects; they are not, courts of 'special or limited jurisdiction, they are not inferior courts, in the technical sense of the term, because an appeal . lies from their decisions. That applies to \u201c courts of special and limited-jurisdiction, which are created on such principles that their judgments, taken alone, are entirely disregarded, and the proceedings must show their jurisdiction.;\u201d that of the courts .of the. United States is limited and special, and their proceedings are reversible on error, but are not nullities, which may be entirely disregarded. 3 Petets, 205. They have power .to render .final judgments and decrees which bind the persons and things before them conclusively, in criminal as well as civil causes, unless- revised on error or by appeal. The true line of distinction between courts whose decisions \u00e1re conclusive if not removed to .an appellate ..court, and those whose proceedings are nullities if their jurisdiction does not appear on their face, is this: a court which is competent by -its constitution to decide. on its own jurisdiction, ajidt\u00f3 exeroise- it to a final judgment, without setting forth in their, proceedings the facts and evidence .on which it is rendered, whose record, is absolute verity,. not to be impugned by averment'or proof to the contrary, is of the first description; there can be no judicial inspection behind, the judgment save-by appellate power. A court which is-so constituted that its judgment can be looked through for the, facts and evidence which are necessary to sustain it; whose decision is not, evidence of itself to show .jurisdiction and its lawful exercise, is of 4he latter description; every requisite for either must appear on the face of their proceedings, or they are nullities. The Circuit Court of this district has original, exclusive, arid final jurisdiction in criminal cases, its judgment is a sufficient cause on a return to a writ, of <em>habeas corpus; </em>\u201con this writ this court cannot look behind'- the judgment and re-examine the charges on which it was rendered. A judgment in its nature concludes the subject in which it is rendered, and pronounces, the. law of the case. The judgment of a court of record, whose jurisdiction is final, is as conclusive on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>all the world as the judgment of this court would be. It is as conclusive in. this court as it is on. other courts. It puts an end to all- inquiry into the fact by deciding it.\u201d 3 Peters, 204, 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u201c To determine whether the offence charged in the indictment*be legally punishable or not, is among the most unquestionable of its (the Circuit Court) powers and duties; the decision of the question is the exercise of jurisdiction, whether the judgment be for or against the prisorer, it is equally binding and remains in full force until reversed.\u201d 3 Peters, 204, 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">If the jurisdiction of the court jn a civil case .is not alleged in the \u201cpleadings, the judgment is not a nullity, but though erroneous, is obligatory as one, (3 Peters, 206,) and in a proceeding <em>in </em>rem, an erroneous judgment binds the property on-which it acts, it will not bind it the less because .the error is apparent, and the judgment is of complete obligation.\u201d 3 Peters, 207. The judgment of the Circuit Court, in a'criminal cato, \u201cis of itself evidence of its own legality, and requires for its support no inspection qf the indictments on Which it is founded. The-law trusts that court with the whole subject, and has not confided to this court the power of revising its decision.\u201d 3 Peters, 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">..These principles have been applied by this court to-sales made under the decrees of Orphans\u2019 Courts: .where they have power to judge of a matter of fact, \u201c they are not required to entgr on record the evidence on which they decided that. fact. And how can we now say but that the court had- satisfactory-evidence before it, that one of the heirs was of age ?\" If it was so stated in terms on the face of the proceedings, and even if the j urisdiction of the coirrt depended \u00f3n that fact; it is by no means clear, that it would be permitted to contradict it, on a direct proceeding to reverse any order or decree made by the court. But to permit that fact to be drawn in question in this collateral way, is certainly not warranted by any principle of law.\u201d 2 Peters, 165, Thompson <em>v. </em>Tolmie.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u201c If the purchaser (under a decree- of the Orphans\u2019 Court) was responsible for their mistakes in point of fact, after they had-adjudicated upon the facts, and acted upon' them, those sales would be snares for honest men.\u201d 2 Peters, 169, cited 11 S. and R. 429,</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\u201c The purchaser is not bound to\" look farther back than-the order of the 'court.' He is not. to see whether the court were mistaken in the facts of debts and children. The- decree of an Orphans\u2019 Court in a cas\u00e9 within its jurisdiction is reversible only on appeal, and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>collaterally in another suit. A title under a license to the administrator to sell real estate, \u00abis good against the heirs of the intestate, although the license was granted upon the certificate of the judge of probate, not warranted by the circumstance of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00ab The license was granted by a court having jurisdiction of the subject: if it was improvidently exercised, or in a manner not warranted by the evidence from the probate courts; yet it is not to be corrected at the expense of the purchaser, who had a right to rely upon tire order of the court, as an authority emanating from a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d 2 Peters, 169, and 11 Mass. 227, cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In that case the jurisdiction of the court was held to attach, \u00ab when the acceptor dies intestate, and any of the persons entitled to his estate is a minor, (2 Peters, 165;) so in this case it attaches on the decease of any person indebted beyond the personal estate he leaves, and when jurisdiction is once attached to a subject, or exists over a person, this court has adopted as a .rule applicable to all courts of records that their decisions are conclusive; \u00abit has a right to decide reveiy question which occurs in a cause, and whether its decision be -correct or otherwise, its judgment, until reversed, is binding on every other court.\u201d 1 Peters, 340. In Voorhees <em>v. </em>The Bank of the United States the same principle is applied to sales or executions under judgments on adversary process, and- such must hereafter be taken to be the established law of judicial sales, as well relating to those made in proceedings <em>in rem, </em>as <em>in personam. </em>10 Peters, 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">We do not deem .it necessary, now or hereafter, to retrace, the reasons or the authorities on which the decisions of this court in that, or the cases which preceded it, rested; they are founded on the oldest and most sacred principles of the common law. Time has consecrated them; the courts of the states have followed, and this court has never departed from them. They are rules of property, on which the repose of the country depends; titles acquired under the proceedings of courts of competent jurisdiction must be deemed inviolable in collateral action, or none can know what is his own; and there are no judicial sales around which greater sanctity ought to be placed, than those made of the estates of decedents, by order -of those courts to whom the laws of the states confide full jurisdiction over the subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">These sales are less expensive than when made on executions; more time is allowed to make them; the discretion of the court is exercised as to time, manner, and the terms of sale; whereas on sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>by a sheriff, all is by compulsion and no credit is allowed; he cannot offer one entire piece of properly for sale in parcels j the administrator can divide and sell as best subserves the interest of the heirs, and sell .only so much as the emergency of the case requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">It has been contended by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that the sale in the present case is not valid, because Peter\u2019Grignon had not such an estate in the premises as could be sold under the order of the County Court, it being only an equitable one before the patent issued in 1829; . but the title became a legal one by its confirmation by the-act of Congress of. February, 1823, which was equivalent to a patent. \u2022 It was a higher evidence of title, as it was the direct grant of the fee which had been in the United States by the government itself, whereas the patent was only -the act of its ministerial, officers.</p>\n<p id=\"Azo\">These views of this case decide it, without examining the excep- . tions to the admission of evidence, the ruling of the court on the instruction prayed, or their charge to the jury. So far as either were unfavourable to the plaintiff, they are. most fully sustained by the foregoing principles a\u00f1\u00bf cases; the County Court of Brown county had undoubted jurisdiction of'the subject; their proceedings are irreversible ; the title of the purchaser cannot be questioned; and the judgment\u2019 of the court below must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">order. .</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">This' cause came on. t\u00f3 -be heard on th\u00e9 transcript of the record from the.Supreme Court of the Territory of- Wisconsin, and was argued by counsel. On Consideration whereof, It is now here ordered arid adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Supreme Court' of-the Territory of Wisconsin in this cause be, and the same is hereby affinried with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
