The second section of the act of 1836 pre-supposes that the sale or location, or other disposition of the land included in the grant confirmed by the first section, were such.sales, locations, or other disposition as the act of Congress and the law in force at this date justified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-8\">This position cannot be assailed, unless by assuming the unconstitutional doctrine that Congress could enact the destruction of a citizen\u2019s title to his land, and dispense with the action of a court and jury-</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-10\">It would s'eem to be exceedingly disrespectful to the Congress of the United States to attribute to that body any such intentions ;\u2022 and not less disrespectful to this high court to imagine, that, if Congress, so enacted or so intended to enact, this court would sustain such spoliatory and unconstitutional legislation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-11\">The counsel for the plaintiffs in error will, therefore, take his stand on his above constitutional- position, and from that elevated ground examine the defendant\u2019s title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-12\">The title, as has been seen, consists of\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-13\">1. A New Madrid certificate;, issued in favour of Eustache Peltier, for 160 acres of land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-14\">2. A location filed in the office of the surveyor-general, at St. Louis, by a purchaser, under Peltier, of said certificate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-15\">3.. A survey of said location, made at the instance of said purchaser and locator- by the surveyor-general.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-16\">4. A patent issued to. said Eustache Peltier, and his legal representatives, for said 160 acres, as located and surveyed, and' by virtue of said location and survey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-17\">The counsel for the plaintiff, for the purpose of his argument, will. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>assume, as <em>res </em>adjudicada, that, if it be shown that the United States had no title to the land described in the patent to Eustache Peltier, that patent is void as against the confirmee, under the act.of 4th July, 1836.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-5\">In the case of Polk\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Wendell, 9 Cranch Rep. 99, the Supreme Court of the, United States lays down the doctrine, <em>\u201c </em>that there are cases in which a grant is absolutely void, as when the state has no title to the thing granted, or when the officer had no authority to issue the grant. In such cases, the validity of the grant is necessarily examinable at law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-6\">The facts iipon which the Supreme Court decided, in Polk\u2019s case, showed that the state of North Carolina attempted to grant lands to which she had ho title or authority to grant. The court therefore pronounced her patent to be void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-7\">If, in the case now before the court, the patent to Eustache Peltier and his legal representatives conveyed the land described in it, it must be because this land had been previously divested out of Amos Stoddard, under Mordecai Bell, and had become merged in the public domain, and part thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-8\">If the land had not been so reunited to the public domain, it is contended, that neither Eustache Peltier nor 'his assigns could have lawfully located upon it, or have caused their location to be surveyed; or, if the location and survey were t\u00f3 be made on their mere demand, by the instrumentality'of the surveyor-general of the United States, at St. Louis, without any discretion on his part to refuse the location and survey, then, although, strictly speaking, the location and survey were made according to the letter of the second section of the law of 1815, yet it must have been, at the risk of the locator, and those claiming under him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-9\">The counsel for plaintiff in error will now, therefore, proceed to demonstrate that,.at the date of the location under Eustache Peltier, the title was not divested out of Amos Stoddard, under Bell, in the land so located, but was actually reserved from sale or disposition by the United States, until the claim to it of Amos Stodd\u00e1rd, under Bell, was finally passed upon by the proper authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-10\">It is in evidence in this case, that the claim of Amos Stoddard, under'Bell, to the land in Peltier\u2019s location had been duly filed long previous to the act-of 15th February, 1811. By reference to that act, section 10, (2 Story\u2019s Laws United States, p. 1178,) it will be seen that the Presid'ent of the United States was authorized, whenever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>he shall think proper, to direct so much of the public lands,\u201d &amp;c. [Here the counsel quoted that part of the act, which is set forth in the statement of .the case by the reporter.]'</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-5\">By the act of-Congress of 17th February, 1818, (3 Story\u2019s Laws, p. 1659,) sect. 3, it .is provided, \u00abthat whenever the land-office shall have been established in any of the districts aforesaid, (created by the first section,) and a register and receiver of public moneys appointed for the same,, the President of the United States shall be, and is hereby, authorized to direct so much of the public lands lying in such district as shall have been surveyed according to law, to be offered for sale, with, the same reservations and exceptions, in every respect, as was provided for the sale of public lands in the territory of Louisiana, by the tenth section of an act entitled, \u2018An act provid-, ing,\u2019 &amp;e., being the same act above referred to.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-6\">As has been observed, it is in evidence in this case, that the land located and patented under Peltier was included' in a claim which was in due time, and according to law,- presented to the recorder, and filed in his office, and therefore was reserved specially from sale, by the acts of 1811 and 18\u00cd8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-7\">It is also in evidence, that -the claim was actually included in a list printed and published, at the instance of the recorder at St. Louis, in pursuance of instructions from the United-States land-department, of lands reserved from sale in the district of St, Louis. It was not contended by the defendant\u2019s counsel that if the land in dispute had constituted part of a lead-mine tract, or included, or was adjacent to, a \u25a0 salt-spring, or formed part of land reserved for public schools or state seminaries, the location by Peltier\u2019s vendee could have held the land, or that a patent could have cured the defect of the location.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-8\">Nor, as the counsel for the plaintiff understands their argument, do they contend that the land included in <em>A </em>mos Stoddard\u2019s claim was not reserved under the acts of 1811 and 1818.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-9\">But, to get rid of the difficulty, they contend, that the words in-the New Madrid act of 1815, section 1, \u201c Any person or persons owning lands in the county of New Madrid, in the Missouri territory, with the extent the said county had on the tenth day of November, 1812, and whose lands have been materially injured by earthquakes, shall be, and they are hereby authorized, to locate the like quantity of land \u00f3n any of the public lands of said territory authorized to be sold,\u201d ought to be construed to tnean lands which, at any time after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the New Madrid location was made, should become public land, and as such might be authorized to be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-5\">And then the counsel for defendant endeavour to show, that subsequent to the date of-the location under Peltier, the land did, in fact, become public land, and might have been authorized, by the President of the United States, to be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel will now proceed to demonstrate, in refutation of the above doctrine of the defendant, that\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-7\">1. The location, or the right of location, was confirmed by the act of 1815 to the owner of the lands injured, whoever he might be at the date of the passage of the act, and not to his assignee or vendee after the date of the act, as in the case before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-8\">2. That the words in the act, \u201c the sale of which is authorized by law,\u201d mean, not land the sale of which, after the location made, might be authorized by law, but land, and that, too, public land, which, in conformity to the acts of 1811 and 1818, before adverted to, Were actually authorized by the President to be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-9\">3. That the land included in the claim'of Amos Stoddard, under Bell, upon which the locations under Eustache Peltier, and also under Martin Coontz, have been made, never has become, at any time, public land authorized to be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-10\">In support of our first objection, namely, that the act does not authorize a location by an -assignee whose assignment bears date subsequent to the passage of the act, the court is referred to the specific provision in the first section, which confines the right to locate to the owner of the land injured. The court will see, by reference to the record, that the locator under the certificate to Peltier, and also to Coontz, was not the owner of the land insured at the date of the passage of the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-11\">It is true, that in many, perhaps most cases, those locations have been made by persons who were not the owners, but it is submitted that this practice cannot have the effect of changing a positive law, particularly when it is considered that this practice was introduced for the benefit of mere speculators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-12\">Tt is matter of record, and we may add, of authentic history, that, under this abusive practice,-the New Madrid law has been perverted to the purposes of gross fraud upon the government of the United States, and to the spoliation (as in the present case is attempted) of private owners. The counsel for the plaintiffs in error respectfully submit, that when the act of 1815 is sought to be converted into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>species of penal law operating'a forfeiture as against private owners, . whose titles and claims were, at the date of that act, matters of record, that act ought to be construed strictly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-6\">If the question were now between the United States and locator, there might, perhaps, be some ground for a liberal construction.- . It might be contended, that the surveyor-general, who filed the location and surveyed it, being an officer and agent of the United States, his act as against his principal ought, if possible, to be binding. But this sort of reasoning surely cannot be endured where the question is between a total stranger to the surveyor-general and a tortious locator who,- at his own risk, has thought proper to file a location calling for land not public, and not authorized to be sold, and availing himself, for manifestly tortious and unjust purposes, of the instrumentality of a purely ministerial officer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-7\">In support of the position, that the words in the act, \u00abthe sale of which is authorized by law,\u201d must be taken to mean, 1st, public lands; 2d, lands authorized to be sold according to the provisions, and \u201c with the same reservations and exceptions in every respect,\u201d contained in the 10th section of the act of 1811, and in the act of-1818, before referred to, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel beg to call the attention of the court to the specific terms of those two acts, and' to their manifest object.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-8\">The counsel for plaintiff would also refer to the New Madrid act, in which, besides the words, \u201c the sale of which is authorized by law,\u201d specifically provides, that \u201c no such location shall include any lead mine or salt spring.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-9\">By those, acts of 1811 and 1818, it seems too clear for argument, that until the sectional lines were run, the president was not authorized to sell the land. The survey is directed to be made by those acts, in conformity with the established system of public surveys. The general object of that system is to designate, beyond all doubt, in all future time, the boundary lines and the quantity of land included within theifa. The special object in Missouri was, besides, to ascertain the location and quantity of all those lands reserved and excepted from sale in those acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-10\">It was impossible that the objects, therefore, in view could be attained without a survey having been previously made by the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-11\">It was impossible, with any accuracy, to ascertain the location or quantity of mineral land \u2014 of salt-spring land. It was also impossible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>to know where the 16th section fell, without survey. It was equally impossible to know the ground covered by claims \u201c duly filed with the United States recorder,\u201d without such survey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-5\">It is manifest, that th\u00e9 act of 181&amp; (New Madrid act) provides for all this by requiring the location to be made, not only on public -land, but public land authorized to be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-6\">By the terms of the acts of 1811 and 1818, (and as to' lead mines .and salt-springs, the New. Madrid act itself,) a great extent of public land was excepted from sale. The President had no power to proclaim such lands for sale. But the act of 1815 requires that the location be not made on those lands. How, theii, was the locator, or the officer who filed the location to know when it. was made, whether it interfered with lands which, though public, were not to be sold ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-7\">While on this pail of the subject before the court, the counsel for the plaintiff in error would refer the court to the opinions of a distinguished attorney-general of the United States, the late William Wirt. They are to be found in. the \u201c Opinions of the Attomeys-General of the United States, from the beginning of the Government to March 1st, 1831;\u201d (published under the inspection of Henry D. Gilpin, in' 1841/) In this letter of the 11th May, 1820, to the secretary of the treasury, (page 263,) Mr. Wirt says: 1st, That \u201c the act attaches no assignable quality to the charity it bestows,\u201d or \u201c to make those charities a subject of speculation2d, That <em>\u201c </em>it was not the intention of Congress, in authorizing the sufferers- \u2018 to locate the like quantity of land on any of the public lands of the said territory which is authorized bylaw,\u2019 to change or affect in any manner that admirable system of location by squares, which had been so studiously adopted in relation to all the territories.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-8\">In his letter of the 19th June, 1820, (page 273,) Mr. Wirt specifically gives it as his opinion', that the sale, is not authorized by law until the sectional lines are run, and consequently all locations previously made by those sufferers (New Madrid) are unauthorized.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY7\">The counsel for the plaintiff in error'begs leave to refer, to those letters of Mr. Wirt, as strongly in support of 'the objection taken to the location in this case, because of its having been made by an assignee. It does not appear that the person who signed the locations filed in this case with the surveyor, had any power- of attorney so to do. He acted for himself and for his-own benefit, and not for that of the \u201c sufferer.\u201d . The opinion of Mr. Wirt as to the necessity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>of a previous survey of the township, is clear and explicit, and, \u2022besides, has been assented fo by Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-5\">By the act of 26th April, 1822, it is enacted, by section 1, \u00abthat the locations heretofore made, of warrants issued under the act of the 15tli February, 1815, if made in pursuance of that act in other respects, shall be perfected into grants- in like manner as if they conformed to the sectional or quarter sectional lines of the public surveys and by section 2, <em>\u201c </em>That hereafter holders and locators of warrants shall be bound, in locating them, to. conform to sectional lines as nearly as the Respective quantities will admit.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-6\">The above act would not have been necessary if. Mr. Wirt\u2019s opinion was not adopted by Congress, or if it had been erroneous. The act was obtained, as many acts unfortunately have been, to suit the purpose of speculators, and to cure defects in their locations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-7\">This act, however, cannot.operate beyond its import and terms. It cannot make, a location valid against a private owner, when, in its origin it was void. The only effect that, according to principles of sound justice and jurisprudence, ought to be given to this act, is merely to make good a location and survey, notwithstanding that if did not originally, or did not at date of the act, coincide with sectional lines. But it is contended by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that, whenever it shall appear that the location in other respects did not -conform to the terms of the act, it shall not become available under the above act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-8\">Mr. Wirt, in his above opinion, only adverted to one object in 'view of Congress, but he might also, with equal propriety, have urged the necessity of survey, in order to ascertain the location and quality of those public and private lands which were excepted or reserved from sale, and which could not be ascertained until the .public surveys had been made, returned, and approved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-9\">As has been observed, it is in evidence in this case, that the surveys of the township in which the land in dispute is situated were not returned till 1822, and that, at the date of those locations under Peltier and Coontz, respectively, no survey at all had been made by the United States</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxQ\">The court is also referred to the opinion of the attorney-general, Wirt, in his letter of the 10th October, 1825, (p. 558,) which is adverse to the legality of locations on land included in a claim duly filed. Mr. Wirt, it will be seen in this letter, refers, in aid of hte opiriion, to an official letter, dated 10th June, 1820, of the then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>secretary of <em>the </em>treasury, Mr. Crawford. The construction, put by Mr. Wirt upon the words, \u201c the \u00a1sale of which is authorized by law,\u201d in the act of 181,5, has been adopted by the United States\u2019 land department,- and has been reiterated in divers letters and opinions of the solicitor of the United States\u2019 land-office, and by the attorney-general of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-5\">For the opinion of Attorney-General Butler, the court ,is referred to (\u201c Opinions,\u201d page 119,9,) the letter of the attorney-general, of 11th August, 1838, in which he adopts the views of Mr. Wirt, and in this very case of Mordecai Bell-uses these words : In the case of Mordecai Bell, whose claim.to 350 arpens is confirmed by the act of. July 4, 1836,1 am of opinion, that the tract of six acres a,nd twenty-eight hundredths, included in the survey, and previously confirmed by the old board of commissioners, must be regarded as clearly held .by a prior title; but that Bell\u2019s claim will be valid for the residue, notwithstanding the survey includes two tracts located, and another patented, under the New Madrid law. These cases must stand on the same ground as those noticed in the case of Mackay, because the lands embraced in the act of 1836 werl equally reserved from sale.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-7\">The above opinions, though not judicial authorities, are referred to in aid of the humhle argument of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and, in particular, are referred to as repelling any conclusion that may be drawn iri favour of those locations, from what has been (very erroneously, as it is conceived) denominated.contemporaneous construction and practice. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-8\">Those opinions, of the law officers of the United States, of the commissioner of the general land-office, and of the secretary of the treasury, can alone be. referred to, to ascertain the construction that was in fact given to the New Madrid law. The acts done under that law in Missouri were <em>ex parte, </em>and interested acts, or purely ministerial acts done by an officer whom the law rendered a mere instrument of the locator. Acts of this sort can claim no respect as demonstrating contemporaneous construction, or as establishing a lawful custom.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-9\">The court will see, on referenceto the second section of the New Madrid law, that\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-10\">1. The recorder was bound to issue the certificate on the oath or affirmation of a competent witness, that any person was entitled to a tract under the provisions of the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-11\">2. That, upon such certificate being issued, and the location made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>on fhe application of the claimants, it was made the duty of the principal deputy-surveyor to. cause the survey'to be made thereof, and to return a plat of each location to the recorder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-4\">3. That the recorder was directed to record the location and plat in his office, and was t\u00f3 receive from the claimant the sum of two dollars for receiving proof, issuing the certificate, and recording the plat as aforesaid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-5\">4. By section 3, the recorder was obliged to issue a patent certificate to the claimant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-6\">5. The executive of the United States was bounds upon the exhibition pf the patent certificate, to issue the patent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-7\">Thus, in each of those five stages of the locator\u2019s title, the locator or claimant is \u00ab <em>actor reus, et judex.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-8\">He first designates the land by his location, which designation was filed as of course. . He then demands a survey of that location, which the surveyor-general is obliged to make. He then demands, upon the strength of'the location and survey, a patent certificate; and, armed with this certificate, he proceeds to Washington city, and demands his patent, which, by the terms of the third section of the act, the executive of the United States is bound to give him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-9\">It is true, that Mr. Wirt, in his letter of the tenth of October, 1825, gives it as his opinion, that the issuing of the patent was not so purely ministerial an act as to dispense.with, on the part of the President, all consideration of the location and survey on which it was founded-; and therefore opposed the issuing of a patent to Mr. Bates, who' demanded it under the provisions of the New Madrid act for land included in a claim duly filed, or which was then before a court of competent jurisdiction: but this opinion of Mr. Wirt, although the department was not in favour of the New Madrid location, does not appear to have prevented the issuing of the patent; doubtless, because the executive considered the act too imperative, or that, as a ministerial officer, he preferred to leave the whole question of title, as between the New Madrid, locator and the claimant, to be decided by a court of justice. In this view, it would, perhaps, be difficult to establish that the executive of the United States was in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-10\">Having thus endeavoured, it is hoped satisfactorily, to demonstrate, that the whole of the proceedings on which the patent to Eustache P\u00e9ltier was based were not only not in pursuance of the New Madrid law, but in direct violation of it, the counsel for the plaintiff in error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>submit, as a logical and legal conclusion, that those proceedings, and a patent based on them, could not, ip the least degree, weaken the claim of the plaintiff under Mordecai Bell, or divest the title, whatever it was, which at the date of the New Madrid act was in Bell and his legal representatives.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-5\">It Has been .urged at bar in the court below, on behalf of the defendant, and may- be reiterated before the- Supreme Court, that, admitting, for argument\u2019s sake, that the location was not good and valid at-its date, it yet has become so by operation of certain- acts of Congress, and that therefore the claimant under Bell can at most be entitled to a re-location under the second section of the act of 1836, under'which he contends that his claim is confirmed. It has been strenuously argued, that he must take the title or the confirmation <em>cwm enere, </em>or not at all; \u2014 that he cannot control Ihe mode in which Congress has thought proper to extend their charity towards him, nor escape from the conditions unde r which that charity has been bestowed. The counsel for the plaintiff might retort this argument on the defendant. Surely, if the claimant under a Spanish' grant and surveybe charged with mendicancy at the door of Congress, the New Madrid sufferer has, <em>h fortiori, </em>had charity \u2014 absolute alms, bestowed upon'him. Surely it is he that must be bound by the strict terms and conditions of the gift, and not seek to enlarge it at the expense either of the United States or of private proprietors. There is nothing in the position of the defendant, who rather represents a New Madrid speculator than a New Madrid \u201csufferer,\u201d to call for any liberality of construction in his favour, especially when that liberality is avowed to-be called for in order to effect a forfeiture, as against a party whose original right to' his land has been solemnly recognised, first, by a board of commissioners, and afterwards by the Congress of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-6\">This argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel assumes (as proved, what we contend has ho existence, namely, that the land included in the claim of Amos Stoddard, under Mordecai Bell, confirmed by the act of 4th July, 1836, has been sold, located, or disposed of, accord? ing to law. If it has not b.een so \u201c disposed of,\u201d it is manifest, that the confirmation by the first section of the .act Of 1836, carries the whole title, and that the second section of that act has no application, no subject-matter, to operate on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-7\">We come now to the ground above adverted to, as taken by defendant\u2019s counsel, namely, that the location, though not good when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>made, has become good by operation of certain acts of Congress on the claim of the plaintiff, and . the land included in it. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-5\">The counsel for defendant', in support of this position, referred to the acts of May 26, 124, May 26, 1826, and May 24, 1828.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-6\">They contend, that, by the 5th section of the. act of 1824, \u201c a claim to land within the purview of that act, which shall not be brought before that court, or through neglect or delay of the claimant, shall not be prosecuted to a final decision within three years, shall be for ever barred, both at law and in equity; and no other action at common law, or proceeding in equity, shall ever thereafter be sustained in any court whatever in relation to said claims.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-7\">To this, the plaintiff .replies, that this section of the act of 1824 (renewed, as we admit, by ffie acts of 1826 and 1828) can have no bearing whatever on the plaintiff\u2019s case-or claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-8\">1. Because this section could not react on the proceeding, under the New Madrid law, and render legal and valid a location and survey that were void <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-9\">2. That the section, if it ever could operate to exclude the plaintiff in his claim from a court of justice, has been repealed by Congress, and the plaintiff remitted to all his right and \"title -under the grant to Bell, by the acts of 1832 and 1833, which authorized him to place his claim before a board, in the'same state of vitality and vigour in which it was when first filed with the recorder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-10\">3. That the act of 4th July, 1836, has confirmed the claim and recognised it as entitled to protection by the' treaty, and good and valid to all intents and purposes. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-11\">This third reason, brings us to the paramount character of the plaintiff\u2019s title; and, it is respectfully submitted, exhibits it as a title which Congress could not violate, even if they had so declared their intention to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-12\">The commissioners under the acts of 1832 and 1833 accompanied their decisions on the respective cases with a very full report and exposition of their views of the claims and titles which they were authorized to take under consideration, and the principles upon which their classification wa's made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-13\">The principles thus laid down, by those commissioners, have not only been sanctioned by the act of Congress of the 4th July, 1836, but have been affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States. In their report of the 31st September, 1835, the commissioners parr ticularly refer to the case of Chouteau <em>v. </em>United States, and also to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the case of Delassus, under Deluzieres <em>v. </em>United States. The commissioners, in their report of 1833, adopted the principle, that, when the grant, or the grant and survey, created a right of property, the claim ought to be placed in the first' class as entitled to confirmation. In their second Report of 1836, they reiterate this doctrine, and refer to the Supreme Court of the United States in support of it. They cite the very words of this court in the above cases. \u201cIn the first case,\u201d say they, \u201cthe Supreme Court lays it down that \u2018orders of survey, made by the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana, are the foundation of title, and are capable of bein'g perfected into complete titles; that they are property capable of being alienated; and is, as such, to-be held as sacred and inviolate as other property.\u2019\u201d They also cite-the language of the Supreme Court in the former case of Delassus <em>v. </em>United States, as follows: \u201c The right of property is protected and secured by the treaty; and no principle is better settled in this country, .than that an inchoate tide to land is property.: independent of treaty stipulations^ this right would be held sacred. The sovereign who acquires an inhabited territory, acquires full dominion over it; but this -dominion is never supposed to divest the vested rights of individuals to property. The language of the treaty ceding Louisiana excludes every idea of interfering with private property; of transferring lands which have been severed from the royal domain.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-5\">The question of the inviolability of the right of Amos Stoddard, under Mordecai Bell, is - settled by the- highest possible'authority, legislative and judicial. It follows, as a clear consequence, that the New Madrid law ought to receive such a construction as is consistent with the above view of Congress and of the Supreme Court. It has been endeavoured to be shown, that, by a fair' interpretation of the New Madrid act, no collision could take place between it and the treaty of cession on those principles, -which, as. the Supreme Court observes, independent of the treaty, would have protected the property of the .plaintiffs in error; but it is respectfully, and confidently also, contended, that if the terms of the New Madrid act, or any other act of Congress, specifically purported to annul, or to violate the right- of the plaintiffs, those terms must he disregarded, as unconstitutional!</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-6\">It is not supposed, by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that the merits'of the claim of Stoddard, under Bell, can now become the subject of reexamination as against the United States, and with reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>validity of that .claim- when it was' filed with the -recorder. All that has been already passed on and settled in favour of the claim. The proceeding under the New Madrid law, passed in 1815, can have no bearing on the original merits of a claim filed' under an act of Congress passed in. 1805. It would seem that the counsel for the defendant have abandoned the' objection to original validity of plaintiff\u2019s title, inasmuch- as the instructions asked for by the defendant, and given by the Circuit Court, are predicated on the patent to Eustache Peltier, and on the location under Coontz. The <em>prirnd facie </em>title of ' the plaintiff was not seriously disputed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-5\">In addition to what has been already submitted by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, on the subject of Peltier\u2019s patent, and the grounds on which it may-be successfully avoided in an action of ejectment, much more might be said, drawn as well from the decisions of this court as from the doctrine in England on the subject of royal grants of land. The court must be well aware, that in England a -king\u2019s grant may be got rid of, by showing that, at the' date of it the king had no title.' It is contended, on behalf of plaintiff in error, that this doctrine should be, <em>cl fortiori, </em>the law of. the United States. The President of the United States is, as respects public land, a purely ministerial officer; whereas the title to public lands in England is vested in the king. There is no law, at least the counsel for plaintiff in error have not been able to find one, which imparts to a patent for land any peculiar virtue, or any greater efficacy in operation than that of an ordinary deed of quitclaim, signed, sealed, and delivered by an attorney in fact for and in the name of his principal. The counsel for the plaintiff id error, while they admit that a United States\u2019 land-patent constitutes a <em>prima facie </em>title, and th\u00e1t a party cannot at law get behind it, arid avoid it.on the ground of.irregularity in the previous formalities, do respectfully contend, that, when the proceedings on which the patent is founded .are -utterly void, or where it is shown that the United States had no estate , in the land, or no right to grant the land, the <em>prirndfacie </em>case made by the patent is rebutted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-6\">In conclusion, the counsel submit that\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-7\">1. .It appears from the record, that the plaintiffs in error claim a right, title, and estate, under a confirmation of a grant and survey vested in them' as heirs-at-law of Amos Stoddard.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-8\">2. That their right and tide is protected and consummated by treaty, and by act of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5VQ\">3. That the decision of the Circuit Court of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>has been against their title, so derived, guaranteed, and consummated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-5\">4. That this decision of the Circuit Court of the United States is erroneous, and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-6\">Jones, for the defendants in error, said he would inquire,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-7\">First, \u2022 As to the instrument by which the plaintiffs attempt to connect the title of Amos Stoddard with- the original title (whatever it was) of Mordecai Bell, under the concession from the Spanish governor of Upper Louisiana; \u25a0 and upon which instrument necessarily depended any sort of right, at law or equity, in Stoddard to claim the rights vested in Bell by that concession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-8\">This instrument purports to.be executed by one Richard Caulk, styling himself syndic of the district of St. Andrews, and certifying that Mr. Bell was present before him, &amp;c. It is produced as a record, upon its own authority. It cannot be set up as a private act; it. is enough to say, that it is actually brought forward as a record. If so,, it is invalid, unless it possesses the necessary requisites. Article 1132, of the Civil Code of Louisiana, changes the common law in this respect, and says, that an act not authentic from defect of form, &amp;c., may avail as a private paper, if signed by the party. In 10 Louisiana Rep. 304,.there is the ease of \u00e1 mortgage signed by a married woman, and some of the witnesses did not see her sign. The court set it aside, because it was produced as an authentic act. See, also, article 2233, adverted to in the case in 5 Martin, N. S. 68, 69. The distinction between authentic acts and private writings is shown in Partidas, title 18, p. 222, 235.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-9\">All the decisions ,of this court in Florida cases, show that persons must prove the authenticity of the paper under which they claim, and that local laws must be proved below, as foreign laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-10\">The office of syndic is explained in 6 Peters, Strother <em>v. </em>Lucas: he was only a subordinate, police officer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-11\">.The preface to the translation of the Partidas, p, 20, shows that, a proclamation of O\u2019Reilly established syndics. There -is no evidence in the case that they acted as notaries. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-12\">As to powers of commandants, see 3 Martin, 115. If this is not valid as an authentic paper, will the lapse of time make it so, as a private paper? It is*true, that time is of great value in sustaining the muniments of title, where the property has been, for a long time enjoyed: but in this case, the party who claims under this instrument never was in possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Secondly. As to Mordecai Bell\u2019s claim, which was confirmed by the board of commissioners on the 8th June, 1885, the plaintiffs, in their statement, say it Was that identical claim which had been filed by Soulard with the recorder of land-titles, on the 29th June, 1808, laid before the board for their action, and rejected by them on the 10th October, 1811as if the first decision against the claim had been subject to some condition or reservation, that kept the claim alive during all the twenty-four intervening years, and still pending before the board, for their further consideration and final decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-5\">This is a clear mistake. Mordecai Bell\u2019s claim was never filed with the recorder of land-titles, nor was- it ever laid before the board for adjudication, till March 30, 1835; near nineteen years after Peltier\u2019s, location, seventeen years after his survey, and two years and eight months after his patent; sixteen' years and ten months after Coontz\u2019s location, and sixteen years and eight months after his survey. It was Amos Stoddard\u2019s claim alone, as assignee of Mackay, the pretended assignee of Bell, that was filed by Soulard, on the 29th June, 1808, with 'the recorder of land-titles; and definitively rejected by the commissioners, on the 10th October, 1811; and which, ever since that time to the commencement of the present action, a period of twenty-eight years, had lain quiet and silent under a judicial condemnation, unconditional and absolute in its terms \u2014 final in its effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">But the-claims of assignees and grantees are.very different. An assignee, as such might establish his claim before the commissioners, who' might, very properly, have confirmed the claim of Bell, as original grantee, without at all recognising the chain of title by which it is alleged that the present claimants hold Bell\u2019s right. In such a case, the plaintiffs would have no title; and the facts in this case, leave it entirely doubtful, whether the commissioners did not intend so to decide. 10 Peters, 334; 6 Peters, 766.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-7\">What title did Bell acquire under the Spanish concession ? He is called a grantee, but there was no land described by metes and bounds.- The concession was nothing but an order of survey, but nc ate vested. 12 Wheat. 599; 6 Peters, 200.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-8\">On 10th March, 1804, Spanish authority ceased, and that all' the steps to acquire title were taken after that time. On the 29th of May, 1804, Bell conveyed the concession to Mackay, but the Spanish law had then entirely ceased. A survey, made by private, authority, after the change of flags, is void. 10 Peters, 234.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Thirdly. As to the supposed confirmation of M. Bell\u2019s claim, itself, by the act of Congress , of the 4th July, 1836, the plaintiffs produced no evidence whatever, of that claim\u2019s being among \u201cthe decisions in favour of land-claimants, laid before Congress by the commissioner of the general land-office,\u201d prior to the passing of that act; unless they rely on presuming that fact from another fact, certi'fi\u00e9d on the 27th March, 1840, by F. R. Conway, recorder of land-tides in the state.of Missouri; namely, that \u201c'said' claim was included in the transcript of favourable decisions transmitted by the recorder of land-titles, and. the two commissioners associated with him, to the commissioner of the general land-office.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALjd\">The title alleged byjhe plaintiffs, as it appears on their own showing, is held utterly vicious and untenable; and if the defendant were stripped of all right and tide, still the full right and tide to the land in question would remain in the United States, without any sort of right in the plaintiffs to claim the land, either at law or equity. ' In support of this, proposition, the following objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 title are held demonstrative and insuperable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-6\">1st. The pretehded act of sale and exchange from Bell.to Mackay was utterly inoperative and void <em>ab iriitib ; </em>\u2022 and therefore the commissioners were fully sustained by the law and the fact of the case when they decided, as they must have decided, since they rejected Stoddard\u2019s claim and admitted Bell\u2019s, that Stoddard had failed to make out any valid claim in himself, derived through Mackay from Bell; and it is a fair' if not a- necessary presumption, under all the circumstances, that the specific defect, for which his derivative claim was rejected by the commissioners, was found in this broken link in the chain by whjch he attempted to connect his claim with the \u00f3riginal title of Bell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-7\">This instrument, throughout its whole frame and,tenor, and in the manner of its execution, pursues.the form and claims the authenticity and effect of a \u201c public or authentic aqt\u201d executed under official sanction, and equivalent to record evidence, as contradistinguished from.a \u201cprivate writing,\u201d to be proved in the ordinary way. Like all such acts, it speaks in the name and character of the officer who \u25a0executed it, not of the parties. It was produced as such an act; - as an act that \u201c proves itself;\u201d that is \u201c full proof \u201d in itself, without any proof of execution in the ordinary way. It must, therefore, be shown to be the very thing, it professes and is claimed to be, or nothing ; failing as an authentic act, it cannot, according to the known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>laws of Louisiana, be set up as a private writing, nor was it attempted to be so set up.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-5\">The validity and effect of this instrument wholly depends on the legal competency of R. Caulke styling himself syndic of a district, to execute an authentic act in relation to contracts, and there is nothing to show, either that he was such syndic as he describes himself* or, being such, that h\u00e9 had any authority,.in virtue of that office, to .execute authentic acts. On the contrary, from all that is known of the office of a syndic, \u2019he was merely a municipal police officer, of very subordinate authority and functions; and is clearly excluded from every description of officer evSr recognised by'the laws and customs of Louisiana as having authority to execute such acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-6\">2d. But whatever may be now thought or said of the intrinsic force and effect of the instrument, if it <em>wererres integra, </em>the decision of the commissioners against Stoddard\u2019s claim (unreversed and unquestioned as it has stood for so many years) is conclusive against the title now set up by the plaintiffs,</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aho\">3d. If there had been. no . decision-of the commissioners against the claim, it would have been equally beyond the cognisance of the court. No title derived from an imperfect Spanish grant, like that to Bell, could be set up, or in any manner recognised in any court of the United States, of of any state, till it had passed the tests provided by-the, acts, of Congress; that is, till confirmed, first by the commissioners, then by Congress, and then regularly located arid identified- by survey,' and lastly carried out into grant by a patent from the United States..</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-8\">.4th. Whatever -title,;wheth\u00e9r an inchoate or a complete legal title, be vested by the decision of the commissioners, the confirmation of that decision by Congress, and the subsequent s irvey locating and identifying'the land- to which the claim'was so confirmed, that, title was vested in Beli exclusively.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-9\">But it is said by the counsel on the other side, that the deed of exchange between Bell and Mackay is a mutual warranty, which_ is ari estoppel, and \"that an estoppel will support an ejectment. But thi.s is not a case of estoppel, which is binding only on the donor and his heirs. If one makes a deed when he has no title and' after-wards acquires one, he is estopped; but if he acquires a lesser estate than he has conveyed, there is no estoppel. 4 Cruise\u2019s Digest, 271, sect. 58, New York edition <em>of </em>1834; 4 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, 98, 260, 261, 8 Barn. and Cres. 497.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>In 1804, the assignee stood in the place of the original grantee, and had only a right to acquire land. What, then, is the warranty in the exchange? Only that the warrantor will not.cl\u00e1im contrary to the. grant; he does not warrant that the grantee shall have the land, because he could not warrant the faith of the Spanish or American government. 2 Barn. and Ad. 278.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-5\">The act of Congress interferes with the estoppel. As to- the effect of aii act of Parliament upon an estoppel, see 2 T. R. 169.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-6\">5th. Even Beil\u2019s claim is'in no way shown to have been included in <em>\u201c </em>the decisions in favour of land-claimants,\u201d which are referred to in the act of Congress of July 4, 1836, as., being within its purview, and which are to be identified by reference- aliunde.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-7\">II. The title vested in Bell himself is but inchoate and incomplete, and wholly incompetent to support the action of ejectment.

As to the two objections taken .to the defendant\u2019s title</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-10\">Objection 1. That the locations and surveys of Peltier and Coontz were On lands not then for sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-12\">Answer. The description of the lands on which the entries, and locations of the New Madrid land-warrants were allowed, was not limited -to lands offered for sale, but to such lands as were not reserved from sale by the land laws of the \u2018United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-13\">Objection-2. That a claim for the land in dispute, under the Spanish grant or concession to Bell, was already before the commissioners for adjudication when those entries and locations were made, and so within the express exception of the act of Congress which .authorized such entries and'locations</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-14\">Answer 1st. The claim before the commissioners was for no particular tract of land, distinguished by metes and bounds,, or other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>wise, from the mass of public lands subject to the claim but simply for 350 arpens of land; to be afterwards duly laid off and surveyed. The survey by Stoddard,-in 1808, was wholly unauthorized' and void; and if he took any possession of the land so' surveyed, it was but a naked and tortious possession of so much of the public lands. No special location of the land so claimed could be pretended till it came to be officially surveyed, May 26, 1837, <em>\u201c </em>in conformity, as it is said, with the decision of the late board of. commissioners,- and in \u2022virtue of the confirmation thereof by the act of Congress\u2019approvedon the 4th July, 1836.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-5\">\u2019 Answer 2d. No claim for the land in -dispute, or for any other land under the Spanish concession - to Bell, was before the commissioners, either at the inception or consummation of the two titles vested in tjie defendant, and derived from Peltier and Coontz; nor till the lapse of many years thereafter, when Bell\u2019s claim was first laid before the board, in March, 1835. As to Stoddard\u2019s claim, it had been definitively rejected by the board six years before the very inception of those titles by the New Madrid land-warrants, and has never been, forran instant, <em>sub judies, </em>since its final rejection by the board in October, 1811, till the commencement of this suit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-6\"><em>Ewing, </em>for the plaintiffs in error, and in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">We.- contend that -the plaintiffs have the better title, and ought to have recovered against- both the patent of Peltier, and the survey of Coontz.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-8\">The claim of Mordecai Bell was duly filed with the recorder of land-titles for the proper district on the' 29th of June, 1808, pursuant to the provisions of the act of March - 2d, 1805, ch. 86, sect. 4, and the act of April 21st, 1806, ch. 39, sect. 3, and the act of March 3d, 1807, ch. 91, sect. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-9\">-. The concession was good. It is settled-that Delassus had a right to grant. Land Laws, 542 ; 9 Peters, 146.</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-10\">The defendant cannot now go behind, the confirmation by the commissioners and by Congress. The. claim was guarantied by treaty, and although no survey -had taken place, Congress indirectly required us to make it. The act of March 2, 1805, ch. 86, directs all grantees from the Spanish government, including orders of survey, to file a plat, &amp;c. It is true that there was no public survey made under the authority of Congress, for there was no public officer to do it. Soulard, who calls himself surveyor-general, was not so under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>the authority of the United States. This is-admitted. But he was recognised by existing legal- authorities. He was the most -proper man to make a private survey, which he did. The Supreme Court of Missouri has held his to be semi-official acts. There are hundreds of cases in the reports of the commissioners of surveys by this same man, and the commissioners took from his records a transcript for their own government. This claim is confirmed as having been surveyed. The act of 3d March, 1807, ch. 101, sect. 1 to 5, saves \u2022 Spanish claims. In 1808, the commissioners refused to confirm this claim, but Congress continued to pass other laws, and no -claim was considered to be .-finally disposed of because it was refused. This one remained on file until Congress should pass upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-5\">. By the act of February 15th, 1811'j-ch. 81, sect. 10, it is enacted, \u201c That till after the decision of Congress thereon, no tract of land shall be offered f\u00f3r sale, the claim to which has been in due time, and -according to law presented to the recorder of land-titles in the dis-' trict of Lousiana, and -filed'in his office, for the purpose of being investigated by the commissioners appointed for ascertaining the rights of persons claiming lands in the territory of Louisiana.\u201d The same provision is contained in the act of March 3d, 1811, ch. 113, sect. 10, and it is referred to and continued in the act of February-17, 1818, ch. 11, sect. 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-6\">The act of March 26th, 1824\u2019, ch. 173, which provides for the trial of Spanish claims in the district courts, and the supplementary act of May 24th, 1828, ch. 92, superseded and- suspended this saving from the 26th day of May, 1829, until.it was revived by the act of July 9, 1832, ch. 180, sect. 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-7\">As to our title before the confirmation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-8\">The concession was in 1800, the assignment in 1804, the survey in 1806, which shows all- .the papers to have been in the hands of the surveyor. In 1808, Stqddart filed -his claim before the commissioners. ' By the Spanish law the delivery of. papers is equivalent to the \"delivery of the.land itself. But the deed is formal enough. It was not the public act of a notary, but that was not necessary. One mode of conveyance is for a notary with two others to summon the parties before him and make up a. record, which is itself a transfer of title; but another mode is by the p\u00e1rty signing a deed. The Spanish laws are not accurately carried out in remote countries. Even in our distant settlements, a record is sometimes made up partly by parol. In 1769, O\u2019Reilly says there were no lawyers in the country except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>at New Orleans. In 1802, there were no notaries except at the same pl\u00e1ce. The people had been transferred often from one power to another, and must have been uncertain sometimes to whom they belonged. They executed deeds before any high officer whom they could find. Moralez implies that commandants might take acknowledgments of deeds. The syndic was nex;t in authority to the commandant, with, whom be acted sometimes as judge. 2 Land Laws, 204, 210, index.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-5\">By comparing O\u2019Reilly, 2, 5, 12, with Moralez, 4, 5, 15, it will appear that the syndic was. a judicial officer. The Partidas says that proof must be given that the officer was a.public one^ unless after a long lapse of time. In the preface to the Partidas, the syndic is mentioned after the alcaldes and before the attorney-general. If, therefore, the deed from Bell was not exactly in a regular form, it was in the customary way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_4\">The claim was prosecuted by Stoddard and not Bell until it was rejected. But this decision was not final, as the act of 1832, ch. 180, [4 Story, 2305,) authorized the commissioners to. proceed on. all rejected claims standing \u00f3n the records of the former commissioners, with or without a fresh-presentation. The claim was confirmed to Bell or his legal representatives. Ten or twelve other, cases are just in the same way. Senate Doc. for 1835-6, vol. 2, doc. 16, pp. 7, 15, 33, 69. In these cases the claim is made by the assignee, and the confirmation is to the original party or to his legal representatives. As to the meaning of this expression, see 12 Peters, 458, Strother and Lucas; -</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-7\">Bell is estopped, or rather rebutted from saying that the confirmation. is not to Stoddard, for he had conveyed <em>to </em>Stoddard with warranty, which amounts to an estoppel. Co. Litt. 174a, 384b; 12 Johnson, 201; 13 Johnson, 316; 14 Johnson, 193; 1 Miss. Rep. 217. Title by estoppel is sufficient to maintain ah ejectment. 1 Salkeld, 276 ; 2 Lord Raym. 1554; 6 Mod. 257, 259, same case as Salkeld, 3 P. W.) 372.</p>\n<p data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-8\">Bell\u2019s deed is sufficiently proved before this court, because it was not objected- to below.

Congress looked only to the fact that the claim was legally filed, and not to the validity of the claim itself. Between 1829 and 1832, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>reservation was withdrawn, entries, werd made and have been sustained by courts in Missouri. But these defendants did nothing in this interval. It is the same case as Bobeani and.the Fort a Chicago. The land was reserved and the entry was void.

Bell-conveyed the same to James Mackay, the 29th of May, 1804, and on the 26th- September, 1805, he conveyed to Amos Stoddard; A plat and certificate of the survey- were certified and recorded by Antoine Soulard, as surveyor-general, the 29th of January, 1806.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">The above papers were presented to tile recorder of the district of St- Louis, the 29th of June, 1808. And the claim was duly filed with the board of commissioners for their action thereon, who, on the 10th of October, 1811, rejected it. But afterwards- on the 8th of June, 1835, the b\u00f3ard decided that 350 arpens of land ought to be cotifirmed- to the said Mordecai Bell, or his legal representatives, according to the survey. And on the 4th of July, 1836, an act of Congress was passed, confirming the decision of the commissioners. The land was surveyed as confirmed. The plaintiffs proved the death of Amos Stoddard, before the suit was commenced;, and that they are his heirs-at-law. The defendant was proved to be in possession of forty-eight acres and eighty-four hundredths of the land in controversy,'one acre and sixty-three hundredths of which were in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>location and survey of Martin Coontz, and the residue within the \u25a0patent of Peltier.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">' The .title of the defendant was founded on ah entry made by Peltier of 160 acres of land, by virtue-of a New Madrid certificate, on the 24th of October, -1816. A survey of the entry was made.in March, 1838, and \u00e1 patent to Peltier was issued the 16th of July, 1832. \u2022 Possession has been held under this title since 1819. The title w\u00e1s conveyed to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">On the 29th of May, 1818, an entry was made, which authorized the survey of Coontz, but.no pat\u00e9nt.has been issued on it</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The township in which the above tract is situated wa.s surveyed in \"1817, 1818, and 1819, and. was examined in -1822. Since 1804, a certain mound on the land has beep called Stoddard\u2019s mound. In 1823 the .\u00a1proclamation of the' President, published .at St. Louis, directed the lands.iii the above township to b\u00e9. offered at public sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">On the above evidence, the court instructed the jury,</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">1. That the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover the land, embraced in Peltier\u2019s patent;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">2. . That they were not entitled to recover the land embraced in Coontz\u2019s. survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">The .decision of this controversy mainly depends on the construction of. certain acts of Congress. By the ,acf of-the 2d of March, 1805, -all persons residing in the territory of . Orleans, who-had claims, to land under the French or Spanish government, were required: to fije theif claims, for record with - the register of the land-office, or. recorder of land titles., and prevision was made for confirming them.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">The time limited irt the.above act Was extended by the act of the 3d of March, 1807, as regards the filing of claims with the. register Or recorder, until -the 1st of July, 1808. By the act of the l\u20185th of February, 1811. the President was authorized to have .the- lands which had been surveyed in Louisiana, offered fen sale; \u201c provided, however, that .till after the. decision of Congress thereon, no tract of land shall.be offered.for. sale, the claim to which has been ifi due time, and according to law,-presented to the recorder of land-titles in -the district of Loui\u00e1ana5 and filed in his office, for the purpose of. being investigated by :the commissioner\u2019s appointed, for ascertaining the rights of persons, claiming land in the territory of Louisiana.\u201d The same reservation was repeated in the act of the 8d of Marchj 1811.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">. The act of the 26th of May, 1824, authorized claimants \u201c under \u2022French- or Spanish grants, concessions, warrants, or orders of sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>veys\u201d in Missquri, issued before the 10th of March, 1804, to file their petition in the District Court of the United States for the con firmation of their claims. And every claimant was declared by the same act to be barred, who did not file his petition in two years.\u201d By the act of the 24th of May, 1828, the time for filing petitions was extended to the 26th of May, 1829., On the 9th of July, 1832, an act was passed, \u201c for the final -adjustment of land-titles in Missouri,\u201d which provided that the recorder of land-titles, with two commissioners to be appointed, should examine all the unconfirmed claims to land in Missouri, which-had heretofore been filed in the office of the said recorder, according to law, prior to. the 10th of March, 1804. And they were required to class the claims sq as -to'\u00ab state in-the first class what claims, in their opinion, would in feet have been-confirmed, according to the laws, usages, and customs of the Spanish government and the practice, of the Spanish authorities under them. And secondly, what claims in their opinion are destitute of merit, law,' or equity. \u201d And by the third section it was provided, \u201c that from and after, the final' report of tne recorder and- commissioners, the lands .contained in the sepond class shall be subject to sale as other public lands; and the lands contain\u00e9d in the first class shall continue to be reserved from sale as heretofore, until the decision of Congress shall be against the claims of any of them; and the lands so decided against shall be in like manner subject to sale as. other public lands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">These are. the facts and statutory provisions which are material in the case. The defendant, under the entry and survey of Peltier, holds'the elder legal title to the land in controversy, except the one acre and sixty-three hundredths, which is covered by the entry and survey of Coontz. Until the confirmation of- the plaintiffs\u2019 title by the act of 1836, the legal title to the land claimed was not vested in \u25a0 the plaintifis. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Objections are made to the intermediate conveyances under which the plaintiffs claim. And first, it is insisted, that the deed-from Bell to Mackay was not proved. It is stated on the record, that there was no proof that jR. Caulk, the syndic, befdre whom the deed was signed and acknowledged, had authority to\" act as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The deed was' executed in 1804. It was attested by two witnesses, and purports to have been acknowledged in the presence of a syndic. There was .no exception to the admission of this deed in evidence ;\u2022 and, consequently, the objections now made to its execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>tion are not before the court. But if the execution of the instrument were now open to, objections, they could not be sustained. Forty years hare elapsed since this deed purports to. have-been executed. From that time to this,, a claim under it seems to hare been asserted. It was presented to 1he commissioners in 1811, haring been filed with the recorder of .land-titles, in 1808. And again, it was brought before the commissioners in 1835, it haying remained on file until that time. Under these circumstances, the regular proof of the instrument might well be dispensed with.. Possession, under, this deed, was .held by Stoddard for a time, and became so-notorious that a certain elevation on the land- was called Stoddard\u2019s mound.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Independently of the lapse of time, the unsettled state of the country at the time this instrument was signed, the transfers of the country from one sovereignty to another, the rude and defective organization of. the government \u2014 the civil and military functions being blended, are facts which no coirt can-disregard in acting upon transfers of property between individuals. If some degree of-regularity and form were observed in regard to public grants, technical and' legal' forms cannot be required in the transmission of claims to land; among- a people, the great mass of whom were ignorant of the forms of titles, and indeed, of almost every thing which pertained to civil government.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">A syndic was i).ot, in that country, an appointed officer, as'he is in a regulated government; but the duties devolved' upon the commandants of military .ports, as occasion might require; There is nothing on the face of this deed to excite suspicion. It was attested by two witnesses, and contains the signature and certificate of the syndic. The genuineness of these attestations was not objected to on the admission of the deed as evidence, or on a motion to overrule it. The deed must, therefore, -be considered as evidence to the jury, without exception. And, under all the circumstances, we think, that full effect should have, been given to it, as a muniment of title. The deed from- Mackay to Stoddard, the ancestor of the plaintiffs, is not objected to. Bell\u2019made the conveyance to Mackay, not having the legal title; but when, under the .act of 1836, the .report of the commissioners was confirmed to Bell and his legal representatives, .the .legal title vested in him, and enured, .by way of estoppel, to his grantee, and those who claim by deed under him. A-confirmation, by act of Congress, vests in the. confirmee the right of the United States, and a patent, if issued, could only be- evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>dence or this. On a title by estoppel, an action of ejectment-may be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">If the claim of the defendant had not been interposed, no one could doubt the validity of the' plaintiffs\u2019 title. It has the highest sanction of the government, an act of legislation; But the 2d section of the'act of 1836, which gave this sanction, provided, \u201cthat iffit should' be found that any tract confirmed, \u00f3r any part thereof, had been previously located by-any other person or persons, under any law of the United States, or had been surveyed or sold by the United States, that act should confer no title to such lands, in opposition to the rights acquired by such location or purchase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">This provision, it is insisted, covers the case, and defeats the title of the plaintiffs. But, it must be observed, that a location, to come within the section, must have been made \u201c under a law of the United States.\u201d Now an act under a law, means in conformity with it; and unless the location of the defendant shall have been made agreeably to law, or the patent were so issued, the reservation does not affect the title of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The holder of a New Madrid certificate had a right to locate it only on \u201cpublic lands which had been authorized to be sold.\u201d Peltier\u2019s location was made in 1816, and his survey in 1818. The location of Coontz was made in 1818, and his survey.-in 1818. At these dates there can be be no question that all lands claimed under a French or Spanish title, which claim had been filed with the recorder' of land-titles \u2014 as the plaintiffs\u2019 claim had been \u2014 were-reserved from sale by the acts of Congress above stated. This reservation was continued up to the 26th of. May, 1829, when it ceased, until it was revived by the act of the 9th of July, 1832, and-was continued until tire final confirmation of -the plaintiffs\u2019 title, by the act of 1.836. The defendant\u2019s patent was issued the 16th of July,-1832. So that it appears,-that when the defendant\u2019s.claim .was entered, surveyed, and patented, the land covered by it, so. far as the location interferes with the plaintiffs\u2019 survey,'was not \u201ca part of the public land authorized to be sold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">On the above facts, the important -question arises, whether the defendant\u2019s title is not void. That this is a question as well examinable at law as in chancery, will not be controverted. That the elder legal title must prevail in the action of ejectment, is undoubted. But the inquiry here is,, whether the defendant has any title, as against the plaintiffs. And there seems to be no difficulty in answer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ing the question, that he has not. His location was made on lands not liable to be thus appropriated, but expressly reserved; and this was the case when his patent was issued. Had the entry been made, or the patent issued, after the 26th of May, 1829, when the reservation ceased, and before it was revived by the act of 1832, the title of die defendant could not be contested. But at no other interval of time, from the location of Bell, until its confirmation in 1836, was the land claimed by him liable to be appropriated in satisfaction of a New Madrid certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">No-title can be held valid which has been acquired against jaw; and such is the character of the defendant\u2019s title, so far as it trenches on the plaintiiT\u2019s. .It has been argued, that the first patent appropriates the land, and extinguishes all prior claims.of inferior dignity. But this view is not sustainable. The issuing of a patent is a ministerial act, which must be performed according to law. A patent is \u25a0utterly void and inoperative, which is issued for lapd that had been previously patented to another individual. . The fee having been, vested in the patentee by the first patent, the record could convey no right. It is tru\u00e9 a patent possesses the highest verity. It cannot be contradicted or explained by parol, but if it lias been fraudulently obtained or issued against law .it is void. \u25a0 It.would be a most dangerous principle to hold, that a patent should carry the legal title, though obtained fraudulently or against law. Fraud vitiates all transactions. It makes void a judgment, which is a much more solemn act than the issuing of a patent. The patent of the defendant having been for lqnd reserved from such appropriation,' is void; and also the survey of Coontz, so far as either conflicts with the plaintiffs\u2019 title. For the foregoing.reasons, we think the instructions of the court to the jury were erroneous ; .and, consequently, the judgment must be reversed .at the defendant\u2019s cost, and a <em>venire de novo </em>is awarded:</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">ORDER.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">This cause came on to be' heard 'on the transcript of the record from the Circuit \u25a0 Court of the United States for the district-of Missouri, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, It is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court, in this cause be', and the same is hereby reversed with costs; and that this cause be, and the same is hereby remanded to the said Circuit.
