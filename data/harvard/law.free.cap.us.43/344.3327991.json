The defendant, Eckhard, endeavoured to show an outstanding title in the inhabitants of the village of St. Charles, under the grant for a Common.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-9\">Upon the trial, the plaintiff, Chouteau, offered in evidence such of the facts above detailed as bear upon his title, and the defendant, .in' addition, gave the following evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-10\">He then proved, by Judge Spencer, that he (witness) came to St,' Louis in the winter of 1796; that he came to St. Charles in the winter of 1798; when he came to St. Charles, the town was surrounded by a fence. \u2019 The witness, looking on the plat of the survey of the commons, said that the claim of Spencer under Rybolt was granted to conform to the fence of the commons, and to have the fence of the commons as its northern line; and, looking upon the plat of survey given in evidence by the plaintiff, says the whole of the land covered-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>by the plaintiff\u2019s claim, as laid down on that plat, was included in the commons fence, which was standing-when he came, here, and remained until after 1804.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">Mr. Cunningham, another witness of the defendant, said that he was a deputy-surveyor of the United States, and, as such, he has surveyed the.exterior lines of the commons of the town of St. Charles; that, in making such survey, he in some places found the lines of the Spanish survey, in others the timber was cut down, and, in prairie laird, no lines of courses could be found; and that the Spanish survey conformed to the plat given in evidence in this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">This being all the evidence,, the court, on motion of the defendant, instructed the jury, that, \u201c if they believed, from the evidence, that the premises in controversy are included in the tract of land surveyed under the authority of the Spanish lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana, for the commons of the town of St. Charles, and held by the inhabitants of said town, and enclosed by them as their commons, under the Spanish government, the plaintiff cannot recover in this actionto which instruction the plaintiff, by his counsel, excepts,- and prays the court to sign this his bill of exceptions, which is done, and the same is made part of the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">Both plaintiff and defendant gave in evidence sundry acts of Congress, and defendant gave'in evidence a private act of the legislature of the state of Missouri, which they, agree shall not be set out in the bill of exceptions, but may be read, and considered evidence in the Supreme Court, as if here inserted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">The jury, under this instruction found a verdict for the defendant. The case was carried to the' Supreme Court of Missouri, where the judgment was affirmed, from which it was brought, by writ of error, to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-9\"><em>Lawless </em>and <em>Bngg, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-10\">Gamble, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-11\">The counsel for the plaintiff made the following {mints:</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-12\">1st. That his title to the land in question is protected by the treaty of cession of 1803, article 3d, and confirmed by the Congress of the United States as such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-13\">2d.. That the title attempted to be shown in the town of St. Charles has not been sustained by any proof of grant.by Spain or France, or by any grant or act of Congress since the treaty of cession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-14\">3d. That the defendant having shown no title in himself, and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>outstanding legal estate, the decision of the Supreme Court of Mis-' souri, overruling a claim, right, and title derived from the Spanish government, guarantied by the treaty of cession and confirmed by Congress, is erroneous and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-5\">In support of the first point, they cited the cases of Delassus and Chouteau and Mackay, reported in 9 Peters, and contrasted those cases with the present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-6\">Assuming then, as demonstrated, that the plaintiff\u2019s title was <em>prima facie </em>good, his counsel will proceed to analyze that set up by the defendant, which the court will have already observed, is simply an attempt to show an outstanding legal estate, in the tract confirmed to Peter Couteau, in the town of St. Charles, or in the trustees of that town. The defendant has not shown any derivative title in him to the land in question, nor any colour for his possession thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7F\">The question then, before the court is, whether the title of the town of St. Charles to their commons is paramount to that of the plaintiff, and includes the land which, as has been shown, was granted by the Spanish authorities to Peter Chouteau. If this question be resolved negatively, it must follow, that the decision of the Supreme Court of Missouri has been erroneously given against the title and right of Chouteau specially set up under the treaty of cession and the acts of Congress, and the repeated decision's of the Supreme Court in analogous eases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-8\">The court will please to observe that no specific grant has been given in evidence by the defendant, of land as commons to the village of St. Charles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-9\">The documents which have been given in evidence by the defendant will be seen, not only not to constitute a grant of commons, but specifically to refute the presumption of, and to negative such a grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-10\">In order to arrive at the conclusion that the town of St. Charles had title to a tract of land as commons, and that the land in question formed part of that tract, and that a legal estate in the whole of that common tract was outstanding against.the plaintiff in ejectment, the counsel for the defendant were compelled-to contend that the act of Congress of the 13th June, 1812, entitled \u201can act making further provision for settling the claims to land in the territory of Missouri,\u201d had the effect, <em>proprio vigore, </em>of confirming to the town (or village) of St. Charles, the title to the whole of the 14,000 acres included in the survey given in evidence by the defendant as common \u201c adjoining and belonging to\u201d that town, (village).</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>This interpretation of -the act of 1812 has been adopted by the Supreme Court of Missouri, and, as a corollary or consequence of this construction, it has been decided by that court that a confirmation by the act of 1812 of commons, necessarily annuls or neutralizes, as against the inhabitants of the town or village, all grants or surveys made under the French or Spanish government, no matter of what date, which previous to the passage of the act of 1812 had not been \u201c confirmed by the board of commissioners for adjusting and settling claims to land\u201d in the then territory of Missouri.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-5\">The first section of the act of 1812-is relied on by defendant and by the Supreme Court of Missouri for the above operation. The counsel for the. plaintiff in error submits that such a construction of the qct of 1812, sect. 1st, is in opposition to the terms 'of the act itself, and would also be violatory of rights vested at th\u00e9 date of the treaty of. cession, .and. protected by that treaty and by acts of Congress:</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-6\">The first section of the act (the only part of that law which bears on the subject) enacts,,\u201cthat the rights, titles, and claims to, in town or yillage lots, out-lots, common field lots and commons, or adjoining and belonging to the several towns or villages of Portage des Sioux* St. Charles, St. Louis and others in the Territory of Missouri, which lots have been inhabited, cultivated, and possessed prior to the 20th day of December, 1803, shall be, and the same are hereby confirmed to the. inhabitants of the respective towns or villages aforesaid, according to their several right or rights in common thereto, provided that nothing herein shall be construed to affect the rights of any persons claimiug the same lands, or any part, thereof, whose claims have been confirmed by the board of commissioners for adjusting and settling .claims to land in said territory.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-7\">It is manifest from the terms of this section, that it was not the intention of Congress to confirm any lots or commons which did not on the 20th of December 1803, belong to the several towns or villages mentioned respectively. The words \u201cin, adjoining, and belonging to the several towns and villages\u201d- are surely significant and explicit terms \u2014 the words \u201c which lots have been inhabited, cultivated, or possessed prior to the 20th December, 1803,\u201d are not more explicit and- significant, than- the former words \u201c in adjoining and belonging to\u201d \u2014 yet the Supreme Court of Missouri have solemnly decided in the' case of Jonas Newman <em>v. </em>L. E. Lawless, Missouri Reports, 279, that the first section of the act of 1812 could have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>confirmatory operation, in- the case of a town lot in St. Louis, unless it were distinctly proved that on the 20th December, 1803, the lot existed as a St: Louis town lot. \u25a0 In that case the plaintiff Newman having failed to prove that essential fact, .the judgment rendered against him in the Circuit Court was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Missouri. The Supreme Court of Missouri based their decision on the terms of the act which manifestly call for the existence of a town lot, and the possession of it as such' on the'20th December, 1803, \u00e1s essential to the confirmatory operation of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-5\">It is submitted that precisely the same sound principle of construction ought to have been applied by'the Supreme Court of Missouri to the- case before the court, and it is contended that if it had been so applied, it would have led the Supreme Court to a decision in favour of the plaintiff. There could be no greater reason or justice for the confirmation of a title to a piece of ground as common, which did. not belong as common to a village,\u2019 than for the confirmation of a lot which did not exist or did not belong to anybody on the, 20th December, 1803.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-6\">The Supreme Court of Missouri, in the present case, observe that there seem to- be no questions arising in this case which were not involved in. the case of Byrd <em>v. </em>Montgomery, 6 Missouri Rep. 510.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-7\">With great respect for the Supreme Court of Missouri, the counsel for the plaintiff in error contend that the facts in the case of Byrd <em>v. </em>Montgomery are totally different from those of the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-8\">In the case of Byrd <em>v. </em>Montgomery, there was no grant of the specific tract of land to the person under whom the defendant claimed title. The defendant in that case sejt up, (as against the title of the town under the act of 1812,) a concession to one Francis Giguiere, dated 14th May, 1800, Which was what is terra\u00e9d a floating concession, authorizing a location and survey on any part of (he royal domain. No survey was made under this concession during the Spanish government, and the confirmation was reported by the recorder in 1815, on the ground of settlement right, arising out of improvement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-9\">The Supreme Court of Missouri were of opinion, that this confirmation in 1815, by the recorder, was subordinate to the confirmation of\u2019 the commons of St. Charles by the act of 13th June, 1812, .section 1st.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-10\">It is by no means the intention of the counsel for the plaintiff in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>error, to assent to the correctness of the doctrines laid down in the case of Bird <em>v. </em>Montgomery. Quite the reverse; but the counsel for the plaintiff in error contend, that the title of the plaintiff in error in this case is totally different from that of Montgomery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-5\">In the present case the grant to Chouteau,- as has been observed, was special \u2014 it required no survey to locate it or ascertain its metes and bounds \u2014 these were specially described in the grant to Chouteau. Again, in Siguin\u2019s case, there was no possession \u2014 no improvement\u2014 no expenditure of money, skill, or labour in compliance with, and upon the condition imposed in the grant. In Giguiere\u2019s case there was no severance effected in favour of the grantee, of\u2019the land granted from the public domain. The treaty of- cession, therefore, did not specially guaranty the land as it clearly did in the present case. The confirmation by the recorder in 1815 was based on cultivation in or prior to 20th December, 1803, and by virtue of the donation law of 1805, and the 3d section of the act of 1812. The report of the recorder of the 1st; November, 1815, which embraced Siguin\u2019s settlement, was affirmed by the act of 29th April, 1816. It is -manifest, therefore, that Giguiere\u2019s title emanated'from a donation law of Congress, and not from an ancient and paramount Spanish grant, wffiich, as in the- principal case, severed the land from the royal domain, and as such was protected by the treaty as private property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-6\">It certainly has not been said or decided in- the Supreme Court of' Missouri, that a-mere claim, without any shadow of right, could be enforced by Congress to the prejudice of an existing right and title \u2014 - particularly such a right and title, as that vested in. the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-7\">The very reverse has- been laid down by the Supreme Court of Missouri in the case of the widow and heirs of Mackay <em>v. </em>Dillon, 7 Missouri Rep. 7. The language of that court in- that case 'is unambiguous on this point. They say, \u201c that only such claims as were founded on right were designed to be confirmed. A mere claim, unaccompanied by any shadow-of right, is clearly not such a claim as any act of Congress could Confirm. The force of the term confirmation, of itself, implies some sort of a title in previous existence.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-8\">It is true that the Supreme Court of Missouri,'in the' above case, came to the conclusion that the title of the inhabitants under the 1st section of the act of 1812, June 13th, to commons, was paramount to that of the plaintiff, who claimed under a grant and survey made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>under the Spanish government to their ancestor, and a grant -and survey recognised by the claimants of the commons, and laid down specially on the plot of survey, made in 1806 by Mackay himself, and submitted .in support of the claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-5\">While the counsel for the plaintiff in error protest against the conclusi\u00f3n to which the Supreme Court of Missouri has arrived in the above case,, as illogical, and utterly illegal and unconstitutional; they nevertheless feel justified in availing themselves of the.admissions-of that court, as above cited, to demonstrate thdt the doctrine insisted on by the defendant in this case, namely: .that the act of 1812 confirmed to the people of St. Charles 14,000 acres of land, including the tract granted to the plaintiff, cannot be sound unless he previously establish that the tract claimed by the pl\u00e1irttiff constituted a part of the commons of St. Charles, on the 20th December^ 1803. The words of the 1st section .of the act of 13th June, 1812, would really seem to preclude all doubt on this point. According to those words, no rights, titles, or claims- to commons are confirmed but those \u201c to commons adjoining and belonging\u201d to the several towns 'and villages-named, and \u201c according to their' right in common thereto.\u201d To contend that this act could confirm or grant commons-which were \u201c not\u201d adjoining and belonging to those-towns or villages, and to which the inhabitants had no \u201c right in .common,\u201d would be to make a new law, and positively repeal that of 1812.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-6\">When we examine the- action -of Congress- on the French and Spanish unconfirmed titles at the date of the passage of the act of 1812, it must be .manifest that it could not have been the-intention of Congress \u201c to interfere with or transfer\u201d (to use the language of Chief Justice Marshall in the above-cited case of Delassus under Deluzieres) to the town of St. Charles, the- tract claimed by Pierre Chouteau. As has been- shown, the claim of the plaintiff in error under his grant, had been placed before the first-board of commissioners, under the act of 1805, was duly filed with the United States recorder, and had been, previously to the treaty of cession, actually registered among the archives of the Spanish -government at St. Louis, as appears by the certificate of the surveyor-general Soulard, and by the' book of Spanish record in St. Louis, to which he refers. This court will please to direct its attention to-the actioi Congress, approved February 15, 1811. 2 Story\u2019s Laws, 1178.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-7\">It will be seen that Congress by the 6th and 10th sections of that act, specially provided that no land should be disposed of at public or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>private sale, \u201c the-claim to which has been in due time and according to law presented to the recorder of land-titles and filed in his-office, for the purpose of being investigated by the commissioners.\u201d The court will also, see that in no case was the decision of the commissioners in Missouri final, when that decision was against the claimant. Congress uniformly, in all the,acts passed from 1805, to 13th June, 1812, inclusive, reserved the power to pass finally on-those claims'.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-5\">It is not contended that the act of 1812 amounted to a final disposition by Congress of the claim, right; and title, of' Pierre Chouteau, Sen:, to the land n\u00f3win question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-6\">The acts of Congress,, since passed for the relief of claimants under French and Spanish unconfirmed titles in Missouri ,and Arkansas, demonstrate that Congress considered Chouteau\u2019s title as still in being, and not destroyed or even weakened b,y any antecedent law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-7\">If this be not so, it must follow that the act of Congress of May 26, 1824, the act of 1828 continuing the act of 1824, the acts of \u00cd832 and 1833; and lastly the act of 4th July, 1836, specifically confirming the title of the plaintiff in error, must have been all of them absurd and without a subject-matter to act-upon. If the right, title, and claim of Chouteau to the tract now in question.,.had been extinguished by the confirmation to the town of St. Ch\u00e1rles, it would seem that it, thenceforward, must have ceased to exist.- It would be, it is submitted, a solecism, a contradiction in terms, to contend that Chouteau\u2019s title, though a nullity as against the title .of the town of St. . Charles, could have any being or validity as against the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-8\">It seems, therefore, manifest that-the utmost operation that can be given to the act of 1812 in'favour of the towns and villages mentioned is, that of a transfer by the United States to those towns and villages of the right, title, and claim of the United States to all such land adjoining fihese towns and villages as belonged to these towns or villages as .commons, and had not been granted to private individuals, and were not protected by existing laws Or treaties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-9\">Having said this much on the general principles upon which the 1st\u2019section of the act of 1812-bught to be-construed and administered, and having shown, that excluding from our consideration the title set up by the defendant under the town of .-St.; Charles, the plaintiff has established his <em>prim,a fade </em>case, the counsel for the plaintiff in- error will now proceed, as summarily as- they can, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>examine the grounds of the claim of the town of .St. Charles to the tract in question as forming part of its common, and hope to be able to satisfy the court that the very documents given in evidence by the defendant negative,, most positively, the claim of the inhabitants to the land for which this action was brought against the defendant William Eckhart.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-5\">(The counsel then examined Tayon\u2019s petition and Trudeau\u2019s answer, which are set forth, in the statement of the case, and contended that the land of the plaintiff was not included, because the Marais Croch\u00e9 was situated below the town of St. Charles, and the grant of the plaintiff above the town ; and also that the character of the land did not accord with that claimed by the plaintiff.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-6\">Again, in the response of the lieutenant-governor there is no grant at all of common to the village of St Charles. There is only a declaration that the wooded and low ground asked- for by Tayon shall remain royal domain, and that the inhabitants of St. Charles may use it to obtain fuel. It is manifest that at the date of this answer of the lieutenant-governor to Tayon no grant, had ever previously been mafle or even asked 'for of common. Tayon in his petition treats the land he asks for as land of the domain, and the lieutenant-governor in his reply affirms this view of it, and at the utmost assents to the use of it, until further order, by the inhabitants. It is difficult to imagine why or how. this document can be relied on or used to establish the existence, in favour of the village of St. Charles on the 20th December, 1803, of any* common right to the Chouteau tract, or indeed of any definite commons at all, upon which the 1st section of the act of 13th June, 1812, can possibly operate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-7\">(The counsel then .examined the proceedings of the inhabitants of the village, as detailed in the statement and observed,)</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-8\">It is manifest from the above proceedings of the inhabitants of St. Charles, that at its date they had but a small tract which they used as common, or for the purpose of fuel, and that that part must have been the same referred to by Don Zenon Trudeau, in his answer to Tayon, and therefore situated on the Marais Croch\u00e9 below St. Charles. It is also manifest that the inhabitants at the date of said proceedings had no grant of commons from the Spanish government of any land adjoining the village; and that the language of Zenon Trudeau, treating the woodland as royal domain, was assented to by the inhabitants of St. Charles, not only in 1797, but on the 18th of January, 1801, the date of the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>It is manifest also, that those simple people never intended <em>by </em>the extension of the common to interfere with any private vested interest or right. They pledge themselves to exert themselves, but-\u201c always without prejudice to the interests of- any person.\u201d They evidently never intended to deprive Pierre Chouteau of his property. They must all of them have been perfectly acquainted with Chouteau\u2019s land. The -works executed by Chouteau and his ancient possession must have been notorious, and it is not to be supposed that the inhabitants of. the village who were employed by Chouteau on his land, could have been ignorant of' his claim to it. This view of those proceedings is submitted in- order the better to understand the effect and import of the other documents, and evidence offered- in support of the claim of commons in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-4\">(The Counsel then examined the effect of the meeting of the inhabitants which took place in January, 1801, and the order consequent upon it 5 and argued that no grant could be inferred from that order. They-then examined the survey of Mackay, and contended,</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-5\">1. This survey is totally unauthorized by the decree in obedience to'which it is recited to be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-6\"><em>2. </em>This survey,, admitting its exterior lines to have been correctly run, aind in conformity to the order of the lieutenant-governor, does not conflict at all with, the, grant .of the plaintiff in error, but is consistent with its existence and. validity;</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-7\">Which.points were argued- at length.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-8\">.In conclusion, the fallowing were, stated as the points which argument was considered as establishing,</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-9\">1st.

So'far-as there'is a. conflict between these Spanish titles, and so far as the court of Mii souri have decided between the parties on the relative merits of these titles, it is believed that the Supreme Court of the-United States have not the jurisdiction to review the judgments of the state courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-13\">The courts of Missouri, in deciding upon the rights of parties, as they existed under the Spanish government, are governed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Spanish law, and neither the treaty of cession, nor the laws of the United States, are drawn in question in such decisions. If either party, by invoking the treaty as the guaranty of his rights, could draw his case within the cognisance of the Supreme Court (the United States, then all questions which may arise about properly in Missouri, Arkansas, or Louisiana, claimed by title originating under the former governments, may be brought before this court. This question may, however, be regarded as settled, by the decision of this court ;n the case of the City of New Orleans <em>v. </em>De Armas and Cucullu, 9 Peters, 224. So far, then, as the state courts have decided this case, upon the comparative merits of the two Spanish titles exhibited by the parties, that decision will be regarded as conclusive by this court,- unless, in making that decision, the state courts have improperly disregarded the claim of the plaintiff, as it may have been asserted under an act of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-5\">The plaintiff, in this case, exhibits his claim to the land in question, as commencing under the Spanish authorities, and then produces the act of Congress of the 4th of July, 1836, (4 Story\u2019s Laws of the United States, 2515,) as the confirmation of his title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-6\">The defendant exhibits the title of the inhabitants of the town of St. Girarles, under-whom' he claims this same land, as also commencing under the Spanish government, and as confirmed by the act of Congress of the 13th June, 1812. 2 Story\u2019s Laws of the United States, 1257.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-7\">The court of \u2018St. Charles decides, between these' two titles, in favour of that set up. by the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-8\">If the question were between the tides, only as Spanish titles, the state courts would have the exclusive right to determine it, but here are two acts of Congress, under which the parties severally claim, as the completion of their respective incomplete Spanish titles, and the state courts have supported the title of the defendant, under the confirmation by the act of 13th June, 1812.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-9\">The instruction given by the Circuit Court leaves to the jury to decide, from the evidence, \u201c whether the land in question is included in the tract surveyed, under the authority of the Spanish lieutenant-governor, for the common of the town of St. Charles, and held by the inhabitants of said town, and enclosed by them as their common, under the Spanish government;\u2019\u2019 and pronounces the law, that if the land is embraced in such claim of common, then the plaintiff cannot recover in this action. The jury have found that the land is included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>in the tract thus surveyed, thus held \"and enclosed as a common, under the Spanish government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-5\">The instruction of the court is founded upon a comparison of the Spanish title to the commons, confirmed by the act of 1812, with the Spanish title of the plaintiff, as confirmed by the act of 1836; and' is a decision in favour, of the commons\u2019 title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-6\">As this case fairly presents the question between two confirmations, by different acts of Congress, it becomes proper to consider the effect of such confirmations upon the legal title. It is to be borne in mind, that the act of June, 1812, confirms the claims to.commons, as the final act of the government, and contemplates no other evi-. dence of title to be thereafter given by the government; it is noti a confirmation in the future, or dependent upon any condition; its language is, \u201cthe claims to commons,\u201d &amp;c., \u201cshall be, and the same are hereby confirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-7\">It is believed to be clear, upon principle and authority, that when an act of Congress of this character has passed, and nothing remains to be done by any officer of the government to convey the title, the title passes by the act itself, and no shadow of title remains in the government to be conveyed subsequently to another individual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-8\">The Supreme Court of Missouri has uniformly maintained this doctrine, and. although the decisions of that court are not of binding authority in this tribunal, when construing an act of Congress, yet they are entitled to much consideration in a case like the present, when we reflect that such acts of Congress operate on. a class of land-titles with which that court is familiar, and in which the citizens of' the state are largely interested; and that acts.of this description are always passed at the instance, and upon the urgent solicitation of the citizens of the state in which the lands to be affected lie. Under such circumstances, the proper meaning and effect of suph acts axe at once presented to the legal mind of the state, and are kept before that mind, until the acts receive a construction founded' upon an acquaintance with the whole subject on which the acts operate. This construction is to be found in the decisions of the courts. While, therefore, this court, in - examining a statute designed to operate throughout the United States, or through many of the states, (as do all general laws in relation to the public lands,) will be but little influenced by the authority of a state decision ; it will be per- . suasively influenced by such a decision giving the interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>an act of Congress which is lpcal, and is applicable to a subject peculiarly within the acquaintance of the state tribunal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-4\">(The counsel here commented on the decisions of the Supreme Court of Missouri in the cases Vasseur <em>v. </em>Benton, 1 Mo. Rep. 296 ; Bird <em>v. </em>Montgomery, 6 Mo. Rep. 510; Mackay\u2019s heirs <em>v. </em>Dillon, 7 Mo. Rep. <em>7; </em>and also Strother <em>v. </em>Lucas, 12 Peters, 454.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-5\">It is submitted to the court, that in whatever light a confirmation by act of Congress is to be viewed, whether as a new grant, or as connecting itself with the original title or claim of the confirmee, it must have the effect of . passing the title of the United States, so that no subsequent grant or confirmation can give a legal title to the subsequent grantee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-6\">If this conclusion be correct, the next question for con\u00e1deration is, whether the confirmation of the common of the town of St. Charles, by the act of 18.12, passed the title to the land in controversy ? On this question, the-counsel for the plaintiff have argued, that the title, or claim, of the town to this land was not such a title as Congress could have intended to' confirm by the act- of 1812.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-7\">As the attempt is made, in this case, to escape from the obvious meaning of the act, by a critical examination of its language, it is prope'r to consider'd^ terms with some care. The confirming section enacts, \u201cThat the rights, titles^ and claims to.town or village lots, out-lots, common field lots, and commons, in, adjoining, and belonging to the several towns or villages of Portage de Sioux, St. Charles, St. Louis, &amp;c., which lots have been inhabited, cultivated, or possessed prior to the 20th day of December, 1803, shall be, and the same are hereby- confirmed to. the inhabitants of the respective towns or villages aforesaid, according to their several right or rights in common thereto.\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-_\">(The counsel thfen referred, for the history of the act, to Am. St. Papers, Public Lands, pp. 377, 549, and to the communication of Mr. Penrose to Mr. Gallatin; also that of Mr. Riddick to the chairman of the Committee on Public Lands; and then entered into a comparison of the titles of ihe plaintiff .and'defendant respectively.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-9\">I proceed now, to examine the plaintiff\u2019s claim, as it has been acted upon by the legislation of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-10\">In the remarks that have been made upon the confirmation of the plaintiff\u2019s title by the act of 4th July, 1836, it has been considered as if it were a general confirmation, without any restriction, and it has been attempted to be shown, and it is believed successfully, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>even regarded in that light, it cannot prevail in this action over the confirmation of the commons. But I will proceed to show, from.the laws of the United States, that this claim of the plaintiff has at one period been extinguished, as having any colour of title to the land, and that the subsequent act of confirmation,.which was amere gratuity, was not intended by the government to interfere with the titles which it had previously granted or recognised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-5\">From the time the United States took possession of Louisiana, there has always been manifested a. strong desire to adjust the claims of inditiduals to any land in the territory,'with, great , promptitude, and upon the. fairest principles. Tribunals have, from time to time, b.een established, to investigate the claims, with power, in some instances, to decide on the merits of the claims upon the most enlarged principles of equity, and in other instances, with authority to report their opinions to Congress for its final action. The desire to have all the claims promptly settled, is shown in the provisions of .the various laws imposing penalties on those who should fail to exhibit their claims for investigation within the times prescribed. . The following is a brief statement of these enactments:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-6\">The proviso to the 4th section .qf the act of 2d March, 1805, (2 Story\u2019s Laws United States, 967,) declares, \u201c-that any incomplete grant, warrant, or order of survey, deed of conveyance, or other written evidence, which shall not be recorded as -above directed, shall never after b\u00e9 considered, or'admitted as evidence in any court of the United States, against any grant derived from the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-7\">The 5th section of the act of 3d March, 1807, (2 Story\u2019s Laws United States, 1060,) contains a similar provision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-8\">The 7th section of. the act of 13th June, 1812, extends the time for filing- notices by actual settlers on the land claimed, under a similar penalty. 2 Story, 1260.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-9\">The 1st section of the act of 3d March, 1813,- authorizes those who have filed notices to file the evidences of title, under the same, penalty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-10\">These earlier acts are referred to, not as having any direct operation on the plaintiff\u2019s claim,but to show the uniformity of the legislation in relation to these claims, and to show that the provisions of subsequent acts, which do affect the plaintiff\u2019s claim, are not new or extraordinary provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-11\">The act of 26th May, 1824, (3 Story, 1959,) which created a special jurisdiction in the courts of the United States, was designed to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>these claims to a final close. The 5th section of that act provides, that a claim not brought before the District Court in two years, or not prosecuted to final judgment in three years, shall be for ever barred, both at law and in equity. The 7th section provides, that where a claim is'barred, by being decreed against,'\u201c or by any of the provisions of the act, the lands shall forthwith be held and taken as a part of the public lands of the United States, subject to the same disposition as any other public lands.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-5\">This act was continued in force by the act of the 26th May, 1826, .for two years, and by the act of 24th May, 1828, it was continued in force, for the purpose of filing petitions, until the 26th day of May, 1829, and for the purpose of adjudicating upon the claims, until the 26th day of May, 1830.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-6\">The record in. this case shows no presentation of this claim to the District Court; and for the purpose of the question now under consideration, it is to be assumed, that it was not presented, or-if presented, was decided against; the effect being the same in either case. It is certain, that it has not been confirmed by the courts, as the only-confirmation relied on by the plaintiff is that of 1836.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-7\">Now, the right of the government to require a diligent prosecution of these claims, and to impose penalties upon the claimants for their negligence, is not to be questioned. This court, in speaking of these provisions of law, in Strother <em>v. </em>Lucas, 12 Peters, 448, says: \u201c These are laws analogous to acts of limitation, for recording deeds or giving effect to. the awards of commissioners for settling claims to lands under the laws of the states; the time and manner of their operations, and the exceptions to them, depend on the sound discretion of the legislature, according to the nature of the titles, the situation of the country, and the emergency which calls for their enactment. Reasons of sound policy have led to the general adoption of laws of both descriptions, and their validity cannot be questioned. Cases may occur where the provisions of a law may be such as to call for the interposition of the courts; but these under consideration do not.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-8\">In this case, then, the fifth and seventh sections of the act of 1824 had full operation on this claim of the plaintiff, at least from the 26th May, 1830, until the passage of the act establishing the last board, on the 9th July, 1832, and during that period the claim was barred, both at law and in equity; and the land, as far as this claim was concerned, was public land. During that period, while the claim of the plaintiff was thus, by his own neglect, extinguished, the land was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Held by the town of St. Charles, as confirmed to its inhabitants by an act of Congress, with no shadow upon its title : and it is now submitted to the court, that no subsequent action of the government could operate to affect the title, thus complete and unclouded, in the town of St. Charles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-5\">If it be said, as it has often been said, .that the government can waive any such forfeiture, I am free to admit that the United States are competent to waive any advantage which they might claim under such enactments, but I deny, that the claimant, having neglected to comply with the terms oi a law, and being thus barred, <em>\u201c </em>at law and in equity,\u201d can, as against an individual citizen, be restored to any right of action by any act of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-6\">' At this point, I will call the attention of the court to another act of Congress, which seems designed to cut off all questions between titles of the description of those now before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-7\">It has been before observed, that the last day allowed for presenting petitions to the District Court was the 26th May, 1829, and a year was allowed for prosecuting them to final decision. If there was a failure to pursue the action thus offered to the claimant, the 5th and 7th sections of the act of 1,824 barred the claim. Now, between the expiration of the time thus given for presenting the claim, and the passage of the act of 9th July, 1832, establishing the last board of commissioners, the Congress of the United States, on the 27th January, 1831, passed an act, by which the United States relinquished to the inhabitants o\u00ed St. Charles all the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the lots and commons. 4 Story, 2220.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-8\">If it should be supposed, that after the act of 13th June, 1812, the technical fee still remained in the United States, here is an act of Congress equally efficacious with a patent, to transfer that fee, and this act is passed when the claim of the plaintiff was barred, both at law and in equity, by his own negligence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-9\">There is still another feature in the plaintiff\u2019s confirmation which requires notice, although, for the purposes of this defence, I think enough has been already said.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-10\">It will be seen, by reference to the various acts of Congress in relation to these claims, that while the government was disposed to treat the claimants with the utmost liberality, it was regarded \u00e1s a duty which the government owed to those who held adverse titles to the land, that they should be protected from any disturbance which might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>be attempted under these later confirmations. The eleventh-section of the act of 26th May, 1824, (3 Story, 196.3,) provides, \u201cthat if, in any case, it' should so happen, that the lands, tenements, or hereditaments decreed to any claimant, under the provisions of this act, shall have been sold by the United States, or otherwise disposed-of, in each -and every such case it shall and may be lawful for the party interested to enter the like quantity of-land,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-5\">The last clause of the sec\u00f3nd section of the act of 24th May, 1828, which continues the act of 26th May, 1824,. in force, provides, \u201cthat the confirmations had by virtue of said act, and the patents issued thereon-, shall operate only as relinquishment of the.title on the part of the United States, and shall in nowise affect the right or title, either in law or in equity, of adverse claimants of the same land.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-6\">These provisions, intended to apply to confirmations which should be made by the decrees of the highest tribunal in the land, show the fixed determination of the government to protect the rights of those holding the land under any title- adverse to the confirmation\".</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-7\">In the same spirit, and with the same purpose, a like provision was inserted -in the 2d section of the act of 4th July, 1836, under which the plaintiff claims. That section enacts, \u201c that if it shall be found that any tract or tracts, confirmed as aforesaid, or any part thereof, had-been previously located by any other person or persons, under any law of - the United States, or had been surveyed and sold by the United States, this act shall confer no title to such lands, in opposition to the right acquired by such location of purchase, but the \u2022individual or individuals, whose claims are hereby confirmed, shall be permitted to locate so much thereof as interferes with such location or purchase, on any unappropriated land,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-8\">Although the most obvious application of the words, \u201c previously located under any law of the United States,\u201d is, to the class of titles in Missouri which originated in the act for the relief of .the inhabitants of New Madrid who suffered by the earthquake, and who were authorized to locate other lands in lieu of those-injured; still it is plain, that all titles which had received the sanction of government were equally deserving of protection, against disturbance from these confirmations. The language used in the 11th section of the act of 1824, \u201c sold or otherwise disposed of,\u201d would have embraced every description of title conferred by the government, by which the land was disposed of, and would have protected the town of St. Charles against the plaintiff\u2019s claim, if it had been presented to the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>under that act, and had been confirmed. The spirit of the legislation is to secure these prior titles; and unless there is some absolute necessity to construe the 2d section of the act of 1838 with the greatest strictness, and to exclude from its protection ail titles which can by such construction be excluded, it is believed that the title of the town of St. Charles may receive the benefit of this section, as a complete defence against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-5\">If, then, the commons \u00f3f the town can with any proprieiy be said to \u201chave been previously located, under any law of the United States,\u201d the act of 1836 confers no title against the claim of the town. On this question' it is hot thought necessary to'remark, as it is to be determined by an examination of the section referred to. The effect of the section is, to leave the claim of the plaintiff unconfirmed, so far as it 'interferes with the titles designed to be protected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-6\">If I have conveyed my ideas intelligibly, I think I have maintained the following propositions:</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-7\">1. That between two confirmations by different acts of Congress, where no other evidence of title is contemplated by the confirming acts,'.the elder confirmation passes the legal title,</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-8\">2. That the confirmation of the commons of St. Charles, by the act of 13th June,-1812, is a confirmation of the claim- as it was spread oh the records of the government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-9\">3. That the claim, as evidenced by the survey and by actual possession, was adverse to the claim'of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-10\">4. That.if the confirmations were to have effect, with relation to the merits of the original Spanish- titles, then the title of the town of St. Charles to* the land in question, as part of the common, is an older and better title than that of the plaintiff</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-11\">5. That the claim of the plaintiff to- the land in question was extinguished..by his neglect to'present and prosecute it, under the act of 26th May, 1824, as that act was continued in force by the,acts of 1826 and 1828.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-12\">'6. That if the fee did not pass by the confirmation, it did pass by the .act of 27th January, 1831.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-13\">\u25a0 7. That- the confirmation' of the plaintiff\u2019s claim by the act of the 4th July, 1836, did not operate to confer any title,' as against the title of the town.</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-14\">These points present, as it is believed, several distinct and complete defences to this action</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Mr. Justice CATRON</author>\n<p id=\"Aq1\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">For the statement of the facts the report is referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">It is insisted this court has no jurisdiction to look into the plaintiff\u2019s concession of 1800; or to pass on it, under the 25th section of the Judiciary act \u2014 and the case in 9 Peters, 244, of New Orleans <em>v. </em>De Armis, is referred to as settling the question. If the plaintiff relied alone on a complete Spanish title, then the argument would be sound, but each party claims by force of an act of Cqngress; the plaintiff under that of 1836, and the defendant under the .act of 1812, confirming to the inhabitants of St. Charles the village commons; and which is fortified by another act, for the same purpose, of 1831. The decision of the Supreme Court of Missouri was opposed to the title set-up under the act of 1836 by the plaintiff. From this.decision he prosecuted a writ of error to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Construction is called for on the acts on which both titles are founded; and as no occasion can arise in any instance involving construction, aside- from a contest, making a case; the facts giving rise to it must be .ascertained before the construction can be applied. To hold otherwise, would render the 25th section a dead letter in a majority of instances. The same question arose in the case of Pollard\u2019s heirs <em>v. </em>Kibbie, 14 Peters, 254, and again in that of The City of Mobile <em>v. </em>Eslava, 16 Peters, 234, both involving property at the city of Mobile; the first is not distinguishable from the present in its material features, so far as the question of jurisdiction is involved; and the latter covers the whole ground before us. In the cases cited, as in this, the record set out the titles on each side, together with the facts and charge of the court; from which it appeared the decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama was opposed to the plaintiff\u2019s title,\u2019 the judgment below having been affirmed. This court did not then doub.t its powers to look behind the act of Congress, into the Spanish concession of Pollard, for the purposes of construing the act, and comparing it with that under which the defendant claimed: not with the intention of setting up the concession as an antecedent title to the act, that would support an action, but for the purposes of the construction and application of the acts on which the controversy depends. And the same rules apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s title is <em>prima fade </em>a good legal title, and will support an ejectment on the act of 1836, standing alone, if the land can be identified, as confirmed, without resort to the patent. This court held, in Strother <em>v. </em>Lucas, 12 Peters, 454: \"That a grant may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>made by a law as well as a patent pursuant to a law, is undoubted, and a confirmation by a law is as fully, to all intents and purposes, a grant, as if it contained, in terms, a- grant <em>de novo.\u201d </em>And as, according to the laws of Missouri, an action of ejectment could be prosecuted on Chouteau\u2019s title, by force of the confirmation,'the construction of the acts of Congress, under which the respective parties claim, will decide the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The character and- nature of the village right, in this country, is somewhat peculiar. The inhabitants of Upper Louisiana resided in villages, almost exclusively, and cultivated common fields, enclosed by only one fence; each person who cultivated the soil having assigned to him, by the syndic of the town, a certain portion of land to cultivate. In this manner the chief tillage of the soil was carried on; the other parts of the country being in the forest state.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The villages also required commons for pasturage for their horned cattle and horses,- and for fuel and timber; this part not being enclosed. The quantity included in the field, for pasturage, timber and wood, was regulated by the nature of the soil and timber, and accommodated to the wants of the inhabitants) and conceded at the discretion of the government; usually to very liberal extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">AS the principal support of the population was derived from agriculture and pasturage, the village commons were deemed of primaiy importance by the people and government, and- as a common title more fav ured than individual titles in cases of. conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In this situation the United States found the country when they came into possession of it, in March, 1804, as the successor' of France; or rather Spain, in virtue of the treaty of cession. So great has been the change by the introduction of a population with different habits, and modes of agriculture, that it is difficult to estimate at this day the former importance of the village common to the French .inhabitants: It was the basis on which their society -Was formed to so material an extent, that the early acts of Congress could not be well understood, without a reference to this important circumstance; and especially not the sweeping act of 1812.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana, (usually the military commandant,) made concessions for lands founded on such considerations as to him seemed just, and according to the policy of the province; ordered it to be surveyed by the public surveyor, who put the interested party into possession, pursuant to the lieutenant-governor\u2019s order, and delivered a plat-of the. survey to the party, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>order that he might obtain a title in form from the general intendency at New Orleans ; to which tribunal alone appertained, by royal order, the. distributing and granting all classes of lands of the royal domain. The intendent-general had the power to adjudge on the equity of the .claim, and to exercise the sovereign authority, by making the grant, as the king\u2019s deputy.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">After the country changed owners, this government had imposed on it, as the successor of Spain, the duties previously performed by the general intendency, of perfecting titles to concessions made by the lieutenant-governors of St. Louis, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Shortly after the United States came into possession, a tribunal was instituted consisting of a board of commissioners to investigate claims of this description according.to the. laws and usages of Spain, as they existed among the French population in Upper Louisiana, and to report to Congress, such as were by the tribunal deemed well-founded, just, and equitable, and that ought to have been confirmed by the general, intendency, had no change of government taken place; and such as ought not to have been' Confirmed: On these reports coming before Congress, it aeted directly by statute, on such titles as were by the legislature considered well-founded and just claims. \u2022 In all such instances it-acted as the successor of the general intendency, and had the same discretion to confirm; -and the sovereign power to perfect the incipient right; or to reject it, that the intendent-general had: Each exercising sovereign power, in regard to the claim, with full authority to award, or to refuse, a perfect title,</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">As the board of commissioners had no capacity to grant, but only to ascertain facts, and report their opinions; and their powers to examine, not extending to every description of claim, Congress acted in some instances independent of any recommendation : necessarily in cases where the board had no right to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Chouteau\u2019s claim had been presented to the board early in 1809: In July, 1810, the board declared the opinion that this claim ought not to be confirmed; and no action was had on it by Congress on the return of the report of 1810.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">In 1812, Congress confirmed the village claims as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">\u201c That the rights, titles, and claims to town or village.lots, out-lots, common field lots, and commons, in, adjoining, and- belonging' to the several towns -or villages of Portage de Sio\u00fax, St. Charles, St. Louis, &amp;c., which lots have been inhabited, cultivated, or possessed prior to the 20th day of December, 1803, shall be, and the same are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>hereby confirmed to the inhabitants of the respective towns or villages aforesaid, according to their several rights or-right in common thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">A new board was organized according to- an act of 1832, with powers to re-examine tbe claims (with others) deemed unworthy of confirmation by the former board. The new board was of a different opinion from the former in' .regard tc Chouteau\u2019s claim, and in November, 1833, recommended it for confirmation, according to his concession: and it was confirmed by the act of. the 4th of July, 1836; corresponding to a recent survey, made in conformity to the concession'. The whole of the claim is included in'the village common of St. Charles,-as it existed on the 20th day of-December, 1803; and under which the defendant-protected his possession, as, an outstanding title.- The State Circuit Court'in Missouri held the village right the better, and so charged the jury-; which opinion was sustained in the Supreme Court of that state, on their former decisions: especially in the cases of Byrd <em>v. </em>Montgomery, 6 Mo. Rep. 514, and Mackay <em>v. </em>Dillon, 7 Mo. Rep. 10. The last involved a .contest in which title Was claimed by one. party under the, St. Louis common.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">These cases maintain in substance, that such inchoate claims (as that of Chouteau was in 1812, when the community of St.- Charles took its title, previously also inchoate) were not' changed in their character, by the treaty by which Louisiana was acquired;' that the treaty imposed on this government only a political obligation to perfect them': that this obligation, sacred as it may be, in any instance,' cannot be'enforced by any action of the'judicial tribunals: and that the legislation of Congress from 1804, to the present time, has proceeded Upon this construction of -the treaty, ds is manifested Jby the modes adopted to -investigate the claims through boards of commissioners, and then acting on them by legislation. This court held likewise, in the United States <em>v. </em>Wiggins, 14 Peters, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">' We think-this reasoning correct, and necessarily following the nature of the claim as above set -forth; it not having befen perfected by the general intendency before the change of governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">2. That court in substance also held, in the cases cited,' that the federal government, being unable to confirm the same land' to two adverse claimants, must then, to some extent, determine betwee i the conflicting titles. Each claimant depends upon the justice or comity of the present government.; and when the government exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>cises its powers and confirms the land to one, it must necessarily be considered in <em>a-court of law </em>the paramount and <em>better </em>title.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">We think this position also sound, and that it is conclusive against the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s title; and therefore order the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">order.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">This 'cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Supreme Court of''the state of Missouri, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, It is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Supreme Court of the state of Missouri, in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
