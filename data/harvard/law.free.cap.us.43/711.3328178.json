It was described, in the court below, as a penalty to punish delinquency or insure .punctuality; but is really intended to mitigate the rigour of law against .a drawer. \u2022. Re-exchange would often be ruinous,- and particularly with the colonies.' The explanation of re-exchange is given in Story on Bills, 40.1. The holder has a right to draw for the amount of the bill, and must do it in the same way that the bill came. It is often circuitous. The general course of .exchange is often so between two countries, and sometimes the circuity is casual.

Thus full effect is given to the whole act. The argument on the other, side requires an interpolation of the words \u201ctime of protest.\u201d By providing for the case of an endorser who has paid damages, the statute intends an action on the bill; but it does not restrain an endorser who has become holder without paying damages, because the whole statute is enlarging. In this'case, the ownership was resumed at the time of protest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-7\">An endorser who' phid the bill could not, without the statute, recover any thing except the amount of the bill and' the damages; but the statute gives him interest also. It is, therefore, an enabling statute. At the time of the act it was doubtful what an' endorser could recover; 2 Durnf. and East, 100. Two years after the Maryland act says there had been doubt.

That the relations existing between the parties, and understood by them, were such as to exclude the idea of damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-16\">. 1. By the general law-merchant, the holder of a protested bill is entitled to reimbursement or indemnity, the standard of which is . interest, expenses, and re-exchange.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-17\">In many places, by statute or usage, damages are allowed, differing in amount; and. given, in some cases, in lieu of re-exchange, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>costs, and interest. The effect is, to dispense with proof of all these \u2022things and facilitate adjustment. Sometimes a penalty is superadded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-5\">The statute says the holder shall receive as much money as will purchase a new bill. This is just the definition of re-exchange. Story on Bills, sect. 400. The Maryland bar was celebrated at the time when this statute was passed; and no doubt it was carefully prepared. The definition of re-exchange is \u201c the purchase of a bill on the country where the drawer of4he protested bill lives.\u201d The statute adopts this in effect,- because, although ^ directs the. new bill to be purchased in the country where the drawer of the old bill lives, instead of the country upon which the old bill was drawn, yet the same amount of money'would have to be paid, in both cases; The statute then provides for re-rexchange, for costs, and for interest. But' these together constitute indemnity. What is the fifteen per cent, which is then added ? It must be a penalty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-6\">' The old statutes of Maryland which have been read show this. For example, the act of 1704 says there shall not be .allowed more than twenty per cent; more than the principal sum and costs. The act of 1708 says ten per cent, more than the sum and costs.' Under these statutes, the amount-of damages was required to be proved, because it was left \u00fcncertain. The act of -1785 adopts a new principle, by providing indemnity and fifteen per cent, damages. The amount of damages and the rules being thus fixed, a party who claims the one must bring himself within the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b732-7\">Rothschild was the. holder of the bill. It was- in his possession by regular endorsement. Suppose he had. omitted to- c.ause it to be protested. ' He could have recovered damages from nobody, because he would not- have brought himself within the terms of the act. And the endorser must bring himself within its operation algo; How? By paying the damages to the holder or some subsequent endorser, to whom he was responsible. The statute provides damages for this class of endorsers only. But the bank, having paid no damages, does not belong to this class, and is therefore not within the statut\u00e9 at all. At the time of protest, it is clear that the bank was not the \u201c owner or holder\u201d of the bill; nor was it at any. time afterwards within the protected class of endorsers. The reason of the distinction is manifest. An endorser who had parted with the bill and received value for it was put to no inconvenience by the protest, and therefore had no claim upon the drawer for damages. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>,His claim only began, in reason, when h'e-was himself- called upon to pay damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b733-5\">It is said by the other side, that the \u201c owner or holder\u201d means also an endorser. But'the act does not say \u201c those who may become entitled to the bill,\u201d but uses language indicating existing ownership ; existing at the time of protest. The second clause of. the act says, \u201c and if any endorser of such bill shall pay to the holder, &amp;c., making a clear distinction between the two classes of persons. How then can they be confounded, and an endorser be allowed to claim as a holder ? To sustain the construction of. the other- side, the \u2022word \u201c endorser\u201d must be interpolated in the first' clause. That the OAvnership must exist at the time of protest is clear, from the language of the statute: \u201c That upon all bills of exchange hereafter \u2019 drawn in this state on any person, corporation-, company, or society, in any for\u00e9ign country .and regularly protested, .the owner or holder of such bill,\u201d <em>See. Such </em>bill; what bill ? One that is regularly protested. ' The ownership is placed in juxtaposition-with thedescription. He must have been the owner or holder of the bill when it underwent this ceremony..</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b733-6\">As to endorsers, the statute introduces.no new principle. By the general law-merchant, no endorser can receive damages from the drawer unless he has himself paid them. 3 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, 115; 3 Washington\u2019s Rep. 310.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b733-7\">It has been said that the object of the second clause was. to provide a new remedy for an endorser. But was it? What were his rights before ? If. Jaudon had been sued in London on this bill, h\u00e9 would harm been liable by the English law,- for the bank was as much liable for damages as the drawer.. If the bank had paid all this, the drawer\u2019would have been liable, independently ,of the statute, because the drawer would have to replace the bill and expenses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b733-8\">The statute, therefore, gives the endorser no new remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b733-9\">The bank-Avas an endorser at the time, of protest, and mus\u00ed remain so; it cannot shift its position and become a holder. The bill was .paid for the honour of an endorser.after protest; the only effect of which is to make the payer an endorsee- of the bill, and protect the endorser, for whose credit it is taken-up, from damages. 1 Espinasse Rep. 113.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b733-10\">2.

The act of 1785 jonly applies to general bills.

The correspondence shows that the bank knew that the government was acting merely as an agent for the claimants-under the French treaty; that it -was but'a trustee.

The endorser might be subject to a different rule, having endorsed the bill in Pennsylvania, where the damages are twenty per cent. How the matter would have stood, if the bank had been compelled to pay the twenty per cent., it is not material to inquire.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b734-12\">What is the law of Maryland ? There are six acts of .Assembly prior to the act of 1785, on the subject of damages. They all have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>one title, and they are .all. restrictive in their terms, that is to say, they restrain or limit the. amount of damages by negative words.' ' The first act,, made between 1676 and 1678, was nearly,-if not exactly the form of expression which is followed in the five subsequent acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-5\">The act of 1785 is of the same character. They are <em>in pari materia. </em>Besides, the act of 1785 has.the satne title, and being made t\u00f3 repeal and supply the prior acts, it must have the same purpose</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOy\">\u25a0 These acts assume, and conclusively show, that there was aright to damages before, which-they restrain, and fix at a certain per centage. This per eentage is not damages given; they existed before. The acts \u25a0 only furnish a rule for computing them. But they are still damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-6\">He then argued</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-7\">1. That damages wer\u00e9 payable by the law-merchant, in all cases of dishonoured foreign hills of exchange.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-8\">2. That these damages were payable by contract, as a part of the contract, and'were capable of being ascertained, but only in each particular case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-9\"><em>3. </em>That they have been fixed in some places and trades by usage, and in others by law, but they are still due by contract, and in no respect different from the damages payable by the general law-merchant, except that a rule is established for computing or \u201c ascertaining\u201d them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-10\">1. He referred generally to the books and cases already cited, but especially to Judge,Story\u2019s work on bills of exchange \u2014 466,467, where the subject is fully explained. The damages are ascertained by the rate of re-exchange. What that is,, and how it may operate, we well know; De Tastet <em>v. </em>Baring, 11 East, 265; Mellish <em>v. </em>Simeon, 2 H. Bl. 378, where the damages were-fifty per cent; Pollard <em>v. </em>Herries, 3 Bos. and Pul. 335, where they were upwards of two hundred per cent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-11\">It is necessary to understand wh<em>at </em>re-exchange\u201d means. -It is the right to redraw, at the place where the bill is payable, upon the place where the bill is drawn, for such a sum as will pay the amount on the face of the bill, with, costs and expenses, at the place, where payable. The Jaw is clearly laid down by Judge Story, in 3 Kent\u2019s Com., 115, and in Chitty. It is the right to redraw, and is exemplified in the two cases just cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-12\">We must distinguish between \u201cexchange\u201d and \u201cre-qxchange.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>The act of 1785 \u2014 framed with remarkable accuracy and fullness of knowledge \u2014 itself makes the distinction, for it gives the exchange, and then adds the fifteen per cent. The object is, to pay the bill at the time and place where payable, according to the terms of the contract. . Messrs. Hottinguer, for example, would have had a right, by the law-merchant, to draw upon the United States, or upon the Bank of the United States, for as much money as would pay them in Paris the amount of the bill. The payment in Paris, therefore, at the time, included the damages. And so, the payment by the Bank of the United States to Messrs. Hottinguer included the.damages.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b736-5\">2. They were payable by contract and capable of being ascertained. They were, in no sense a penalty. They were a recompense, an equitable equivalent, or more exactly, a fulfilment Of the contract, given by the law-merchant, which does not deal in penalties, but looks to equity and substantial justice. This law of damages is founded in the plain equity of. the contract, and has nothing in it that is vindictive or penal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b736-6\">Still less, could they be said to be unliquidated. Where there was an established fate of re-e'xchange, the price of the day furnished the rule. The law does not require that there should be an actual redrawing. There is an immediate right to redraw, and whether the holder redraw or not, he is entitled to the amount. De Tastet <em>v. </em>Baring. Where there is no such rate established, or it is inter-, rupted or disturbed, no matter how, resort may be had to circuitous drawing, and the actual cost settles.it, at the expense \u00f3f the party liable on the bill. Bangor Bank <em>v. </em>Hook, 5 Greenl. 174; Chitty, 670. These damages are part and parcel of the bill, though contingent, as is also the liability of the drawer and endorser. They are recovered in an action on the bill, as the principal is.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b736-7\">The. payment,- at the time and place where , the bill is payable, therefore, includes the damages. Put the case of-a party on the bill, thus paying after protest \u2014 he actually pays the damages. They are included jn what he pays. In other words, he pays exactly the same as'if he had.been redrawn upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b736-8\">3. In lieu of the right to redraw, usage has in some places fixed a rate of re-exchange or damages, and law in others. Where not so fixed, they remain as they were before^ But neither the law nor the usage professes to give the damages. They were payable by the contract, according to the law-merchant. Neither does the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>or usage, in any case, intend to take them away. They have in vie.w to avoid the fluctuations of exchange, (Story on Bills, 480;) to mitigate the occasional rigour of the law-merchant. Chitty, 665. The acts of the Maryland legislature had chiefly in view this latter object. It would seem that the r\u00fcle of the law-merchant had proved very burdensome, which will easily be understood when we consider thai there never has been, and is noi now,' any regular re-exchange between England or the continent of Europe and -the United Slates, and, therefore, recourse was necessary to costly expedients. They have all one title, <em>\u201c </em>an act ascertaining what damages shall be allowed on protested bills of exchange.\u201d The usage, in some instances, has passed into law. Neither the usage nor the law altered the nature-of the contract, that is, made it less a contract, as to its force or its comprehension. They had one single obj\u2019ect only, and that for the benefit of .the party liable. The damages are still due by contract; more precisely than before, because the rate is fixed and known, and therefore can be stipulated. But they rest upon the same equitable contract.' Before, it was an undefined, now a fixed liability \u2014 that is, the amount is -fixed, where there was alre.ady a liability \u2014 the redrawing is fifteen per cent., neither more nor less, since 1785. By the prior acts,\u2019it was twenty per cent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-5\">No such act can be presumed to mean any more. The remedy is applied to a given mischief, and the acts all indicate plainly what that mischief was. It was- the same that has led elsewhere to usages and laws,, that is, to substitute a fixed rate of damages for an uncertain one, but by no means to take away-the right where it previously existed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-6\">Proceeding, then, more particularly to examine the act of 1785, under the view thus taken of k, he maintained,</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-7\">1. That the Bank of th\u00e9 United States was the \u201c.owner or holder of such bill,\u201d and \u201c entitled to the same,\u201d within the terms and meaning of the first part of the first section of the act of 1785.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-8\">2. That the Bank of -the United States had actually paid the damages, and was within the words of the second part of the section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-9\">1. There is a radical error,, as already intimated, in supposing the act gives the damages \u2014 that there would be none without it. This leads to error in the whole construction, by taking a wrong departure. The act leaves the right as found, but limits and fixes the amount. It professes to do nothing more. To this intent, it is to be liberally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>at least fairly, construed. It must be reconciled, if necessary, with the law-merchant. It must not be brought into conflict with that law, by interpretation out of its own words and, declared -intention. His position was simply this \u2014 whoever by the law of the contract was entitled to.damages, is entitled still; and the damages are fifteen per cent. Such is the exact effect of a usage. Grimshaw <em>v. </em>Bender, 5 Mass. 157, 161, 162; The right to damages attaches upon the protest of t]ie bill. It is no more than this, to compel the drawer to pay the bill/ at the time and place stipulated. In favour of whom does it attach ? Why of the holder. Of what holder? Of any holder. For there always must be a holder, and there can be but one at a time, though there may be several persons uhited to make that one. The drawer is not to be put to the risk.of paying twice.. Therefore, the claim must be made by one who has the possession, with right, so as to be able to give up the bill, with a full and final discharge. The Bank of the United States was the holder, to jthis full intent. It held the bill, with right, ready to hand it-over and give an effectual release. -What more could be requisite to make it a holder?</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b738-4\">Now let us look at the act of Assembly, It uses the words in the most general sense. It does' not restrict them to the holder at the time of the protest, nor t\u00f3 any particular time; It could not so mean. The holder has a transferable right; not negotiable in the broadest meanirig'of that \u00abword, because, being overdue, which is notice, the assignee takes the bill, subject to the equities between the parties. In other respects it is fiegoti\u00e1ble. The holder may transfer it, as fully as he holds it,; and his transferee becomes the holder,, with all .his rights, including the right to damages. If this be not so, the damages would- be lost by.th\u00e9 transfer, and' the first holder would be the loser, as he would not be paid for the damages, if they could not be transferred, which would be unreasonable and unjust; or else, we should be obliged to consider this as a case notprovided for by the act, and turn over the derivative holder to the law-merchant for. his rate of damages. But it is clear that the act meant to provide for every case. It applies, therefore, to every holder, and surely the Bank of the United States was a holder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b738-5\">The right of the bank, however, as holder, is even stronger than has yet been stated, and in point of law sufficient to satisfy any construction of the words, as a moment\u2019s attention to. the facts will show.</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>The bank was the original holder of the bill, by purchase from the United States. It endorsed the bill to Barings, arid they endorsed it to Rothschild. The bill was dishonoured:,- and protested for nonpayment. Hottinguer and Co., of Paris, strangers to the bill, paid it <em>supra protest, </em>for the honour of' the Bank of the United States, the endorser. By this payment, Hottinguer and Co. became the holders, were substituted for the holders, with all -their rights against the drawer and the first endorser. This is fully settled in France, in England, and in the United States, as may be seen by reference to Pothier, Pardessus, Beawes, Chitty, Story, and every book that treats upon the subject. The. only restriction was, that as they paid for the honour of the first endorser, they could make no claim -upon the subsequent parties on the bill. They became the holders, at the time of the protest, with full rights - against the United States, and the Bank of the United States. These rights were, to redraw, that is, to claim damages, and -to transfer their rights as holder. In this-state of things, Hottinguers paid themselves, in Paris, the full arriount, out of money of the Bank of the United States then in their hands. The bank ratified the payment \u2014 that is, the bank paid it to the holders, and the holders (Hottinguers) handed the bill, with all their rights, to the bank. The bank thus became the holder, and was remitted to its former character and rights. Lutw. 896,899; 7 Term R. 570. They were the holders when the bill returned. They were holders, by relation, to the time of the_ protest. They became the holders, in law, at the time of the protest. They had' therefore a right to redraw \u2014 that is, a right to damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANW\">The material fact here is, that the bank paid the full amount in Paris of what was due there. They actually, really, and legally paid the dairiages, for to pay the bill at the place where payable, after protest, is to pay the damages. It gives th\u00e9 .right to recover damages. Suppose the case of circuitous redrawing. Each holder in succession becomes entitled. Mellish <em>v. </em>Simeon. The cases are to every intent the same; if there be a usage, that fixes the amount: and so, if there be a law. To redraw from Paris an Maryland is fifteen per cent. This, the Bank of the United Statas have, therefore, paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b739-5\">2. The Bank of the United States had actually paid the damages, and so was within the words of the second part of the first section of the act of 1-785.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b739-6\">It is proper here to notice the objection made on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>United States, that the Bank of the United States was an endorser, and, therefore, could not recover damages, \u00a3\u00a3 unless it had paid them or was liable td pay them.\u201d This is urged, upon the authority of Chancellor Kent. 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 115. That learned author refers, for his support, only to the case of Kingston <em>v. </em>Wilson, 4 W. C. C. R. 310. He has been misled by the note at the beginning of the report, where from an error of the press, or some other cause, the point is stated as he has quoted it. But no such question arose in that case, and none such was decided. One of the claims thfere made was by the drawer of a bill of exchange upon the drawee, for not accepting his bill, and the learned judge who th\u00e9n presided in that court (Judge Washington) said, that in an action by the drawer against the drawee, he could not recover damages, unless he had paid them or was liable to pay them. See 4 W. C. C. R. 316. What the law would be in such a case it is ndt now material to inquire.</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b740-5\">But waiving that'question, and supposing (if it be possible) the bank not to have been a holder, how will the matter stand ?

This is not disputed, and cannot be disputed. Had the'bank not paid the damages ? i\u00a3 The law does not insist upon an actual redrawing,\u201d &amp;c. 3 Kent, 115. Nor is the claim for re-exchange or damages confined to bills of exchange. 3 Bos. &amp; Pul. 335; Pollard <em>v. </em>Herries, Chitty, 668. It is the substance which is regarded. Apd so it is in the Maryland act of 1785. The words of the act apply exactly. It does not require that the damages shall be paid <em>eo nomine, </em>but th\u00e9 \u201c value\u201d of the same paid to the party \u00a3\u00a3 entitled\u201d to the same, as Hottinguer and Co. undoubtedly were here. What was the \u00a3\u00a3 value\u201d of the same ? Precisely the amount on the face of the bill, in Paris, at th\u00e9 time. That is1 exactly what they had a right to redraw for. There is nothing artificial or technical in the law-merchant. Chitty, 667. Its principles and its methods are those of common sense and justice applied to the transactions of men. The confusion in this case has arisen from not distinguishing, as the law-metchant does, between paying here and paying aoroad. Paying abroad includes the damages, which the act\u2018of Assembly fixes at fifteen per cent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>In every point of view, then, the bank has a clear right to the damages. If the United States were authorized to draw, and the gov\u00e9rnment of France bound to accept, the United States will have their recourse over against France for the damages, after paying the bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b741-5\">Some minpr objections have been made, not properly open upon this record, which may be disposed of in a few words; and a question-has been suggested, entitled to attention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b741-6\">1. It is said this is not a bill within the act, nor in a legal and commercial sense, being drawn on a particular fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b741-7\">This subject, of what is not a negotiable bill, .is treated fully, and with reference to the authorities, by Mr. Chitty, pages 157, 158, and by Judge Story in section 40, page 54. The exceptions are, when there is a condition or contingency ; here,'there was neither condition nor contingency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b741-8\">It has been settled too by the legislative authority. The act of Congress of 3 March, 1837, 4 Story\u2019s Laws, 2556, styles it <em>\u201c </em>the bill of exchange.\u201d.</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b741-9\">Again, it calls itself a \"bill of exchange;\u201d has always been termed a <em>\u201c </em>bill of exchange;\u201d went forth to the world, and was negotiated as such; has been so treated in all the correspondence; was protested as a bill of exchange, and claimed as such in the suit. It is too late in -the day to question its character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b741-10\">The use if was employed for, to remit or transfer funds, does not make it the iess a bill of exchange. 5-Wheat. 288. This is,-and always has been the appropriate purpose of bills of exchange, whether they were originally invented by the Jews of Lombardy, or, as Rank\u00e9 supposes, in his History of the Popes-of the 16th century, to collect'the revenue in the Papal States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b741-11\">2. The United States is a sovereign, not affected bypenalties in an act of the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b741-12\">If confined to penalties, the position is of no consequence here, the question not being of penalties. If it be extended to damages, it is authoritatively answered by the United States <em>v. </em>Bank of Metropolis, 15 Peters, 377, 392. See also, 3 Marsh. 184.</p>\n<p data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b741-13\">Upon what principle can it be cont\u00e9nded that a contract of the United States is different from that of an individual ? A bill of exchange is a contract well understood, importing definite legal responsibilities. To what extent is it that the difference is to apply ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Will the United States be barred from claiming, as well as exempted from paying damages ? They have always insisted upon, and received them, where they were the holders of protested'bills. Such a one-sided doctrine would be intolerable. And.what would become of the credit of the United States ? and the facilities they require in the receipt and disbursement of their revenue, if their bills were thus,, as it were, outlawed ? Such a doctrine has no countenance in any decision of this court, and it is quite safe to predict it never will have.</p>\n<p data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b742-5\">3. The relation between the parties \u2014 What is it ? That of seller and buyer. The United States came into the market with a bill to sell. The Bank of the United States bought it. Nothing could be more simple. There is no mystification in this. See Record, 16, 17, 18, 19. The money being paid into the bank makes no difference. That was agreed, (Record, p. 19;) and without agreement was a thing of course, for the bank was the treasury, and when the money was so placed, it was immediately at the disposition of the government as its own.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b742-6\">But further, the United States .have admitted their liability for principal, interest, protest, and expenses, according to the bill of exchange. If not a bill of exchange, why pay for protest ? Why a protest or expenses, if not a bill of exchange ? They only refuse to pay the damages, which is entirely arbitrary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b742-7\">If it had not been a bill of. exchange, it would still be a contract to pay a certain sum of money in Paris, on a given day. \u2022 If broken, what would be the measure of damages ? Not less, certainly, than upon a bill of exchange. Chitty, 668; Pollard <em>v. </em>Herries, 3 Bos. &amp; Pul. 335.</p>\n<p data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b742-8\">The objections of the United States' are thus disposed of. ' It is, in truth,, a. very plain case,, now that it has been deliberately examined. The record and the history of the cause show that the principal. point was suddenly started in the Circuit Court, and scarcely \u00e1t all discussed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b742-9\">The question suggested, and all that remains to be considered is, what would be the effect of the payment being prohibited by the law of France ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b742-10\">The fact is, that\" the payment was not prohibited by law; but thereVfas.no appropriation by law for the payment.\u2019 See Protest, Record, 22,26. \u2018 The treaty was a binding contract between the high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>contracting parties from the exchange of ratifications; and by that treaty, the money was due and ought'to have been paid. It was impossible to prohibit the payment by a law of France, without assuming the grave responsibility of a wilful violation of the treaty, which is not to be presumed. A mere failure to supply the means, at the time appointed, was not of so serious a character. It might admit of explanation. But still it was a failure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b743-5\">But neither the one nor the other, nor a prohibition in every respect lawful, as being clearly within the rightful authority of the legislature, could vary the rights of the parties to this bill. This was directly and deliberately decided in Mellish <em>v. </em>Simeon, 2 H. Bl. 378, 379, and in effect decided, also, in Pollard <em>v. </em>Herries, 3 Bos. &amp; Pul. 335. The reasons are there fully set forth.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b743-6\">Mr. Justice McLEAN</author>\n<p id=\"AILy\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">A writ of error brings this case before the court, from the Circuit Court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">On the 7th' of February, 1833, the secretary' of the treasury of the United States drew the. following bill on the minister and secretary of state for the department of finance of the French government:</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">\u201c Sir: \u2014 I have the'honour to request that at the sight- of this my first bill of exchange (the second and third -of the same tenor and date unpaid) you will be pleased to pay to the order of Samuel Jaudon, cashier of the Bank of the United States, the sum of 4,856,666 francs and 66 centimes; which includes the sum of $3,916,666 66, being the amount of the first instalment to be paid to the United States under the convention concluded between the United States and France, on the 4th of July, \u00cd831, (after deducting the amount of the first inst\u00e1lment to be reserved to France under the said convention,) and the additional sum of 940,000 francs, being one year\u2019s interest at four per cent, on all the instalments payable to the United States, from the day of the exchange of the ratification to the 2d of February, 1833.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">This bill was purchased by the bank, and endorsed by it to Messrs. Baring, Brothers &amp; Co., of London, and by them for value was endorsed, pay the order of N. M. Rothschild, Esq.; and by him it was directed to be paid to Messieurs De Rothschild, Brothers, or order, of Paris, for value in account,</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>This bil) on presentation not being paid, was protested, and was afterwards taken up on account of the first endorser by Hottinguer &amp; Co., who also paid the costs, &amp;c., and charged the whole sum to the Bank of the United States. Notice of the non-payment of this bill was given, in due time, to the drawer; and also that the bank claimed of the government interest, costs, and fifteen per cent, damages on the bill. The government accounted to and paid the bank the principal of the bill and the costs, but refused to pay the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Sometime after the protest, a dividend on the stock held by the United States having been declared by the bank, it- retained a part of the dividend to cover the above damages. A suit being brought against the bank, by the government, to recover the dividend thus withheld, the bank set up as an offset the fifteen per cent, damages claimed on the aboye bill</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">On. the trial, the court held, and so instructed the jury, that the action was maintainable. That the set-off or credit claimed by the defendants was governed by the statute of Maryland. That - if the bank had been the holder of the bill, at the time of the protest,, it would, under the statute, be entitled to the damages claimed; but that it must be viewed as endorser, and consequently could not recover such dainages, unless upon proof that they had been actually paid by the bank. To this charge the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted, and this brings before the court the questions for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Before we consider the rulings of the court excepted to, it may not be improper to notice the structure of the bill, which has been much commented on by the counsel; though not having been excepted to by the government, it is not a matter for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">It is supposed not to be a bill of exchange, as it was drawn payable out of a particular fund. This seems not to be the character of the bill. It was drawn for a certain sum, and the drawer then states on what account such sum was due from the French government. But there was no restriction as to what moneys or appropriation out of which the bill should be paid. This could in no sense restrain the negotiability of the instrument. It has the frame, character, and effect,- of a bill of exchange. It was so called and treated by the secretary of the treasury who drew it; by his successor who had some correspondence in regard to it; by the attorney-general to whom it was submitted for his-opinion, by Congress ; and by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>eminent bankers in Europe through whom it was negotiated and paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">That the United Slates can sustain an action against the bank, to recover a dividend declared in their favour, is undoubted. This seems to have been doubted by the counsel for the bank in the Circuit Court, but the objection has been abandoned in this court. Nor can there be any question of the right of the bank to set up, in this case, by way of offset, the damages in controversy, if the claim for damages be sustainable. This right is not contested by the attorney-general.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The main point in the case depends upon the construction of the Maryland statute, which applies to this district. It is singular that this statute, which was enacted in 1795, in reg\u00e1rd to the question now before us, has never been construed by the local courts. And the same may be said of other and prior statutes of Maryland, containing similar provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The first section of the act provides, <em>\u201c </em>that upon all bills of exchange hereafter drawn in this state, on any person, corporation, company, or society, in any foreign country, and regularly protested, the owner or holder of such bill, or the person or persons, company, society, or corporation, entitled to the same, shall have a right to receive and recover so much current money as will purchase a good bill of exchange of the same time of payment, and upon the same place, at the current exchange of such bills, and also fifteen per cent, damages upon the value of the principal sum mentioned in such bill, and costs of protest, together with legal interest upon the value of the principal sum mentioned in such bill from the time of protest, until the principal and damages are paid and satisfied: and if any endorser of such bill shall pay to the holder, or the person or persons, company, society, or corporation, entitled to the same, the value of the principal, and the damages and interest as aforesaid, such endorser shall have a right to receive and recover the sum paid, with legal interest upon the same, from the drawer, or any other person or persons, company, society, or corporation, liable to \u25a0 such endorser upon such bill of exchange.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">That the holder of a foreign bill, or other person entitled to it, may recover, under this statute, from the drawer, in case of protest, a sum that will purchase a similar bill of the same amount, together with fifteen per cent, damages on the principal sum, is admitted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>But it is insisted that the bank paid the bill as endorser, and that as there is no proof that it paid the fifteen per cent, damages, they are not recoverable under the statute: The first part of the section gives to the .holder of a protested bill its value at the place drawn, the fifteen per cent, damages, and interest upon the value of the principal sum. The latter part of the section gives to the endorser, who has paid to. the holder the value- of the principal, the damages and interest on the entire sum' paid, with legal interest. So that while the holder of the bill recovers only interest upon the principal sum, the endorser is entitled to interest on the yrhole sum paid by him. And to give interest on this sum seems to have been the object pf the latter clause of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Had the bank retained the bill until its presentation and protest, there could be no question of its right, as holder, to the damages claimed. It endorsed the bill to Baring, Brothers and Co., and they to Rothschild, who endorsed it to De Rothschild and Brothers. These last were the holders, and had not the bill been paid, supra <em>protest, </em>on account of the bank, as first endorser, they would have been entitled to the damages. Hottinguer and Co., having paid the bill for-the honour of the bank, became the holders, and could recover the damages from it or the drawer. But they being the depositories of the bank, charged it with the amount they paid, by which the bank was remitted to its original character as payee and holder of the bill. In this light the bank was viewed and treated by the government, for it paid not only the principal sum and interest to the bank, but also the costs of protest and other expenses chargeable under the laws of France. But the damages allowed by the statute were refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">It has been intimated that these damages must be considered as a penalty, and' not as a part of the bill. This is a mistaken view of the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Had th.ere been no statute, the bank, as the holder of the bill, would have been equally entitled to damages. They would have been claimed on a different principle, and might have been of a greater or less amount according to circumstances. The origin and character of a bill of exchange are found in the law-merchant : that law which pervades the commercial world, and which, though founded on usage, has become as fixed and definite as any. other branch of the' law. Under this law the drawer of a bill in this country payable in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>a foreign country is liable, should such bill be protested, not only for the costs of protest and other incidental charges, but also to re-exchange on- the-bill. The exchahge is sometimes direct, at other .times circuitous, depending in some degree upon the commercial intercourse between the countries where the bill is drawn, and where it is made payable. . Between this country and France, the exchange is often, if not generally, by the way of London.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Thq bill under consideration having been protested at Paris for non-payment, the holder under the general commercial law was entitled to a bill drawn at that place, payable in this city, for sucjr sum as would pay the original bill at Paris, including costs of protest and other legal charges. \u2022 This is re-exchange, and it varies, as must be seen, with the fluctuations of commercial <em>intercourse, </em>influenced somewhat by local circumstances and the general state of the money market. In some instances, owing to peculiar circumstances, re-exchange has been found to exceed forty or even fifty per cent. To avoid so ruinous a charge, .-so uncertain a rule of damages, and one so difficult to establish by evidence, the state of Maryland, and almost all the other states of the Union, have fixed, by legislation, a certain amount of damages on protested foreign bills, in lieu of re-exchange. Experience has shown that this is a judicious regulation. It relieves the parties to the bill from great, uncertainty, and promotes punctuality by showing the drawer what damages he must pay on the dishonour of his bill. Fifteen per cent, on the principal sum, which the statute adopts, may be greater than the actual re-exchange \u2022 in the present case. But, whether this be so or not is not open for inquiry. It is believed that if this per cent, excluded the re-exchange, at the time this bill was protested, there are many other cases in which it would fall short of that change. The statute has,.probably, fixed an amount which, would be an average charge for re-exchange. This being the basis of the act, the damages cannot be considered as a penalty. The damages given -by .the statute are as much a part of the contract as the interest. On this point there is believed to be no difference of opinion among enlightened courts or commercial men.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The doctrine of re-\u00e9xchange is founded upon equitable principles. A bill is drawn in this country, payable at Paris, in France. The payee gives.a.premium for it under the expectation of receiving the amount at. the tim\u00e9 and place where the bill is made payable. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>protested for non-payment. Now the payee and holder is entitled to the amount of the bill in Paris. The same- sum paid in this country, including costs of protest and other charges, is not an indemnity. The holder can only be remunerated by paying to him, at Paris, the principal, with costs and charges; or by paying to him in this country those sums, together with the difference in value betweeh the whole sum at Paris, and the same amount in this country. And this difference in value is ascertained by the premium on a bill drawn in Paris and payable in this country, which should sell at Paris for the sum claimed. The statute of Maryland then is founded on equitable considerations, although the rule of damages may be considered arbitrary, as it does not yield to circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In this case the bank purch\u00e1Sed the bill from the government and paid for it. It was sold and transferred by the bank: But the bill not being paid to the holder, the bank paid the amount of it, including the costs of protest and other charges, to Hottinguer and Co., at Paris, who had taken it up <em>supra protest, </em>for the honour of the first endorser. The bank, in this manner, came again into possession of the bill, the endorsements, in effect, being stricken- out. In a commercial and legal-sense, then, the bank is the holder of- the bill, and has the same claim for damages as if it had never been endorsed. Had the government been suable by the bank, it must have declared and recovered as payee and holder, and not as endorser of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">No objection is taken, in the bill of exceptions, as to the liability of the government to damages, on a protested bill of exchange drawn by it, the same as an individual. No such question, therefore, arises in this case. As the holder of a protested bill, the government exacts damages; it would seem to be equitable, therefore, that as drawer under like circumstances, it should pay them.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Upon the whole, we think, that in view of the circumstances of this case, the bank is entitled to the fifteen per cent, damages, under the Maryland statute, and that, consequently, the instructions of the Circuit Court were erroneous. The judgment of that court is, therefore, reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court, and a <em>venire de novo </em>is awarded, <em>See.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b748-9\">Mr. Justice CATRON.</author>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">By the instructions given by the Circuit Court, the controversy is made to turn on the construction of the statute of Maryland; nor'does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>the record raise any qu\u00e9stion. on the transaction growing out of the fact,, that it was one between,governments, to obtain a sum of money due from the one to the other; in which the corporation' acted as an' instrument and agent, in a form suggested by itself, to obtain .the money. For instance: if it be true, that the United States, in fact, received no money from the bank for the bill, it not having been charged to the b\u00e1nk; this being found, with the additional fact, that the parties intended to await the event ofpayment, or refusal, on the. part of France, and let the bank hold and .use the money awaiting-the event;-then the question-on the equity of the case may arise. But the jury did not pass on any sifch facts, the instruction given \u25a0rendering the -inquiry .unnecessary; and so-it cut qff every other question the plaintiff might have raised in opposition to -the offset claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The foregoing is given merely, as an instance,' to show . that, no qu\u00e9stion arises on the record,\u2019 but- on the construction, of the act of 1785.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The statute provides for two elasses of cases: 1st, \u201c the owner or holder of the protested bill, or the person or-persons,, company, society, or-corporation entitled to the same,;\u201d' and 2dly., \u201cany endorser of the bill who should pay to the holder, or the person or.persons, company, society, or corporation-entitled! to the same, the -value of the principal, and the damages arid interest.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In the first class, the \u201c owner or holder,\u201d &amp;c., shall haye a right to receive and recover sq much current money as will purchase a good bill of exchange of the-same time of payment, and. upon the same place, at-the current exchange of such bills, and also fifteen per cent, daihages upon the value of the principal-sum mentioned in such bill, andcosts of .protest, together with lega] interest upon the value of the principal sum mentioned iri such bill, from the time of protest, until the principal and damages are paid and- satisfied;</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">In the second class, the endorser who has paid the principal, damages, and interest, shall have a right to receive arid recover the sum paid, with legal interest upon the same, -from the drawer or any other person or persons, company, society, or corporation, liable to such endorser upon such bill ofexchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">It is not necessary to inquire- whether this statute includes all possible cases, and if it does not, by what law the cases so unprovided for wquld be governed, because the bank is seeking, in this instance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>to-bring itself within the statute; unless it does so, the precise claim of fifteen per cent, cannot be sustained. The charge of the' court below was twofold.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">1. That the case was governed by the law of Maryland, and</p>\n<p id=\"Ach\"><em>2. </em>Construing that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The bill of exceptions includes both points; but this court has proceeded to examine and decide the cause on the second only, passing over the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The bank must then bring itself within one of the two classes above described; let us examine them in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Was the bank at the time when its present rights accrued, the \u201c owner or holder of the bill.\u201d I say at the time its present rights accrued, because this general proposition includes the rights acquired at the time of protest, or acquired subsequently \u2014 each of which branches must be separately examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">The bill was endorsed to Messrs. Baring, Brothers and Co., of London, on some day which the record does not state: that it was sold to the Barings, and not sent over for collection, is not controverted, nor open to question.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">It was then passed, by endorsement to- N. M. Rothschild, and from him to the Messrs. Rothschild in Paris, in whose possession it is found on the day that it became due. It was at their request that a demand was made, by the notary, for payment, and upon refusal, that the bill was protested. So far, they appear to have, been, and no doubt were, both the \u201c owners and holders of the bill,\u201d and the only \u201cpersons entitled to the same'at the time of the protest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AId\">Hottinguer and Go. intervened immediately after protest, and paid the bill for the honour, of the bank. What rights were then acquired ?</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">It will not be necessary to examine and decide whether they acquired a right to fifteen'per cent, damages or not; or to comment upon the want of harmony in the law, if it were to allow to a volunteer, who had no right \u00a1to .complain of anybody, the same damages which it gives to a disappointed and suffering party expressly because he has been put to great inconvenience and to hazard of discredit, by the omission of the drawer to provide the necessary funds to meet the bill. The books and cases all recognise the right of such a volunteer to principal, interest, and costs. If Hottinguer and Co. were, the parties to this suit; it would become necessary to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>amine the question of their claim to damages; but we are now investigating the rights of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Granting that the Messrs. Rothschild, immediately upon protest, became vested with the right, under the statute, to \u201c receive and recover\u201d from the drawer fifteen per cent.-damages in addition to the other sum pointed out in the law; and granting also, for the sake of the argument, that all these rights passed to M. Hottinguer, with the' delivery of the bill, it is clear that he was vested with a right\" that he could exercise or not at his pleasure. If he forbore to claim the damages,' he mutilated the rights attached to the bill, supposing all the rights of the parties to be transferred with the bill from one to another. His right to relinquish. the damages cannot well be disputed. It was -property, and could be given away. It is not our province to inquire into his reasons; we can' deal only with facts. It appears from the record, that- instead of charging fifteen per cent, damages, he' contented himself with charging a commission of one-half per cent., amounting to 24,283 francs and 33 centimes; less than 5000 dollars. This commission may have been paid to him by the bank, and it appears from a report from the first auditor\u2019s office, dated July 29,. 1837, that this Commission would be paid by the United States to the bank upon presentation of a proper voucher.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">There is nothing in the record to show that Hottinguer and Co., even up to this time, sanction this claim of fifteen per cent., or that the bank intends to pay it oyer to Hottinguer and Go., if it shall succeed in compelling the United States to pay it. On the contrary, tire claim of the bank appears to be prosecuted for its own -benefit; and the result will be that the bank, if it succeeds in this suit, will pay to Hottinguer- and Co. less than $5000, and keep $165,000 for itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">At' the time of the protest, and immediately afterwards, comprehending the payment <em>supra </em>protest, and protest itself, either Rothschild or Hottinguer and Co. were the \u201cowners or holders\u201d of the. bill, as described in the first class of the statute, and of course no rights whatever accrued to the bank. JDid it subsequently acquire any?</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">In what particular manner the bill was transferred by Hottinguer and Co. to the bank after protest and payment \u2014 \u2018whether by general. or special endorsement, or-by \u00e1 receipt upon the bill \u2014 the record does not show. It only says that \u201c the' bill of exchange and protest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>\u2022were transmitted to the bank, which thereby, and by reason of the premises, became and were again holders and owners of the same.\u201d But the claim for..fifteen- per cent, damages had been voluntarily waived, as we have seen, by Hottinguer and Co., and it is not easy to see \u25a0 how any person claiming under them could have anymore rights than those which the assignors chose to insist upon. The mere possession of the bill is not sufficient, because. that possession was accompanied by a cotemporaneous declaration that Hottinguer and Co. intended to claim nothing more than one-half per cent commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">It is not perceived, then, how the bank can bring itself within the' class of - cases provided' for- in the first branch of the statute. Is it within the sec\u00f3hd?</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">This depends entirely upon the answer to the question, has it, as endorser, paid the damages to. the owner or- holder of the bill, or to any one ? If it has,- the record 'does not show it. Oh the contrary, all that it has paid was-the commission of a half per cent, to Hottinguer and Co.; if indeed it has paid that, for there is no evidence of it. The propriety of the statute Is not the subject of examination; but it may be remarked that it appears to be founded on reason and justice. Every successive endorser, as he transfers a bill of exchange, receiv\u00e9s from the endorsee its full value; and being thus reimbursed for his outlay in the purchase of the bill, the. inconvenience which falls upon somebody when the. bill is protested does not touch -him. His account is already balanced. The reason therefore for allowing damages utterly ceases as to him. He has no fresh bill to purchase, either by re-exchange or in any other manner. But when he is made responsible, as' he may be, to the holder, for the amount of the bill and damages, it is fair \u00e1nd reasonable that the same liability.shouid travel upward until it is ultimately fastened upon the drawer; each endorser being obliged to refund to the one below him exactly what that one has be\u00e9n compelled to pay. But the bank has not paid these damages, and consequently is not within the second class of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Being not -within the statute at all, the claim for damages cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The argument that the fifteen per cent, is not damages, but exchange, is entirely unsound, as I conceive, in this case. The statute gives exchange from the place of drawing interest, costs of protest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>and fifteen per cent, damages, in addition. The first is indemnity; the second a penalty. By commercial men the first is construed liberally, as within the general rule governing bills of exchange, with the difference of estimating the exchange from the place of drawing, instead of re-exchange; the right to the penalty is strictly construed, according to the words of the statute. Its plain meaning must govern the merchant and business man ; for him it was made. He is told that the owner of a bill, at the time of its protest, shall be entitled to fifteen per cent, damages from ihe drawer, or endorser, in every case; and that the endorser shall be entitled to the same, (from the drawer, or a prior endorser,) provided the owner makes him pay the fifteen per cent.; not otherwise. And this I understand to have been the uniform mode of proceeding under the' statute by the merchants of Maryland, under the 1st and 3d sections of the act; nor does it appear by the books of reports of that state, that this interpretation by business men has ever been questioned in the courts of justice there. For the reasons stated, I think the instruction given to the jury in the Circuit Court was proper, and that the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b753-5\">Mr. Justice WAYNE.</author>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">I concur in the opinion that the judgment of the court below ought to be reversed, but not for the reasons given in the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">order.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the' United States, for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and was argued by counsel.
