That by the will of Z. Magruder, of 26th March, 1789, Elias Magruder took a life-estate, only in the land sued for, and, under the facts in the case, had no other estate to his death; and that, at his death, the land was to be sold for the benefit of the six children of the testator mentioned in the devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-12\">2. That this being the case, the Court of Chancery of Maryland had authority, upon the petition of four of such children, to decree a sale of the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-13\">3. That the court did so decree, and</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-14\">4. That the sale made under the decree to Walter. Slicer, under whom , the lessor of the plaintiff claims, passed to Slicer the fee, which is now.in the plaintiff\u2019s lessor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-15\">For the defendants,</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-16\">1. -That tinder the devise to Elias Magruder, (in the 8th clause of the will of Zachariah Magruder,) said Elias Magruder virtually took, under the laws of Maryland, an'estate.in fee-simple..</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-17\">2. That even if Elias Magruder, under tire facts stated, took only an estate for life, yet the proceedings in Chancery were not effectual to vest in'Walter Slicer (through whom the plaintiff claims) a legal title to ,the parcel of land sought to be recovered in this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-18\">3. That even if, upon the facts stated, said Walter Slicer acquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>a legal title to said land, yet the lessor of the plaintiff, upon the whole facts, does not show that such title had become vested in-him at the time of the demise. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-5\">4. That even if. the lessor of the plaintiff had, at the time of the. demise, a legal title to undivided parts of the tract, he could- not recover at all, the demise being for an entirety.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-6\">Johnson, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-7\">The first question is, what' estate- did Elias Magruder take under \u00dcie will ? \"We say, only an estate for life: the other side say that it was eithe. an \u00e9state in fee, by virtue of the rule in Shelly\u2019s case, or a fee-tail, or a fee-simple conditional at common law. It is perfectly clear that if the will had stopped at the first paragraph, the estate devised would have been only for life; the doubt is as to the second paragraph. If the contingency happened, the estate was to become a fee to the devisee; if he died without children, then it was to go to the children of the testator:</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-8\">' Is it enlarged by the rule in Shelly\u2019s case ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-9\">1 Rep. 93 contains the rule. It was recognised as \u00e1n old one, and is, that where an estate is. given for life with limitation over to heirs, it is an estate in fee, and taken by virtue of the rule. But if the contingency had happened here, the devisee w.o\u2019M have , taken under the will an estate in <em>fee; </em>and the distinction is in his taking under the will or under the rule. Fearne, Con. Rem. 28, note; 1 Hargrave\u2019s Law Tracts, 490; 1 Preston on Estates, 263 to 419; 4 Kent, 214.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-11\">Is it a conditional fee-simple ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-12\">The defendant is understood-to place it in this class. But a conditional fee-simple at common law is an estate' limited over to some particular heirs, in exclusion of heirs general; - Before statute off Westminster, courts held that where the contingency happened* the estate became absolute and could be aliened; but in no other Case -than where heirs special are preferred to heirs general. A qualified or base fee is where a deed is made to A. and his heirs, tenants of the manor of Dale; where they hold, only as long as .they are tenants. The error of the other side is in not distinguishing between a fee-simple conditional at Common law and an estate to arise upon condition. The difference between estates upon condition precedent and condition subsequent is, that in the former there is no estate in the party until the contingency happens, whilst in the latter there is. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Here, .tiie estate in fee was to arise upon the happening of a future contingency, in case Elias married and had children; otherwise he was a mere tenant for life\u00a1. 2 Bla. Com. 109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-5\">2. Was the chaneeiy proceeding regular?</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-6\">1. ' Did th\u00e9 Maryland statute give jurisdiction ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-7\">2. Was it a case of ordinary chaneeiy jurisdiction ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-8\">The Court of Chancery is created by the constitution of the state, and .invested with all chancery powers, .unless restrained - by law. In-case of doubt, we look at the statute to see whether it takes away any of the ordinary chancery powers. The act of 1785, chap..72, is intended to enlarge jurisdiction; its title being, '\u201cAn act to enlarge the jurisdiction of the High Court of Chancery.\u201d The 4th section is applicable to this case. The executrix was dead, and the authority of the executor was revoked. No regular- bill was' necessary; a petition was sufficient. .All that the chancellor had to be satisfied of, were two things: 1st, That the sale ought to be made, and 2d, That there was no person to make it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-9\">2. It was a case also of ordinary chaneeiy jurisdiction. A trust was to be executed and there was no trastee. The petition prayed for a sale, and the decree was that all directed by the will to be sold should be sold;. The trustee, therefore, sold the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-10\">\u2018 Our title is good, if Slicer\u2019s was. He claims under the proceedings of a court of competent jurisdiction, whose decision must b.e presumed to be right. Elias must be presumed to have been dead, if it is necessary to sustain the authority of the court. It is objected also that it does not appear that the trastee ever gave a bond; but this court must presume that every thing was properly done. 10 Peters, 449.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-12\">It is also objected that the power to sell was \"in the \u2022 surviving executor. This court and the Court of Appeals in Maryland have differed upon this point 10 Peters, 533, that it survives; 4 Gill and Johnson, <em>323, </em>that it does not. But the ground of the decision in' Peters was; that the sale was to be made to pay debts. In this case there were no debts.,. The devisees cannot deny the validity of the chancery proceedings.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-13\"><em>Schley, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-14\">By the laws of Maryland (1789, chap. 45) estates of fee-tail general or fee-simple conditional are in fact fee-simple estates, because they ar\u00e9 descendible as such, (1 Harris and Gill, 111,) and are liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>for the debts of the deceased. Elias took a fee-simple conditional. 2 Preston on Estates, 289, 295, 298, 303, 304</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-5\">Elias had something more than an estate for life. 1 Brockenborough, 131; 2 Virginia Rep. 11 ; 7 Harris and Johnson, 244; Fleta, lib. 3, chap. 9, page 186;. Bracton, 17; 1 Reeves\u2019 History of English Law, 293; 2 Preston, 296; Plowden, 233, 250; 2 Lord Raymond, 779: Co. Litt. 18.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-6\">If Elias had issue, they would have taken by descent after his death; he must therefore have had afee in himself. 1 Preston on Estates, 264; 2 Powel on Devises, 602; Willes, 3; 2 Gill, and Johns. 458.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-7\">Suppose Elias had only an estate for life; how does Slicer get the residue ? In 1805, Elias Magruder wa*. alive, because in 1806 he sold land. The chancellor' o'rdered the land sold' free of ail claims of heirs or devisees; but Elias was a devisee and living on the land; Was his land sold over his head ? \"He had not joined in the petition, or forfeited his estate. The. petition, therefore, does not include the 100 acres, but states that the 356 acres, had not been sold. True, the decree covers all; but it must be limited by the petition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-8\">The act of 1785 does not include this case, because it is confined to cases where.the party neglects or refuses to act; but Elias being alive, there was no neglect to sell the 100 acres, because the time to sell had not yet come. Elias might even then be married and have children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-9\">The power of the trustee was only that which the executor had, the proceeding being <em>ex parte. </em>Ellas did not die until 1812, and the chanc\u00e9llor could not divest him of his rights upon a petition filed by other persons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-10\">The bond of the trustee is a condition precedent, and' he had no right to act without complying with'it. The law required a bond. The case in 2 Gill and Johnson, 114, is not applicable, because no final ratification appeared there, and there was i\u00f1uch evidence on the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-11\">Suppose that Slicer had a good title, did the plaintiff obtain it? The two elder judgments were dormant for three years prior to Lamar\u2019s sale. If there is an outstanding title in Lamar, the plaintiff must fail in his ejectment; on this subject some analogous cases may be found in 12 Wheaton, 179; 4 Cond. Rep. 457, note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-12\">In Maryland, there is no law' limiting the lien of \u00e1 judgment, but the judgment itself is good for twelve years. The chancellor, however, decided (2 Bland Ch. Rep. 323) that a judgment cannot lie dormant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>for ever. Some illustrative cases are 2 Harris and Johnson, 66; 8 Gill and Johnson, 38; 7 Gill and Johnson, 360.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-5\">It is settled in Maryland that there must be a <em>scire facias </em>where a new parly is to be charged; such parly must have a-day in court. 2 Harris and Johnson, 72; 10 Gill and Johnson, 373.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-6\">4. The demise is for an entirety.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-7\">Two children did not join in the petition, and tire record does not show that they ever received a distributive share of the proceeds of the second sale of 100 acres. Their title is not extinguished; and whatever m\u00e1y be the condition of the other four children, the plaintiff, not having acquired the title of these two, cannot succeed under his present demise,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-8\">Johnson, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-9\">It does not appear that any of the children ever' Objected to the proceedings of the trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-10\">As to the 356 acres, it must be admitted that there was no other' mode of making a sale than under, the act of 1785; and there was the same necessity as to the 100 acres. The executor had .not power to sell them; here was a. case, then, where property ought to be sold; and there' was nobody to sell it. If the chancellor appoints a. trustee, he has decided that a trust exists. This court has said that the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, must stand; and must assume that the necessary facts were proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-11\">The Court of Appeals in Maryland have decided (M. S. Denison and Dublin) that a proceeding under the fourth section of the act of 1785 is like a suit. One person is enough to petitionothers\u2019 can go in and be heard. If one were not enough to petition, the act would be of little use. The trustee was directed to \u00ab sell and convey the property,\u201d not merely the interest of the petitioners. The act was designed, for a practical purpose, to reach the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-12\">Was the trustee appointed for the 100 acres also ? True, the petition speaks only of 356 acres, but it refers to the will, and states it. The same children who were to receive the proceeds of the 356 acres, were, by the will, also to receive the proceeds of the 100 acres. The right to the 100 acres was prospective and contingent; but the trustee was vested with power to sell all, for the sake of convenience. It is objected that Elias was still alive; but the court may as well presume him to be dead, as that there was error in the decree. The admission in the record is, that the court may presume any fact which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>they would \u2022 instruct a jury to presume. If, therefore, they would instruct a jury to presume the death of Elias,'it can presume it too. The trustee first reported that he 'had not sold the 100 acres, and afterwards reported specially that he had, The -court, by ratifying this last report; have made it conclusive that they considered the trustee to have been authorized.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-5\">This party cannot object to these proceedings; if any persons could, it would be the children who djd not join, but the court would not now -tolerate an ejectment, if brought by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-6\">The bond is not nfecessary to give the chancellor jurisdiction, but to secure the parties; its omission is' a mere irregularity, and not to be brought into .view upon a collateral matter. Besides, it must be presumed to have been given. In <em>2 </em>Gill and Johnson, 114, a ratification was presumed, page 130.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-7\">It is said that we do not show a title to the whole. But the two children who did not petition received, their share of the proceeds,\" and by that act made themselves parties. They are estopped. The decree gave authority to sell the whole land, and the whole title was conveyed to-us.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-8\">The Court of Appeals did say once, that a plaintiff could not recover an undivided' part, claiming title to the whole. The act of 1832 corrected this. This act has been repealed in part, but not in this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-9\">As to an outstanding title in Lamar:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-10\">Until the chancellor said otherwise, the profession had no doubt of the propriety of the lien of an elder judgment. Before' the act of 1823, execution had to be issued within a year and a day. Now three years are allowed. All judicial- liens must be noticed by all. A purchaser under a junior judgment must be presumed to have notice of the first. The chancellor says that the object of requiring a prompt issue is to protect purchasers; but they are already protected by the records.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-11\">What estate did Elias take ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-12\">It is true that an estate-tail general or fee-simple conditional is, by the laws of Maryland, synonymous with a fee-simple. . But a fee-simple conditional is where the limitation is to heirs special, to' the exclusion of heirs general. 2 Bla. Com. 110. There is no such special limitation in this will. No estate of inheritance passed on the death of the testator. 2 Bla. Com. 151, 154, defines an estate upon condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-13\">If a fee passed upon the death of the testator, it was not by virtue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>of the will. Rules giving a different direction to an estate from that pointed out in the will are not applied except from necessity. The devise to the children is a good executory devise, to take effect unless a contingency happened. The object of the testator was to benefit his children; but the argument of the other side would defeat that intention.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b63-5\">Mr. Justice McLEAN</author>\n<p id=\"AP\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">This case comes up on.a writ of error to the Circuit' Court for the' district of Maryland. An action of ejectment was commenced by the lessor of the plaintiff, to recover the possession of 100 acres of land, part of a tract called George\u2019s Adventure, situated near the town of Cumberland.' In the Circuit Court a verdict was found for the plaintiff, subject to .the opinion of the court upon a cause stated. A judgment was entered for the defendant; and the cause is now before us, on the facts agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">By his last will and testament,'Zachariah Magruder, a citizen of Maryland, among other things devised to his wife Sarah, the full use of his dwelling-plantation, containing in the whole, after a certain legacy was deducted, about 356 acres, called George\u2019s. Adventure, in Washington county; to be by her peaceably and quietly possessed and enjoyed without molestation, during her natural life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The will also contained the following, \u201c I give and bequeath unto my brother, Elias Magruder, during his natural life, 100 acres of land, being part of a tract of land called George\u2019s Adventure,' lying and being in Washington county, and state aforesaid; to be laid off at the upper 'end of the tract aforesaid, so as to include the plantation on which he now lives. In case the said Elias Magruder should have heirs lawfully begotten of him in wedlock, I then give and. bequeath the 100 acres of land aforesaid to him, the said Elias Magruder, his heirs and assigns, for ever; but should he, the said Elias Magruder, die without an heir so begotten, I give, bequeath, devise, and desire, that the 100 acres of land aforesaid be sold to the highest bidder, and the money arising from the sale thereof to be equally divided among my six following children, to wit: Samuel,\u201d . &amp;C-. The testator having died, proof was made of his will, and letters testamentary were granted, the 3d of May, 1796, to Sarah Magruder his wife and his son Nathaniel B. Magruder, named as executrix and executor in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">After the decease of the testator, Elias Magruder took possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>of the 100 acres of land devised to him, and being so in possession he conveyed the tract to David Lynn, who devised the same to the present defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">On the 30th of December, 1805, Samuel B. Magruder and three other, brothers, sons of Zachariah Magruder, filed .their petition to the chancellor of Maryland, representing that their father after making particular dispositions of property, devised that the remaining' part of his land, called George\u2019s Adventure, being about 356 acres, should be sold to the highest bidder, by and at the discretion of his ' executrix and executor, and the money equally divided amongst his six children, including the petitioners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The petitioners stated that the executrix was deceased, and that ' Nathaniel B. Magruder, being, insolvent, at the instance of his sureties, his power as executor had been revoked by.the Orphan\u2019s Court. And the petitioners prayed that a trustee might be appointed \u201c to sell all the property devised to he sold by the will, and such other and further relief,\u201d &amp;c. The. will was filed, as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">On the day of filing the petition, the chancellor decreed, \u201cthat the real estate in the said will direct\u00e9d to be sold shall be sold; that Roger Perry be appointed trustee,-who. shall, give bond in $2000, conditioned for the faithful performance of the trust reposed in him by the decree, or to be reposed in him by any future decree or order in the premises, and that he shall proceed to sell,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Afterwards on the 22d of May, 1806, the trustee reported that he \u201chad sold the real estate ip the said will and decree mentioned,\u201d ' and had made distribution, &amp;c-. At the close of his report he says, \u201c the 100 acres, part of the said tract devised to be sold in case Elias Magruder should die without heirs, as expressed in the will, still remains unsold.\u201d The sale, was ratified by the chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">And afterwards, on the 9th of June,. 1812, the trustee made a' second report, that he \u201c had sold the remaining part of the real estate of Zachanah Magruder, deceased, consisting of 100 acres of land,\u201d &amp;c. This sale was also ratified by the chancellor, and a deed was executed to Walter Slicer, the purchaser. In the year 1818, a judgment was obtained against Walter Slicer, and two others in the year 1819. On one of the junior judgments execution was issued, under which the land in question was sold to Lamar. On the other junior judgment, obtained at the same term, an execution w&amp;s issued, and the same tract was sold, after the above sale, to David Shriver, jr., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the lessor of the plaintiff He also purchased, subsequently, the same tract, under the prior j udgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The first question for consideration arises out of the devise, in the will, to Elias Magruder. Did he take a life-estate' only, or a fee-simple ? That he took an estate in fee-simple conditional in the 100, acres, is urged by the defendants\u2019 counsel.. And a statute of Maryland of 1786, entitled \u201can act to direct descents,\u201d <em>2 </em>Ketty\u2019s Laws, chap. 45, which provides that lands held \u201c in fee-simple or fee-simple conditional, or in fee-tail to the heirs of the body generally,\u201d shall descend in the same manner, is relied on as giving a fee-simple to the devisee. Under this' statute, it must be admitted, whether- the estate vested be technically considered a. fee-tail general or a conditional fee-simple, in effect, it is a fee-simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In 1 Inst. 20 s. it is said that \u201c all limitations-confined to the heirs of the body, either by direct or circuitous expression, and which are not estates-tail under the statute <em>de donis, </em>remain conditional .or qualified fees at the common law. A gift of land to a man and his heirs generally, if he shall have heirs of his body, without any other expression to qualify the word heirs \u00f3f his body, is a conditional fee. Fleta, b. 3, c. 9, 136. And in Plow, 233, it is said, \u201c and. the Lord Dyer in his argument took exception to the ratification, for that it confesses the estate-tail in King Henry VH., and then says, that he having issue, Prince Arthur, entered and was seised in fee; whereas, he said, the-having issue did not make him' to have the fee, for the fee e''her accrued to him by the. remainder or never.\u201d The same doctrine is found in page 250; Machell <em>v. </em>Clarke, 2 Lord Raym. 778. By the statute <em>de donis, </em>Westm. 2, 13 Ed. 1, a fee-simple conditional estate at common law, in certain cases, was converted into a fee-tail which, by alienation,'the ancestor could not change.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The estate under consideration, it is \"insisted, is a conditional fee-simple ; or in other words that the fee vested is liable to be.defeated on the failure of heirs as provided in the will. On the other side it is argued, that the condition was a precedent one, which must happen before the fee vested. The doctrine above cited seems to favour the first of these positions, as does also the rule in Shelly\u2019s case. By that rule, \u00abin any instrument^ if a freehold be limited to the ancestor for life, and the inheritance to his heirs, either mediately or immediately, the first-taker takes the whole estate.\u201d This rule had its origin in feudal times, and was, perhaps, in no small degree influenced by considerations' which have long since ceased to exist. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The rule, Mr. Preston says, 1 Pres, on Estates, 369, \"is of positive institution, and has,this circumstance of peculiarity and variance from rules of construction.\u201d \u201c Instead of seeking the intention of the parties and aiming at its accomplishment, it interferes in some, at least, if' not in all cases, with the presumable, and in many instances, the express intention.\u201d \u201c In its very object, the rule was levelled against the views of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">That-this effect has been given to the, rule by some adjudications is admitted. But there is a rule of construction applicable to ail .instruments, .and especially:to wills, that, is, the intention, of the parties, which should control any arbitrary rule however ancient may be its origin. And of this opinion was Lord Mansfield, in Perrin <em>v. </em>Blake, 4 Burr. 257.9. He says, \u201c the rule is not a general proposition, subject to nO control, where, the intention is on the other side, and where objections may be answered.\u201d . And he agreed, as Mr. Preston remarks, with Justices Wilmot and' Aston, that \u201c the intention is to govern, and that Shelly\u2019s case does not constitute a decisive uncontrollable rule.\u201d Mr. Justice Buller, in \u2022 the case of Hodgson and wife <em>v. </em>Ambrose, Doug. 337, was of the same opinion, and also Lord Hardwicke, in Bagsh\u00e9w and Spencer, 2 Atk. 583. Where technical w;ords are used in a deed, of conveyance, the legal import of such words must govern. But there' is no rule- better established, than that in giving a construction to a will, the intention of the testator must prevail, His' expressed intention constitutes the law, .unless it shall conflict with some. established legal, principle. Under this rule the. nature and extent of the estate devised to Elias Magruder. must depend upon the words .of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In -the first clause of the devise a life-estate is clearly given to him. \u00abI give and bequeath unto my brother, Elias Magruder, during his natural life, 100 acres of land,\u201d &amp;c. The second clause of- the devise is equally explicit. \u00ab 'In case the said Elias Magruder .should have heirs lawfully begotten of him in wedlock, I then give and. bequeath the 100 acres of land aforesaid, to him, his heirs and assigns, for ever.\u201d Now the condition of having heirs as above expressed, is clearly a precedent, condition and must happen before the estate vests. \u2022 And -if any dpubt could arise from the above sentences whether the testator intended to-vest in. Elias inore than a life-estate, that doubt must be dispeEed by the succeeding sentence, \u201c.but, should he, the said Elias' Magruder, die without ain heir so begotten, I give\u2019, bequeath, devise, and desire that the 100 acres.of land, aforesaid, be sold to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the-highest bidder, and-the money-arising from the sale thereof, to be 'equally divided among my six children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">It would be difficult to convey in' more explicit language, than is done in. the abov\u00e9 - sentences, the intention of the testator. He gives a life-estate; and then, on the happening of the contingency named, he gives an estate to the devisee and his heirs in fee-simple; but, should the contingency not happen, he .directs the land ta be sold and' the proceeds distributed among his-children. No- other conclusion can be arrived at, on this view of the will, than .that Elias Magruder took only a life-estate in the land.- His conveyance, therefore, eould transfer no interest in the land, beyond his own life.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The next question regards the title under-the proceedings before the chanc\u00e9llor.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">These proceedings were by virtue of \u201c an act of 1785, forhplargirig the power of the High Court of Chancery.\u201d 1 Maxcy\u2019s Laws,, ch. 72, sect. 4, which provides, \u201c that if any person hath died or shall die, leaving 'real or personal'estate to be-sold-for the paymentr of debts, or other .purposes, and shall not, by will or other instrument-in'writing, appoint a person or persons to sell- or -convey , the same-property, or if the person or persons appointed for'the purpose aforesaid shall neglect- or refuse to execute such' trust, or if- such person or persons, or any of them, shall\u2019die before the execution of \u25a0 such trust, so that the sale cannot be-made for the purposes intended, in every such case the chancellor shall have full powerand authority, upon application or petition from, any person or persons interested in-the sale of such property, to appoint, such trustee o.r trustees for the purpose of selling and conveying such property, and applying'the money arising from the sale -to the purposes intended, as the chancellor shall in his discretion think \"proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">An objection, is made to these proceedings, <em>in </em>limine, on the ground that only a part of the heifs interested; united in the applic\u00e1tion to the. chancellor. But this, objection is not'sustainable. The petition was for the benefit of all the heirs, and the statute does not require that all shall unite in the petition; \u00ab Any person or persons interested\u201d may apply to the chancellor. Whether applicants- or not, all the heifs equally participated in the results of the proceedings, and this is a sufficient answer, to any technical objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">\u2022 But the main point under this head is, whether'.the sale of the 100 acres now in controversy was of any validity. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">That the proceedings before the chancellor constituted a suit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>admitted; ,and also that they are conformably, at least in part, to the mode of procedure in such cases. The chancellor had jurisdiction of the cause, as presented by the petition; and' this being the case, no advantage can be taken of errors, however gross,-when the record is used collaterally. If a want of jurisdiction appear on the face of the record, the judgment or decree will be treated as a nullity. , But where there was jurisdiction, the- record must be received as conclusive of the rights adjudicated. No fact established by the judgment of the courtcan be controverted. In the language of this court, in the. case of Voorhees <em>v. </em>The Bank of the United States, 10 Peters, 450, the record imports absolute .verity. But when a judgment or decree is given .in evidence, its nature and effect can only be ascertained by an examination of the jecord. Let.this test fee applied to the proceedings of the chancery court under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">It is admitted, and the fact appears from the fecord, that at the time these proceedings were instituted, Elias Magruder was living and continued to live for seven years afterwards. And as he had a life estate in the premises in controversy, and the contingency on which the estate was to vest in his heirs, being possible, during his life, the land was not subject to. sale under the will. It could only be sold on the devisee\u2019s failure to have heirs, which could not occur before his decease.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The petition asks an order to sell the remaining part' of the tract called George\u2019s Adventure, a part of it having been devised, containing about 356 acres. The sale of the 100 acres, now in contest, was not asked and indeed could not be, as the tract at that time was not liable to be sold. The decree ordered, \u00abthat the real estate in the said will directed to be sold should be sold.\u201d Now this decree could only apply to the 356 acres named in th&amp;petition, for the reason- that the sale of that tract- only was prayed'' for, and it was the only tract, at that time, which the will authorized to be sold. In the language of the. decree, it was the real estate directed by the will to be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">To construe the decree as embracing the 100 acres tract, would go beyond the prayer of the petition and the jurisdiction of the court. One of the trustees named in the will was deceased, and the other, being insolvent, \u2022 had been removed by the Orphan\u2019s Court. The substitution of a new trustee gave to him no power beyond the special order of the court..- Under the statute it seems not' to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>been the practice of the.court to appoint a trustee generally, to carry into effect the \u2022will: but to point out, by a specific decree, what he shall do and the mode of doing it. His duties being limited by the decree, he is made the instrument of the court, having no discretion or power under the will.. Consequently, in his decree the chancellor required the trustee to give security, and directed him what notice should be given, and in what manner the sale should be made. This mode of executing the act was clearly within the discretion of the chancellor, specially given to him in the close of the above section. . The rule was made and ratified by the chancellor. A deed was executed by the trustee to the purchaser, and nothing further was done until in June, 1812, when the trustee made a second report, that in pursuance of the above decree, after giving public notice, \u201che had sold to Walter Slicer, the remaining part bf the real estate of Zachariah Magruder, deceased, consisting of the 100 acres devised to Elias Magruder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Now it is clear that this sale was not made in pursuance of the decree. ' Neither in the petition nor in the decree was the tract of 100 acres named or referred to. This proceeding then, by the trustee, was without authority. It could derive no sanction from the 'decree. From the record, it-would seem that there had been no continuance of the cause for six years, and no step taken in it. The second\u2019 report is then made by the trustee as stated. This report was ratified and confirmed \u201cunless by a given day cause to the contrary should be shown,\u201d of which public notice was given. No cause being shown, there \u25a0 was a final ratification bf the sale on the 22d of February, 1813. A the time of this sale it is admitted that Elias Magruder was deceased, without heirs, in the language of the will, \u201c lawfully begotten of him in wedlock.\u201d And here a question arises whether the above sale can be treated as a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">That the trustee was not authbrized to sell by the decree has already been showm. It would seem, however, from die form of his report, that he assumed to act only in virtue of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Does the ratification of the sale bring it within the rule, which applies to a case where the court has jurisdiction, but has committed errors in its proceedings; Had the court jurisdiction of die tract of land in controversy. At the .time the decree was entered, that tract was no more subject to the power of fire court than every other tract in the county. The devisee was in possession, having a life-estate in it subject to become a fee-simple on his having heirs lawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>begotten by him.. He had no notice of the proceeding, and was in no'sense a party to. it. \u25a0 The petition did not pray for the Sale of this land:.. In fact that proceeding can, in no point of view, be considered as authorizing the \u25a0 sale \u2022\u2022 by the' trustee. The validity, of the sale then must rest up oil the- fact of -ifs having\" been made by the trustee, and sanctioned by the chancellor. \u25a0 There would seem to be nb ground for doubt on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The chancellor is authorized to' proceed in a summary mode, under the statute, for the sale of land, in the predicament.'of the above tract, after' the decease of the devisee, without heirs. But He can only proceed on the application of persons interested. Here was no such ' application for the sale of this land. The sale being without authority,, the ratification of it by -the court must be-c'onsidered as having b.eten. given inadvertently. \u2022 If given deliberately and on a full examination-of all the facts,.still if must be regarded as an unauthorized proceeding. There was no case beftre the court \u2014 nothing on which its judgment could rest:</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">No :Court, however great may be its .dignify, can arrogate to itself the power of disposing'of real estate without the forms of law. It must obtain jurisdiction of the thing in a legal mode: A decree without notice, would be treated sis. a nullity. And so must a sale of land be treated, which has been made without an order or decree of the court, though, it may have ratified the sale. The statute under which the proceeding was had requires a decreeat least such has been its uniform construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">This view being decisive of the title of the lessor of - the plaintiff, it is not necessary to -consider the other questions in the- case. '</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">The judgment 'of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">ORDER.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">This cause came on . to be heard on the\" transcript of-the record from the Circuit Court of-the United States for the district of Mary-' land, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, It is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said- Circuit Court in this' cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
