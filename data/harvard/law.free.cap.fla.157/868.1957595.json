He found, also, that as of the date of the entry of the decree the entire net revenues of the electric light system of the Utilities System of the City were pledged for the payment of the principal and interest on $32,000 Electric Revenue Certificates of the City of Bartow, dated December 1, 1935; that subject to the prior pledge of said net revenues for the pay-, ment of said $32,000 Electric Revenue Certificates, fifty per cent, of the net revenues of said electric light system are pledged for the payment of the principal and interest on the \u201cRefunding Bonds, Series of 1940,\u201d dated October 1, 1940; and that the remaining fifty per cent, of the net revenues of the electric light system are not pledged for, or encumbered in any manner by, the said \u201cRefunding Bonds, Series of 1940,\u201d dated October 1, 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">The chancellor further found in his decree that the negotiable revenue bonds sought to be validated are payable solely from the net revenues of the water system and the electric light system of the City\u2019s Utilities System and do not constitute an indebtedness of the City for which the taxing power of the City is pledged; and that \u201cthe lien of the holders of Utilities Revenue Bonds proposed to be issued by said City .. . and of the holders of the coupons appertaining thereto, on the net revenues of said water system and said electric light system of said Utilities System will be subordinate to the lien of the holders of said $1,131,000. Refunding Bonds, Series 1940, dated October 1, 1940 (issued to refund $1,278,660.25 General Refunding Bonds, dated April 1, 1934, Series'A. B. C, D, and E), <em>only as to fifty per centum </em>(50%) <em>of said net revenues; </em>and that such holders of said Utilities Revenue Bonds will have an exclusive first lien on fifty per centum (50%) of the net revenues of the water system, and an exclusive first lien on fifty per centum (50%) of the net revenues of the electric light system of said Utilities System, subject, however, to the prior and superior lien of the holders of said $32,000 Electric Revenue Certificates, dated December 1,1935, on all the net revenues of said electric light system of said Utilities System.\u201d (Italics supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>The appellant maintains that the chancellor committed reversible error in finding that the covenant contained in the \u201cGeneral Refunding Bonds, Series 1940,\u201d dated October 1, 1940, pledged only fifty per cent of the net revenue of the Utilities System, in view of the language contained in such stipulation that \u201csuch revenues so pledged shall not be less than fifty per centum (50%) of the total amount of such net revenues for any twelve months period\u201d; and that the chancellor erred, also, in finding that the Utilities Revenue Bonds proposed to be issued were not subordinate to a prior and superior lien on all net revenues derived from the Utilities System for the payment of said Refunding Bonds, Series 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">We cannot agree with the appellant that the chancellor erred in the findings he made. In State of Florida v. City of Bartow, 147 Fla. 67, 2 So. (2nd) 125, this court interpreted the legal effect to be given the covenant which we have quoted, and held that the covenant did no more than obligate the City \u201cto pay 50 per cent of the net revenues of its light and water system with all other unappropriated revenues from sources other than ad valorem taxes to service the outstanding [General Refunding Bonds, Series 1940].\u201d This being the effect of the covenant, no error was committed by the chancellor in finding that the Utilities Revenue Bonds here brought in question were not subordinate to a prior and superior lien on the entire net revenues derived from the Utilities System for the payment of the Refunding Bonds, Series 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The appellant having failed to show error, the decree appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b893-8\">CHAPMAN, C.
