M. Chandlee and wife, Linda Chandlee, and Mary L. Dixon, subdividing the Wy2 of SWy of NW/4 of SWj4 Of Section 4, Township 4 South, Range 14 West, designated as Magnolia Heights, which plat is dated September 13, 1935, and filed for record September 18,1935, in Plat Book 2 at page 22, of the records of the Clerk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>of the Circuit Court of Bay County, Florida, the records of Bay County, Florida, do not show, therefore the defendant denies that the plaintiff is the owner of the lands described in the declaration, to-wit: Lot 9 and the south half of lot 10, Magnolia Heights, Section 4, Township 4 South, Range 14 West.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">This plea tendered an immaterial issue. It did not deny title in the plaintiff but did d\u00e9ny that plaintiff\u2019s title was shown by the record of Bay County, Florida. The plea did not deny the possession of the plaintiff. Plaintiff was allowed to testify, over the objection of the defendant, that he was the owner and in possession of the described land when the damage occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">It is our conclusion that, absent a plea denying ownership and possession, such ownership and possession were admitted by the plea of not guilty and, therefore, there was no reversible error in admitting the testimony of the plaintiff in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">It is well settled that no person has the right to gather surface waters that would naturally flow in one direction by drainage ditches, dams or otherwise and divert them from their natural course and cast them upon the lands of the lower owner to his injury. See Brunley v. Dorner, 78 Fla. 495, 83 So. 912; Seaboard All-Fla. Ry. Co. et al. v. Underhill, et al., 105 Fla. 409, 141 So. 306; Dade County v. So. Dade Farms, 133 Fla. 288, 182 So. 858; A.C.L.R. Co. v. Hendry, 112 Fla. 391, 150 So. 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The acts of the defendant in constructing the ditches and diverting the water course causing the accumulation of waters to overflow on the plaintiff\u2019s property and damage same were sufficiently proven to warrant a verdict in favor of. the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">No reversible error being made to appear, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-11\">CHAPMAN, C.
