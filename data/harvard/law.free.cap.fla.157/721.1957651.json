That such connection by him with the conducting of lotteries is the same offense for which he is now being prosecuted under the indictment sought to be quashed, and contended that he was immune from prosecution for the same offense under the provisions of Section 932.29 Fla. Statutes 1941 (same F.S.A.). The motion was denied and the trial resulted in conviction. Defendant appealed and challenges the correctness of the denial of the motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-15\">On the face of the motion it is apparent that the investigation proceeding or trial at and on which he was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>testify was not the violation of any of the statutes of this State against bribery, burglary, larceny, gaming or gambling or any of the statutes against the illegal sale of spirituous, vinous or malt liquors.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">It is, therefore, clear that the testimony of the accused, having been given on a preliminary hearing or investigation upon a charge of murder in the first degree, did not bring the accused within the purview of the immunity afforded by the statute, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">No error being made to appear, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b744-7\">CHAPMAN, C.
