On or about April 29, 1941, the defendant was the owner and holder of an option to purchase' 10.000 shares of common stock of National Airlines, Incorporated, a corporation, from said corporation at a price of $7.50 per share. On or about said date, the defendant granted to the plaintiff an option to purchase from said BAKER 500 shares of- the common stock of said corporation at a price of $7.50 per share. Said option was in writing, a true and correct copy thereof being hereto attached and made a part hereof as Exhibit No. 1. Thereafter said corporation declared and issued a stock dividend of one share to each four, whereby said options became options to purchase 12,500 shares and 625 shares, respectively, at the same total price. Thereafter, on or about December 15, 1943, the plaintiff notified the defendant in writing of the plaintiff\u2019s intention to exercise his said option, and the defendant exercised his said option. Plaintiff has been at all times, and is now, ready, able and willing to pay to the defendant, the purchase price of said stock, and has so notified the defendant, but the defendant has failed and refused to deliver said stock in accordance with the terms of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. Said stock has greatly increased in value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-11\">\u201cSECOND COUNT. On or about April 29, 1941, the defendant was the owner and holder of an option to purchase 10.000 shares of common stock of National Airlines, Incorporated, a corporation, from said corporation, at a price of $7.50 per share. Said option expired April 15, 1944. On or about April 29, 1941, the defendant granted to the plaintiff an option to purchase from the defendant 500 shares of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>common stock of said corporation at a price of $7.50 per share. Said option was in writing, a true and correct copy thereof being hereto attached and made a part hereof, as Exhibit No. 1. Thereafter, said corporation declared and issued a stock dividend for one share of common stock to each four shares of common stock, whereby said options became options to purchase 12,500 shares and 625 shares, respectively, at the same total price. Plaintiff entered the military service of the United States in December, 1941, shortly after Pearl Harbor, and during the month of December, 1943, was engaged in active fighting on Bougainville Island, and did not return to the United States until the last week in April, 1944. On December 15, 1943, the plaintiff notified the defendant of his intention to exercise his said option, a true and correct copy thereof being hereto attached and made a part hereof, as Exhibit No. 2. Thereby the said option became a valid and binding contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, subject only to become void if the defendant should fail to exercise his said option. Thereafter, the defendant, on or about April 15, 1944, exercised his said option. Plaintiff has been at all times, and is now, ready, able and willing to pay to the defendant the purchase price of said stock and has so notified the defendant, but the defendant has failed and refused to deliver said stock in accordance with the terms of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. Said stock has greatly increased in value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">\u201cTHIRD COUNT. On or about April 29, 1941, the defendant was the owner and holder of an option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock of National Airlines, Incorporated, a corporation, from said corporation, at a price of $7.50 per share. Said option expired April 15, 1944. On or about April 29, 1941, the defendant granted to the plaintiff an option to purchase from the defendant 500 shares of the common stock of said corporation at a price of $7.50 per share. Said option was in writing, a true and correct copy thereof being hereto attached and made a part hereof as Exhibit No. 1. Thereafter said corporation declared and issued a stock dividend of one share of common stock to each four shares of common stock, whereby said options became op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>tions to purchase 12,500 shares and 625 shares, respectively, at the same total price. Plaintiff, having entered the armed services of the United States and having been assigned to duty in the Pacific area, gave to one Paul R. Scott his general power of attorney and constituted him the agent of the plaintiff in and about the matter of the said option and the exercise thereof. On December 15, 1943, plaintiff instructed said Scott to exercise said option, and thereafter and before April 1, 1944, said Scott attempted to exercise said option, but the defendant refused to admit to said Scott the existence of said option, Plaintiff was at said time engaged in combat duty in the Marine Corps of the United States in the South Pacific and did not return to the United States until the last week in April, 1944, and under such circumstances could not act to protect his own interests as promptly and adequately as he otherwise could have, which facts were known to defendant. From that time until February 2, 1945, the defendant refused to admit the existence of said option, and did so then only to deny that said option had been exercised by plaintiff within the time specified in said option. Whereby the defendant waived the exercise by plaintiff of the said option within the time specified therein, and is estopped now to deny the timely exercise by plaintiff of the said option. Defendant exercised his said option on or about April 14, 1944. Plaintiff has been at all times and is now, ready, able and willing to pay to the defendant the purchase price of said stock and has so notified the defendant, but the defendant has failed and refused to deliver said stock in accordance with the terms of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. Said stock has greatly increased in value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The exhibits attached are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201cApril 29, 1941</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201cMr. J.

The question of consideration is wholly immaterial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Consequently we will not discuss the question of consideration. We are of the opinion that plaintiff\u2019s letter quoted above was unmistakenly an election within the agreed time to buy the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Defendant insists that the allegation that \u201csaid Scott attempted to exercise said option, but the defendant refused to admit to said Scott the existence of said option\u201d is insufficient because it is a pure conclusion of the pleader. There may be some reason for this assertion according to Andrew Stephen\u2019s Rules of Pleading. It is a close question on a rule of pleading. Our decision will determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s case is submitted to a jury or whether he must henceforth abide by the judgment against him on the demurrer. We are unwilling to rest the final outcome of the case on such a technical nicety of pleading. The declaration, if supported by proof, presented a case for the jury to pass upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The judgment is reversed for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-8\">CHAPMAN, C.
