Motions were interposed by all the defendants except G. H. Heath and his wife Bertha Heath to dismiss the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">On hearing on these motions the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\u201cIt appears from the amended bill of complaint that on September 15th 1944, the date upon which plaintiff recovered his judgment, the lands in question were no longer partnership assets. An undivided one-half interest therein had been previously conveyed by one of the co-partners, Frank Brewer, joined by his wife, to an outsider, Marjorie Priest. The facts are not sufficient to entitle plaintiff to any relief in a Court of Equity against the defendants, Frank Brewer, Loucille Brewer, Joe Priest, Marjorie Priest, or A. W. Landers. In consideration of the premises, it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">\u201cORDERED AND DECREED that said motion to dismiss are granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Having examined the transcript of the record and considered the oral argument presented by counsel for the parties in connection with the briefs filed, it is our conclusion that the allegations of the amended bill of complaint are entirely insufficient to warrant the relief prayed and, therefore, there is no reversible error in the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-13\">CHAPMAN, C. J., BUFORD and ADAMS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b221-14\">BROWN, J., concurs in the conclusion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
