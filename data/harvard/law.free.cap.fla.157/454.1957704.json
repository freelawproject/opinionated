C. Green, defendant herein a certified copy of said deed being attached hereto and made a part hereof, and marked Exhibit \u2018E\u2019 said deed being recorded in Deed Book 47, page 35 of the records of Clay County, Florida.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The bill of complaint does not allege that in the suit by the county to quiet title the provisions of chaper 22079, Acts of 1943, were not all strictly complied with. Nor does it make Clay County a party defendant in the present suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The prayers of the bill are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201c(1) That the said deed from Clay County, Florida, a political subdivision of the State of Florida, to defendant C. C. Green recorded in Deed Book 47,' page 35, of the records of Clay County, Florida, conveying Lot 3, Block 26, according to a plat of Orange Park, recorded in Plat Book 1, page 23 of the public records of Clay County, Florida, be canceled and declared null and void, and the Clerk of this Court be directed to expurge said deed from the records of Clay County, Florida.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">\u201c(2) That the plaintiff herein be permitted to pay any taxes that are determined by this Honorable Court to be due on said premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">\u201c(3) And for such other specific and general relief that this Honorable Court may deem equitable, and your Plaintiff will ever pray, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">If the provisions of chapter 22079, supra, were strictly complied with and a decree of a court of competent jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>tion was entered quieting title to the lands in the county, then the land-owner has had his day in court. See Pinellas County v. Banks, 154 Fla. 582, 19 So. (2nd) 1; Leon County v. Crawford, 158 Fla. 604, 15 So. (2nd) 321. If that decree appeared valid and regular on the record the defendants in the court below were entitled to rely on it as adjudicating a new and independent title vesting in the county. The bill of complaint alleges the existence of no irregularity in the proceedings to quiet title in the county appearing on the record and alleged no knowledge on the part of defendants of any irregularity which is alleged to have occurred prior to the institution of the suit by the county to quiet title under the provisions of chapter 22079, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The cases of Shuptrine v. Wohl Holding Corporation, 147 Fla. 185, 3 So. (2nd) 524, and Moore v. Wesley E. Garrison Inc., 148 Fla. 653, 5 So. (2nd) 259, are not applicable here because in neither of those cases had there been any adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction of title in the vendee under whom the defendant acquired conveyance of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The allegations of the bill of complaint hereinabove quoted are sufficient to preclude the plaintiff from relief in this suit. Therefore, certiorari is granted and the challenged order quashed with directions that an order be entered granting the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-7\">CHAPMAN, C. J., TERRELL and ADAMS, JJ, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
