Thereupon the County Judge removed Albany as administratrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">This Order was appealed to the Circuit Court and was by the Circuit Court affirmed and on appeal is brought here for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">On consideration of the matter, it is our conclusion that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed on authority of the cases of Roberts v. Roberts, 124 Fla. 116, 167 So. 808 and Hillyer &amp; Lovan et al. v. Florida Industrial Commission, 155 Fla. 144, 19 So. (2nd) 838, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">It is so ordered</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b663-10\">CHAPMAN, C.
