The only plea offered by the defendant was \u201cnot guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">Sec. 52.19 Fla. Statutes, 1941 (same F.S.A.) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxU\">\u201c52.19 Operation of Plea of Not Guilty in Tort Actions.\u2014 In action for torts, the plea of not guilty shall operate as a denial only of the breach of duty or wrongful act alleged to have been committed by defendant, and not of the facts stated in the inducement, and no other defense than such denial shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>be admissible under that plea; all other pleas in denial shall take issue on some particular matter of fact alleged in the declaration; and where in the declaration the breach of duty .or wrongful act is alleged to have been committed by defendant through the agency of any other person or thing the alleged relationship between the defendant and that other person or thing shall not be put in issue by the plea of not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">So it is that by the pleadings the defendant admitted the ownership of the bus and the agency of the driver thereof and that the driver was acting in the scope of his employment. See McLeod Construction Company v. Cooper, 101 Fla. 441, 134 So. 224; Smith v. Coleman, 100 Fla. 1707, 132 So. 198; A.C.L. Ry Co. v. Crosby, 53 Fla. 400, 43 So. 218; City of Key West v. Baldwin, 69 Fla. 136, 67 So. 808; Johnson v. Fla. Brewing Co., 90 Fla. 148, 105 So. 319. This rule, however, did not relieve the plaintiffs of the burden to identify the bus. To do this the plaintiffs proved that the bus bore upon the side thereof the name \u201cFlorida Motor Lines\u201d and that this marking is used by the defendant to identify its buses with which it operates a common carrier business in the State of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">We think that this evidence constituted prima facie proof of ownership by the defendant and that this proof of ownership warranted the assumption, (absent contradicting plea and proof that it is not operated by the agent and servant of the defendant) that it was so operated.' See Sherman &amp; Red-field on Law of Negligence, 6th Ed. Vol. 1, Sec. 158; Mann v. Stewart Sand Co., (Mo.) 243 S.W. 407; Globe Laundry v. McLean, (Tex.) 19 S.W. (2) 94; Edgeworth v. Wood, 58 N.J.L. 463, 33 Atl. 940; Fleischman v. Polar Wave Ice &amp; Fuel Co., (Mo.) 127 S.W. 660; Deil v. Brewing Co., 51 N.Y. Sup. 930; Hartgig v. American Ice Co.

Maseeh (Ariz.) 179 Pac. 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">We conclude that the questions presented in this appeal must be answered contrary to appellant\u2019s contention and that the judgments, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b46-8\">CHAPMAN, C. J., TERRELL and ADAMS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
