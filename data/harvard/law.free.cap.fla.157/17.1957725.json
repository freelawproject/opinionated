This is all shown by the testimony of the plaintiff, appellant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">Therefore, it must be assumed that the Chancellor in the exercise of his judicial discretion denied relief to one who was admittedly an adulterous spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-17\">Upon this theory, the decree denying divorce is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AO\">CHAPMAN, C.
