In addition to claiming that the parties did not have a dating relationship, appellant contends that the trial court (1) erroneously denied his motion to dismiss the case, (2) erroneously granted the restraining order because his conduct was nonviolent, and (3) violated his First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and expression.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March 2013 a Tennessee court issued a protective order requiring appellant to stay away from and have no contact with respondent. The order expired in March 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2015 in the County of San Luis Obispo, respondent applied for a domestic violence restraining order against appellant. Respondent, a professional cyclist, declared that she had \"met [appellant] 2\u00bd years ago through cycling.\" She had been friends with him for several months. Appellant \"expressed an interest in moving forward in [the] relationship,\" but respondent \"informed [him] that [she] was not interested in moving forward ..., and [she] wanted to just be friends.\" \"One night, at 3:30 am, [appellant] came to [respondent's] house, banging on the door and windows.\" Thereafter, appellant repeatedly harassed respondent by sending text messages to her, posting her personal information and photos of her on Facebook, posting videos of her on YouTube, and sending \"private messages to individuals sharing personal information about [her].\" In text messages to respondent,\n   appellant called her a \"psycho evil witch\" and \"a compulsive liar\" who had \"lied\" about him and \"destroyed [his] life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The matter was set for a hearing on February 19, 2015. On that date, respondent's counsel appeared in court. Respondent was \"on a bicycle Tour in New Zealand.\" Appellant, who lived in Florida, appeared in propria persona via the telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the beginning of the hearing, appellant told the court: \"[M]y understanding is the [respondent] has chosen to be out of the country, knowing that the court date was today. I would ask that the court dismiss the case.\" The court did not rule on the motion. It put the matter over until 3:15 p.m. At that time, the court said, \"This case ... is going to take a lot longer.\" The court continued the hearing to February 26, 2015. Appellant did not object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 26, 2015, appellant again appeared in propria persona via the telephone. Respondent was personally present with her counsel. After extensive argument, the trial court found that \"there was a relationship [between the parties] that qualifies as a dating relationship and that the communications and interaction from [appellant] to [respondent] qualifies for a domestic violence restraining order protecting [respondent].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellant contends that, at the hearing on February 19, 2015, the trial court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss. But the court did not deny the motion. It never ruled on the motion, and appellant did not press for a ruling. He did not object to the continuance of the hearing to February 26, 2015. \"[H]is failure to press for a ruling [and to object to a continuance] waives the issue on appeal.

It is a social relationship between two individuals who have or have had a reciprocally amorous and increasingly exclusive interest in one another, and shared expectation of the growth of that mutual interest, that has endured for such\n   a length of time and stimulated such frequent interactions that the relationship cannot be deemed to have been casual.\" Based on this definition, the\n   <em>\n    Oriola\n   </em>\n   court determined that the plaintiff was not entitled to a DVPA restraining order because a dating relationship between the parties had not existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The legislature responded swiftly to\n   <em>\n    Oriola's\n   </em>\n   definition of \"dating relationship.\" In 2001 it passed Assembly Bill 362, enacting section 6210 which gave the phrase \"dating relationship\" a technical definition for purposes of the DVPA: \" 'Dating relationship' means frequent, intimate associations primarily characterized by the expectation of affection or sexual involvement independent of financial considerations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Stats. 2001, ch. 110, \u00a7 1.)

Respondent declared:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"We were friends for several months. During that time, we spent time together, dined out on occasion, and [appellant] stayed in my home for several days....\" Respondent sent a message to appellant stating that he had a strong emotional \"hold\" on her. She complimented him on a kiss that he had given her. In an email to appellant dated November 22, 2012, respondent said: \"[T]hat hug in the doorway and your hand on my lower back felt good.\" \"[T]he moments we were close (either wrestling on the couch, or when you were laying in bed with me), seemed more platonic, versus romantic.\" Respondent referred to \"[t]he time we've both invested to build our relationship over the past 7 months, ... strengthening our love and respect for each other.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In his communications with respondent after she had rebuffed his advances, appellant made clear that he considered their relationship to have been more than a mere friendship. He accused her of \"leading [him] on\" while she was dating someone else. Appellant wrote: \"What do u call telling me u love me but ur ... [with] someone else?\" \"You can combine all those [other] guys ..., and [they] still did not do for you what I did.\" \"Didn't you tell me you wld always remember me and what a huge impact I had on your heart and life?\" \"At least I wont hv to deal with u ever again.

At the hearing on February 26, 2015, appellant told the court that he thought \"[respondent] was falling in love with me.\" Appellant acknowledged that he had said to her, \" 'You really\n   couldn't understand why someone [i.e., appellant] loved you for just you without sex.' \" Although there is no evidence that the parties had sexual relations, appellant admitted that in December 2012 he had sent nude photographs of himself to respondent. The nude photographs are evidence of \"intimate associations\" and an \"expectation of ... sexual involvement\" within the meaning of section 6210. Appellant, however, stated to the court that \"[t]here was nothing inappropriate about\" the photographs, which had been taken when he \"was nude modeling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Respondent denied that her relationship with appellant involved \"dating\" as that term is commonly understood. In her application for a restraining order, she noted that the parties had \"discussed [the] possibility of dating.\" In her November 22, 2012 email to appellant, respondent said that they were \"just remaining friends\" and \"weren't dating, whether casually, socially, or non-committed dating.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court was not required to accept, and did not accept, respondent's characterization of the parties' relationship. Respondent never conceded that the parties did not have a \"dating relationship\" within the meaning of section 6210. Whether a dating relationship existed was a factual question to be decided by the trial court based upon all of the evidence. The trial court stated: \"[A]lthough in one portion [of the email respondent] says ... something about, 'We don't have a dating relationship,' you do have a relationship by this evidence. All of the evidence shows there was an expectation of affection or desire to have affection .... So although you guys may have called it 'We are not dating' or 'We don't want to date,' you certainly have all the attributes, it looks like, [of a dating relationship] under [section]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   6210 of the Family Code.\" When appellant protested that he had never actually gone on a date with respondent, the court replied: \"What I have seen in these papers is that you guys had lots of communication, that you actually stayed at her residence.... So that's where I'm seeing there was something more to this than to say, 'We never went on a date.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The trial court drew reasonable inferences from the evidence in concluding that there was a dating relationship. \"[A] finding based upon a reasonable inference ... will not be set aside by an appellate court unless it appears that the inference was wholly irreconcilable with the evidence.

Appellant has not demonstrated, as a matter of law, that the trial court erred in exercising its traditional power to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Claim of Nonviolent Conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In his opening brief appellant states: \"A record involving an indication of 'Domestic Violence' is a serious charge and has irreparable repercussions to a person's reputation. It is alarming that the [trial] court would rule against a male Appellant in this way when there was never any 'domestic' and never an occurrence of any 'violence' by Appellant. Domestic violence by definition is violent or aggressive behavior within the home, typically involving the violent abuse of a spouse or partner.... [\u00b6] The DVPA was created to protect people ... who have legitimate fears of physical harm from a domestic partner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At oral argument before this court, appellant complained that he is subject to a domestic violence restraining order even though his conduct was nonviolent. Appellant stated, \"I can't get a job with a domestic violence restraining order on my record. If they do a background check, it shows up and everybody thinks I'm a violent monster.... This isn't domestic violence. It should be a harassment civil suit....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Except for an incident in Wisconsin, the record contains no evidence of appellant's use or threatened use of physical force against respondent. The incident occurred in June 2013, when appellant was subject to the Tennessee protective order. Respondent declared that appellant had \"approached [her], grabbed [her] arm, and turned [her] around to talk to him.\" Respondent claimed that she has \"a documented police report for this incident in Wisconsin.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Whether or not respondent is reasonably fearful that appellant will physically harm her, there is no DVPA requirement of a physical threat. Thus, there is no basis for appellant's claim at oral argument, \"This isn't domestic violence.\" Nor is there any basis for the claim in his opening brief, \"The DVPA was created to protect people ... who have legitimate fears of physical harm from a domestic partner.\" \"Violence,\" as that word is commonly defined, is not a prerequisite for obtaining a restraining order under the DVPA. The dictionary definition of \"violence\" is \"the exertion of any physical force so as to injure or abuse.\" (Webster's 3d New Internat. Dict. (1981) p. 2554.) The DVPA, however, defines \"domestic violence\" as \"abuse.\" (\u00a7 6211.) \"Abuse is not limited to the actual infliction of physical injury or assault.\" (\u00a7 6203, subd. (b).) For purposes\n   of the DVPA, \"abuse\" means, inter alia, \"[t]o engage in any behavior that has been or could be enjoined pursuant to Section 6320.\" (\u00a7 6203, subd. (a)(4).) Section 6320, subdivision (a) permits the court to enjoin a party from \"harassing ... or disturbing the peace of the other party....\"\n   \" '[T]he plain meaning of the phrase \"disturbing the peace of the other party\" in section 6320 may be properly understood as conduct that destroys the mental or emotional calm of the other party....
