The 15-count indictment stemmed from a high-speed chase during which defendant rammed a truck into four police vehicles. Inasmuch as the indictment and the plea allocution establish that each instance of ramming a police vehicle was a separate and distinct act and neither was a material element of the other (see, Penal Law \u00a7 70.25 (2); <em>see also, People v Bryant, </em>92 NY2d 216, 230-231), we find no abuse of discretion in County Court imposing consecutive sentences. Finally, we find that the agreed-upon sentence was neither harsh nor excessive and find no extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence imposed in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Cardona, P. J., Peters, Spain, Carpinello and Graffeo, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
