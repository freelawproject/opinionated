(hereinafter Southland), and stepped into a pothole at the delivery area behind a store owned by the defendant Waldbaums. The plaintiffs failed to prove a prima facie case of negligence against Southland since they did not prove that Southland, an out-of-possession landlord, had actual or constructive notice of the alleged icy condition <em>(see, Simmons v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>84 NY2d 972). The evidence demonstrated that it was the franchisee\u2019s responsibility to keep the parking lot free of snow and ice. There was no evidence that Southland was told of the alleged icy condition in the 7-11 Store parking lot, or that its limited right of re-entry constituted constructive notice of alleged hazard on the premises <em>(see, Simmons v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., supra; Stark v Port Auth., </em>224 AD2d 681, 682).</p><p id=\"b492-6\">In addition, the plaintiffs failed to prove prima facie that Waldbaums had ownership, possession, or control over the area where the injured plaintiff allegedly fell such that it could be held liable <em>(see, Stackpoole v Knights of Columbus, </em>236 AD2d 532, 533; <em>Bentley v City of Amsterdam, </em>170 AD2d 725, 726; <em>Balsam v Delma Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>139 AD2d 292, 296). Moreover, there was no evidence to support the plaintiffs\u2019 theory that the use of the Town road by Waldbaums which accessed its delivery area constituted a special use thereof <em>(see, Balsam v Delma Eng\u2019g Corp., supra). </em>Bracken, J. P., Santucci, Krausman and Feuerstein, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
