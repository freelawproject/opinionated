However, the defendant\u2019s recitations, read as a whole and in context of the case (see, <em>People v McGowen, </em>42 NY2d 905), do not raise a viable justification defense to the crime to which he pleaded guilty, i.e., murder in the second degree based on a depraved indifference to human life (see, <em>People v Toxey, </em>86 NY2d 725, 726; <em>People v Lopez, </em>71 NY2d 662, 667). The allocution minutes demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s plea was entered knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently, and that he understood the crime to which he was pleading guilty.</p><p id=\"b675-4\">The defendant\u2019s purported waiver of his right to appeal his sentence was not valid (see, <em>People v Rose, </em>236 AD2d 637; <em>People v Rolon, </em>220 AD2d 543). Accordingly, we have examined the defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence was excessive but find it to be without merit (see, <em>People v Suitte, </em>90 AD2d 80). Mangano, P. J., Santucci, Krausman, Florio and H. Miller, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
