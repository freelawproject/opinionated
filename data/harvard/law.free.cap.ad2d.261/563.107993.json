Belkin was injured when her foot became caught in a two-inch gap in the riser of a staircase which was part of playground equipment on the premises of the Holbrook Road Elementary School, where she had taken her children to play.</p><p id=\"b605-10\">The defendants established that the playground equipment was built for young children according to specifications. The plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the design was inherently dangerous for its intended use is unsupported by legally-competent proof <em>(see, Prosser v County of Erie, </em>244 AD2d 942; <em>Pinzon v City of New York, </em>197 AD2d 680; <em>McCarthy v State of New York, </em>167 AD2d 516; <em>Dolan v City of New York, </em>5 AD2d 300).
