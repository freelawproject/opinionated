Kiel for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against them, and denied their cross motion for summary judgment.</p><p id=\"b503-11\">Ordered that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with one bill of costs to the respondents appearing separately and filing separate briefs.</p><p id=\"b504-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, the Supreme Court properly found that the plaintiff Mark E. Oraa was a volunteer, and therefore not entitled to the protection of Labor Law \u00a7\u00a7 200, 240 (1) and \u00a7 241 (6) (see, <em>Whelen v Warwick Val.
