In particular, we note plaintiffs repeated and transparently deliberate references to evidence that she was very clearly precluded from introducing, her extended arguments with the court in the presence of the jury, which included personal appeals for the jury\u2019s sympathy, and her frequent entreaties to the jury that she be compensated for the time spent in litigating the matter <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In light of this egregious behavior on plaintiffs part, we are unable to find that defendant received a fair trial. We therefore find that the verdict must be set aside and the matter remanded for a new trial. Concur \u2014 Ellerin, P. J., Lerner, Andidas and Saxe, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
