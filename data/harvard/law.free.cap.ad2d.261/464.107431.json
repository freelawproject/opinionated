The issues raised on the appeal from the order are brought up for review and have been considered on the appeal from the judgment (see, CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).</p><p id=\"b507-8\">The plaintiffs contend that the jury verdict which found that the defendant Ingrid S. Rodgers was negligent, but that her negligence was not a proximate cause of the plaintiff Louis Reuter\u2019s injuries is against the weight of the evidence. At trial, it was established that the injured plaintiff suddenly stepped into the road while looking to his right and without looking to his left. He stepped into the path of an oncoming vehicle that was traveling within the speed limit. The jury could have found that although Rodgers was negligent in failing to operate her vehicle in a safe and reasonable manner, the injured plaintiff was the sole proximate cause of his injuries. Thus, the verdict is supported by a fair interpretation of the evidence and should not be disturbed <em>(see, Keegan v Prout, </em>215 AD2d 629; <em>see also, Nicastro v Park, </em>113 AD2d 129, 134).</p><p id=\"b507-9\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions do not require reversal. S. Miller, J. P., Sullivan, Joy and Altman, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
