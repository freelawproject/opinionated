Ctr., </em>145 AD2d 474; <em>Wilson v State of New York, </em>112 AD2d 366). For liability to ensue, it must be shown that the medical provider\u2019s treatment decision was \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018something less than a professional medical determination\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Darren v Safier, supra, </em>at 474; <em>Davitt v State of New York, supra). </em>In this case, Dr. Frederick\u2019s decision on the evening of January 2, 1989, to allow the decedent to voluntarily enter the hospital the next morning was a professional medical determination. The mere fact that the claimant\u2019s expert would have opted for a different treatment, without more, \u201crepresents, at most, a difference of opinion among [medical providers], which is not sufficient to sustain a prima facie case of malpractice\u201d <em>(Darren v Safier, supra, </em>at 474; <em>see also, Topel v Long Is. Jewish Med. Ctr., </em>55 NY2d 682; <em>Krapivka v Maimonides Med. Ctr., </em>119 AD2d 801). Thompson, J. P., Sullivan, Joy and Schmidt, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
