Moreover, the plaintiff, Albert A. Jur\u00f3n, and the defendant Edward S. Minzner stipulated to have all issues regarding their respective financial interests in their former law firm resolved in the dissolution proceeding. Under these circumstances, any perceived inequity in the continued distribution of the assets of the former law firm must be raised and addressed in the context of the Westchester County proceeding. Therefore, the Supreme Court, Queens County, should have granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint in this action. Sullivan, J. P., Krausman, Florio and Smith, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
