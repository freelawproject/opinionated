We disagree. \u201cIt is well settled that the parties to a matrimonial agreement may condition a husband\u2019s obligation to support his wife solely on her refraining from living with another man without the necessity of the husband also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>proving that she habitually holds herself out as the other man\u2019s wife as Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 248 requires\u201d <em>(Pesa v Pesa, </em>230 AD2d 837; <em>see, Scharnweber v Scharnweber, </em>65 NY2d 1016). Upon our review of the record, we find that there was sufficient evidence demonstrating that the defendant resided with an unrelated male for either of the requisite periods set forth in the stipulation of settlement. Accordingly, there is no need for a hearing to aid in the determination of the plaintiffs motion.</p><p id=\"b649-4\">The plaintiff paid $59,200 in maintenance after making his motion. Therefore, since \u201c[h]e is entitled to recoup this payment by a credit offsetting any arrears\u201d <em>(Grossman v Merke-Grossman, </em>248 AD2d 670, 671), and since it is undisputed that as of the date of the hearing arrears totaled only $28,300, the payment of arrears in maintenance is also terminated.</p><p id=\"b649-5\">Pursuant to paragraph 22.4 of the agreement of the parties dated June 20, 1985, the party who prevails in litigation to enforce the agreement shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees from the other party. Accordingly, we remit the matter to the Supreme Court, Nassau County, for a hearing to determine the appropriate amount of counsel fees to be awarded to the plaintiff.</p><p id=\"b649-6\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit. O\u2019Brien, J. P., Goldstein, Luciano and Schmidt, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
