Appellants, Charles and Karen Melichar, sued Respondent, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d), for breach of contract, breach of implied warranty, and breach of express warranty after State Farm failed to pay for mold related damages to their home resulting from an accident. The district court issued a directed verdict in favor of State Farm. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-27\">The Melichars are homeowners in Boise. They previously maintained homeowner\u2019s insurance through State Farm. Two of the Melichars\u2019 past homeowner\u2019s policies are relevant to this case. The first relevant policy had a policy period of July 12, 2001, to July 12, 2002 (\u201cfirst homeowner\u2019s policy\u201d). The second relevant policy had a policy period of July 12, 2002 to July 12, 2003 (\u201csecond homeowner\u2019s policy\u201d). The two policies were identical except that the second homeowner\u2019s policy contained a mold exclusion endorsement, which excluded coverage of mold related losses occurring during the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-28\">On March 25, 2002, while the Melichars were vacationing in Arizona, their son cheeked on their house and discovered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>toilet had overflowed, which caused water damage to the property (\u201cMarch accident\u201d). Laurie Burlile, the Melichars\u2019 daughter-in-law, called the Melichars that day to advise them of the situation. The Melichars immediately contacted State Farm and informed it of the problem. State Farm proceeded to open a claim and determined that the damages were covered under the Melichars\u2019 policy. The Melichars\u2019 insurance agent advised them that the released water needed attention immediately. In response, the Melichars asked if State Farm \u201chad anybody that did that kind of thing.\u201d State Farm informed them that it had someone who could take care of it, and the Melichars verbally authorized State Farm to begin work on the house. At the time, State Farm maintained a \u201cPremier Service Program,\u201d which provided insureds who did not wish to procure their own contractor the option of selecting a participating State Farm-approved Premier Service Program contractor to perform repair work.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The next day, March 26, 2002, Laurie met at the Melichars\u2019 home with a State Farm insurance adjustor who recommended hiring a disaster company. When Laurie voiced no preference for a particular company, the adjustor contacted Western Building Maintenance (\u201cWestern\u201d), a State Farm-approved Premier Service Program contractor, to perform the repairs. Western arrived shortly thereafter, and either a representative of Western or State Farm asked Laurie to sign an \u201cauthorization to repair\u201d form. Laurie signed the form using her mother-in-law\u2019s signature, \u201cKaren Meliehar,\u201d and Western began performing repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The Melichars returned home on April 6, 2002, to find ongoing construction and repairs. Upon their return, they found a letter from State Farm, dated March 27, 2002, explaining the Premier Service Program (\u201cMarch 27 letter\u201d). The letter stated that the Melichars selected Western as the Premier Service Program contractor to perform the repairs on their home. On April 29, 2002, Charles Meliehar signed an \u201cauthorization to repair\u201d form, which acknowledged that the Melichars agreed to use the State Farm Premier Service Program and authorized Western to repair the damages resulting from the March accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Near the end of July 2002, the Melichars informed State Farm and Western of their concern regarding an outbreak of mold in their home. State Farm arranged for an industrial hygienist, Summit Environmental, Inc., to perform a mold and fungal evaluation of the house. Summit Environmental conducted the evaluation and prepared a report stating that portions of the home were impacted with mold growth, and recommended mold remediation. In August, Western began conducting the mold remediation and on December 13, 2002, Summit Environmental issued a post remedial report which stated that the mold was fully remediated. State Farm paid all expenses associated with the repairs and remediation resulting from the March accident up to this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">On or about December 24, 2002, the Melichars noticed that the floor near the washing machine was beginning to ridge and buckle. On December 26, they notified State Farm of the problem, and upon inspection State Farm learned that Western had improperly inserted a drain hose from the Melichars\u2019 washing machine into a wall cavity where there was no drain pipe. As a result, water from the washing machine had drained into the wall cavity causing structural and mold damage to the Melichars\u2019 property (\u201cDecember accident\u201d). On December 27, 2002, State Farm sent the Melichars a letter stating that the December accident resulted in a second loss that was subject to the Melichars\u2019 second homeowner\u2019s policy and, because it contained a mold exclusion endorsement, no coverage would be provided for \u201ctesting, remediation, or any other repairs in reference to mold or mildew damage in respect to the second loss.\u201d State Farm subsequently paid or offered to pay for the non-mold related damages arising from the December accident. However, when State Farm failed to pay for mold related damages resulting from the December accident, the Melichars sued, alleging breach of contract, breach of implied warranty, and breach of express warranty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The case went to trial and, upon the conclusion of the Melichars\u2019 case-in-chief, State Farm moved for a directed verdict. The district court granted State Farm\u2019s motion, finding that the damages sought \u2014 the cost associated with remediation of mold-related damage resulting from the December accident \u2014 constituted a second loss subject to the second homeowner\u2019s policy, which excluded coverage for such damages. The court further held that the Melichars presented no evidence that State Farm breached either an express or implied warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">We will address four issues in this opinion: (1) whether State Farm\u2019s failure to pay for remediation of the mold damage associated with the December accident constituted a breach of contract; (2) whether State Farm\u2019s failure to pay for such remediation constituted a breach of warranty; (3) whether the district court\u2019s award of costs to State Farm should be reversed; and (4) whether either party is entitled to an award of attorney fees or costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a directed verdict, this Court applies the same standard as does the trial court. <em>Gunter v. Murphy\u2019s Lounge, LLC, </em>141 Idaho 16, 27, 105 P.3d 676, 687 (2005). This Court does not defer to the district court\u2019s findings, but rather conducts an independent review of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>This Court \u201cmust determine whether, admitting the truth of the adverse evidence and drawing every legitimate inference most favorably to the opposing party, there exists substantial evidence to justify submitting the case to the jury.\u201d <em>General Auto Parts Co., Inc. v. Genuine Parts Co., </em>132 Idaho 849, 855, 979 P.2d 1207, 1213 (1999). A directed verdict will only be granted in favor of the moving party if the evidence presented is so clear that \u201call reasonable minds would reach only one conclusion: that the moving party should prevail.\u201d <em>Powers v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., </em>139 Idaho 333, 335, 79 P.3d 154, 156 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">The district court did not err in directing a verdict in favor of State Farm with respect to the breach of contract claim because under the policies\u2019 terms, the loss resulting from the December accident was subject to the second homeowner\u2019s policy. The Melichars argue that the district court erred in finding that two separate losses occurred under the policies\u2019 terms because it is reasonable to interpret all the damages in this case as a single, continuing loss resulting from the March accident, which State Farm is obligated to repair and replace under the first homeowner\u2019s policy. The Melichars\u2019 interpretation is contrary to the clear and unambiguous terms of the Melichars\u2019 homeowner\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">i.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">Whether an insurance policy is ambiguous is a question of law, which this Court freely reviews. <em>AMCO Ins. Co. v. Tri-Spur Inv. Co., </em>140 Idaho 733, 739, 101 P.3d 226, 232 (2004). A policy \u201cis ambiguous if \u2018it is reasonably subject to conflicting interpretations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cascade Auto Glass, Inc. v. Idaho Farm Bureau Ins. Co., </em>141 Idaho 660, 663, 115 P.3d 751, 754 (2005). Any ambiguities in an insurance policy must be construed against the insurer. <em>Farmers Ins. Co. of Idaho v. Talbot, </em>133 Idaho 428, 435, 987 P.2d 1043, 1050 (1999). However, where the policy language is clear and unambiguous, \u201ccoverage must be determined in accordance with the plain meaning of the words used.\u201d <em>Mutual of Enumclaw Ins. Co. v. Roberts, </em>128 Idaho 232, 235, 912 P.2d 119, 122 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">The parties dispute the meaning of the term \u201closs\u201d within the context of the homeowner\u2019s policies. Although the term \u201closs\u201d is not defined in the \u201cdefinitions\u201d section of either policy, the types of losses that will be covered under the policies are addressed in the \u201closses insured\u201d section:</p>\n<p id=\"b750-15\">COVERAGE A \u2014 DWELLING</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>We insure for <em>accidental direct physical loss </em>to the property described in Coverage A, except as provided in SECTION I\u2014 LOSSES NOT INSURED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">(italics added). The plain language of this section unambiguously establishes that the term \u201closs\u201d is contemplated by the policies to mean the resulting <em>physical </em>and <em>direct </em>damage caused by an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Additionally, the Melichars contend that the term \u201coccurs\u201d is ambiguous because it is undefined in the policies and is subject to multiple interpretations. The Melichars\u2019 homeowner\u2019s policies provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">1. Policy Period. This policy applies only to loss under Section I or bodily injury or property damage under Section II which <em>occurs </em>during the period this policy is in effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">(italics added) The term \u201coccurs\u201d is not further defined in the policies, but the mere fact that a term is undefined in a policy does not make that term ambiguous if it has a settled legal meaning. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, </em>P.A. <em>v. Dixon, </em>141 Idaho 587, 540, 112 P.3d 825, 828 (2005). It is well settled in Idaho that \u201cthe time of the <em>occurrence </em>of an \u2018accident,\u2019 within the meaning of a liability indemnity policy, is not the time the wrongful act was committed but the time the complaining party was actually damaged.\u201d <em>Millers Mut. Fire Ins. Co. of Texas v. Ed Bailey, Inc., </em>103 Idaho 377, 379, 647 P.2d 1249, 1251 (1982) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>National Aviation Underwriters, Inc. v. Idaho Aviation Ctr. Inc., </em>93 Idaho 668, 670, 471 P.2d 55, 57 (1970)). In <em>Millers Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>this Court adhered to the reasoning that \u201c[t]o stretch the scope of \u2018accident\u2019 backward in time to reach the date of the earliest beginning of any prior event which might be regarded as having a causal relation to the unlooked-for mishap would introduce ambiguity where none now exists.\u201d 103 Idaho at 380, 647 P.2d at 1252 (quoting <em>Home Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Hosfelt, </em>233 F.Supp. 368, 370 (D.Conn.1962)). Thus, even though the term \u201coccurs\u201d is not defined in the policy, our case law makes clear that an accident occurs during the policy period in which the policy holder was actually damaged, and not the period in which the event giving rise to the loss occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">The district court correctly concluded, after applying the policies\u2019 terms to the facts and circumstances in this case, that there were two separate losses \u2014 the first covered by the first homeowner\u2019s policy and the second covered by the second homeowner\u2019s policy. It is undisputed that the water released into the Melichars\u2019 home as a consequence of the March accident physically and directly caused damage to the Melichars\u2019 home and the July mold outbreak. Both the event directly causing the loss, the overflowing toilet, and the resulting loss itself, the structural and mold damages, occurred during the policy period of the Melichars\u2019 first homeowner\u2019s policy, which was effective from July 12, 2001, through July 12, 2002. Because the first homeowner\u2019s policy did not include a mold exclusion endorsement, State Farm paid for the repair and replacement of all the resulting damages, including the cost of mold remediation. It is also undisputed that the July mold outbreak was fully remediated prior to the December accident. In fact, the sole relief the Melichars seek in this case, and the only alleged covered expense the Melichars contend State Farm has failed to pay, is the cost associated with remediation of the mold damage that occurred as a result of the December accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">Contrary to the Melichars\u2019 assertions, the damages resulting from the December accident were subject to the second homeowner\u2019s policy. The physical and direct cause of the December mold outbreak was the water released in December from the improperly plumbed washing machine. The record reveals that sometime in December, as Western was concluding the remediation of the July mold, it improperly inserted a drain hose from the Melichars\u2019 washing machine into a wall cavity where there was no drain pipe, resulting in a water release, and a subsequent mold outbreak. Both the event directly causing the loss, the improper placement of the hose, and the resulting loss itself, the mold outbreak, occurred during the policy period of the second homeowner\u2019s policy, which was effective from July 12, 2002, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>through July 12, 2003. Undoubtedly, the December accident would not have occurred had Western not been present in the Melichars\u2019 home to repair the damages resulting from the March accident. However, while the water released as a result of the March accident may have been an <em>indirect </em>cause of the December accident, it certainly was not the <em>physical </em>and <em>direct </em>cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">In sum, the Melichars\u2019 argument that the December loss is a single, continuing loss resulting from the March accident because it is causally related is incongruous with both the policies\u2019 terms and this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>National Aviation Underwriters </em>and <em>Millers Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>The district court correctly concluded that the December accident resulted in a separate loss subject to the Melichars\u2019 second homeowner\u2019s policy, which excluded coverage for such damages. Therefore, State Farm did not breach either homeowner\u2019s policy by failing to pay for mold related damages resulting from the December accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The district court did not err in granting State Farm\u2019s request that a directed verdict be entered against the Melichars with respect to the breach of warranty claims. The Melichars argue that State Farm breached an express warranty contained in the March 27 letter by failing to require Western, pursuant to a pre-existing contract it had with Western, to provide the Melichars with a written warranty covering its work. The March 27 letter, which the Melichars received from State Farm regarding the Premier Service Program, provided that \u201c[y]our contractor will warranty their workmanship labor on building or structural repairs, for a five year period.\u201d Relying on this language, the Melichars assert that State Farm expressly warranted that Western would provide them with a written warranty covering their work. That Western did not provide a warranty to the Melichars in this ease is uneontested. However, State Farm did not warrant the repairs; it only indicated that the contractor would give a five-year warranty. Although the Melichars did not receive a warranty, for reasons that are disputed, their remedy was to pursue the contractor for improperly reconnecting the washing machine hose. The Melichars have already succeeded in that pursuit, having accepted an offer of judgment from Western for $50,000 in the early stages of this lawsuit, and they cannot now pursue State Farm because they did not recover as much as they thought they were entitled from Western. Thus, the district court did not err in entering a direct verdict against the Melichars with respect to the breach of express warranty claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">The Melichars further contend that State Farm breached the implied warranty of workmanlike performance. This Court has held that where a party provides personal services, a \u201cwarranty is implied that the services will be performed in a workmanlike manner.\u201d <em>Hoffman v. Simplot Aviation, Inc., </em>97 Idaho 32, 36, 539 P.2d 584, 588 (1975). Additionally, this Court adheres to the rule that \u201cprivity of contract is required in a contract action to recover economic loss for breach of implied warranty.\u201d <em>Salmon Rivers Sportsman Camps, Inc. v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>97 Idaho 348, 354, 544 P.2d 306, 312 (1975). In this case, Western provided the personal services necessary to repair the Melichars\u2019 home, not State Farm. Nevertheless, the Melichars argue that State Farm is hable for the implied warranty of workmanlike performance based on agency theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">As a general rule, independent contractors are not agents. <em>See Pinson v. Minidoka Highway Dist., </em>61 Idaho 731, 737, 106 P.2d 1020, 1022 (1940); 41 Am.Jur.2d <em>Independent Contractors </em>\u00a7 3 (1995). Whether a person employed to do certain work is an independent contractor or an employee turns on the amount of control the employer reserves over the individual. <em>See Id. </em>Where an employer controls the performance of the person employed to do certain work, as well as the result to be achieved, the servant is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>agent, and the employer will be liable for its authorized acts. <em>Id. </em>at 737, 106 P.2d at 1022. However, where the employer has no control over how the servant performs the contract, but retains control only as to the result to be achieved, the servant is an independent contractor. <em>Id. </em>The burden of proving a principal-agent relationship falls upon the party asserting agency. <em>Transamerica Leasing Corp. v. Van\u2019s Realty Co., </em>91 Idaho 510, 517, 427 P.2d 284, 291 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The evidence in the record establishes that State Farm lacked control over how Western performed the repairs of the Meliehars\u2019 home. The only agreement between State Farm and Western states that \u201c[t]he parties expressly agree that the Contractor shall be an independent contractor for all purposes in performance of this Agreement and that none of its employees or agents shall be considered an employee of State Farm for any purpose.\u201d Furthermore, representatives from State Farm testified that it did not control the work of Western, and one of Western\u2019s co-owners testified that State Farm did not control when it worked, nor did it ever direct Western\u2019s work. Given this evidence, the Meliehars failed to establish that an agency relationship existed between State Farm and Western and, therefore, the district court did not err in granting State Farm\u2019s request that a directed verdict be entered against the Meliehars with respect to breach the implied warranty of workmanship performance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The district court awarded State Farm costs in the amount of $15,854.35 based upon the court\u2019s finding that State Farm was the prevailing party. The Meliehars request on appeal that the district court\u2019s award of costs be vacated if the district court\u2019s holding is reversed. Because we affirm the district court, the Meliehars\u2019 request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Both parties request attorney fees on appeal. The Meliehars request attorney fees pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 41-1839(1). Because State Farm has not failed to pay an amount \u201cjustly due,\u201d we decline to make an award. State Farm requests attorney fees on appeal pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 41-1839(4), which provides the authority for an award of attorney fees when a court finds that the case was \u201cbrought, pursued, or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 41-1839(4) provides a basis for an award of attorney fees to either the insured or the insurer. Nothing in the record suggests that this appeal was frivolous or unreasonable. Therefore, State Farm\u2019s request for attorney fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">The decision of the district court is affirmed. Neither party is awarded attorney fees on appeal. State Farm is entitled to costs on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b753-15\">Chief Justice SCHROEDER, and Justices TROUT, EISMANN and BURDICK concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\">. The Melichars initially filed suit against both State Farm and Western. Prior to trial however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>the Melichars accepted Western\u2019s offer of judgment pursuant to Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 68 for $50,000. Western was subsequently dismissed from the suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\">. Because we hold that the March 27 letter did not create an express warranty from State Farm to the Melichars, we need not address the Melichars\u2019 concern as to whether the letter was part of their policy or a stand alone contract. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>vided in such policy, certificate or contract, to pay to the person entitled thereto the amount justly due under such policy, certificate or contract, shall in any action thereafter brought against the insurer in any court in this state for recovery under the terms of the policy, certificate or contract, pay such further amount as the court shall adjudge reasonable as attorney's fees in such action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
