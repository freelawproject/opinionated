Sara Buckley, Mercer\u2019s niece, witnessed the battery. While Mercer was in custody on the battery charge, he called Buckley and threatened her and her family\u2019s safety and attempted to dissuade her from testifying against him. Based on the statements made in the call, the State charged Mercer with intimidating a witness in a criminal proceeding under Idaho Code \u00a7 18-2604(3). The case went to a jury trial and after the State rested, Mercer moved for an acquittal pursuant to I.C.R. 29(a). Mercer argued the State failed to present any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>evidence that his threats had the actual effect of preventing Buckley from testifying fully, freely and truthfully, as Buckley ultimately testified against Mercer on the battery charge. The district court denied the motion, ruling that I.C. \u00a7 18-2604(3) did not require the State to prove Mercer\u2019s threats affected the witness\u2019 testimony. The matter was submitted to the jury and Mercer was found guilty of intimidating a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Mercer appealed the denial of his motion for acquittal and his case was assigned to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction, holding that under the plain language of I.C. \u00a7 18-2604(3), a failed attempt to influence a witness is, in fact, a violation of the statute. Mercer then filed a Petition for Review, which was granted by this Court. Two other issues were raised on appeal, including whether the jury was properly instructed on a lesser included offense and whether Mercer\u2019s sentence was improper because certain facts were not found by the jury or admitted by Mercer. While the Order on Review stated that this Court would consider all issues, the parties have only raised and argued the first issue, whether the district court erred in denying Mercer\u2019s motion for acquittal. In this circumstance, the opinion of the Court of Appeals remains in effect with respect to the other two issues raised on appeal, which we do not address.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, the appellate court must independently consider the evidence in the record and determine whether a reasonable mind could conclude that the defendant\u2019s guilt as to such material evidence of the offense was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Grube, </em>126 Idaho 377, 386, 883 P.2d 1069, 1078 (1994). \u201cThe determination of the meaning of a statute and its application is a matter of law over which this [C]ourt exercises free review.\u201d <em>Woodburn v. Manco Prods., Inc., </em>137 Idaho 502, 504, 50 P.3d 997, 999 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"Axo\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">\u201cWhere the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, legislative history and other extrinsic evidence should not be consulted for the purpose of altering the clearly expressed intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>State v. Hart, </em>135 Idaho 827, 829, 25 P.3d 850, 852 (2001). \u201cIn construing statutes, the plain, obvious and rational meaning is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow hidden sense.\u201d <em>Higginson v. Westergard, </em>100 Idaho 687, 691, 604 P.2d 51, 55 (1979). In determining the ordinary meaning of a statute \u201ceffect must be given to all the words of the statute if possible, so that none will be void, superfluous, or redundant.\u201d <em>In re Winton Lumber Company, </em>57 Idaho 131, 136, 63 P.2d 664, 666 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">Idaho Code \u00a7 18-2604(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-12\">Any person who, by direct or indirect force, or by any threats to person or property, or by any manner willfully intimidates, influences, impedes, deters, threatens, harasses, obstructs or prevents, a witness, including a child witness, or any person who may be called as a witness or <em>any person he believes may be called as a witness </em>in any criminal proceeding or juvenile evidentiary hearing from testifying freely, fully and truthfully in that criminal proceeding or juvenile evidentiary hearing is guilty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">Mercer argues that a violation of I.C. \u00a7 18-2604(3) requires the State to prove a defendant\u2019s words or actions, in actuality, \u201cprecluded\u201d a witness \u201cfrom testifying freely, fully and truthfully.\u201d He argues that the statute does not cover a failed attempt to alter or prevent the witness\u2019 testimony. Mercer\u2019s argument, however, disregards the plain language of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-2604(3), which does not require a defendant to actually prevent a potential witness from properly testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">First, the language in the statute creates a purposeful distinction between a person who <em>\u201cmay </em>be called\u201d as a witness and a person the defendant <em>\u201cbelieves may </em>be called\u201d as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>witness. Under the statute, a person the defendant <em>\u201cbelieves may </em>be called\u201d as a witness refers to someone who may not actually be called; otherwise, this category of witness would be interchangeable with any person who <em>\u201cmay </em>be called\u201d to testify. The fact the statute criminalizes intimidation directed at a person neither party intended to call as a witness, but rather, who the defendant simply believes may be called, belies the argument that the State must prove a defendant\u2019s threats had an actual effect on the victim\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Mercer relies heavily on the 1993 amendment to I.C. \u00a7 18-2604(3) that specifically removed the \u201cattempt\u201d language from the statute, to support his argument that the statute requires an actual effect on the witness\u2019 testimony. The 1993 amendment modified I.C. \u00a7 18-2604(3) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">Any person, who by direct or indirect force, or by any threats to person or property, or by any manner willfully intimidates, influences, impedes, deters, threatens, harasses, obstructs or prevents, or attempts-to-intimidate, influence, impede,deter, threaten, harass, obstr-uct-or \u2014 prevent a witness or any person he believes has-been-er <em>who </em>may be called as a witness <em>or any person he believes may be called as a witness </em>in any criminal proceeding from testifying freely, fully, and truthfully in that criminal proceedings is guflty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">I.C. \u00a7 18-2604(3) (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The attempt language, however, simply became unnecessary when the legislature added a new category of potential victims, i.e., any person the defendant \u201cbelieves may be called\u201d as a witness, but who is not actually called. This additional language supports our view that it is unnecessary for the defendant\u2019s threats to have an actual effect on the witness\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Secondly, it is the defendant\u2019s actions combined with an intent to intimidate a witness in a criminal proceeding, <em>not </em>the effect on the witness, that constitutes the crime. Mercer focuses on the phrase \u201cfrom testifying freely, fully and truthfully\u201d to support his argument that the State must prove his actions had an impact on the witness\u2019 testimony. Reading the statutory provision in its entirety, however, it is clear this clause simply refers to the defendant\u2019s state of mind. The defendant must act with the intent of intimidating a witness \u201cfrom testifying freely, fully and truthfully,\u201d in a criminal proceeding. There is no requirement that the defendant is ultimately successful in his efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Finally, under Mercer\u2019s reading of the statute, in order to prosecute a defendant, the victim witness would have to first commit perjury, or otherwise not testify freely, fully or truthfully and <em>then </em>admit to it, or the State would have to somehow prove that its own witness, in essence, lied on the stand. It is illogical to read the statute to include such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mercer\u2019s motion for acquittal under I.C.R. 29(a).</p>\n<judges id=\"b148-14\">Chief Justice SCHROEDER and Justices EISMANN, BURDICK and JONES concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
