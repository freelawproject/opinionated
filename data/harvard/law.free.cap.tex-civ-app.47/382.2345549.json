It can be resorted to only when the premises is habitually used, actual, threatened and contemplated use, and not when they were used for gaming months before. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Supplement to Sayles\u2019 Texas Civil Statutes, title 50b., page 257; Whitaker v.

The court overruled the demurrers, and on final hearing rendered judgment perpetually enjoining appellants as prayed for by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Appellants\u2019 principal complaint is at the action of the court in overruling their demurrers. It is insisted that the petition is insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>in that it alleges convictions for gaming long prior to the institution of the suit, without showing the nature of the game. We do not regard the allegations referred to as essential to the sufficiency of the petition. The material allegations are those quoted by us above, arid those now under consideration seem to be in the nature merely of evidence tending to support the material complaint. The antecedent convictions were but circumstances illustrative of the use appellants had been making of the premises, which, together with other evidence that was offered; was relevant to the issue of the threatened use charged, and, while it may not be good pleading for the pleader to set forth his evidence, no such objection is here made, and we fail to see why we should hold the petition bad in its entirety because of such fault.</p>\n<p id=\"AFA\">Again, it is urged that the petition should have described the games sought to be inhibited, and negatived exceptions to the gaming statute relating to private residences, the contention being that under article 379 of the Penal Code of Texas it is no offense to play at a game of cards at a private residence occupied by a family. It is to be observed, however, that the evident purpose of the Act of the Legislature, as well as of the suit, was to prevent the progress and continued commission of a specified class-of crimes, and not to convict and punish for a single offense already committed, and in the very nature of the case, we apprehend, the same strictness of pleading and proof is not required in the first instance as in the last. An act already committed is susceptible of precise proof, and hence of averment. But it does not seem so easy to specify or describe an act merely threatened or in contemplation. It may be committed in any one or more of the many ways in which our gaming laws can be violated, and therefore the material fact charged in the petition under consideration\u2014the <em>factum </em>probandum\u2014is that the defendants are actually contemplating\u2014threatening\u2014to use the specified premises for the purpose of gaming and of keeping and exhibiting games prohibited by the laws of Texas. If so, it is not material that the premises may be a private residence. In article 380 of the Penal Code it is declared that \u201call gaming houses\u201d are included within the meaning of places at which it is unlawful to play at a game of cards. And in referring to games, gaming tables or banks, prohibited by article 3'82, article 383 of the same code declares that it was \u201cintended by the foregoing article (article 382) to include every species of gaming device known by the name of table or bank, of every kind whatever, this provision shall be construed to include any and all games which in common language are said to be played, dealt, kept or exhibited.\u201d Why, then, should the cause of the plaintiff in the action be unnecessarily incumbered and imperiled by requiring technical descriptions of the premises in question or of the games threatened ? All places and all games prohibited by law, and of which all persons are presumed to know, are included within the beneficial purposes of the Act of the Legislature under consideration, and a petition in the form of the present ong, charging substantially in the language of the Act, is, in our judgment, sufficient. All assignments which call in question the sufficiency of appellee\u2019s petition are accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">But one other assignment is presented, and that is that \u201cthe court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>erred in rendering judgment for the plaintiff perpetuating the im junction, for the reason the same is contrary to the law and the evidence in the case.\u201d Neither the assignment nor the propositions thereunder specif}\u2019 the fact or facts in issue which the evidence is insufficient to prove, as required by the statute and rules, and hence are too general to require consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">We conclude that the judgment must be affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
