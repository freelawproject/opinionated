The bill in this cause was filed to foreclose a mortgage executed by the defendant Boynton to one Haskins. After the execution of the mortgage, Boynton conveyed his equity of redemption in the mortgaged premises to trustees for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the benefit of creditors. The trustees sold the premises at auction. They first put up for sale a house and lot, and it was publicly stated that it would be sold free of incumbrances. The defendant Yandenburgh became the purchaser. The residue of the mortgaged premises were then sold, and it was also publicly stated that they would be sold subject to the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. The defendant Slade became the purchaser. Q,uit claim deeds were executed to the purchasers respectively, by the trustees. No mention of the incumbrance was made in either deed. Subsequently Slade sold and conveyed to the defendants Fake and Norton a small piece of the land purchased by him. It appeared that he had agreed to execute to them a warranty deed; but the deed in fact executed by him contained no covenants of warranty.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>(a) </em>Affirmed, at the general term in Albany, January 3d, 1848.

But he has suffered the bill to be taken as confessed, and does not now deny that his portion of the premises is first chargeable with the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>of the mortgage. I do not think, therefore, that he should be personally charged with any part of the costs. He purchased Boynton\u2019s equity of redemption with full knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, and subject to the further condition that the portion of the premises purchased by him. was to be first liable for the satisfaction of the mortgage. He in effect agreed that his part of the premises should be liable to indemnify Vandenburgh against the lien of the mortgage upon that part of the premises purchased by him. But he did not agree to become personally liable for the payment of the mortgage, or to indemnify Vandenburgh. The latter would have had the right, in order to relieve his own property from the incumbrance of the mortgage, to file a bill against Slade and the plaintiff, for the purpose of having the mortgage paid off, or of having the premises purchased by Slade subject to its payment sold, to satisfy the mortgage. In such case, the costs of the proceeding would, I think, have been chargeable upon the premises liable in equity for the payment of the mortgage and the indemnity of Vandenburgh. And I see no reason why, upon this bill filed by the owner of the mortgage to have it satisfied, the premises liable in equity to indemnify Vandenburgh should not be charged with the payment of the costs he has necessarily incurred in protecting his equitable rights. For the same reason, I think Fake and Norton are entitled to indemnity, so far as it can be provided, out of the proceeds of the premises retained by Slade when he sold to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">The decree in this case must, therefore, contain special instructions to the officer making the sale, directing him first to sell that part of the mortgaged premises purchased by Slade at the trustees\u2019 sale, except so much as was subsequently sold to Fake and Norton, and after paying out of the proceeds, the expenses of the sale, that the amount due the plaintiff for debt and costs be first paid; then the costs of the defendant Vandenburgh ; and lastly the costs of the defendants Fake and Norton. If the proceeds of the premises shall be insufficient to pay the plaintiff\u2019s debt and costs, and the costs of the defendant Vandenburgh, then that part of the mortgaged premises sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>by Slade to Fake and Norton is to be next sold for that purpose ; and if after applying the proceeds of that parcel, a deficiency still remains due to the plaintiff, then the premises purchased by Vandenburgh, at the trustees\u2019 sale, are to be sold to pay such deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-6\">If the parties prefer it, the decree may name some suitable person as referee to make the sale, instead of the sheriff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
