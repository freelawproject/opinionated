Judge, at the Saratoga circuit in December* 1846. A trial was had before a justice of the peace, between Abraham K. Underhill as plaintiff, and William V. R. Taylor as defendant; who is the defendant in this suit. On that trial the plaintiff in this suit was a witness on the part of the plaintiff in that suit. Soon after that trial, the defendant, in a conversation with William L. Taylor, said to him of the plaintiff, that he had sworn to a lie. After the plaintiff had proved the speaking of the slanderous words, the counsel for the defendant offered to prove, as a circumstance tending to mitigate damages, \u201c that immediately after the trial before the justice, and before the words charged were spoken, Abraham K. Underhill, the defendant in that s\u00fait, and the father and next friend of the plaintiff in this suit* addressed irritating and taunting language to the defendant Taylor, and said that he had good witnesses in his family.\u201d The circuit judge excluded the evidence, and the counsel for the defendant excepted. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff. And the defendant moved for a new trial, on a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-7\"><em>Wm.

Underhill did address irritating language to the defendant, it furnished the defendant with no apology, for afterwards, in a conversation with William V. R. Taylor, uttering slanderous words of the plaintiff. On the return of the summons before the justice, William W R. Taylor, the plaintiff therein named, did not appear in person, but Hervey Edwards appeared for him, without objection, and joined issue with Abraham K. Underhill, the defendant in that suit; and on the trial the plaintiff appeared in person. After the evidence in this cause, on the part of the plaintiff, was closed, the defendant moved the judge to nonsuit the plaintiff; and assigned as cause for the motion, \u201c that it appeared from the evidence, that the testimony of the plaintiff was extra-judicial; Taylor not having appeared in the cause before the justice on the joining of issue, and no evidence of Edwards\u2019 authority having been produced before the magistrate.\u201d The judge denied the motion, and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. The judge rightfully denied the motion. Taylor appeared in person on the trial of the issue, which Edwards had joined for him. This was abundant evidence that Edwards had authority to join the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The motion for a new trial must be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
