To this declaration, a plea of the general isuue was inter-posed by the defendant below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>After trial in the court of common pleas, the case was appealed to the supreme court; and during the pendency of the case in the latter court-, the death of Cooley was suggested, and his administrator was made party, according to the statute in such case made and provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-5\">At the last term of the court in Hamilton county, the case was submitted to a jury, and a verdict returned for the plaintiff, upon which judgment was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\">A bill of exceptions was then tendered by the defendant below, now plaintiff in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-7\">This bill of exceptions shows that on the trial of the case, the deposition of Calvin C. Cooley was offered in evidence, by the defendant in error. This deposition was taken during the lifetime of Peter Cooley, but it was now objected to, on the ground that the deponent was the son and heir-at-law of Peter Cooley, deceased, and as such heir was interested in the event of the suit, although not interested at the time the deposition was taken. The objection was overruled by the court, ai.d the deposition read to the jury. To this opinion of the. court, the pla-intiffin error excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-8\">The error assigned and relied upon is, that the court, in ad mitting this testimony, mistook the law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-9\"><em>Storer </em>&amp; Gwynne, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-10\">The original action here sought to be reviewed, was brought by Cooley against Lewis and Hiram Eagin. Hiram Eagin and Peter Cooley, subsequently deceased, and Nathaniel Montgom ery, administrator of Peter Cooley, was made party plaintiff. On the trial of the cause, the deposition of C. C. Cooley, a son of Peter Cooley, was admitted by the court, and was, in truth, the sole evidence for the plaintiff. In admitting this deposition, we claim the court erred. It is conceded that the deposition was taken before Peter Cooley\u2019s death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-11\">This witness, being the son, was entitled, in whole or in part, as distributee, to his father\u2019s estate. No will was made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>father; no evidence was offered by the plaintiff that the father\u2019s estate was insolvent. The testimony of the witness, therefore, had the effect to transfer money into his own pocket. If presented on the stand to testify, he would clearly have been incompetent. <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>8 Wend. Rep. 542 ; <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>Garland, </em>2 Hayw. Rep. 147.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-5\">The rule in England is well established, that the deposition of a witness who becomes interested in the event of the suit, cannot be admitted in a case at law. 1 Phil. on Ev. 364; Bull. N. P. 242; <em>Tilley's case, </em>1 Salk. 286; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Fairfax, </em>1 Str. 101; <em>Holcroft &amp; Smith, </em>1 Eq. Cas. Abr. 224. Such depositions have sometimes been read in cases in chancery. 2 Vern. 699 <em>; </em>S. C. 1 P. Wms. 287; 2 Atk. 615; 2 Ves. 42. But no case can be produced in England, where they have been permitted in the trial of an action at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-6\">In <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Read, </em>4 Yeates Rep. 512, the deposition of a witness in life, who became interested after bringing the suit, and after giving his deposition, was held to be inadmissible; and in <em>Chess </em>v. <em>Chess, </em>17 Serg. &amp; R. 412, this rule was held to be clearly settled in Pennsylvania. It cannot, we suppose, make any difference in the rule, whether the witness does or does not become actually a party on the record, as administrator, if he is the party really interested as distributee. In 1 Greenleaf on Ev. 206, Mr. Greenleaf makes some remarks in favor of admitting the deposition at law, but he admits no express authority has been found for reading the deposition. As was said in 4 Yeates 512, the rules of chancery, as to evidence, have never been adopted at law, otherwise the conscience of the defendant might be purged at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-7\">In <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Eddy, </em>1 Mass. Rep. 1, the deposition of a party taken in the original cause, was admitted in the review of the case, after some hesitation, on the ground that the law required the same testimony to be heard on the review, as was offered in the original cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-8\">In <em>Jones v. Scott, </em>2 Ala. Rep. 58, the deposition, taken be fore the interest was acquired, was excluded. In <em>Le Baron </em>v <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>Crombie, </em>14 Mass. Rep. 236, the court, per Parker, C. J., held that the testimony given by a witness in a former trial of the same case, the witness having been in the meantime convicted of an infamous offense, was not to be received, and recognized the rule above stated as prevailing in England, that a supervening interest excludes the deposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-5\">Apart from other wide differences between the practice at law and in chancery, this distinction may be pointed out between depositions, in tribunals acting under the different systems. All evidence in chancery is by deposition. The evidence of a witness in chancery stands, as of the day when it is taken, to be used whenever the hearing of the cause comes on. A deposition at law is only admissible in certain cases, where the witness is ancient or very infirm, resides out of the county, or intends to leave before the time of trial. When the deposition is taken, it is not certain that it will, or can be used on the trial; it is, in realty, taken <em>de bene esse. </em>If, at the tri al, the witness has ceased to be infirm, or is within the county, he must be present in court. This fact shows, that the deposi tion speaks as of the day of trial, and the right of the witness to testify must be governed by his interest at that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-6\">If the witness happens then to be a non-resident, or out o\u00ed the county, he certainly stands in no better position than if Ik were present. If present, he could not testify ; and yet it is said that, although he cannot open his mouth, something before-taken from his lips shall be read to the jury, perhaps in his presence. This is placing the witness as if he were dead \u2014 recognizing a death, such as no authority has contemplated. The doctrine is an interpolation on the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-7\">Professor Greenleaf has carried the doctrine to its limit; for certainly, if it prevails, whatever evidence the interested witness gave orally on a former trial, may be offered in a subsequent trial, in his own behalf, if any one can be found who remembers it. The attempt to go as far as this has, we venture to say, never been made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>It will be borne in mind, that the position in which C. O. Cooley stands has not been the act of the defendant. He has assumed it, to be sure, by the act of the law, but we have a right to say, not involuntarily; for he might very easily have released his interest, and made himself competent. But he does not do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-5\">We admit that a witness cannot deprive a party of his testitimony, by rendering himself incompetent. This rule goes upon the principle that a door would thus be opened to fraud and injustice. It does not apply where the witness becomes a party interested in, and who receives part of the fruits of, the suit. Nor does it extend to a case where the interest devolves on the witness by act of law, or by an accident happening without his agency \u2014 2 J. J. Marsh. Rep. 332-3 ; 1 Greenlf. on Ev., \u00a7 167\u2014 or where the interest is acquired <em>bona </em>fide, in the usual and lawful course of business. 1 Greenlf. on Ev., \u00a7 167, \u00a7 418. If a witness acquires a subsequent interest, by the act of the party producing the witness, he is disqualified. <em>1 </em>Greenlf. on Ev., \u00a7 418.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-6\">The position of Professor Greenleaf, on this subject, is contradictory. While, in \u00a7 167, he treats of those cases in which proof of former testimony of a Witness may be admitted, and admits, that if he becomes interested in the subject-matter <em>bona \u25a0fide, </em>he cannot testify, unless he releases his interest, and that the same principle applies to an interest arising by operation of law, upon the happening of an uncertain event, such as the death of an ancestor, he yet, in \u00a7 168, intimates that a former deposition should be received in a case at law. Surely, the same rule which admits the deposition, would admit proof of what the witness had before stated orally, while under oath.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-7\">Had C. O. Cooley, in this case, been presented on the stand as a witness, we might have examined him on his <em>voire dire. </em>Having then disclosed his interest, he must have been rejected ; and so, we think, should his testimony have been, whether oral or written.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>Fox &amp; French, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-5\">We maintain the witness had no interest in the result of the suit at the time his deposition was given; his father was then living, and of course he had no more interest in the result of the suit than any other child or servant has in his father\u2019s or mother\u2019s business. 1 Greenleaf Ev., <em>\u00a7 </em>386..</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-6\">The interest to exclude a witness must be a present, certain and vested, not an uncertain and contingent one. Hence <em>\u201c </em>the heir-apparent to an estate is a competent witness in support of the claim of his ancestor.\u201d 1 Greenleaf Ev., <em>\u00a7 </em>390.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-7\">The interest must exist at the time the witness is examined; a subsequently acquired interest is not sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-8\">This must of course be the case where the witness is examined in open court; the same rule holds where a deposition is taken. The reason why an interested witness cannot testify is, because the law will not hold out any temptation to the witness. Of course that reason only holds where the interest is vested and certain when the witness is examined. That is the time when he will, if at any time, be affected by his interest. If he has no interest when examined, .of course it cannot affect his testimony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-9\">In <em>\u00a7 </em>168, 1 Greenleaf Ev., this question is discussed, and the writer shows that it is well settled that a deposition taken in a chancery cause is admissible if taken while the witness was not interested, and says \u201c the analogies of the law are altogether in favor of admitting the evidence.\u201d He also says that, in 17 Serg. &amp; Rawle 412, it was conceded there is no reason for any distinction ; but the practice had been otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-10\">On the same principle, we maintain that our practice in Ohio has always been to admit the deposition if taken while the witness had no interest in the result of the suit. We have then the practice established in Ohio at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-11\">The reason of the thing itself, and the practice in chancery, all uniting to sustain the opinion of the court delivered on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>circuit, viz: \u201c That the deposition of a party taken when he had no interest may he read in the same cause after he acquires an interest in the result of the suit by the death of Ms father.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-4\">But we maintain farther, it was the duty of the plaintiffs in error to have shown that the witness was in fact interested in the result of the suit. We show he was not interested at the time; if the plaintiffs object to the testimony, they must show that the witness had since become interested; is that shown merely by proving him to be a child of the original plaintiff?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-5\">By the law of Ohio, the widow and the children are entitled to an allowance for a year\u2019s support; and if a child can claim any thing, as heir, must he not first show the estate was solvent, and more than sufficient to pay the allowance to the widow, etc. ? If the heir must show these facts in order to recover, must not any other person, who attempts to show an interest, prove the same facts ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-6\">We claim, therefore, that the deposition was clearly admissi ble under both views of the ease.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b48-7\">Hitchcock, J.</author>\n<p id=\"And\">The simple question which arises in this case is, whether in the trial of an action at law, the deposition of a witness, Avhich was taken while the witness was disinterested, can be read in evidence, if at the time of trial he is interested in the result of the suit. That under such circumstances, a deposition might be read on the hearing of a case in chancery, I suppose there can be no . doubt. The authorities are numerous to show that, in chancery, an interest cast upon the witness, subsequent to his giving his deposition, will not of necessity operate to exclude that deposition from the consideration of the court. In the 168th section of the first volume of Greenleaf\u2019s Evidence, the author says: \u201c If in cases of disqual ifying interest, the witness has previously given a deposition in the cause, the deposition may be read in chancery, as if he were since deceased, or insane, or otherwise incapacitated. It may also be read upon the trial at law, of an issue out of chan eery. In other trials .at law, no express authority has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>found for reading the deposition; and it has been said that the course of practice is otherwise; but no reason is given, and the analogies of the law are altogether in favor of admitting the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">It was in consequence of this <em>dictum </em>that I advised the admission of the deposition excepted to in the ease now before the court, and afterward for the purpose of bringing the question before a full court, rinited in the allowance of a writ of error. It is true, as the learned author says, that no express authority had been found for reading the deposition under such circumstances, but numerous authorities are found establishing a contrary rule. Some of these authorities are cited in the ar gument of counsel for the plaintiff in error, and would seem to be conclusive upon the point; and' there is, to say the least of it, some reason why a different rule should prevail. In trials at law, witnessess must, as a general rule, be examined in open court. It is only under peculiar circumstances that depositions can be read. If Calvin C. Cooley had heen within the jurisdiction of the court, and offered as a witness, he must have been excluded on the ground of interest; and it would seem to be inconsistent to admit the deposition of a witness, who could not, at the time the deposition is offered, be admitted to testify. The admission or rejection of the testimony would be made to depend, not upon the competency of the witness, but upon the fact whether he was or was not within the jurisdiction of the court. Upon consideration, the court are of opinion that it is safer to rely upon the uniform authority of adjudicated cases, rather than upon the opinion of an elementary writer.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">But it is urged by counsel for defendant in error, that the interest of the witness in this case - is not such as to exclude him, because, from aught that appears, the estate of the father may be insolvent, and it is urged that it was the duty of the objector to show that it was not insolvent. We think otherwise. Upon the death of the father, his heirs acquire a direct mterest in his estate. It is the same interest which he had in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>his lifetime, although their claims must be postponed to those of creditors. In the prosecution of a suit, either in favor of or against the personal representatives, if any of the heirs are offered as witnesses, the law will presume them to be interested until the contrary appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The judgment of the supreme court is reversed, and the cause remanded to the county of Hamilton for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
