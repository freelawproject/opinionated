Warrick Martin &amp; Co. had frequently, from time to time, forwarded to defendant notes and bills for collection, and upon receiving payment thereof, the defendant credited Warrick Martin &amp; Co. in their account on his.books, with the amount collected, and the same was from time to time paid to Warrick Martin &amp; Co., upon their checks, or by remittances. Statements of accounts were from time to time transmitted by one party to the other, showing how the accounts stood between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-4\">On the 11th day of February, 1848, Warrick Martin &amp; Co. were indebted to the defendant, on their account with him, in a balance of $162.70, and so continued indebted until the 24th day of March following, when their indebtedness was increased $70.37, the amount on that day advanced and paid to them by defendant, at Pittsburgh, as above mentioned. And on the 18th day of April, their indebtedness w;as increased by the further charge of $3.24, for premiums, making in the whole the sum of $-. The defendant made no other advances or payments to Warrick Martin &amp; Co., after the 11th day of February, 1848, than those above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-7\">On the 7th day of April, 1848, the defendant received an order from Warrick Martin &amp; Co. (who in the meantime, having failed, had suspended business), directing him to return the bill to the plaintiff, which the defendant declined to do. He claimed that, according to the course of dealing between himself and Warrick Martin &amp; Co., he had a right to retain the bill until the balance of accounts due to him from them was paid, he having then, on the 7th day of April, for the first time received notice that any other person than themselves claimed any interest in the bill, or its proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-8\">On the receipt of the bill by the-clerk of the defendant, it was by him presented to the drawers, who accepted it, and the same was afterward, on the 20th day of April, 1848, paid by them to the defendant, and the amount thereof, $114.04, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>passed to the credit of Warrick Martin &amp; Co., on his books, the defendant claiming to retain 'the money on account of the balance due from them to him on the account current between them, as above mentioned. No consideration was paid by defendant for said bill, other than that which arose from the char acter of the dealings between him and Warrick Martin &amp; Co., as before stated, and of which the plaintiff had not notice, other than the fact that Warrick Martin &amp; Co. were exchange and money-brokers, as before stated. No credit was given by Kearney to said Warrick Martin &amp; Co., for said bill, until the payment thereof. Plaintiff knew that Kearney was an exchange and money-broker, as before stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-5\">The affidavit of Coffin, referred to in the agreed statement, stated that he was the clerk of Warrick Martin &amp; Co., that the bill of exchange was left with them for collection simply, and that they had no interest in it or in its proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-6\">Upon this agreed statement and affidavit the court ruled the law of the case to be in favor of the defendant, and gave judgment accordingly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-7\"><em>George James, </em>for plaintiff in error, relied upon the case of <em>Lawrence et al. </em>v. <em>Stonington Bank, </em>6 Conn.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">This case presents the single question whether a party intrusting commercial paper before due, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>another, under such circumstances as to enable him to deal with others, as the apparent rightful owner, and he does so deal, can afterward retain the paper or its proceeds, by proving his original equity. The bill in question, when it came to the hands of the defendant, bore evidence upon its face that it was the property of Warrick Martin &amp; Co. They were its apparent owners; the public had a right to so treat them. That firm were brokers, living in Pittsburgh, and doing business with the defendant, also a broker, residing in Zanesville. Each firm had been in the habit of crediting the other for sums of money received in this way,- and remitting balance. This bill took the usual course, and the defendant having a balance of account against the persons from whom he received it, retained it to offset and liquidate that balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">It looks like a case of hardship for the actual owner of the bill to lose it for the bare error of intrusting its collection to irresponsible money-brokers. It would be equally a case of hardship if the defendant should be compelled to lose the amount, when, but for the credit by this means given to War-rick Martin &amp; Co., he would probably have taken measures to secure the balance of account due him. The rule in such cases is, that where one of two persons must sustain loss, he shall be the sufferer who placed the means of imposition in the hands of the wrong-doer. Between two innocent persons, he shall suffer who incautiously gave the means of obtaining the false credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">It is admitted by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, that if w-e follow the doctrine of the supreme court of the United States, in the case of the <em>Bank of the Metropolis </em>v. <em>The New England </em>Bank, 17 Pet. R. 174, we must sustain the judgment below. \u25a0 In that case it is said to have been \u201c long settled that wherever a banker has advanced money to another, he has a lien on all the paper securities which are in his hands for the amount of his general balance, unless such securities were delivered to him under a particular agreement.\u201d In that case the paper bore <em>prima facie </em>evidence that it was the property of the Com <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>monwealth Bank.- It was in fact the property of the N. E. Bank, but the Bank of the Metropolis received it from the former without notice that they were not the owners, and the court say, \u201c if an advance of money had been made upon this paper to the Commonwealth Bank, the right to retain it for the amount, would hardly be disputed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\u201c We do not perceive any difference in principle, between \u2022an advance of money, and a balance suffered to remain upon the faith of their mutual dealing. In the one ease as in the other credit is given upon the credit of the paper deposited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Agy\">This case appears to be decisive of the question presented by the agreed case, and it is sustained by the English eases, to which we have been referred, and is also sustained by reason as well as authority. A loss must he borne by one of the parties. The misplaced confidence of the plaintiff has occasioned the loss which he sustained. It was his want of caution in trusting commercial paper in irresponsible hands, as the apparent true owners, which enabled Warrick Martin &amp; Co. to deal with and transmit it as their own. He was not bound to do this; he might have pursued the usual and safe course, by sending it to an attorney of Zanesville for collection, or to the defendant. Or by proper inquiry he might have ascertained the responsibility of Warrick Martin &amp; Co., and their mode of doing business. Having neglected this, he cannot compel the defendant, who is guilty of no fault, to bear the consequences of his want of caution in placing his own property in hands unworthy of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b575-7\">Read, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
