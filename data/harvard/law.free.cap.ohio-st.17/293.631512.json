Also that the. professors and teachers should be members of the Presbyterian church, under the care of the general assembly of the Presbyterian church in the United States; that in no case should said property revert to \u2018the grantors or their heirs or assigns; but in case said seminary should fail or become extinct, then said property to belong equally to the American Bible Society, American Tract Society, American Colonization Society, and American Education Society ; and in case any of said societies should become extinct, or all of them, said property, or a due proportion of it, should be appropriated to such charitable religious institutions as the general assembly of the Presbyterian church in the United States should direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The bill further shows that, after making said deed, a seminary was established, and buildings erected by said association incorporated by said act, and the trustees took -upon themselves the duties imposed by the charter; that they established professorships and instructions, viz: a professor of theology, a professor of biblical literature, a lecturer on church history, a professor of sacred rhetoric and pastoral theology, and lecturer -on church polity; that Lyman Beecher was appointed professor of theology, Calvin E. Stowe professor of biblical literature and lecturer on church history, and Diarca Howe Allen professor of sacred rhetoric and pastoral theology and lecturer on church polity, who are now acting as such professors, with the sanction of the board of trustees; and said Calvin' E.

That whereas, a theological institution has been recently established in the vicinity of Cincinnati, in said county of Hamilton, for the education of pious young men for the gospel ministry, and for the purpose of affording to the youth of the country, and particularly of the western states, the means of acquiring useful knowledge ; and whereas, certain persons have been made a body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>politic,by an act of the general assembly of the State of Ohio, by the name of the said Trustees of the Lane Seminary.

They have the power to elect from their own body an executive committee, consisting of a president, two vice presidents,'treasurer, and recording and corresponding secretary, who, with six other members elected at the same time, should be the executive committee, to conduct the affairs of the same under the direction of the board, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-7\">But these officers must reside in Cincinnati or its vicinity, and <em>a majority </em>of all the committee, and all the professors, etc., should be members of the Presbyterian church in good standing, under the care of the general assembly of the Presbyterian church.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-8\">These, then, are the limitations to the general powers of the trustees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-9\">The trustees in office are therefore under the control of the chancellor, in this as in all other cases where a trust is created.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-10\">W e claim that it is the duty of the trustees to carry out the object of the original donors, as expressed in the charter and in the deed donating the property to the Lane Seminary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-11\">The object can only be carried out by employing teachers who believe in the doctrines, discipline and practice of the society known by the name of Presbyterian.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-12\">And to insure .this teaching, the trustees are bound to elect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>in the executive committee, a majority of persons wno are members of the Presbyterian church as then existing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-5\">In the present case it is admitted they have employed, and do now employ, professors and teachers who do not belong to that church. It is also admitted that a majority of the executive committee are <em>not members </em>of the Presbyterian church, as the same existed at the date of the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-6\">And with these facts, admitted as they are by the demurrer, I cannot conceive upon what principle it is the defendants attempt to defend this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-7\">The great object of the suit is to compel the trustees of the Lane Seminary to perform the trust reposed in them by this complainant and other donors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-8\">It is one of those ordinary applications to the chancellor to compel a trustee to execute a trust which he has accepted, and we suppose the right of the complainant to the relief is so clear that there can be no question raised on the subject. We are not asking this court, as a court of law, to decide religious controversies between parties, or to assume ecclesiastical jurisdiction over churches or their members. All we ask is, that this court, as a court of'chan eery, shall exercise its ordinary powers in compelling a trustee to use property and the proceeds of such property, according to the designation of its original owners, and according to the express terms and conditions of the deed of trust. We ask the court to compel these trustees to act fairly and honestly \u2014 to compel them to use the funds realized out of the trust property for the objects originally intended, and according to the terms of the trust deed. We claim this as a right on our part, and that it is as much the duty of the court to enforce this right as it is our right to claim it. Although we do not claim the court has any right to inquire into ecclesiastical matters as such, whether one religious creed is better than another, yet we do claim that wherever property is conveyed upon a well defined express trust, it is the duty of this court to carry such trust into execution, and to administer it according to the intent of the founders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-9\">In every case of charity, whether the object be religious or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>purely civil, it is the duty of the court to give effect to the intention of the founder, provided that can be done without infringing on any known rule of law. 7 Simon Rep. 290. If the terms of the deed of foundation be clear and precise in the application, the course of the court is free from difficulty. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>3 Merivale 409; 7 Simon 290; <em>Miller </em>v.

In gifts for charitable purposes, the donor may prescribe his own terms, and if he declares the object of his gift to be to propagate <em>a particular creed or class of devotions, </em>or to secure a real or imaginary stability, by having those doctrines taught by <em>a clergyman, </em>and by a church in connection with, or in subordination to a particular ecclesiastical judicatory, <em>his tvill </em>as in the case of a devise stands for a reason, and must be respected.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Gable, </em>2 Denio 540.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-5\">\u201c When property is <em>in terms </em>conveyed upon trust to support a particular <em>form of worship </em>or to provide for the teaching of the doctrines of a particular denomination of Christians, the court of chancery will enforce such trust and prevent a perversion of the property to other purposes.\u201d Ibid, per Ballow, J., 549 ; Porter 553, 556.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-6\">In <em>The Associate Reformed Church </em>v. <em>Trustees Theological Seminary, </em>3 Green\u2019s Chan. Rep. 98, the court held \u201c that neither Dr. Mason, nor any other into whose hands it (the books and money) might come, had a right to apply it to any other purpose than that for which it was <em>originally intended, </em>and it is the duty of the court, upon a proper application, to see <em>that this trust is not </em>abused.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-7\">It makes no difference as to the powers of the chancellor, whether the trustees are private persons, or whether the trust is vested in a corporation. And though they are a collegiate body whose founder has given a visitor to superintend his own foundation or bounty, yet, as between one claiming under a separate benefactor and these trustees for special purposes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>court will look upon them as trustees only, and oblige them to execute it under the direction of the court. 1 Vesey Rep. 462; 2 Vesey, .jr. 46, 49; 2 Howard 189.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-4\">In <em>Bowden </em>v. <em>McLeod et al., </em>1 Ed. Chan. Rep. 392, the court say it will not interfere to restrain the free exercise of religion in any man, \u201c and yet there are cases in which this court has power to inquire into tenets openly and publicly expressed in reference to the place in which they are promulgated. Equity can do this whenever called upon in connection with it to administer a trust. As for instance, where a religious society is formed, a place of worship provided either by the will of the founder, the <em>deed of trust </em>through which the title is held, or by the charter of incorporation; a particular doctrine is to be preached in the place, and the latter is to be devoted to such particular doctrine and service. In such a ease it is not in the power of the trustees of the congregation to depart from what is thus disclosed to be the object of the foundation or orig inal formation of the institution, and teach new doctrines and set up a new mode of worship.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-5\">In the Girard will case, 2 Howard 199, it was held the donor of property has a right to donate his property upon such terms as he pleases; if he thinks proper, he has a right to exclude ecclesiastics or layman from being employed as instructors in the institution he has established.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-6\">In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hammel, </em>6 Barr\u2019s Rep. 87, the court held the legislature had no power to change the trusts, or to create new ones. That the trusts and charities of the testator must be carried out according to his directions. They were his charities, and he had the right to dispose of his own property upon such terms as he deemed proper, and not even the legislature could alter the trusts, and an act which attempted to alter the trust was declared unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-7\">The same doctrine as to the duty of the court to enforce the trusts according to the declared intent of the donor was enforced in <em>App.v.

The object the donor had in view is what we wish to ascertain; of course we must view it as he viewed it at the time he made the deed. \u25a0 To do this we must go back to the 9th December, 1829, and we find as a matter of history that at that time there was one Presbyterian church in the United States ; that church, or the several churches, or the branches of that church, whichever you please, was or were under the care of the general assembly \u2014 that same church and general assembly now exist under the same name and organization, under the same church government, and professing the same doctrines. Since that period some of the members of the church have seceded \u2014 some of the churches have been exscinded, and these have formed new societies, adopted a new form of church government, repudiating the powers of the general assembly as claimed at the date of the deed. At that time the general assembly was an appellate court; from the decisions of the inferior church judicatories an appeal lay to that assembly, whose decision was final. Under the New church government, no such appeal liefe. The Presbyterian churches under the New system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>differ but little in church government form that of the Congregationlist churches, or from the Baptist churches \u2014 so the two \u2022churches differ\u2019considerably in matters of faith and doctrine ; in fact, we suppose it was this latter difference that caused the separation; and that it is considered by the parties a fundamental difference is evident, or we should not see such respectable bodies of men refusing to meet and worship together. There is therefore a great difference both in church government and doctrine between the now so-called New church and the Presbyterian church as known and established at the date of this \u2022deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-5\">It is perfectly immaterial to this argument as to which of the churches or which of the doctrines is most consonant to our own views of such matters; we want to ascertain the intention of these donors'at the date of the deed. Had the donors reference to a church, or society, or general assembly then well known ? or did they refer to one not in existence ? That is the question. Now we suppose there can be but one opinion on this subject. The donors must have had in view the general assembly and the Presbyterian church as then known, as it was then constituted; with its faith and its doctrines and form of church .government as then understood ; the faith in which these donors had been educated and in which they hoped for salvation. This is the only common-sense view of the matter, and such is the universal sentiment of the courts on this subject, as will be seen by an examination of the following cases: <em>Gabel </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>10 Paige 641; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>10 Eng. Cha. 61 \u2014 63; <em>Lady Hewley\u2019s case, </em>7 Simons 290; <em>Field </em>v. <em>Field, </em>9 Wendell 394; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Baptist Education Society, </em>1 B.

The question in such case is not which faith or doctrine is the soundest or most othordox, but for what object or purpose was the fund originally established by the founders of it.\u201d <em>Field </em>v. <em>Field, </em>9 Wendell 401.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-5\"><em>\u201c </em>What were the religious tenets in general of the donor ?' because it would not be a just application of those trust funds, if they were employed for the sustentation of religious opinions which the donors themselves have disavowed.\u201d 1 Sanford\u2019s Cha. Rep. 509.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-6\">The intention of the donor as made known in the grant, remains the law of the donation for all time to come.

That the trusts and charities^of the testator must be carried out according to his directions. They were his charities, and he had the right to dispose of his own property upon such terms as he deemed proper, and not even the legislature could alter the trusts. The court therefore declared the law of 1846 unconstitutional. 3 Watts 408.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-5\">The terms of the foundation or trust cannot even be altered by the founder unless he has reserved a right to do so in the deed. 1 Watts &amp; Sergeant 36 ; 1 Bur.

Same authorities. 1 B.

Although we do not admit this to be the fact, and the pleadings do not present the question, yet we maintain if such is the fact it does not affect the present question. The donors or founders may establish the institution on such a basis and insert such trusts (or statutes as the conditions are sometimes called) as they deem proper, and all subsequent contributors are bound by the terms of the original foundation, unless they grant upon some new trusts, which they may undoubtedly do. But mere general contributions for the general objects of the charity are governed by the original trusts. Nor can it make any difference in the effect of these subsequent contributions whether they were made by members of the Old or New School party \u2014 whether by Turk, Mahommedan, Jew, Christian or infidel. The contribution or donation, whether of real or personal property, must be appropriated to advance the general object of the institution, unless they are made upon some new trust or condition attached to the new donations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Nor does it affect the question whether a large or small .number of the friends of this institution desire professors of the New church school of theology. Majorities or minorities are not known in courts of justice, nor can the desire of the one or the other affect the administration of the trust, or alter or vary in any way the rights of parties under the trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-4\">\u201c The argument that a majority for the time being can mould to their own notions, the principles sustained by the gifts of the founders of the charity, and can substitute other principles or cardinal doctrines in their stead, cannot be tolerated for a moment. It strikes at the root of all religious, charitable and even literary gifts and' bequests, which are to endure beyond the lives of those first intrusted with their administrations. It closes the avenues to benevolence, and chills the warm heart of charity ; of that good will toward men which seeks to perpetuate by the means bountifully conferred on the donor, the good works which the approach of his appointed time on earth prevents him from accomplishing or perfecting in person. Let it be once understood to be the law of the land, that funds bestowed for the maintenance of a Protestant church may, with the change of faith of the members, at any time be applied to the support of the Roman Catholic forms of worship and religious doctrines; or that a devise for the support of disabled seamen may, in the wisdom of its trustees for the time being, be used to educate young mariners for the better discharge of their duties; and we shall have no more of the munificent eleemosynary donations which so much distinguish and adorn our country.\u201d 1 Sanford\u2019s Cha. Rep. 508, 509.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-5\">It is not a question as to what doctrines these officers teach; the trust requires they should be of a certain faith, and if they belong to the church 'required by the donor the trust has not been violated, but it is a very natural conclusion to draw that the donors in this deed supposed that officers professing to belong to the Presbyterian church would be favorable to the tenets and form of government of that church. It cannot be presumed that any Christian minister will teach doctrines or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>faith in which he had no belief \u2014 so that by employing professors who do not belong to the Presbyterian church as known at the date of the grant, the defendants are guilty of a direct violation of trust. 10 Paige 645.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-5\">The bill shows that these trustees are appropriating the funds of this institution to pay the salaries of officers who are not authorized by the terms of the charter of the deed of trust to be employed. They are thus continually defeating the object of the trust, setting at naught the desires of the donors, disregarding the very charter under which they are acting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-6\">This they do under the pretense that the New School is the real Presbyterian church referred to in the trust deed. But they know it is not so \u2014 they know the old Presbyterian church, the old general assembly, now exists. It has been so decided in the great case of <em>Commonwealth on the relation of Todd </em>v. <em>Green and others.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-7\">The New School church is not only different in doctrine and church government, but the name even is changed, for the New School is called the constitutional Presbyterian church. So that the New church has neither the same faith, the same government, nor the same name as the Old- church which was in existence when this trust deed was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-8\">The professors, therefore, in this institution are in the same situation as all other persons who separate either voluntarily or otherwise from the old society. They cease to be members of that church of which they were once members, and of course cease to be qualified to act as teachers in this seminary. Eor, \u201c it is a well settled principle that when part of any religious association separate and establish \u00e1 new society, they cease to be members of the original society.\u201d <em>Associate Reformea Church v.

We could not sustain a mandamus of course; because we have no officers to put in, and because we cannot, in a court of law, select which of the trustees shall remain, the charter re quiring only a majority to be members, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-4\">The obligation imposed upon a trustee after accepting the trust is as binding on a corporation as on an individual. 1 B. Munroe 220.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-5\">\u201c It has often been declared in this court that a college is under no obligation to accept an accession to its foundation, or any other trust; that if it does accept it without any arrangement made for a modification at the time of acceptance, it is bound to adhere strictly to the trusts.\u201d 15 Eng. Cha. 164; Keene 163.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-6\">The court will view all gifts to a corporation and determine all questions in like manner as if intrusted to the hands of indi viduals. 1 Vesey 467; 2 Ib. 46-49.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-7\">It is the duty of the trustee, whether an indvidual or a corporation, not to convert the charity fund to other uses than according to the intent of the founder or donor. 3 Merivale 408; 7 Simons Cha. Rep. 290.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-8\">Corporations may be divested of the trust where an abuse is shown, in the same manner as any other trustee. 17 Vesey, jr. 499.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-9\">\u201c If the corporation accept the donation there is an acknowledgment and acquiescence in the terms prescribed, and an implied obligation to carry out the terms in good faith.\u201d 1 B. Munroe 217.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-10\">But it is claimed that this trust cannot be enforced by David R. Kemper, although he is one of the original donors and creators of the trust, because it is alleged he has no remaining interest in the property. It is claimed there is neither privity of contract nor privity of estate between the living grantor and the trustees. ^No authority is adduced to sustain this proposition, and we believe none can be produced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-11\">Such a proposition sounds rather harshly, both in a court of law and in a court of equity. We maintain that between the grantor or donor and the grantee in the deed, there is a direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>privity of contract and estate also; and whenever the grantee accepts the deed, and in that deed a trust is created, the very acceptance on the part of the trustee creates a direct contract between himself and the grantor, which the law will compel him to perform. 1 B. Munroe 217.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-5\">The grantor and grantee are both parties to the contract, and so long as they are both living they can enforce the contract. This must necessarily be so, or the law would not imply an obligation on the part of the trustee who accepts the trust. But there being a contract, each party may enforce its execution. Authorities are not expected to be numerous on such a question, because almost all questions on the subject of charities arise out of charities created by will, and therefore a question can hardly arise during the life of the donor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-6\">But we have some cases deciding this question in favor of the right of the donor, Kemper, to sustain this suit directly, and the analogies we think are in his favor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-7\">In <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Baptist Education </em>Society, 1 B. Munroe\u2019s Reports 222, it is expressly decided that the grantor and donor while living may file such a bill and enforce the trusts. That being one of the contracting parties, he has a right to the aid of the court to enforce the contract. While the court admits a bill might be sustained in the name of the attorney general, they say, <em>\u201c We </em>are satisfied that a bill may be filed by the founder, if living, or his heirs, if he be dead, or by any beneficiary, having an interest in the use, or by any other having a vested interest in the fund, against the corporation, for a true and faithful execution of the trusts confided to it. Pauling is the founder, and is a party to the contract of donation, and stipulated its terms, and has unquestionably the right to have those terms enforced, and if living, might file a bill for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-8\">In 7 B. Munroe 618, the court thought the bill might be sustained in the name of the attorney general also, although the statute did not make P his duty .to prosecute such suits. At least they would not dismiss a bill brought in his name.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>If we refer to the legal analogies we shall arrive at the same conclusion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-4\">By the common law, he who gives the first possessions to a corporation is the founder of it, and entitled to the rights which the foundership gives. These consist in visitation and correction of any misapplication of his bounty to any purposes foreign to its original destination. 1 Watts &amp; Sergeant 36.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-5\">\u201c But what is. the nature and extent of this visitorial power ? Is it a power to revoke the gift ? to change its uses ? to divest the rights of the parties entitled to the bounty ? Certainly not. It is a mere power to control and arrest abuses, and to enforce a due observance of the statutes of the charity.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. McKeen, 1 Sumner 300.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-6\">This right of visitor is of value, and even after the transfer of it, the original donor has a right to have the statutes of his foundation, as to the power of the trustees, strictly adhered to, except so far as he has consented to any alteration of them, and the funds cannot be diverted. 1 Sumner 305.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-7\">Here we have the right of the founder distinctly admitted. He has a right to have the statutes, that is, the rules and trusts he has established, strictly enforced. If he can do this without coming into chancery, well and good, but if his rights as founder require the aid of a court of chancery to enforce them, he of course comes into that court. He has the right to have these trusts enforced even after he has transferred bis rights as visitor. And this consideration alone, it appears to me, disposes of the whole objection now raised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-8\">Eor if he has this right to have his trusts enforced after he has transferred his right of visitation, it is not because of his visitorial right, for that is transferred and gone. On what then is it based except upon the fact that he was one of the original donors, and therefore has such right by privity of contract? I have no doubt the-practice of suing in the name of the attorney general has its origin in, and ought to be confined to, a case of necessity. If the donor is dead, and his heirs are all dead, so that there is no visitor, no person who can insitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>suit, then, for the purpose of sustaining the charity, the king, who acts by his attorney general and in his name, as a sort of donor general or father of all charities, and as a matter of necessity, on being made acquainted with the facts by any one willing to become a relator, institutes the suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-5\">We admit that on the death of the donor, and-where no heirs can be found, or where they are insane, the visitorial power in England will be exercised by the chancellor, but never while the donor is living. 2 Vesey, jr. 609, <em>619; 17 </em>Ib. 498; 13 Ib. 519; 11 Ib. 191.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-6\">\u2022 And there would be just as much propriety in deciding that the donor had no right as visitor, as to say he had not right as donor merely in his own lifetime to come into a court of chancery and have the trust enforced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-7\">We claim further, that while the founder is living the suit ought not and cannot he brought in the name of the attorney general without a statute authorizing it 'to be brought in that manner. We claim the right of the state to interfere in the name of the attorney general, never attaches while the' donor is in existence, any more in this than any other case of a breach of trust. There is no necessity for such action'while the donor is living, for he is competent to come into court and have his own contracts enforced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-8\">There is not a case to be found in the English books, showing that a suit has been brought in the name of the attorney general during the life of the donor. The tact is he only acts because there is no donor or heir of a donor living to act, 7 Vesey, jr. 75 ; <em>Birmingham </em>School, P. Wms. 325.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-9\">He acts as the king\u2019s officer because there is no donor, as the king is said to be a trustee where no trustee is appointed. In other words, the chancellor appoints a trustee where the donor has not appointed one. 7 Vesey, jr. 86.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-10\">It is now well settled (although it was formerly considered stherwise), that the chancellor does not derive his powers in charity cases from the statute of 43 Eliz. Eor such trusts were enforced by the chancellor prior to the passage of that act. 1 Sanford\u2019s Cha 562; 2 Howard\u2019s U. S. Rep. 196.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>And the practice of suing in such cases in the name of the attorney general did not commence until after the passage of the 43d Eliz. 1 B. Munroe 618.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-4\">It is a remarkable fact that out of fifty cases mentioned in the note to Mr. Binney\u2019s argument in the <em>Girard Will case, </em>2 Howard\u2019s Rep. 155, as having been decided prior to the passage of the act of 43d Eliz., not one of them is in the name of the attorney general.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-5\">And the very first case cited is a case where the plaintiff is son of a woman who had placed six hundred marks in the defendant\u2019s hands for the purpose of founding a charity in the church of St.-Peter, which he had neglected to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-6\">The other cases there cited are in the names of trustees, sometimes in the names of parishoners in behalf of themselves and others \u2014 and in short, these bills seem to have been filed either by the donors or their heirs, or by persons having an interest in the fund \u2014 or by owners of property in the neighborhood of the charity; in short, they were filed in all sorts of ways and by almost all sorts of persons, but never by the attorney general.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-7\">The fact is, except as a mere matter of form, it can make no difference to the real justice of the case whether the suit is prosecuted in the name of the complainant, as one of the original donors, or whether it is filed in the name of the state, using the name of David R. Kemper as relator. The real object is to ascertain the character of the trust, and to have it enforced and charity administered according to the original intent of the donor. And it does appear to me to be trifling with the justice of the case while we are discussing this matter of form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-8\">Again, we claim that David R. Kemper has such an interest in this matter that he can sustain this suit independent of his privity of contract with the Lane Seminary, as one of the donors. He, as a member of the Presbyterian church in the United States, has one of the qualifications of becoming a teacher in the seminary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-9\">He, also as a member, is qualified to form one of the exec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>utive committee and one of the trustees, and being one of that class of persons who have a right to see that the trusts are ex ecuted. Again, as one of the members of the Presbyterian church, he is interested in having the pupils of this institution taught by professors of his own religion. It is from these pupils he expects himself or his children to receive that religious instruction which it was the aim and object of these donors to provide, and he has a right, through the medium of this court, to prevent an abuse of the trusts. And being one of a large class of persons who stand in such a position that, if the trust was properly executed, they might become trustees, or members of the executive committee, or teachers, or might be benefited by the kind of teaching which these pupils might receive ; he has the right to file this bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-5\">But if the court should think it at all important that this form should be observed, of suing in the name of the prosecuting attorney, we ask, in order to arrive at the justice of the cause, and to prevent a sacrifice of the substance to the form, that the plaintiff have leave to amend by inserting the name of the prosecuting attorney, and David R. Kemper as relator. Even in England, where it is held that such a bill must be in the name of the attorney general, where that ceremony and form has been omitted, the chancellor permits such an amendment to be made, in order to arrive at the justice of the ease. Such an amendment was made in <em>Well-beloved </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>1 Cond. Eng. Cha. 21; <em>Corporation of the Sons of Clergy </em>v. <em>More, </em>9 Simons Cha. 610, 614.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">The case is an important one not only to these parties, but as affecting a large class of donations made by public-spirited and pious men. It affects not only the administration of the funds and property of the Lane Seminary, but the administration of the funds and property of every institution in the state and of every trust established for public or charitable purposes. Oui object in coming here is not to have this court undertake to investigate and scrutinize the religious opinions of individuals . we wish not any man to change his religious opinions and em <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>brace ours, further than such change might be produced by a thorough conviction that ours is the correct opinion. We wish every man to interpret the scriptures for himself; but when men professing one set of religious doctrines, and one form of church government, undertake to disseminate the doctrine and government, with funds and property designed for teaching a different doctrine and form of church government, we think we have a right to complain, and to insist the fund shall not be so perverted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-4\">If the defendants deem the doctrines and form of government of the Presbyterian church obsolete, contrary to scripture, to common sense, or to the progress of the times, we have nothing to say. They have a right to believe and to teach other doctrines, and to establish other forms of church government, but as was said by the chancellor in <em>Kniskern </em>v. <em>The Lutheran Churches of St. John\u2019s and St. Peter\u2019s and </em>others, 1 Sandford 561, \u201c the law does not permit them to use the property of others to sustain their views. They are trustees of this fund, and neither justice nor honesty will tolerate them in taking the fund given by others (their ancestors it may be, but given for the purpose of supporting the doctrines of that confession), and using it to attack and destroy those doctrines.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-5\">As is said in 2 Denio 552, \u201c all denominations of Christian worshipers have an interest in the question, for unless the title to property held in trust for religious and charitable uses is to be determined by the courts as intimately connected with the doctrine, and faith and form of church government, established by the patrons and founders of each church, there can be no stability in the churches, nor even a faithful execution of the trusts. But the character and integrity of the government is concerned in seeing all such trusts protected and faithfully executed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-6\">We therefore claim that the court will decree the defendants to execute the trust according to the intent of the donors in the trust deed, by first electing a majority of the executive committee, and all the professors and teachers, of persons belonging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>to the Presbyterian church as it existed when the donation was made. Second, that they enjoin the defendants from selling or disposing of the trust property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-5\">The court have power to declare the offices of unqualified persons and of trustees who have abused their trusts, vacant, and to order new elections or appointments in which persons incompetent should be excluded, and the chancellor has sometimes directed a master to appoint or to have an election made. 1 Sanford\u2019s Cha. 563; 9 Paige Cha. 281; 10 Paige Cha. 627; 3 Green\u2019s Cha.

It asks this court to compel the trustees of Lane Seminary, incorporated by the general assembly, to do what this court upon the relation refused to do, namely, to oust Messrs. Beecher, Stowe and Allen from their several offices in the institution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-10\">The counsel for the complainant has dwelt upon the division of the Presbyterian church in 1838, and the alleged differences of faith and government, between the two great bodies into which the original church was separated. He claims that the highly respectable division to which his client- is attached is the true, original, primitive, unaltered and unalterable church, and that the division to which Nathaniel Wright and his associates, and Messrs. Beecher, Stowe and Allen belong, is no better than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the degenerate plant of a strange vine. We are of opinion that no good can come of any controversy, before this court, upon the merits of this claim \u2014 that, ten years having elapsed since the division, and each party having retained the institutions and property which it then held, it is better for both sides that a perpetual truce be established, and both parties quieted in their respective possessions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-4\">We therefore do not propose, unless compelled by a decree of this court, to enter at all into the investigation to which we are invited by the counsel for the complainant. Protesting that the charges of the bill, that persons not qualified by membership in the Presbyterian church have been appointed members of the executive committee or of the faculty of Lane Seminary, are all groundless, we shall confine ourselves in this discussion to the points raised by the pleadings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-5\">These are two:</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-6\">1.. Is it competent for David R. Kemper to maintain a suit m equity to enforce the performance of the trusts upon which the trustees of Lane Seminary hold the corporate property ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-7\">2. If such a suit may be maintained in the name of an individual private person, has David R. Kemper any such interest in the subject-matter of controversy as will enable <em>him </em>to maintain it?</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-8\">1. As to the first of these questions, it is to be observed that David R. Kemper, with his co-grantors, conveyed the tract of land described in their deed, of December 9, 1829, a copy of which is annexed to the argument of Mr. Eox, upon the <em>same trusts precisely </em>which are specified in the act of incorporation: so that the effect of their deed is exactly the same that it would have been if they had conveyed to the trustees upon condition that the trustees would establish the seminary upon their land, and <em>govern it according to the \u00b6revisions of the charter. </em>Suppose, then, the conveyance had been in this form, and the seminary established upon the land, and so that condition complied with, could David R. Kemper.maintain this bill to compel the trustees to administer the affairs of the corporation in conformity with the charter ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>It is clear that he has no visitatorial, or, as I prefer to write it, <em>visitorial </em>power over Lane Seminary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-5\">The nature and extent of this power are well defined by Chancellor Kent. It \u201c arises from the <em>property </em>which the <em>founder </em>assigned to support the charity; and as.he is the <em>author </em>of the charity, the law gives him and his heirs a visitorial power; <em>that is, </em>an authority to <em>inspect the actions </em>and regulate the behavior <em>of the members that partake of the </em>charity.\u201d Of these \u201c he is to judge according to the statutes and rules \u201d of the institution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">David R. Kemper has not, and never had, any such power as this. None could arise from his grant of land, for he was not the <em>perficient founder </em>of the charity; that is to say, not \u201c the person who originally gave to it its funds and revenues.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>McKeen, </em>1 Sumner 300. The charter of Lane Seminary was granted on the 11th February, 1829, and the corporation was in full existence when the deed of the Kempers was executed. If, under these circumstances, each of these grantors became invested with a visitorial power, then every donor, or grantor, for valuable consideration of any property to an eleemosynary corporation would become invested with like' power, and the institution would be subjected to as many visitors as there might be grants to it. This is absurd.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">But argument on this head seems to be unnecessary in this case, for the <em>grant </em>was to <em>incorporated trustees. </em>And it is \u201c well settled, as a general rule in the construction of charters, that if <em>the objects </em>of the charity are not incorporated, but <em>certain trustees are incorporated </em>to manage the charity, the visitorial power is deemed to belong to the trustees in their corporate capacity.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>McKeen, </em>1 Sumner 301; <em>Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>4 Wheat. 675.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-8\">It is quite clear, therefore, that the complainant is not entitled to the aid of this court in the exercise of any visitorial power. He has not, in fact, made any case for such aid in his bill. He cannot invoke the aid of the court unless he avers that he has attempted to exercise such power, but has been hindered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>defendants. But the bill contains no such averments. It is framed upon a totally different theory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-4\">It states a case of trust. It avers a grant of lands upon certain trusts, and avers that these trusts have not been fulfilled. And it is quite true, that, \u201c <em>as managers of the revenues of the </em>charity, <em>the trustees are not leyond control: </em>but are subject to the general superintendence of a court of chancery, for any abuse of their trust in the management of it.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>McKeen, </em>1 Sumner 301.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-5\">This doctrine is well stated by Judge Story, 2 Equity 434 \u201c Where a charity is definite in its objects and lawful in its creation, and it is to be executed and regulated by trustees, whether they are private individuals or a corporation; there the administration properly belongs to such trustees ; and the king, as <em>parens patriae, </em>has no general authority to regulate or control the administration of the funds. In all such cases, however, if there be any abuse or misuse of the funds by the trustees, the court of chancery will interfere, <em>at the instance of the attorney general or the parties in interest, </em>to correct such abuse or misuse of the funds. But, in such cases, the interposition of the court is properly referable to its general jurisdiction, as a court of equity, to prevent abuses of a trust, and not to any original right to direct the management of a charity or the conduct of the trustees.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-6\">In general, then, it-seems that bills, to compel the performance of trusts by incorporated trustees, must be filed by the <em>proper </em>representation of the government, or a <em>party in interest. </em>In Ohio, even a party in interest must come into court by the representation of the government; for the 24th section of the quo warranto act (Swan\u2019s Statutes 775) provides, that \u201c nothing in this act contained is intended to restrain any court of chancery in this state from enforcing the performance of trusts for charitable purposes, <em>at the relation of the prosecuting attorney, </em>or from enforcing trusts, or restraining abuses in other <em>corporations, </em>at the <em>suit of the persons injured.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-7\">The clear distinction made in this section between eleemo* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>svnary corporations and. others, speaks for itself. As to the former, only the prosecuting attorney, if satisfied that a case exists requiring the interposition of equity, can call for such interposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-5\">The first question involved in this case must, therefore, I apprehend, be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-6\">As to the second question, if I am wrong in supposing that, in Ohio, no private person can file a bill in his own name, to enforce the performance of corporate trusts, it remains to inquire whether David R. Kemper has such an interest in the property of Lane Seminary as will enable him to maintain the present bill ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-7\">1. We have already seen that he possesses no right as visitor ; consequently this ground for his claim of right to sue, much relied on by Mr. Fox, must be abandoned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-8\">2. The only condition in the deed, not expressed in the charter, is, that the seminary shall be established on the granted land. This has been done. The seminary is there. The deed then must be treated, as has already been said, as a grant to the seminary on condition that the lands be appropriated to the uses pointed out by the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-9\">It was not a mere benefaction. It was a grant for a valuable consideration. The grantors owned, as appears from the bill, adjoining lands. The establishment of the seminary on the granted land would greatly enhance the value of that retained. This was doubtless a moving consideration for the deed, though others of a higher nature had influence, and appear more prominently.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-10\">Now it may be conceded that if the trustees manifest a purpose to remove the seminary to other lands, or to use the lands granted for any purpose contrary to the clear intent of the charter, whereby the complainant or his property will sustain damage, he may be entitled to relief in equity. But he makes no such case. He complains of no injury to himself or his property. He appears for the community at large, and complains of a breach of trusts in which hundreds of thousands have an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>equal and the same interest with himself. It seems too dlear for argument that a complainant, so circumstanced, is not <em>\u201c </em>a party in interest \u201d in the sense of the authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-4\">3. The complainant can complain of no injury to the reversion, for he has no reversion, however remote. It is expressly declared in the deed <em>\u201c </em>that in no case shall any part of the aforesaid property, appurtenances or avails thereof, ever revert, to them (the grantors), their heirs or assigns.\u201d Should Lane Seminary fail or become extinct, the property must go to one-of the benevolent societies named in the deed. It is difficult to conceive of a case in which the grantor of land to a charita ble institution could more completely divest himself of all in terest, present or future, visitorial or other, in the land granted,, than these grantors have done. If the trustees of Lane Seminary have forfeited their title to that land, David R. Kemper is not the person to complain. The Education Society, the Bible Society, the Tract Society and the Colonization Society are alone entitled to the interposition of the court as \u201c parties-in interest.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-5\">It is to be remembered, finally, that the objects of this bill are not properly attainable by a proceeding in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-6\">So far as the complaint goes to the leasing of some portion of the lands, it is very obviously unsustainable. There is no-stipulation in the deed that no portion of the land shall be leased or sold. The sole stipulation as to the use of the lands is, that the seminary be established upon them. As to the part of the sixty acre tract not necessary for this purpose, there is no stipulation. In the absence of such a stipulation the charter must, govern, which gives full power. And it is quite obvious that for the benefit of the seminary, and to carry out the very purpose of the charter as recognized in the deed, it may become verynecessary to lease some portion of the lands for residences, boarding-houses and the like, if not to sell some. If the trustees, may lease without breach of trust, it is a sufficient answer to the <em>alternative </em>allegation that they have leased <em>or </em>sold, or threaten to lease <em>or </em>sell. Besides, the bill only charges that the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>trustees threaten to lease or sell the greater part! Now, to say nothing of the vagueness of the charge of .threatening without the allegation of any specific acts, they might certainly lease \u2022or sell \u201c <em>the greater part\" </em>of sixty acres \u2014 say thirty-one acres\u2014 and still retain quite sufficient for any purpose contemplated by the deed or charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">The charges as to breach of the provisions of the charter and deed, in relation to manual labor, are also quite too indefinite The charge is, that \u201c the trustees have refused to establish regulations requiring manual <em>labor;.or, if they have established </em>such regulations, complainant is informed and believes they are not enforced.\u201d This charge is in the alternative, and\u00bb too vague. No case of neglect to enforce the regulations is stated. The <em>extent </em>to which the complainant thinks such regulations should be enforced, is not indicated. What degree of severity and strictness is supposed to be necessary to avoid the charge of neglect does not appear. Besides this, the bill itself prays no relief, unless by the general prayer, against acts or omissions of this sort. Under these circumstances, we think the court will be disposed to leave these matters where, unless a clear case of breach of trust be shown, the law leaves them, in the sound discretion of the trustees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\">The general principle applicable to these charges is indicated with sufficient clearness by the court of appeals in Kentucky, in the case of <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Baptist Education Society, </em>1 B. Munroe 223 ; of which case we will remark, in passing, that while the decision is right, the court seem, in the course of the opinion, to recognize a doctrine not necessary to the case, and unsustained, as we believe, by the current of authorities \u2014 that individual donors or grantors, of realty or personalty, however inconsiderable their gifts or grants may be/ and although they retain no interest, are entitled to the aid of chancery in enforcing the uses of the gift, or grant. ' We say \u201c <em>seem to recognize,\" </em>for when the case is scrutinized, it will be found that the real doctrine of the case applies only to <em>unexecuted contracts </em>of subscription, in aid of a charitable corporation, and merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>declares that a party to the contract of subscription, if seduced 'into it by false representations, or suppression of the truth, or if the consideration has failed, has a right in this, as well as in all other contracts, to ask its dissolution, and an injunction against the payment of the money subscribed by him. But to return to the principle, applicable, as we have said, to the charges of the complainant. It is stated as follows : \u201c Nor is the allegation, with respect to the insecurity of the fund, sufficiently spe ci\u00f1e and certain to demand the interference of the court, even if the complainant had a right to inquire into the matter. All the allegations, in relation to the treasurer\u2019s failing to give the security required, may be true, and still the fund be sufficiently safe in his hands. And we are not disposed to indulge in <em>presumptions beyond the specific allegations </em>of the bill, which tend to impute negligence and infidelity to men, the most of whom have been selected and intrusted by the legislature, with the high and responsible functions committed to the trustees, by the charter before us.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-4\">All this, however, is really aside from the true case. It i\u00bb known to every body, and apparent enough on the face of the bill, that the real object of the proceeding is, not to enforce reform in the administration of the corporate property, but to compel the trustees to oust certain persons from certain offices, because disqualified in law to hold them, and to elect certain others in their places.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-5\">Now it is quite clear that if any person is in office without right, there is a clear and adequate remedy at law, unless it has been lost by lapse of time. If it has been so lost, this court will not interpose its extraordinary power to defeat the effect of the statute of limitations, and least of all in such a case as this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-6\">Besides, it is well 'settled, and so held by the court of appeals of Kentucky in the case already cited, that a court of chancery \u201c cannot inquire into acts of misfeasance, or non-feasance, with a view to the amotion of any members of the corporation, or with a view to the dissolution of the corporation. \u201d <em>Cham</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><em>bers </em>v. <em>Bap. Ed. </em>Society, 1 B. Munroe 216. This, we apprehend, is conclusive against the complainant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-5\">For these reasons, then, 1. That a bill to enforce the performance of corporate duties or trusts cannot be maintained by a private person in Ohio; 2. That the complainant has no such interest as will entitle <em>him </em>to maintain this bill; and 3. That the objects of the bill, set forth with sufficient certainty, \u00e1re not such as can be reached by a proceeding in equity, \u2014 w\u00e9 claim that the demurrer should be sustained, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-6\">We add, merely, that while we believe this disposition of the case is demanded by the weight of reason and authority, we are, also, fully satisfied that by it substantial justice will be done to all parties concerned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-7\">We add, further, that D. R. Kemper is only one of the four <em>joint </em>grantors. If a bill can be maintained at all, must not the four join ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">Suppose, also, the demurrer overruled, the case litigated, and Wright, Beecher, and others ousted, and Old School men appointed, then any donor or grantor of the New School could file his bill, and complain that' the new professors and trustees are not Presbyterians, bringing the whole matter into litigation again. A decree in favor of a private person concludes nothing. If the government, by its officers, obtain a decree, all are concluded.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b325-9\">Birchard, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af8\">Two grounds of objection are taken to this bill. 1st. That it is not competent for the complainant to maintain a suit in equity, to enforce the performance of the trusts upon which the trustees of Lane Seminary hold the corporate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">2d. That if such suit may be maintained by any private individual, that complainant has no such interest in the subject-matter as will enable him to maintain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">In support of the bill, and in answer to these grounds of objection, it is argued that there is a direct privity of estate and of contract between the grantor and grantee, in the deed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>so long as both parties are living, either party may enforce its execution. If this be so, it must be because there remains some interest in the grantor, as <em>-cestui que </em>trust, or beneficiary, 01 that he stands in the relation of founder, retaining an interest</p>\n<p id=\"Ai6\">We can see no such interest. The mere fact of being a Presbyterian of the Old School is insufficient. No one would pretend that any member of that branch of the Presbyterian church could maintain the bill. But if that relationship would in any case be sufficient, such suit would have to be presented by all persons belonging to the society, or by some one suing for himself in behalf of all. This bill proceeds on no such ground, and as said before, mere membership of that branch of the Presbyterian church would not be sufficient. This is not like the case of one who, being a member of a congregation, sues in behalf of himself and other members of the same congregation to compel the proper administration of a common property, in which each and every member has a specific but joint interest, for here there is no interest in the estate. The deed expressly grants away the entire estate, and covenants that in no case shall any part of the property or its avails ever revert to the grantors, their heirs or assigns,\u201d but in case the Lane Seminary shall ever fail or become extinct, shall go to certain religious or benevolent societies. No right remained in Kemper under this deed. The property from him passed to a public institution as a gift to the public, or for the benefit of the public, and he can claim no right to interfere beyond that of any other member of community. , The consequences of allowing a suit to proceed in. his name would be that it would conclude nothing, and the door of litigation would never be thereby closed. If Mr. Kemper may file his bill and compe\u2019 an answer, so may any other individual who has donated prop erty or funds to the seminary, for each donor has the same right; and when the suit of one is determined, if it fail, another may prosecute a like suit, and so on <em>ad infinitum, </em>and neither one or all the cases thus decided could be plead in bar to a further litigation. This shows that, however great may be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>wrong complained of, there is much propriety in requiring suits of this nature to be carried on and conducted in the name only of a public officer, who may lawfully represent the whole community, or at .least all that portion of it who are interested equally with complainant. It has been claimed that a visitorial power existed in Kemper as founder, which would enable him to supervise the execution of the trust and maintain a bill to correct abuses. But the case shows no such founding of this seminary as^ entitles him to the exercise of visitorial powers. He was but one of several donors, and the donation was to incorporated trustees. This vested the visitorial power of all the donors in those trustees, subject only to the control of a court of chancery for any abuse of their trust. <em>Allen </em>v. McKeen, 1 Sum. Rep. 300. And as before stated, the general chancery power of the court should only be exercised when called into action by a party who may prosecute, and in whose favor or against whom the decision will be obligatory and final as to all matters involved in the litigation. If we are correct in this, the objections presented by the defendants on demurrer are, in the opinion of two members of the court, substantial, and not, as argued by counsel, a mere matter of form.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">But were it admitted that, as donor, he has a right to require the trustees to adhere strictly to the objects of the donation and not divert the funds, it must still be observed that he is but one of several grantors in the deed, and should not be allowed to proceed and try the question which he makes upon the bill, and which shows the others equally interested, without bringing them before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Again, we are asked to allow an amendment, should we deem it important that the suit be brought by the prosecuting attorney. In reply to this it may be said that amendments, when proper, are a matter of discretion, to be granted or refused according to the dictates of a sound legal judgment. Upon the question whether this is a case for amendment we are divided, and give, according to the course of our practice, no opinion, The motion fails on division.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
