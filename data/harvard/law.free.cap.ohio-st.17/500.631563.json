Martin, and others.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b498-8\">The vendor of land, <em>by </em>taking a mortgage upon the land sold to-secure the payment of the purchase money, does not extinguish his prior equitable lien 5 and the lien of a judgment creditor obtained between the date of the mortgage and the time when it is recorded, will be postponed to the vendor\u2019s lien.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-9\">This is a bill in chancery, reserved in Fairfield county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ANS\">The bill avers that Boos being seized of lot No. 2, in Lancaster, conveyed it- to' Ewing &amp; Martin, April 27, 1844, for $1,200, to be paid $600 in hand and $600 in six years, with the interest annually; that the first payment was made, and the second remains still unpaid, with the interest. That until the 4th April, 1845, he relied solely upon his lien upon the estate for payment, but as the vendor\u2019s lien was liable to be lost by a transfer and conveyance without notice, he took a mortgage upon the lot without any abandonment of his lien as a vendor to secure the purchase money. The bill avers that Martin &amp; Ewing took the lot as tenants in common, and that the interest of Ewing is chargeable with the sum due to complainant as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>partnership debt, and is prior to all other claims or liens. The bill proceeds to set forth the recovery of several judgments against Ewing at the May term, 1845, which were levied on the land, and upon which a sale of Ewing\u2019s interest for about $540, was made to Upheld, May 22, 1847, which sale is not yet confirmed. The judgment creditors and purchasers are made defendants, and complainant prays that a sufficiency of the proceeds may be set apart to satisfy one half the debt due from Ewing &amp; Martin, or that the sale may be confirmed subject to his lien, as first lienholder, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-5\">Ford, one of the judgment creditors, answers, admitting the sale and the taking of the mortgage to secure the purchase money, alleges that his judgment for $622.11 and costs was rendered the 5th May, 1845, and his levy made 27th May, 1845, and the mortgage 'was not left for record until July 27, 1845, by reason whereof he and the other judgment creditors of Ewing are entitled to the preference. It denies that B. &amp; M. were in partnership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-6\">The answers of Davis and others are substantially like this. There was a decree below for complainant, from which the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-7\"><em>Martin &amp; Effinger, </em>for complainant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-8\">The first question presented for the determination of the court in this ease is this: Has complainant, by receiving the mortgage in the bill mentioned, removed the vendor\u2019s lien in his favor for the balance of the purchase money ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-9\">It is not questioned that, up to the execution of said mortgage, the lien did exist. The answer only denies that part of the bill -which charges that complainant \u201c did not intend, by taking said mortgage, to abandon his vendor\u2019s lien.\u201d And just here it may be well to inquire, upon whom falls the <em>onus probandi </em>that complainant did, or did not, so intend ? We answer that it is thrown upon the defendants. First, because a party is seldom, if ever, required to prove a negative, and sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ond, because, in all adjudicated cases having a reference to the one at bar, such has been the ruling of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-4\"><em>Prima </em>facie, the vendor has never been held to do more than simply to show that the whole or \u2022 a part of his purchase money remains unpaid, and that the lien arises in his favor, and must be overcome by proof adduced by the vendee, or those claiming under him. Judge Story, in his Equity Jurisprudence, 4th edition, p. 465, says : \u201c Generally speaking, the lien of the vendor exists, and the burden of proof is on the purchaser to establish that, in the particular case, it has been intentionally displaced, or removed by the consent of the parties. If, under all the circumstances, it remains in doubt, the lien attaches.\u201d If <em>what </em>remains in doubt ? Why, simply this, that the vendor desired and intended to look to the <em>estate </em>sold, as his security, even then, the lien is said to attach \u2014 and in order to remove it, there must remain no doubt that the vendor looks to some-other security, as his assurance of payment \u2014 and then, and not till then, does he abandon his equitable lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-5\">This question of intention must always be determined by some outward act, or declaration of the vendor \u2014 as, for instance, if he receives from the vendee an independent security,, this has been held sufficient to remove the lien. The case of <em>Naivee </em>v Prowse, 6 Ves. 752, was for a long time a leading case as to this question. Sir William Grant, in deciding the above case, says: \u201c Upon the question as to the claim set up by Mitchell to a lien, it is now settled that equity gives the vendor a- lien for the price of the estate sold without any special agreement. But supposing he does not trust to that, but carves out a security for himself, it still remains matter of doubt, and has not received any positive decision, whether that does or does not amount to a waiver of the equitable lien, so as to preclude the vendor from resorting back to that lien, the security\u2019 proving insufficient. Without entering into that question, whether every security necessarily amounts to a waiver, it is impossible to contend that there may not be a security that will have that effect, that will be a waiver. By conveying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>estate -without obtaining payment, a degree of credit is necessarily given to the vendee. That credit may be given upon the confidence of the existence of such a lien. The knowledge of that may be the motive for permitting the estate to pass without payment. Then, it may be argued, that, taking a note or a bond, cannot materially vary the ease. A credit is still given to him, and may be given from the same motive, not to supersede the lien, but for the purpose of ascertaining the debt, and countervailing the receipt indorsed upon the conveyance. But,-if the conveyance be <em>totally distinct and independent, </em>will it not then become a ease of substitution for the lien, instead of a credit given on account of the lien ? Suppose a' mortgage was made on another estate of the vendee, will equity at the same time give him, what is in effect a mortgage upon the estate sold, the obvious intention of burdening one estate being, that the other shall remain free and unencumbered ?\u201d Thus the reasoning of the master of - the rolls is all directed to the <em>intention </em>of the parties, and he asserts that the vendee could only have been induced to part with the long annuities (the independent security in that case) in order that he might thereby disencumber the purchased estate of the vendor\u2019s lien, and therefore have the more perfect dominion over it. Can such a reason exist, or such an inference arise, in the case at bar ? Would the incumbrance of the land, by way of mort gage, in this case, have tended to give the vendees a larger dominion over the same? Certainly no one will so contend, as by that means all the world is put on notice of the incumbrance, whereas, had the mortgage not been given, an innocent purchaser might have been found, to whom an absolute conveyance might have been made. Such a change of the tenure of the security, therefore, could only have tended to contract the dominion of the vendees over the land in question, and could only have been induced by the consideration stated in the bill, that is to say, that by this open declaration of the existence of the vendor\u2019s lien, the world might be put on notice, and the vendees prevented from defeating the security of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>vendor in the very thing sold. The intention of the vendor to look to the land as his security, is thus but the more distinctly revealed and proclaimed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-4\">In <em>Mackreth </em>v. <em>Symmons, </em>15 Ves. 340, another leading case in point, Lord Eldon holds the following language in reference to the case of <em>Naiver </em>v. <em>Prowse: </em>\u201c There is just difficulty to conceive how it should have been reasoned, almost in any case, that the circumstance of taking a security was evidence that the lien was given up, as in most eases there is a contract under seal for the money. The master of the rolls having before observed that there may be a security which will have the effect of a waiver, proceeds to express his opinion that, if the security be totally distinct and independent, it will then become a case of substitution for the lien, instead of a credit given on account of the lien \u2014 meaning that not a security, but the nature of the security, may amount to a satisfactory evidence that a lien was not intended to be reserved. And he puts the case of a mortgage of another estate, or any other pledge, as evidence of an intention that the estate sold shall remain free and unincumbered. It must not, however be understood that a mortgage taken is to be considered as a conclusive ground for the inference that a lien was not intended, as I could put many instances that the mortgage of another estate for the purchase money would not be a decisive evidence of an intention to give up the lien, although, in the ordinary case, a man has always a greater security for his money upon a mortgage, than value for his money upon a purchase. And the question must be, whether, under the ciroumstances of that particular case, attending the worth of that very mortgage, the inference arises. In the instance of a pledge of stock, does it necessarily follow that the vendor, consulting the convenience of the purchaser by permitting him to have the benefit, therefore gives up the lien which he has ? Under all the circumstances of that case, the judgment of the master of the rolls was satisfied that the conclusion did follow. But the doctrine as to taking a mortgage, or a pledge, would be carried too far, if it is understood as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>applicable to all cases, that a man taking one pledge, therefore necessarily gives up another, which must, I think, be laid down upon the circumstances of each case, rather than universally.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-5\">See also the case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Roberts et </em>al., 5 Ohio Rep. 35, where this whole doctrine is beautifully reviewed, and where the court, in speaking of the mortgage, or other security, carefully and guardedly describe it as \u201c collateral,\u201d before it can have the effect of destroying the lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-6\">It thus appears most evident that so long as the vendor relies upon the <em>estate sold, </em>connected with the personal security of the vendee alone, no question can arise as to the existence of this lien in favor of the purchase money; and such lien can only be destroyed by such positive outward acts of the vendor as convince the mind that he looks away from the estate sold, to some distinct and independent security. Can it be pretended in this-case, that the complainant, by taking his mortgage on the estate sold, and thus in a manner drawing this identical security the more closely to himself \u2014 looking to no other property or responsibility, but simply changing the tenure by which he holds the estate sold \u2014 has manifested an intention of disencumbering the land of the vendor\u2019s lien and of giving to the vendee, or those claiming under him, as judgment creditors (and not as purchasers), a more complete dominion over the same ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-7\">But, secondly, has not the debt to complainant a strong equitable claim to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale in question, in another view of the ease ? It is charged in the bill that the debt to complainant is a partnership debt, due to him from the firm to whom he conveyed the said estate. This allegation is not denied by the answer, and therefore stands out as an admitted fact. Shall, then, the proceeds of the sale of Ewing\u2019s moiety be applied to the 'payment of his private debts, to the injury of complainant, in his character as creditor of the partnership, or to the injury of Martin, the other partner ? Can so monstrous a claim be preferred, with any degree of seriousness, in a court of equity ? No one attempted wrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>has ever received a more rebuking discountenance at the hands of courts of equity than this very thing of plundering a part nership, in wrong of either of the firm creditors or the other partner, to raise the means for the payment of a private debt of any single member of the firm. There is no principle of equitable jurisprudence which has a more conservative influence in the commercial world than the one we have just referred to, and which tends in so great a degree to define the rights and obligations of firms, as contradistinguished from those of the individual members of the firm, separately considered. And the strong necessity for introducing such a rule is quite a sufficient reason for its ' establishment; for without it, where would be the possibility of protecting a joint concern from inevitable ruin from the prodigality or bad management, in his own private affairs, of any one member of the firm? So strongly has the equity of a claim, such as the one now presented by complainant, operated upon the minds of this court, that in the very face of a statute, contravening the principle we have been discussing, it has held that dower to a widow of a deceased partner could not he assigned in partn\u00e9rship lands to the injury of the remaining partner, or partnership creditors. <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>8 Ohio Rep. 328.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-4\">It cannot successfully be answered to this, that the case at bar is different from the Sumner and Hampson case. For in this, as in that, there was an agreement of the partners that the land in question should be held to pay the partnership debt. This agreement is evidenced by the mortgage made to complainant, by which the premises in question were pledged, as between the partners, to pay this firm debt, and this long before the rendition of the judgment in favor of which the proceeds for the sale are demanded by some of the defendants. And here it should be marked that the mortgage of Ewing &amp; Martin to complainant was dated and executed, though not delivered for record, on the 4th day of April, A. D. 1845, whereas, the judgments of defendants, Davidson et al., were not rendered until 22d of May, A. D. 1845. Now if the said con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>veyanee to complainant did not attach as a mortgage lien until after the rendition of the said judgments, yet, surely, in the eye of a court of equity, so far as Ewing &amp; Martin are concerned, no instrument which they could have prepared would more fully have answered the purpose of a declaration or agreement, that the land in question should be charged with the payment of their partnership debt. This intention having been thus manifested by the partners before the defendants, Davidson et al., claimed to have any lien, places this case on a footing with the case of <em>Green </em>v. <em>Green et </em>al., 1 Ohio Rep. 535, where partnership real estate, held under a declaration of the partners that it should be sold to pay partnership debts, was declared by this court as so sacredly belonging to the creditors as to defeat the application for dower on the part of the widow of one of the firm. An additional authority on this point may be found in Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, vol. 2, p. 672, where that learned judge uses the following language, to wit: \u201c Another species of tacit or implied trust, or perhaps, strictly speaking, of tacit or implied pledge or lien, is that of each partner in and upon the partnership property, whether it consists of lands, or stock, or chattels, or debts, as his indemnity against the joint debts, as well as his security for the ultimate balance due to him, for his own share of the partnership effects.-\u201d And the learned author refers to Collyer on Part. b. 2, ch. 1, p. 65; <em>Wert </em>v. <em>Skip, </em>1 Ves. 239, 456; <em>Hoxie </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>1 Sumner Rep. 181, 182, etc., etc.; also to 4 Johns. Ch. R., p. 522, where it is expressly decided, that \u201c an assignee or separate creditor of one partner, is entitled only to the share of such partner, after the settlement of the accounts and after all just claims of the other partner are satisfied \u2014 that the interest,-therefore, of each part ner in partnership property, is his share of the surplus, subject to all partnership accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-5\">But, finally, and looking only to the mortgage, has not the complainant a higher equity to the funds in question than the defendant judgment creditors ? We take it that this point was expressly decided in 7 Ohio Rep., in the case of <em>The Muskin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>gum Bank </em>v. <em>The Adm\u2019rs of E. Carpenter. </em>In that case a mortgage was taken and defectively Recorded (the recorder omitting the name of one of the subscribing witnesses). Subsequently to the execution of the mortgage, certain creditors of Carpenter sued and obtained judgments, and the contest for the fund was had in a court of equity. Now, in this case of Carpenter, the mortgage as recorded was no notice, it had just as well not been on the record at all, and yet the court, without a dissenting voice, took the funds arising from the sale of the mortgaged premises, away from the subsequent judgment creditors, and gave them to the mortgagee. It will not do to answer, that there was a peculiar equity in favor of the Muskingum Bank in the above case, growing out of the defective execution of the mortgage. It was attempted on the part of the defense, to show that, at the time of the execution of the mortgage, but one individual attested as subscribing witness, but the testimony was conflicting, and the court expressly decided that the weight of evidence was in favor of the opinion that both witnesses attested it at the time of its execution, and that the stronger probability was that the recorder had omitted to record the name of Thos. Ericker, one of the attesting witnesses. That was a case, then, of a perfectly executed mortgage never put on record, yet preferred to subsequent judgment creditors. In the decision of the last mentioned cases, the court say, \u201c whenever rights are acquired, depending on, or in reference to a specific property, they are regarded as possessing a superior equity to a general.lien upon all the estate of a debt- or, as the lien by judgment. The latter does not constitute a property <em>per </em>se, or a right in the land itself \u2014 it only confers the right to acquire such a property by levy. A mortgage is sometimes called a lien for the debt, but it is something more \u2014 it is a transfer of the land itself \u2014 the mortgagee is a purchaser. 2 Oranch 355 ; Ibid. 73. He takes the interest of the debtor subsisting at the'time, and no posterior rights can be preferred to his. Such is the plaintiff\u2019s postition \u2014 he has a specific interest in the lands, and is entitled to a preference over creditors by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>subsequent judgments \u2014 2 Peere Williams 279; 3 Ves. 581; 3 Dess. 568; 3 Ohio Rep. <em>539; </em>5 Ohio Rep. 181,\u201d etc. \u2014 and all this of a mortgage never recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-5\">We conclude then,</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-6\">First. That complainant has a prior lien in favor of his purchase money, because he has always looked only to the estate sold, as his security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-7\">Second. That complainant\u2019s debt is chargeable on the land or fund, by reason of its being a partnership debt, and the land or fund partnership property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-8\">Third. That, without record, the mortgage is to he preferred to subsequent judgment creditors, the contest being in a court of equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-9\"><em>Thomas </em>Ewing, for complainant, submitted the following additional argument:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-10\">I contend that the vendor is entitled to the fund in this case, by virtue of his general lien. He has, in the language of Lord Eldon, in the case of <em>Maruth </em>v. Symmonds, 15 Ves. 350, \u201c <em>that natural justice and equity which excite a </em>wish\u201d that the lien could be enforced; and the weight of authority is. I think, in accordance with that natural justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-11\">Generally, the vendor has a lien upon the land sold, for the purchase money, and that lien subsists, unless the vendor show a purpose to release the land and take,other security. It must he something that shows \u201c that he did not intend to trust to the estate as the pledge for his money.\u201d Long on Vendors, vol. 3, p. 123.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-12\">The question is not whether the vendor intends to rely upon his general lien, but whether he intends to rely upon the estate as a security. If he intends to rely on the estate, the law gives him a lien upon it \u2014 rand it can hardly be said that he shall lose- \u25a0 that lien, because he showed a purpose to strengthen it \u2014 not to abandon it. The essence of the thing \u2014 that at which a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>of equity looks \u2014 is the <em>fact </em>of lien; the <em>form </em>is of little consequence to the court or to parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-4\">In this case it is clear that Boos did not intend to abandon the lien on the estate, or the vendor\u2019s lien, until he got a better, on the same property. He looked to the land sold for his security from first to last, and the act which is claimed as evidence that he had abandoned it, directly proves that he especially relied on it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6aI\">Equity does not abandon the substance and pursue the shadow \u2014 disregard the essence of the thing and insist on the form. Some of our state courts may, for aught I know, have been misled by this species of fallacy; but the English chancery lays down the true rule on the subject, and adheres to it. Did the vendor intend to trust to the estate as his security, or did he intend to abandon that and rely on something else ? If he relied on the estate, he retains his lien upon it. If he did not, but took the other security of some other person, or on some other thing, he has lost it. See 16 Ves. 348-60; 3 Sug., Vend. 123. There is an opinion of some of our judges against the propriety of sustaining any lien (upon land) which is not of record. Such an opinion, whether resting in sound policy and the just principles of jurisprudence or not, might influence the acts of a legislator who may make 'the law, but not a court whose duty it is to declare it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-6\">P. <em>Van Trump, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-7\">The precise question here presented has not been decided by this court in bank, nor to my knowledge has it been adjudicated on the circuit. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-8\">In the case of <em>Tiernan </em>v. <em>Beam et al., </em>2 Ohio Rep. 383, the legal title had not passed from the vendor, or his representatives, to the vendees, at the time the lien was sought to be set up against the land. The question in that case was (the vendor still retaining title), whether a note with indepen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>dent personal security was an extinguishment of the implied equitable lien, and the court very properly held it was not, especially when it was coupled with the proof that it was the contract of the parties that the vendor should retain the legal title as security for the unpaid purchase money. It will not be denied that if the question was between an actual purchaser from Ewing, for a valuable consideration, without notice of the secret trust, the law would be clearly in favor of said purchaser, against the lien. This is so plain a legal proposition, that it is not controverted. Now, upon what principle is this legal rule founded ?\u2022 It is unquestionably upon the ground that the vendor has parted with his title, and that the purchaser has yielded a valuable consideration, without notice of the hidden trust as between the original vendor and vendee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-5\">In the case at bar, the. vendor passes at once full and complete title to- the vendee ; thereby giving it out to the world that he has no claim upon the vendee, or the lands, for the purchase money, and suffers a period of more than a year to elapse before he places his mortgage upon record, giving notiee'of his secret claim for the purchase <em>money </em>yet unpaid. In the meantime, relying upon the facts as they appear openly to all the world, these judgment creditors put themselves exactly in the position of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice, by incurring a large bill of costs in ordering out executions, and making levies, a proceeding they never would have adopted had they been cognizant of the large claim now set up by complainant as a lien upon the lands levied upon. Who can say, so far as the facts appear in the case, but what these judgment creditors of Ewing, became such from the very fact of his being in possession of this land, unincumbered by any apparent outstanding claims against it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-6\">' In this view of the case, after the levies were actually made upon the land in question, the judgment creditors stand upon very different ground from a creditor who has a mere lien by judgment without levy. What I claim in this connection is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>that push this doctrine of a vendor\u2019s implied lien to its extrem ity, upon the authority of even the land-worshiping spirit of English decisions, it is at last, only an implied lien in favor of the vendor, borrowed by the English chancellors from the civil jaw. Yet even in England, the question as to what shall be an extinguishment of the lien, is by no means clear and well settled. In Ohio we have seen fit to adopt the lien, with as yet no very clearly defined limits. In some of the states, such as Pennsylvania, Georgia and Massachusetts, it is rejected altogether, as unsuited to a country in which, by the spirit and habits of the people, and the condition of the country, real estate has become a species of merchandise and traffic, passing from one to another almost with the facility of a chattel. In the several cases of <em>Patterson et al. </em>v. <em>Johnson et al., </em>7 Ohio Rep. 225, 1st part; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>5 Ohio Rep. 35; T<em>iernan </em>v. <em>Beam, </em>2 Ohio Rep. 483: <em>Jackman </em>v. <em>Hallack, </em>1 Ohio Rep. 319; <em>Bank of Muskingum </em>v. <em>Administrators of Carpenter et al., </em>7 Ohio Rep. 21, 1st part, no question was, or could be raised, as to whether a mortgage taken by the vendor from the vendee on the same land, extinguished his prior equitable lien, when the rights of third persons intervene. It is, therefore, a new question in Ohio. It is claimed by counsel on the opposite side, that it rests upon us to show that the vendor, in this case, waived his implied lien for the purchase money. We admit that the current of English cases, and the doctrine of one of our own judges, goes to this point. But what we claim in the case at bar is, that we have shown this fact, by the taking of the mortgage, which, by the presumption of law, overrides the presumed equitable lien, in favor of the vendor, arising out of the mere fact of sale. And the case is here, upon the proposition now under discussion, narrowed down to this single point: Did the mortgage, <em>ipso facto, </em>operate in law as an extinguishment of the prior equitable implied lien ? In other words, does the lesser merge in the higher security ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>This whole doctrine of a vendor\u2019s implied lien, is ably and fully examined by Chancellor Walworth, in the case of <em>Fish </em>v. Howland, 1 Paige\u2019s Rep. 20 ; and to which I call the special attention of the court. I hope the court will examine the case itself, as the review of the authorities by the chancellor is entirely too lengthy to be copied into a written brief. After examining some forty cases, the chancellor sums up as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-5\">\u201c Lord Eldon seems to think that the question of lien or no lien depends altogether upon-the intention of the parties, and that each case must be determined upon its own particular circumstances. If the actual intention of the parties was to govern the decisions of the courts, the lien would seldom be sustained ; for it is probable that not one person in a hundred, who conveys or purchases real estate, is aware of the existence of such a principle of equity. A much safer rule, I apprehend, is, to sustain the implied .lien whenever the vendor has taken the mere personal security of the purchaser only, and to consider any bond, note, or covenant given by the vendee alone, as intended only to countervail the receipt of the purchase money contained in the deed, or to showT the time and manner in which the payment is to be made, unless there is an express agreement between the parties to waive the equitable lien <em>; </em>and on the other hand, to consider the lien as waived whenever any security is taken on the land, or otherwise, for the whole or any part of the purchase, unless there is an express agreement that the equitable lien on the land shall be retained. This constitutes a safe rule, easily understood, and which I consider established by a weight of authority in this country which is not easily shaken. And I believe no English case, previous to-the revolution, will be found in opposition to these principles, except the case of <em>Farwell </em>v. Heele\u2019s, which is overruled by Chancellor Kent, in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Garson.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-6\">I shall neither have time or space to go into an examination of the various American cases upon this question. I therefore-present to the court the mere digested abstract of the points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>decided by them, as collected from the different Digests of the Reports:</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-4\"><em>\u201c </em>A vendor, taking a mortgage on the subject sold, to secure the purchase money, can only claim under the mortgage and its terms. The mortgage supersedes the implied equitable lien for the purchase money, which, but for the mortgage, would have attached to the subject.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>2 Leigh\u2019s Rep. 353.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-5\">This is a decision by the highest court in Virginia, where the English doctrine as to the existence of the mere equitable lien of the vendor, as against the vendee, and all others with notice, has been repeatedly recognized in its fullest extent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-6\">\u201c Whenever any security is taken on the land sold, or otherwise, for the whole or a part of the purchase money, the equitable lien will be waived, unless there is an express agreement that it shall be retained. \u201d 1 Paige 20; 2 Yerger\u2019s R. 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-7\">\u201c A vendor of land executing a conveyance and taking a bond and security for the purchase money, discharges the land from his equitable lien, even while it continues the property of the purchaser.\u201d 5 Munf. R. 297. \u2022 .</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-8\">\u201c A mortgage of land by the vendee, to secure the payment of the purchase money, due by his vendor to the prior vendee, by agreement between all the parties, is a waiver of the general lien, which, but for such mortgage, the immediate vendor would have had upon the land, to secure to him the payment of the purchase money.\u201d Gilm. R. 329.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-9\">I regret I cannot present to the court the report of this case, for the reason that it may be inferred from the language used above as to the agreement between the parties, that it related to the fact that the parties had agreed to waive the lien; when, in my opinion, it unquestionably refers to the relation merely in which the parties stood to each other; that is, that the vendee of the second vendor agreed to execute a mortgage on the same land, to secure the payment of the money which his vendor owed the original vendor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Here, then, are a number of American authorities upon the express point raised in the case at bar. The case of the <em>Bank of Muskingum </em>v. <em>Adm'rs of </em>Carpenter, is cited by counsel to show that the vendor\u2019s lien is paramount to the lien of a general judgment creditor. I do not propose to controvert this pfoposition. This doctrine, however, presupposes such vendor\u2019s lien actually to exist at the time the judgment was rendered. The very point raised in the case at bar is, did this equitable lien exist in favor of the complainant at the time these judgments were rendered and the levies made under them ? The reason why a judgment is postponed to a vendor\u2019s lien where they both exist in fact is, that the one is a general, the other a specific lien, upon the particular property in dispute. The moment the general lien of a judgment becomes specific by levy, in a case where there is no notice of the secret equity, it becomes, in my opinion, a matter of very grave doubt whether the specific lien of the judgment does not override the former, and subject the property to the payment of the judgment. Judge Lane, in delivering the opinion of the court, in this very case of the <em>Muskingum Bank </em>v. Carpenter, confirms this distinction. He says: \u201c Whenever rights are acquired, depending on, or in reference to, specific property, they are regarded as possessing a superior equity to a general lien upon all the estate of the debtor, as the lien by judgment. The latter does not constitute a property <em>per se, </em>or a right in the land itself; it only confers the right to acquire such a property by levy.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAu\">The levy of these judgments, then, upon the premises in question, has converted them, as to this property, from a general into a special lien. If, then, the vendor\u2019s mere implied equitable lien, by the taking of the mortgage, was merged in that instrument, being a higher security <em>in pais, </em>than the mere right raised by equitable implication, the 'complainant is confined to his rights under the mortgage, and is postponed to the superior, paramount, specific lien of the judgments, they being levied before the recording of the mortgage. The point upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the taking of this mortgage turns as much upon a question of <em>merger, </em>as of the <em>waiver </em>of the lien. In either point of view it is, to some extent, a question of intention. Now, what was the intention of the complainant in taking this mortgage ? It was, unquestionably, to secure the payment of the balance of the purchase money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-4\">The American eases already cited, go to the point, that the taking of a mortgage is a presumed waiver of the lien. Apart from the force of these authorities, the allegations of the bill show that it was the intention of complainant to abandon his equitable lien, if he had any intention at all about the matter. If there was an absence of all intention in that regard, then the presumption of law in his favor falls .to the ground. The bill alleges that complainant, fearful that his vendees might convey said premises to some person without notice, and thereby lose his security, was induced to take the mortgage in order to protect himself from the consequences of such conveyance. Now, what is the plain English of this averment? Is it not that he intended to abandon an uncertain and indirect, for a more certain and direct security, and that the one should substitute the other ? He was not satisfied with the implied, and resorted to the express lien. The long interval of time which he suffered to elapse between the sale and the taking of the mortgage, shows with what intent he changed the liens. He had come to that state of mind in which he made his e'ection between the two modes of security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-5\">I do not propose to go into an examination of the English cases. In the language of Judge Story, in the case of <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1 Mason 215, speaking of the effect of the English decisions upon this question of the vendor\u2019s lien, the state <em>G </em>the law on this subject is reduced to a most distressing uncer tainty?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-6\">Great confusion sometimes grows out of the form of the lan guage used by the judges in deciding a given case. Thus, in England, it has been laid down as a kind of maxim, that \u201c if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>fcbe security be distinct and independent, it will then become a ease of substitution for the lien.\u201d It is argued, on the other side of the case at bar, that the kind of security here alluded to, is intended to be distinct and independent of the property upon which the lien is sought to be placed. But it is quite certain that this is not the true meaning of the expression. No case like the one at bar has ever been decided in England. In the first place, it will not be denied that the thing substituted must be a security, as contradistinguished from the mere naked personal liability of the vendee upon the contract of sale; but if it is, in itself, as a new security, distinct from, and independent of, the implied equitable lien, the general terms of the maxim are just as well reconciled with the fact, as though it had <em>been </em>engrafted upon other property than the subject of sale. The case put by Sir William Grant, to illustrate the maxim, does not militate against this view of the subject, for it was not only <em>obiter dictum, </em>but he would very naturally put the strongest case that suggested itself to his mind. Because he puts, by way of illustration merely, the case of other property, it does not follow that a new and higher security upon the same property would not have the same effect; especially as, in England, the precise point here raised upon this mortgage had never been adjudicated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-5\">All that counsel say about partnership, is certainly out of the case. It is asserted in the argument of one of the counsel of last year (for I have not seen their arguments of this year), that the bill alleges a partnership to have existed between the vendees, Martin and Ewing, and that the allegation, not being denied by the answer, is to be taken as true. There was no such allegation to answer. The allegation is, \u201c that Ewing and Martin took the above described tract of land as tenants in common, and therefore the interest of said Ewing is chargeable with the amount due to complainant as a partnership debt,\u201d etc. This is something new! Two partners hold lands as tenants in <em>common </em>\u2014 ergo, they are partners !!</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>Henry Stanbery </em>(attorney general), submitted the following argument for the defendants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-4\">It seems to me this is a very clear case against the vendor\u2019s lien, which is set up by the complainant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-5\">On the 27th April, 1844, the complainant conveyed the land to Ewing 'and others for the consideration of $1200, of which $600 was paid in hand, and for-the other $600 he took the notes of the purchasers, payable six years after date. If the transaction had stopped here, there would have been a lien\u2014 not because there was any agreement for such lien proved, but because it would have be'en presumed from the fact that the vendor took no security. He had nothing to rely upon but a vendor\u2019s lien, and therefore the law presumes he intended to rely upon that. About a year afterward, a new fact occurs\u2014 and a very important one in reference to this lien, and that was the taking a mortgage \u2014 a <em>written and express lien </em>on the land itself, to secure the unpaid purchase money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-6\">This transaction is thus stated in the bill :</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-7\">\u201c Your orator, until the 4th day of April, A. D. 1845, relied solely and alone on his vendor\u2019s lien, but as that was liable to-be defeated by a voluntary conveyance of said land by said Ewing <em>k </em>Martin, or either of them, to some person or persons not apprised of said lien, and that he might thereby lose his security, he took a mortgage upon the above described tract of land; and your orator did not intend to abandon, and he insists that he did not abandon, his vendor\u2019s-lien upon the land in question by taking said mortgage.\u201d '</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-8\">The mortgage was however <em>taken as a security </em>\u2014 as a surer security than the lien. In other words, he took the mortgage as a cumulative security. He intended to have two liens on the same land, for the same debt \u2014 one implied, and the ather express.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-9\">Now, if I understand any thing about a vendor\u2019s lien, it cannot coexist with any other security. It is implied for the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>reason that no other security has been taken. It must appear that the vendor looks to it alone. It is a lien implied, not ex pressed, and just because none is expressed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-5\">The moment, therefore, that Boos took the mortgage, a written pledge of the land itself, all question about a lien implied, because no other security was taken, ceased to exist. After that he stood upon a lien expressed \u2014 not a lien implied. He intended by that act to abandon, and did abandon, his implied lien. The law raises that intention out of the act, for the same reason that the law raised the intention to rely upon the implied lien, before resort was had to the mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-6\">But it may be said that the mere\" taking of the mortgage, without recording it, did not give a lien, and that Boos cannot be said to have abandoned his vendor\u2019s lien until, by the record of his mortgage, he showed a purpose to substitute another lien in its stead.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-7\">If there were any thing in that view, the .easy answer to it is, that Boos did put his mortgage on record. He never abandoned it, and remitted himself to his original vendor\u2019s lien, and never intended to abandon it. At this moment he stands as mortgagee. His only lien on this land is the lien of a <em>mortgagee, </em>not of a <em>vendor; </em>and this was his condition when this bill was filed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b517-8\">Birchard, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aui\">The complainant presents for our consideration a question of very considerable importance, if not one entirely new in this court. As a mortgagee, he has no claim prior to the liens of the judgments, upon which this land has been sold. This results from the provisions of the act relating to the recording of mortgages, under the construction it has repeatedly received by this court. See <em>Stansell </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>18 Ohio Rep. 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Aware of this difficulty, his learned counsel have rested his case upon the broad, equitable doctrine, that the property of one man ought not to be taken from him in .satisfaction of another\u2019s debt without just compensation. This case is therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>presented as that of a vendor, having parted with the legal title, relying upon his lien upon the land sold for payment. It is certainly a strong case of apparent equity.- The naked inquiry is, did he forfeit this equity by his ineffectual attempt to secure it, by way of a mortgage ? This is the great question to be decided. It is thus stated by respondent\u2019s counsel: \u201c Does a mortgage upon the estate sold, taken by the vendor to secure the payment of the purchase money, extinguish his prior equitable lien ? \u201d They say this is a new question in Ohio : and so far as I know, it has never before been presented, or if so, never understood to have beeii presented before a full court for decision. It has been intimated that it would have been better for the people of the state, had the court, at an early day, held that no such lien as the secret lien of the vendor existed in Ohio. It is not for us to say which would have been the better policy. Our courts and our people have for a long time recognized the existence of this species of equitable lien, contracts innumerable have been made in reference to it, and to deny the existence of the rule which recognizes it, at this day, would produce mischief scarcely distinguishable, in consequences and principle, from a legislative act impairing the obligation of contracts. For my own part, I cannot well see how that provision of the constitution which prohibits the violation of contracts, is less obligatory upon courts than upon legislators. Hence the great danger of unsettling by adjudication \u2014 which always has a retroactive operation, a long-settled rule which has been so incorporated into the' judicial system as to become a rule o-f property. Such is the character of the rule recognizing the vendor\u2019s lien. It must exist as to past transactions. If the policy is vicious, the legislature can change it, and provide for the future. That the lien exists in Ohio, under certain circumstances, is as well established as any other principle of law, <em>Tiernan </em>v. Beam, 2 Ohio Rep. 383. When it obtains, the vendee is treated as a trustee to the vendor, for so much of the purchase money as remains unpaid; and the lien is binding upon the vendee, his heirs, and others acquiring title, with notice of the equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Prima </em>fade, it exists without a special agreement. But what facts and circumstances are sufficient to defeat or overcome the apparent equity of the vendor, has often been a question of doubt and difficulty; and the older decisions are not all, on some points, entirely reconcilable. There are also some nice shades of difference in the more modern decisions. However, it is now regarded as well settled, that the equity of the vendor cannot be set up against a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, without notice. Also, that the taking of <em>collateral </em>security, either personal or by way of mortgage, is a waiver which extinguishes the lien ; and that a mortgage for a part of the purchase money, on the same property, is a waiver of the lien for the residue, <em>Brown </em>v. Gilman, 4 Wheat. 290; 1 Mason 212; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>2 Wash. Rep. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In <em>Mackreth </em>v. <em>Symmons, </em>15 Vesey 350, nearly all the English cases are reviewed by Lord Eldon. In 4 Wheat, and 1 Mason, the doctrine is examined at length by the supreme court of the United States. In <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>1 Paige Ch. 20, both the English and American cases are examined by the chancellor of New York. In the latter case the learned chancellor expresses the opinion that the safer rule \u201c is to consider the lien as waived whenever any security is taken <em>on the land, </em>or otherwise, for the whole or any part of the purchase money, unless there is an express agreement that the equitable lien on the land shall be retained; \u201d and in the same opinion he recognizes the principle first stated in <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>2 Vernon 281, and sanctioned by Chief Justice Marshall, in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Gilman, </em>\u201c that where, by agreement, there is an express lien upon the estate for a part of the consideration of the conveyance, it excludes the idea of an implied lien for the residue.\u201d The principle deducible from <em>Mackreth </em>v. <em>Symmons, </em>is clearly \u201c that a mortgage taken upon the estate is not of itself a waiver of the lien, but that when so taken as to evince the intention that the estate was always relied on as a security for the purchase money, the lien subsists, and, if necessary, may be pursued. With this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the principle sanctioned by the supreme court of the United States, in 4 Wheat., maybe reconciled. For a mortgage taken on a part of the premises only, to secure the purchase money, necessarily raises a violent presumption that the parties intended the residue of the estate should pass free and unincumbered. This reasoning admits of no implication that, if necessary, the lien would not -have been recognized in aid of the mortgage, so far as that embraced the vended property. The spirit of the rule being this, \u201c that the lien still subsisted when the obvious intention in taking the mortgage is to rely upon the estate sold solely as security.\u201d We cannot conceive upon what principle an act done with such an object, can be held in equity a waiver or destruction of the lien. At law, it might merge the implied equity in a higher security. This seems to be the ground of decision in the case referred to, in 2 Leigh\u2019s Reports, decided by the court of appeals in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">There is no reason for this application of the doctrine of merger in equity. A merger does not extinguish a claim ; its equity still subsists and is united with the higher security; and whenever it becomes necessary to resort to it for the purpose of justice between man and man, a majority of the court think there is no violation of principle nor any direct conflict with authority, in permitting it to be done in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The quotation from Paige, taken in the sense which we suppose it might have been intended, is not very objectionable, and would not be an authority for rejecting this lien, for here the avowed object in taking the mortgage was to preserve the lien upon the estate itself. If, however, as counsel contend, the chancellor\u2019s intention was to hold that the taking of a mortgage to secure the purchase money, no other security being relied on than the property sold, is either a merger, waiver, or substitution, or other destruction of the lien, we think it is not right to follow him, and that Sir Wm. Grant, Lord Redesdale, and Lord Eldon, are safer guides.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">But aside from all authority, what is there in the effort tc secure an absolute binding lien upon the property itself, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u25a0whole property sold, which should in conscience be held to destroy the vendor\u2019s equity ? The act of taking a mortgage deceives and defrauds no one. It raises no inference and authorizes none, that the party did not rely upon the property as his security for the purchase money; and if there is any foundation in any case for the equitable doctrine, that a man\u2019s land shall not be taken from him till he has received pay for it, by one who has knowledge of the facts, that foundation still remains, notwithstanding a mortgage be taken. As I have said before, the doctrine that the implied lien becomes merged in the higher security, has its force in those cases where it is applicable, in courts of common law. It is not a creature of equity. In deed, equity should restrain the principle and prevent its application, where attempted to be used as an instrument of injustice. The legal doctrine of merger ought never on the equity side of this court to be permitted to work the destruction of a well-established equity, unless the authorities require it. There is no adjudicated case that I know of which requires it save the one in Leigh, referred to above. I am aware that numerous <em>obiter dicta </em>may be found to sustain the notion that an attempt to secure the vendor\u2019s lien by a mortgage on the estate sold, is a discharge, of the lien itself, yet I have never seen, nor do I ever expect to see, a well-considered case expressly deciding that naked point. It seems impossible that such a decision can be based on solid grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">A mortgage taken as this was is not a substitution. That term implies a contract by which the parties agreed to take other property, or other security, and discharge the lien upon the land, leaving the vended estate in the hands of the purchaser unincumbered, subject to alienation. Nor is it a waiver. By waiver is meant an act done showing impliedly or expressly that the party agreed to rely on some security other than the estate for the purchase money, or, without any security, to rely upon the personal responsibility of the vendee alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Again, as this land has been sold, it is urged there can be no relief, because if the vendor\u2019s lien exists at all it is a lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>upon the land and not upon the purchase money, while the bill \u2022seeks the purchase money only.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In answer to this it is only necessary to look at the general equity of the parties and the state of the facts. The land, it is true, has been levied upon and sold upon the execution, yet the sale is not confirmed nor the money paid into the hands of the judgment creditors. It is yet in the custody of the court, where it is held for the use of the one having the better claim. The vendee, creditors and purchaser are in court. None of them have any desire that the sale should be set aside. They, together with complainant, wish it confirmed. Why should the court refuse then to do what equity requires, and secure to complainant the benefit of his lien in this form, and to the creditors the surplus ? Certainly he came not too late to preserve his equitable rights, because he came before confirmation and in time to prevent it if necessary ; in time also to prevent the bidder at sheriff sale from placing himself in the condition of purchaser without notice. Before a confirmation he might interfere, after that it would perhaps have been too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">This brings me to the consideration of another point which has been suggested. That is, that the complainant is too soon in court. True, this objection is not very directly put forward, yet it-is proper that it should be noticed. If I understand the meaning by which it is sustained, it is in this wise : complainant\u2019s claim is not due, and until due he has no right in court, and cannot know that any necessity for a resort to this fund will ever arise. Besides, he has the personal security of Martin for the money due, so that, in effect, this proceeding is for Martin\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">As to the first of these objections, for they should be considered as two and disposed of separately, it is admitted the purchase money is not due, and that when due, it may be paid without a resort to this land, or the fund which it has produced. But is that any reason why complainant should lie still and see his securities swept away, by being placed in the hands of one who may vest the title in a purchaser without notice ? He ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ther has or has not a lien upon the land. If he has such lien, it is clearly his right to protect it. No one can compel him to part with it against his will, nor should he be turned out of court when it is put in jeopardy, and will be lost, or the loss hazarded, irretrievably, without the aid of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Then, as to the personal security of Martin, does the objection amount to any thing ? The land was sold to both, and both Martin and Ewing, by the showing of the bill, are liable for the purchase money. This in nowise affected the vendor\u2019s lien. It existed in no less force than it would if the sale had been made to a single person, and even if the retention and preservation of the lien by Boos should in the end result to the benefit of Martin, that fact furnishes no reason why Boos shall be forced to part with it. It is not for this court, but for the party himself, to elect when, and under what circumstances, he will yield up a security for the payment of his debt which ho lawfully possesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\n<em>Deeres for complainant.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">N.

As it seems to me, that by the decision of this case, novel principles are introduced into the law relative to the. lien of %. vendor of real estate upon the estate itself, for the purchase money, I deem it necessary and proper to state the reasons which have induced me to dissent from the opinion expressed by a majority of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">I am not about to controvert the principle that, in equity, a vendor, under certain circumstances, has a lien upon land sold for the purchase money. This principle has been recognized by this court, and so far as it has been thus recognized, I am-willing to sustain it. But I am free to say that, if the question was now for the first time presented for consideration, 1 should be opposed to the recognition of the principle. I should be opposed to it, because I believe it to be inconsistent with the-general policy of our laws. It is a secret lien, and as such,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>its enforcement should not be encouraged. Since 1831, such has been the policy of our laws, that even a mortgage can have no effect, until it is made public by being deposited with the recorder of the county to be recorded. Such is the express legislation of the state, and this-court, in carrying out the intention of the legislature, have decided that a mortgage, al though executed according to the forms of law, has no effect, either in law or equity, until it is recorded. 13 Ohio Rep. 148; 14 Idem 430. Although the policy of this legislation has been doubted by many of those who have made the law their study, and who have formed their opinions from reading English books and English decisions, still I have no doubt that, on the whole, it will be found to be beneficial to the state, and the people of the state. Cases may, and undoubtedly will arise, where we might wish the law was otherwise, but such cases cannot and ought not to be permitted to interfere with a policy which must conduce' to the general good. It must and always will so happen that, in the administration of the law, injustice will be done in particular cases. By the enforcement of a vendor\u2019s lien, we defeat this general policy of the law. Or, if we do not entirely defeat it, we very materially depart from it. To show that I am not alone in the opinion, that the recognition of this vendor\u2019s lien is inconsistent with the policy of this state, and of other sfates in this Union, I refer to the case of <em>Kauffelt </em>v. <em>Bower, </em>17 S. &amp; R. 64, in which Gibson, J., says, in delivering the opinion of the court, \u201c the doctrine of lien has never been encouraged by the legislature ; but has barely been tolerated in particular cases, and under severe restrictions. Nor can I conceive how it ever came to be considered a principle of general equity any where, that a vendor who has divested himself of every particle of right that can pass by deed, shall nevertheless have an available interest in the land.\u201d And Duncan, J., says, \u201c the doctrine of implied lien here is a novel one, lately imported, and opposed to the policy of our government, which is to leave this species of property altogether free to alienation, unincumbered with secret trusts, or concealed liens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>There is no necessity for the ends of justice that this doctrine of implied lien, for it is but an implied lien, should be sustained. If the vendor intends to rely upon the estate sold, as security for the purchase money, he can retain the estate in his own hands, until the purchase money is paid. Or if ne parts with the title, he can at the same time take back a mortgage and place the same upon record. In either case he is secure, and does not place it in the power of the vendee to defraud him, or any subsequent purchaser. But if he parts with the title without such security, he leaves it in the power of the vendee to commit a fraud. Such person may sell to an innocent purchaser without notice, and receive the entire consideration money. But if, before the deed is executed, the second purchaser receives notice that full payment has not been made to the original vendor, he must lose both money and land. Nothing can protect such subsequent purchaser unless, before receiving notice, he has paid the entire purchase money, and also received his deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Another reason why, if the question were an original one, I should be unwilling to recognize or sustain this implied lien, grows out of the fact, that it is a subject with which nine-tenths, if not ninety-nine hundredths of our people are unacquainted. They understand what is meant by a mortgage and what is meant by a judgment lien, but of this vendor\u2019s lien they know nothing. Chancellor Walworth, in the case of <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Howland et al., </em>1 Paige C. R. 20, well says, \u201c it is probable that not one person in a hundred, who conveys or purchases real estate, is aware of the existence of such a principle of equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">But although, if the question were an original one, I should be unwilling to recognize and enforce the principle in our jurisprudence, still, in accordance with former decisions, I am willing to enforce it to the extent to which it has been heretofore recognized and acted upon. The extent to which this court has heretofore gone is, to establish the principle that a vendor has a lien upon the land sold for his purchase money, provided he takes no other security for its payment than the personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>security of the vendee. But if he takes any other security, let it be real or personal, the security so taken must be relied upon\u2014 the implied lien is extinguished. The same principle or rule prevails, as I understand, in all the other states of the Union where this implied lien is recognized. And it is a rule founded in reason, and easily understood. That is, it is founded in reason, provided there is reason in saying that a man can have an interest in land, after having done all he could, by absolute conveyance, to divest himself of all interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">It is now to be considered whether the complainant, in the ease before the court, is entitled to the relief sought upon principles heretofore recognized in this court, or in any of the courts of the United States-or of England.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The -simple facts of the case are these: The complainant, Boos, on the 27th of April, 1844, sold and conveyed to John D. Martin and Samuel Ewing, as tenants in common, for the consideration of twelve hundred dollar\u2019s, a parcel of land in the neighborhood of Lancaster, Fairfield county. Of the consider ation money one half was paid in hand, and a credit of six years was given for the other six hundred, which will fall due on the -27th of April, 1850.. To secure this last payment a mortgage was executed on the 4th of April, 1845, and recorded on the 21st of July of the same year. Certain of the defendants recovered judgments against Ewing, at the May term of the court of common pleas of Fairfield county, 1845, executions upon which were issued and levied upon his share of, or interest in the aforesaid land. In May, 1847, Ewing\u2019s interest in the land was sold, and the money brought into court, whereupon this bill was filed by the complainant, seeking to appropriate to his use so much of the money so made as will amount to one half the balance which will fall due to him, from Ewing and Martin, in April, 1850, on the ground that he as vendor has a lien upon the land, and that he is now entitled to the money, the land having been sold. It is stated in the bill that complainant when he conveyed, relied upon his lien as vendor, and that he did not intend to relinquish this lien by taking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>mortgage. This allegation I suppose to he merely the suggestion of counsel, and no way material; but if material, it is denied in the answers, and there is no testimony to sustain it There is no suggestion in the bill but that Ewing and Martin are abundantly able to pay the remaining six hundred dollars, nor but that the land which remains unsold, and which is cov ered by the mortgage^ is ample security.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Now here is a case in which it is manifest that the vendor did not trust to the personal security of the vendee, for the whole or any part of the purchase money, or if he originally trusted to such personal security, he ceased to trust to it when he took the mortgage, on the fourth of April, 1845. From that time he relied upon the collateral security furnished by the mortgage, and his implied lien as vendor was extinguished. At least such has been the law as heretofore understood in this state and in the other states of the Union. And I venture to say, that a case cannot be found in the English books to the contrary. The simple question presented in this aspect of the case is this, where the vendor takes a mortgage upon the premises sold, to secure the purchase money, is the equitable implied lien extinguished, or has the vendor a double lien, that is to say, a lien as vendor, and a lien by the mortgage ? A majority of the court say that the implied lien is not extinguished by the express lien of the mortgage, but that the two liens continue to exist together. To my mind it is clear, that the implied lien is merged in the express lien, and that the \u2018 two are inconsistent the one with the other, and cannot exist together, and such I understand to be the uniform current of authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Chancellor Kent, in speaking of this lien of a vendor, says, \u201c in several cases it is held that taking a bond from the vendee for the purchase money, or the unpaid part of it, affected the vendor\u2019s equity, as being evidence it was waived, but the weight of authority and the better opinion is, that taking a bond, note, or covenant from the vendee for the payment of the money, is not of itself an act of waiver of the lien, for such instruments are only the ordinary evidence of the debt. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>taking a note, bill or bond, with distinct security, or taking distinct security exclusively by itself, either in the shape of real or personal property from the vendee, or taking the responsibility of a third person, is evidence that the seller did not repose upon the lien, but upon independent security, and it discharges the lien.\u201d 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 153, 2d Ed. Such is -the principle which has heretofore been recognized by this court, and it has been so uniformerly recognized by the American courts, that it may well be denominated the American principle, and if it does in any respect vary from the English principle, I should be disposed to abide by the opinion of our own jurist, and to follow the decisions of our own courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">From an examination of the text of Story\u2019s Equity, it might be supposed that the commentator differed in opinion from Chancellor Kent, but I apprehend that he should not be so understood. For in the case of <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1 Mason\u2019s Rep. 212, he says \u201c there is a strong if not decisive current of authority, to lead us to the conclusion, that merely taking the bond, note or covenant of the vendee for the purchase money will not repel the lien; for it may be taken to countervail the receipt of the payment usually inserted in the conveyance. But where a distinct and independent security is taken, either of other property, or of the responsibilty of a third person, it certainly, admits of a very'different conclusion. There the rule may properly apply, that <em>expressum faoit, cessare taciturn; </em>and where the party has carved out his own security, the law will not create another in aid of it.\u201d And again, \u201c in a careful examination of all the authorities, I do not find a single case in which it has been held, if the vendor take a personal, collateral security, binding others as well as the vendee, as for instance, a bond or a note with a surety or indorser, or a collateral security by way of pledge or mortgage, that under such circumstances a lien exists upon the land itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In the case of <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>2 Washington\u2019s Rep. 141, the president of the court of appeals of Virginia says, \u201c the doctrine that the vendor of land not taking a security, nor making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>* conveyance, retains a lien upon the property, is so well settled as to be received as a maxim. Even if he have made a conveyance, yet he may pursue the land in the possession of the vendee, or of a purchaser, with notice. But-if he hath taken a security, or the vendee hath sold to a third person without notice, the lien is lost.\u201d And such was the decision of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In the ease of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Gilman et al., </em>4 Wheaton\u2019s Rep. 455, the supreme court of the United States held that \u201c the equitable lien of the vendor of land, for unpaid purchase money, is waived by any act of the parties showing that the lien is not intended to be retained, as by taking <em>separate securities </em>for the purchase money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">This court, in the case of <em>Mayham </em>v. <em>Coombs et al., </em>14 Ohio R. 428, held that the vendor\u2019s lien is lost, when the vendor takes real or personal security for the payment of the purchase money. In that case the real security was a mortgage on the premises sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Such are some of the American cases, and they are all decided upon the principle that when any other security is taken for the payment of the purchase money than the personal security of the vendee, the vendor\u2019s lien is. extinguished. Nor do I understand, so far as I have been able to examine, that a different principle is settled by the courts in England. True, in the case of <em>Mackreth </em>v. <em>Symmons, </em>15 Vesey 329, 342, Lord Eldon seems to consider, that whether taking a distinct security will have the effect to extinguish the implied lien, depends altogether upon the circumstances of each case, and that no rule can be laid down universally; and that therefore it is impossible for any purchaser to know, without the judgment of a court, in what cases a lien would, and in what cases it would not, exist. His language is, \u201c if on the other hand, a rule has prevailed, as it seems to be, that it is to depend, not upon the circumstance of taking a security, but upon the nature of the security, as amounting to evidence, as it is sometimes called, or to declaration plain, to manifest intention, the expression used upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>other occasions, of a purpose to rely, not any longer upon the estate, but upon the personal credit of the individual, it is obvi ous that a vendor, by taking a security, unless by evidence, manifest intention, or declaration plain, he shows his purpose, cannot know the situation in which he stands, without the judgment of a court, how far that security does contain the evidence, manifest intention, or declaration plain, upon that point.\u201d If there be so much uncertainty in England upon this subject, it is matter of regret, and it is to be hoped that that which has heretofore been considered certain, in this country, will not be rendered uncertain by the interpolation of a new principle in the decision of this case. Well might the chancellor express regret, as he does, that this implied lieu had ever been enforced in the English courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">It is believed, however, notwithstanding what is said by Lord Eldon, as before quoted, that it may even in England, in some cases at least, be known when the vendor\u2019s lien is extinguished, without resort to a court. In 2 Sugden 60, it is said, <em>\u201cIf </em>the vendor take a distinct and independent security for the purchase money, his lien on the estate is gone; such a security is evidence that he did not trust to the estate as a pledge for his money.\u201d And again, upon the same page, \u201c and the same rule must prevail, it has been said, where a vendor accepts a mortgage of another estate, for the purchase money, the obvious intention of burthening one estate being, that the other shall remain free and unincumbered; so even where the vendor takes a mortgage of the estate sold for only part of the purchase money; because, by taking a mortgage for part, he clearly evinces his election, that the estate should be charged with that part only.\u201d And again, on page 61: \u201cA bond and a mortgage of <em>part </em>of the estate, have been held to exclude the lier over the rest of the estate. But it seems that taking a covenant, bond or note, for the purchase money, will not affect the vendor\u2019s lien.\u201d And in one case it was held, where the receipt of the purchase money was indorsed on the deed, and a bond given for its payment, that the vendor\u2019s lien was extin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>guished. There is but one case of this description, so far as I 'know, in the English books.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">I am not aware, however, that upon the points so far referred to, there is any difference of opinion between the majority of the court and myself. For I understand it to be admitted, that if a vendor takes independent personal security, if he take real security upon a different estate, if he take as security a part of the estate sold, the equitable lien is extinguished. But if he take a mortgage upon the entire estate sold, then it is said the equitable lien continues, because he thereby shows that it is his intention to rely upon the estate for the purchase money True, he manifests his intention to rely upon the estate for the purchase money; but at the same time he manifests his intention not to rely upon his secret, implied lien. On the contrary, he takes an express lien \u2014 one \u2022 that is open and notorious\u2014 and to me it would seem strange, if this should fail him, that he can ever resort to the implied lien, which'I must think was merged in that which is express. But upon this point we are not without authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The case of <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Howland et </em>al., 1 Paige C. R. 20, is a case in point. The facts of the case, so far as they bear upon the one now before this court, are as follows: On the 10th of February, 1813, one Samuel Howland, then about 86 years of age, conveyed his farm to the defendant, David Howland, his grandson, with whom he expected to reside the remainder of his life; and took back a life-lease, at a nominal rent. In 1816, David Howland conveyed to his brother Pontus, one half of said farm; and in 1825, Pontus conveyed his interest to one of the defendants to the bill. The chancellor refuses to sustain the prayer of the bill, and in pronouncing his opinion against the lien, went into an elaborate review of the authorities, both English and American, after which he remarks as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">\u201c It appears, from this review of the English cases, that the question as to what shall be considered a waiver of the implied lien upon the land conveyed, for the unpaid purchase money, is still unsettled in that country. But I am gratified to find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>in the American cases, so far as I have been able to discover, with one exception, there is a uniform current of authority in favor of what I consider, at this day, as the only correct rule on the subject \u2014 a rule which will enable vendors and purchasers to understand their respective rights, without the necessity of resorting to a court of chancery to give a construction to the varying circumstances of each particular case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Again, the chancellor says :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">\u201c Lord Eldon seems to think that the question of lien or no lien depends altogether upon the intention of the parties, and that each case must be determined upon that principle, and upon its own peculiar circumstances. If the actual intention of the parties was to govern the decisions of the court, the lien would seldom be maintained, for it is probable that not one person in a hundred, who conveys or purchases real estate, is aware of the existence of such a principle of equity. A much safer rule, I apprehend, is to sustain the implied lien, whenever the vendor has taken the mere personal security of the purchaser only; and to consider any bond, note, or covenant given by the vendee alone, as intended only to countervail the receipt of the purchase money contained in the deed, or to show the time and manner in which the payment is to be made, unless there is an express agreement between the parties to waive the equitable lien ; and, on the other hand, to consider the lien as waived, when any security is taken on the land or otherwise, for the whole or any part of the purchase.money, unless there is an express agreement that the equitable lien shall be retained. This constitutes a safe rule, easily understood, and which I consider established by a weight of authority in this country which is not easily shaken. And I believe no English case, previous to the revolution, will be found in opposition to these principles.\u201d This case of <em>Farnell </em>v. <em>Hulis </em>is the one in which it was ruled by the English chancellor that, where the consideration was indorsed as received, and a bond given to secure the payment, the vendor\u2019s lien was extinguished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">\u201c Applying this rule,\u201d says the chancellor, \u201c to the case now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>under consideration, the lien which is claimed in this case upon the land conveyed by Samuel Howland, cannot be sustained. He did not rely upon any implied lien upon the farm for this purpose, but carved ,out his own security, for his support, by a direct incumbrance upon the estate conveyed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The case of <em>Little and Telford </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>2 Leigh\u2019s Rep. 353, which was decided in the court of appeals of Virginia, arose upon the following state of facts: By deed of bargain and sale, dated March, 1819, Brown sold and conveyed to the Wilsons four lots of land, and the Wilsons executed a deed of trust, on the 30th of the same month, conveying the same lots, in trust, to secure the payment of the purchase money to Brown, in installments, stipulating that the said Wilsons should take the rents and profits arising from the same to their order; and in another deed of trust, dated 19th October, 1819, the Wilsons, in order to secure a debt to Little and Telford, conveyed the same lots, and the rents and profits, to a trustee, upon trust that he should sell the same to satisfy the debt. The controversy, in a great measure, was as to the rents and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The court say, <em>\u201c </em>The deed of trust to secure the debt to Brown expressly stipulated that the Wilsons should enjoy the rents and profits until the 25th February, 1827, and Brown could not have acquired the possession, nor consequently received the rents and profits, until that day, either by an action at law or by a bill in equity; and the deed of trust to secure the debt to Little and Telford expressly conveyed the rents and profits arising from the 9th of October, 1821, That is, the Wilsons conveyed by the last deed, the very right which they had reserved by the first. The, circumstance that the first deed of trust was for the purchase money of the property, has no effect upon the question as to the rents: For, 1. The implied lien for the purchase money, which would have existed if the deed of trust had not been given, was utterly destroyed by the execution of that deed, and whatever effect that implied lien might have had upon the question, it is superseded by the deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>I have been the more particular in quoting from the last two cases, because they were decided by intelligent and respectable American courts, and because in each one the question was presented, whether a security taken upon the land sold, operated to extinguish the vendor\u2019s lieu \u2014 the principal question presented in the case now under consideration, and in each case it w\u00e1s decided that, under such circumstances, the lien was extinguished. And here I will remark, that no case has been referred to in the argument, nor have I been able to find any reported case, in which the contrary doctrine is established. Still these. authorities are disregarded and overruled hy a majority of the court in the decision of the case now under consideration, and the rule which Chancellor Walworth thought was too well established by American authority to be easily shaken, is overthrown. And why is it so ? Upon what is the decision of this particular point based ? Certainly not upon decided cases. So far as precedent is concerned, the only authority hitherto adduced is a <em>dictum </em>of Lord Eldon, in the case of <em>Mackreth </em>v. Symmons, 16 Ves. 329, already referred to, that it did not appear to him a violent conclusion as between vendor and vendee, that, notwithstanding a mortgage, the lien should subsist, and especially where the mortgage was .upon the estate sold, for in such case the mortgage itself would show that the vendor intended to rely upon the estate as his security. Upon an examination of this whole case, it will be seen that no question was in fact raised, whether, by takinoa mortgage upon the estate sold the lien was extinguished, nor was any such question in fact decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Now I feel all due respect for the courts, both of common law and chancery of England, but I cannot consent that the mere dictum of an English chancellor shall be held of higher authority than the solemn decisions of our own American courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Although the question of the most practical importance in this case is, whether by taking security upon the estate sold a vendor relinquishes his equitable lien, and which question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>answered by a majority of the court in the negative, still there are other matters involved which, to my mind, furnish insuperable objections to a decree in favor of the complainant. I suppose no one will doubt that, had the mortgage of the fourth of April, 1845, been recorded before May of the same year, we should never have heard of a vendor\u2019s lien in the complainant It was not so recorded, and consequently the defendants, or a number of them, acquired liens upon the land by judgments, prior in point of time to the recording of the mortgage, and therefore- superior or preferable to the lien of the mortgage. And herein consists the sole reason for this proceeding. The complainant was guilty of laches and neglect in procuring his mortgage to be recorded, and consequently the judgment liens attached. These liens attached, not because the mortgage was imperfect, but in consequence of the sheer neglect of the mortgagee. But complainant having thus in part lost the benefit of his mortgage, seeks to avail himself of his lien as vendor, for the purpose of overreaching the liens of judgment creditors. Now it does seem to me, in any aspect in which I can see this case, that the only reason which the complainant has to come into this court, grows out of his own negligence and laches, and although a court of equity might relieve an individual against the negligence and laches of another, I have never known such court to relieve a man from difficulties which he may have got into in consequence of his own laches or negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"A77\">Again, from any thing which appears in the bill, both Ewing and Martin are abundantly able to pay the balance of purchase money which will fall due in 1850. There is no intimation that either of them is insolvent, or are likely to become insolvent, nor is it pretended but that the money due is well secured by the mortgage. To me it seems to be a question worthy of consideration, whether, under such circumstances, a vendor can resort to his lien upon the land. Whether he should not, in the first place, exhaust the personal property of the vendee before he\u2018resorts, to this lien. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>this point I do ribt feel confident as to the practice. In the case of <em>Carson </em>v. <em>green et al., </em>1 Johns. C. R. 303, which was a bill to enforce a vendor\u2019s lien, I find it stated in the bill that a suit had been prosecuted at law, and the personal property exhausted, and, in deciding the case, the chancellor says, \u201c the failure of the personal estate is sufficiently shown in the first instance, and there is nothing to gainsay it,\u201d and then proceeds to decree the sale of the real estate pursuant to the prayer of the bill. True, it is not settled, in the case cited, that the lien of the vendor cannot be resorted to until other sources, from which to compel payment, fail. Still, such an inference may fairly be drawn from the case. It is urged, however, by the counsel for complainant, that the lien of a vendor is but a mortgage in equity, and, as in the case of a mortgage in fact, the mortgagor may, in the first instance, resort to a court of equity to compel the sale of the mortgaged premises to make the money secured, so the vendor may resort to a court of equity to enforce his equitable mortgage. It may be so, and as at present advised I shall not undertake to controvert the position. But admitting it to be so, and considering the caSe in that light, it is clear to my mind that the present bill ought not to be sustained, nor the relief prayed for granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The land in controversy was sold by the complainant, Boos, to Ewing and Martin, as tenants in common. One half the purchase money was paid by the purchasers jointly, and their joint notes given for the balance, with no other security than the personal security of the vendees. Under these circumstances, the vendor had an implied lien upon the land for the purchase money. But this was not a lien upon one half the land, for one half the purchase money still due, but a lien upon the whole land for the entire purchase money. Subsequently, in April, 1845, the purchasers executed to the vendor a mortgage upon the same premises to secure the payment of the remaining purchase money. To this mortgage there were two parties, the mortgagors and the mortgagee. The instrument itself was a joint instrument of the mortgagors, and it covered the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>property originally purchased. This instrument th\u00ae mortgagee received, and by so doing, in my opinion, waived or extinguished his equitable lien or mortgage. My brethren, however, hold otherwise. If, however, it was not extinguished, it was not changed, but still remained an equitable lien or mortgage upon the entire land, to secure a joint debt due from the two purchasers to the vendor. The note given for the purchase money was a joint note, the mortgage executed by the purchasers to secure the payment of the note was a joint mortgage, and if. this equitable lien is to be treated as an equitable mortgage, that, too, must be considered as being joint. Such being the situation the vendor may sue upon his note, not, however, until it falls due; he may proceed upon his mortgage, or he may enforce his equitable lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Now suppose he should elect to sue upon his note, would he commence a suit against one of the makers for one half of the note, and another suit against the other for the other half ? Or could he commence a suit against both the makers for one half the note, leaving the other half unpaid ? No one will hesitate to say that such a course of proceeding could not be sustained. The contract being an entire one, could not thus be divided. And if two suits could be sustained in this manner upon the same note, double that number might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Suppose the vendor should elect to proceed upon his mortgage, could he file his bill against one of the mortgagors to enforce the payment of one half the money due, and a like bill against the other mortgagor to enforce payment of the other half? Or could he file his bill against the two mortgagors, to compel \"the payment of one half only of the purchase money by the sale of one half the land, the balance of the purchase money remaining still due ? It seems to me every person must answer these questions in the negative. And yet this is precisely the case before the court, except that the object is to enforce the equitable, not the legal mortgage. The effort made is not to enforce the vendor\u2019s lien or equitable mortgage, to-secure the payment of the entire debt, but of one half the debt. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>not to enforce payment by the sale of the entire land, but to enforce the payment of one half the debt, by the sale of one half the land. It is no answer to this difficulty to say that the object in view is not to enforce the lien upon the land, but upon the money which is the avails of the land. The express object of the bill is to enforce the vendor\u2019s lien, and if that cannot be enforced upon the land, surely it cannot be .upon the money. As the purchase money is not due, the vendor comes .into this court as a mortgagee, claiming distribution of the avails of land which has been sold at the suit of other persons, but to which he would have been entitled in preference to those persons, had his mortgage matured. In such case he may, if he elect, come into court and claim the money, thereby affirming the sale, or he may disregard the sale, and when his mortgage . matures, proceed against the land. But if he comes in and claims a distribution, he must make such a ease as would entitle him to a decree for the sale of the laud, had his mortgage matured. Surely no such case is made here. This is a bill filed by an equitable mortgagee, having a debt due from the joint debtors, secured by the mortgage, to make one half the debt from one half the mortgaged premises, leaving the balance of the debt still due by both the joint debtors, and the other half of the land still bound for the balance of the debt. The avowed object is to collect that portion of the debt which is supposed to be due from Ewing, because his undivided half of the land has been sold upon execution. And for whose benefit ? Certainly not for the benefit of Boos, for he is perfectly secured for his purchase money. He has the personal security of both Ewing and Martin, and there is no pretense but that they are abundantly able to pay, and in addition to this, he has a mortgage which confessedly binds one half the land sold to pay one half the purchase money. If any one is benefited by the decree in this case, it is not Boos the vendor, but Martin the joint purchaser with \u00a1Ewing, and his co-obligor. Such is the effect of the decree, and yet no one principle connected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>with the subject of such equitable liens, is better settled than this, that no one can derive any advantage from the vendor\u2019s lien, except the vendor himself and his privies in estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">If I am wrong in supposing that the proceedings in this case are not in harmony with ordinary legal or equitable proceedings ; if it be sound doctrine that a payee of a promissory note, made by two individuals, may treat that note as if one half was due from one of those individuals, and the other half from the other, and may bring separate suits accordingly; if a mortgage executed to secure the payment of such a note, may, in like manner, be enforced ; then there is another difficulty in the way! In a note so executed, admitting each one of the makers to be a principal for one half the amount of the note, and no more, yet he must be held to stand in the light of a security for the other half. This, I presume, will not be contradicted. Apply this principle to the case now under consideration, and what is the consequence ? The complainant, Boos, sold the land to Ewing and Martin, received one half the purchase money, and the joint note of the purchasers for the residue. If this note is divisible, and it seems to me that it must be so considered in order to sustain the present proceedings, then each one of the makers is principal for his half of -the note, and security for his comaker for the other half. Ewing is principal debtor for three hundred dollars, and security for Martin for the other three hundred; and so Martin is principal debtor for three hundred dollars, and security for Ewing for the other three hundred. Jf seems to me that we necessarily get into this dilemma by attempting to afford the relief prayed for; and if so, it follows that Boos took collateral personal security for the purchase money of the land sold, and in such case, it is admitted on all hands that the equitable lien is extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">I have now stated some of the reasons which induce me to dissent from the opinion of a majority of the court, in this case. I object to that decision, because I believe it to be inconsistent with the law upon the subject of vendors\u2019 liens, as heretofore construed and acted upon in this and every other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>state in the Union, where the existence of this lien is recognized ; because, by it, decisions made in the court of chancery of New York, and the court of appeals in Virginia, and which are directly in point, are overruled; because, by it, an American rule, which is said by Chancellor Walworth to be too well settled by authority to be easily shaken, is overthro wn; because its effect will be, as I apprehend, to introduce into this branch of the law.the same uncertainty which is said to prevail in England; because it is inconsistent with the general policy of our laws, as to real estate; because no better reason can be alleged for the interference of this court, than the negligence of the party seeking relief; because the relief sought cannot be granted without interfering with the harmony of legal and equitable proceeding, in the enforcement of contracts; and because the relief, when granted, does not result to the benefit of Boos, the vendor of the land, but to tho benefit of Martin, and of the purchasers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
