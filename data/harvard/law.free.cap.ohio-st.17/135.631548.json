The relators set forth that the defendants, on the 6th of March, 1848, \u201cdid usurp, intrude into, and unlawfully exercise, and from thence up to the 7th day of March, 1848, continued, without any legal right, to hold and exercise the office of commissioner of Allen county, contrary to the laws of the state.\u201d Also, that by the act erecting the new county of Auglaize, the defendants became residents of said county, by being included within the territorial limits thereof, and that on the sixth day of March, A. D. 1848, the associate judges, of the court of common pleas of Allen county, convened, etc., and declared said offices vacant, and appointed the relators. to fill said vacancies, who were duly qualified, etc., and became thence entitled to exercise and discharge all and singular the duties and privileges of said offices, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-10\">The defendants have plead not guilty to the charge of usurpation and intrusion into the said offices, and have, also, filed special pleas, setting forth their claim of title to said offices, which, by agreement of counsel, are to be treated as notices of special matter filed with the plea of the general issue, and by said agreement the judgment of this court is to be entered upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the merits as they shall be found upon the agreed statement of facts, which is in these words, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-4\">It is agreed by the parties to these suits, that the said Samuel Walker was elected county commissioner of said county of Allen, at the annual October election, A. D. 1846, for the term of three years, and was duly sworn and legally qualified, and acted as such commissioner from and after his said election, until and after the commencement of these suits, and that at the time of his said election he resided in the township of Moulton, then in the county of Allen, but now in the new county of Auglaize ; and that up to the time of the commencement of these suits he had not changed his said residence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-5\">It is also agreed between the parties to these suits, that the said Nicholas Zanglein was duly elected county commissioner of said Allen county for the term of' three years, at the annual October election, A. .D. 1847, and was duly sworn and legally qualified, and acted as such county commissioner until and after the commencement of these suits \u2014 that at the time of his said election he resided in the township of Pusheta, then in the county of Allen, but now in the new county of Auglaize, and that up to the time of the commencement of these suits he had not changed his said residence. It is also further agreed, that on the 6th day of March, A. D. 1848, the associate judges of the court of common pleas of said county of Allen declared the ofiices of the said Samuel Walker and Nicholas Zanglein to be vacant, and that the said relators, Elmer Hartshorn and Josiah B. Roberts, were appointed by the said associate judges to fill said declared vacancies as set forth in their respective relations; and that the said relators were also sworn, and filed their certificates of appointment and oath of office with the auditor of said Allen county, as set forth in their said relations respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">It is further agreed that the special pleas in these cases shall be considered and held as notices of special matter attached to the general issue \u2014 and further, that the several matters therein set forth is a true statement of the facts of the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>Wm. Lawrence, </em>for the relators.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-5\">On the part of the relator it is claimed that he is entitled to a judgment of ouster against the defendant, and to sustain that claim it is maintained: 1st. That by the constitution and law of the state a county commissioner can only act as such, or hold his office,\\ while ah <em>actual </em>resident of the county.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-7\">2d. That the office is not required by the constitution, is dependent upon legislative will for its continuance, and that a statute may create a disability to hold it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-8\">If the affirmative of these propositions is maintained, then the defendant has no right to hold the office of commissioner, but judgment of ouster must be pronounced against him. The authorities by which they are sustained, certainly appear to be conclusive, and I will examine each separately in the order they are stated. 1st. It is maintained that a county commis.sioner must be an <em>actual </em>resident of the county in which he holds. his office, and that non-residence is a disqualification for which he may be ousted. The constitution of the state, art. 1, sec. 27, provides, that <em>\u201c </em>no person shall be appointed to any office within any county who shall not have been a citizen and inhabitant therein one year next before his appointment.\u201d This clause applies to all county officers, as is evident from the connection in which it is used, and the object in view in framing it. But the act of March 5,1831, establishing boards of county commissioners (Swan\u2019s Statute 205, sec. 1), also provides, \u201c That there shall be established <em>in </em>each organized county in this state a board of commissioners, etc.;\u201d and sec. 6 declares, \u201c That before any commissioner shall enter upon the duties of his office, he shall take an oath or affirmation <em>* * </em>faithfully and impartially to discharge the duties of a commissioner <em>of the county in which he </em>resides.\u201d These and other similar provisions very clearly show that the right to hold the office is <em>dependent on residence, </em>and that any attempt to hold the office by a non-resident, is in violation of law, and without legal authority. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Now as <em>non-residence </em>is a <em>disqualification, </em>it <em>attaches </em>as <em>soon </em>as the <em>non-residence commences. </em>It is the <em>fact </em>of non-residence that creates the disqualification, and it takes effect, like a <em>resignation </em>or the <em>expiration of the term </em>of <em>office, </em>as soon as it occurs, and operates immediately to abrogate all right to exercise the duties of the office. If it does not operate <em>instantaneous, </em>it does not for a day, a month, a year. But it is insisted that the statute of 1831 secures to a <em>non-resident </em>commissioner, or one who has become a non-resident, a right to the office fox* six months after his non-residence. S\u00fach is not the statute. It declares, in the same section which authorizes the associate judges to fill all vacancies except those occurring from expiration of term, <em>\u201c </em>that the <em>absence </em>of any commissioner from the county for six months in succession shall be deemed a resignation of the office.\u201d (Stat. 205, sec. 4.) The constitution and the same law had declared non-residence an instantaneous disqualification from holding the office. This provision then must be understood to embrace a class of eases not already provided for. It declares \u201c <em>absence </em>for six months\u201d a virtual resignation. It declares the effect of <em>absence </em>and- not <em>non-residence.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-4\">It was foreseen that even <em>residents </em>might be <em>absent </em>six months and yet not be, in a legal sense, non-residents. To meet cases of temporary absence, then, of residents, this clause was added to the fourth section of the statute. These disqualifications are founded in reason and expediency. The non-resident commissioner, careless of the burthens he imposed upon others, might levy taxes he had no share in paying, and conduct the affairs of a county in which he had no interest, and to sanction the right .of a non-resident to office is to impair the salutary operation of the law. It is, therefore, very apparent that non-residence renders a commissioner incompetent to hold the office, and the disqualification commences instantaneously with the non-residence. 2nd. The second proposition asserts that the office of county commissioner is a mere statutory office, not required by the constitution, and in all respects dependent on legislative will. If this be so, then the legislature could, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>law, create a legal disability depriving defendant of his right to act as commissioner. As to offices, the term of which is fixed by the constitution, it is not pretended that the legislature has plenary power over them, but as to offices not required by the constitution, there is no limit to the exercise of legislative power. This has become a settled principle in our jurisprudence, and hence it is said, \u201c in the absence of constitutional restriction the creation, continuance, duties and emoluments of an office are matters of political expediency, and to be judged of solely by the legislature.\u201d 7 Bacon\u2019s Abg. 281, tit. Offices: 4 Dev. N. C. Rep. 23; 3 Kent 457. Even as to an associate judge, holding an office, the term is fixed by the constitution; the court has said, \u201c no one would contend that a voluntary removal was not a forfeiture and resignation of his office. Can it make any difference when this removal is effected by the exercise of a constitutional right of the general assembly and by an act of omission in the officer ? It seems to us it cannot.\u201d 11 Ohio Rep. 513. This power has been frequently exercised in Ohio. The legislature abolished the board of public works, and of canal commissioners, and the officers ceased to act. The office of state printer was abolished, and in these and other cases, the officers ceased to hold their offices, although their regular terms, as fixed by prior law, had not expired. The legislature had power to erect the new county of Auglaize, by the constitution; article 7, sec. 3. And by the act creating that county, the residence of defendant was changed from Allen to Auglaize county. By a legislative act he was made a nonresident of Allen county. The legislature having power to do this, and having legally exercised that power, the effect clearly-follows. It matters not <em>how </em>the disability of non-residence attached to defendant; the <em>effect </em>is declared by the constitution and law, as I have shown. Whether the disability be created by the act of God, by the act of the party, or by operation of law, the effect is the same. The legislature, by a solemn act, declared defendant a non-resident of Allen county \u2014 practically declared him no longer a commissioner. It might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>abolished the office, or declared that all commissioners over sixty-years of age should cease to hold the office, for such is the power of the general assembly over an office of its, own creation. The right to abolish the tenure by which legislative offices are held, is incident to the right to create them. The de fendant, then, by <em>operation </em>of law, was <em>legislated </em>out of his office; has been subjected to a disability which deprives him of all right to discharge his official duties; in short, his official existence was terminated by statute.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-4\"><em>Rose &amp; </em>Bliss, for defendants, submitted the case without argument.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b138-6\">Birchard, C. <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Avq\">Upon the preceding statement of facts, our first inquiry is, whether the facts show a right in the defendants to retain the offices to which they were respectively elected. The 4th section of the sixth article of the constitution, declares that the appointment of all\u2019civil officers, not otherwise directed by the constitution, shall be made-in such manner as may be directed by law. There is no provision in the constitution for the election of a. county commissioner. The office is a creature of the statutes. Its duties are there de fined, and to them we must look for the main guide in deter mining the rights of these litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">By the first section of the act establishing boards of county commissioners, passed March 5, 1831 (Swan\u2019s St. 205), it is enacted, \u201c that there shall be established in each organized county of this state, a board of commissioners, to be elected by the qualified, electors of the county, at the annual election in October. By the sixth section, each commissioner, before entering upon the duties of his office, is required to take an oath or affirmation faithfully and impartially to discharge the duties of a commissioner of the county <em>in which he resides.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">These provisions of the statute seem to indicate that the office of commissioner of a county can only be held by a resident of the county. And when we take into consideration the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>duties of the board of commissioners, the fact that they are the representatives of the county in its corporate capacity, that they are the corporate body in all suits and contracts, relating to the interests and funds of the county, etc., we cannot doubt that non-residence within the county is a disqualification, which necessarily vacates the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">It is, however, argued in behalf of the defendants, that under the provisions of the fourth section of the act (Swan\u2019s St. p. 205), they were entitled to hold their offices for the period of six months after the passage of the act erecting the county of Auglaize. This section authorizes the associate judges to fill any vacncay in \u25a0 the office of county commissioner, occurring from any cause other than the expiration of the term for which he was elected; and the last two lines of the section read thus: \u201c And the absence of any commissioner from the county for six months in succession, shall be deemed a resignation of the office.\u201d Has this clause any such bearing on this case as is contended for ? We think not. It was intended to meet and provide for a case, in all its essential features, entirely different\u2014 a case of neglect of duty, by continued absence from- the county, without a change of residence. It is not necessary to extend the provisions of this act to anything else. The case designed to he provided for is manifest; and it would be overstepping the legitimate bounds of judicial interpretation to make the clause embrace more. i</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">There remains still the question, wha,t. effect had the act creating the county of Auglaize upon the residence of defendants ? By the agreed statement, they became residents of the territory constituting the new county. The power of the general assembly to thus change the limits of a county is undoubted. It follows, that persons residing within the limits of territory detached from the old, and attached to the new county, cease to be residents of the former, and become residents of the latter ; and unless there is some provision of the act erecting Auglaize county, modifying the apparent effect of these general principles, it would also follow that the defendants were both' legislated out of office on the 25th of February, 1848.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>But there are provisions of the act which exclude the con elusion that the general assembly intended to effect a result so summary. Vol. 46, p. 130 L. L., \u00a7 10 of the act, provided for official action of these relators, as commissioners of Allen county, <em>immediately upon the passage thereof. </em>It made it their duty to reorganize certain townships or parts of town ships effected by the act, conclusively showing that, for a time, their respective offices were to survive the erection of the new county. Within this period, we are of opinion these defendants might have secured their titles to the offices of commissioner, by removing within the newly prescribed limits of Allen \u25a0county. An intention so to remove was not sufficient. The intention should have been evidenced and accompanied by an actual removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">What was the precise limit to this period of election is not given in any direct language, yet it may be satisfactorily ascertained by a careful consideration of the act itself, and of the general duties of the board of county commissioners. The 6th section of the act continued the duties and jurisdiction of the sheriffs, coroners, constables, and collectors of taxes of Allen county, on the territory detached therefrom, until the first Monday of March, 1848. All writs in that part of the territory were to be styled of the county of Allen, until the first of March (\u00a7 7, p. 129), and after that of the county of Auglaize.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">To this period, the county of Allen in its corporate capacity was interested in the taxes collected and the costs, etc., made in her name, and there was much propriety in continuing the control of the corporate officers elected for the original territory, till that time. After that, there was very little propriety in subjecting the interests of Allen county to the control of those who then became exclusively identified with the new county of Auglaize.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">A necessity existed for filling the board of commissioners on the first Monday of March, that being the time appointed by law for holding an annual session. The relators, by the agreed facts appearing to have been duly appointed and qualified, are \u25a0entitled to the offices claimed by them respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\"><em>Judgment </em>accordingly\u00ab</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
