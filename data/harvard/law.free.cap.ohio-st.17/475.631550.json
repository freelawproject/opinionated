On the trial of this cause the plaintiff, by his counsel, called witness Alexander McBain, who testified that he was editor and publisher of the American Patriot, a newspaper published in the town of Wellsville. That an article signed \u201c J,\u201d in manuscript, was brought to his office, to which was appended a note, requesting the publication in said paper of the article J, and that on no consideration should he disclose the author\u2019s name ; which note was signed J. Russell, and he believes it to have been written by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-8\">That said article J, was published in said newspaper, and is marked A, of the date of the 13th of August, 1845.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-9\">That afterward the article \u201c B,\u201d signed A. McLaughlin, declared on, was published on the 20th of August, 1845, in said paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>That only one article signed J, and one reply to the same, was published in said paper. That from three to five hundred impressions of said article, being the circulation of said paper, were published.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">The plaintiff then called Henry Paul, a witness, and'asked him the following question, which was excepted to by the defendant, and the objection overruled and the question put:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">What did you hear McLaughlin say, if any thing, as to who was the writer of the article J ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">The said witness, then \u2022 stated that at an interview with the defendant, he, the defendant, stated that he had found out that the article J was written by the plaintiff, and then read from'a newspaper which he had in his possession, the defendant\u2019s an swer to the article J. And from the conversation the witness-understood the article of defendant to relate to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">McLaughlin said that Mr. Russell was the man who wrote the article J, and that he wrote the reply to it, which was .then read from a newspaper in McLaughlin\u2019s possession. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then produced a newspaper and placed it in the hands of the witness and asked him to read the article signed \u201c Alexander McLaughlin,\u201d and say whether it was the same that had been read to him by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\">To which the defendant\u2019s counsel objected, unless it be proven that the newspaper exhibited to the witness was the same identical paper from which the defendant read to the witness or that notice was given defendant to produce that paper- \u2014 or proof of its loss \u2014 and insisted that secondary evidence could not be admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-11\">The court overruled the objection, and the witness being asked to look at the article signed \u201c Alexander McLaughlin,\u201d said that \u201c I believe it is the very same article.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-12\">To which rulings the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-13\">2. Be it remembered that on the trial of this cause, after Henry Paul had testified, the plaintiff, to support the issue upon-his part, gave evidence that defendant carried to the office of the American Patriot, a communication in manuscript, for pub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>lication; that the said manuscript is lost or destroyed. The editor and publisher was then called up and gave evidence as follows: \u201c I made an alteration in the article, which I did not suppose materially altered the meaning of the article, and published it in the American Patriot of August 20, 1847 ; that an edition of between three and four hundred was printed and circulated.\u201d The plaintiff then offered in evidence the American Patriot of August 20, 1847, containing the alleged libel, to which the defendant objected. Objection overruled and paper admitted; to which decision defendant excepts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">The plaintiff, in further support of the issue upon his part, offered to prove, by witnesses on the stand, as follows: that they were acquainted with the parties, that they had read the said publication, and that from their knowledge aforesaid, and from reading the alleged libel, they understood and believed that the plaintiff was the person meant and intended in said libel as the Mr. J.\u201d against and concerning whom it was published'; to the admission of which defendant objected. Objection over ruled \u2014 evidence admitted. Plaintiff excepts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-7\">To which said ruling the defendant excepts, and his bill of exceptions are here allowed him, and' the same are ordered to be made part of the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\">The errors assigned are\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-9\">1.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Act\">The objection taken to the declaration is, that it does not show upon its face that the libel was upon Rus sell. This is a mistake. The declaration avers that the publication was of, concerning and against the plaintiff; that defend ant published, etc., the false, scandalous, malicious, defamatory and libelous matters of and concerning the plaintiff, that is to say, etc., setting forth the libel, with inuendoes, averring that certain words meant the plaintiff. The words of the libel were actionable, and were alleged to have been published of the plaintiff. The particular words said to have been intended to indicate him are referred to, and averred to have meant him. This was sufficieut. It would have been good on demurrer, and is dearly so after verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">In support of the second assignment, it is urged that there should have been proof that the paper offered in evidence was the same one used by McLaughlin to the witness, or that its loss should have been accounted for. It is to be observed in reference to this objection, that the proof was, that several hundred sheets of the impression containing the libel had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>struck off, that this paper offered in evidence was one of the impressions, and identical with that read to the witness -by McLaughlin. The objection that this paper was but secondary evidence, is not founded upon correct premises. It was no more secondary in its nature than would be one duplicate of one original contract secondary evidence to the other. Any one number of the entire impression was as much an original as any other number. There is no reason why any difference should be made between the numerous sheets of the same impression. All must of necessity be alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Again, the objection that the published article had. been changed in an immaterial matter from the manuscript, should not have excluded it from the jury. The witness Paul stated that McLaughlin read it to him from the newspaper, stating that he was the writer. This was evidence from which the jury might have found him, the writer, against the evidence of the editor, and thus sustain the first count of the declaration. Or they might infer from this acknowledgment, that he authorized or procured the editor to make the immaterial alteration, and so sustain the allegation of the other counts, that he caused and procured the libel to be written, etc. The evidence was competent, and properly admitted. It tended to support the declaration. Whether it was sufficient or not was for the jury to determine. It was for them to say whether the editor\u2019s statement, or the statement of Paul, was to be received as truth. The only remaining inquiry is,- whether witnesses may be called to prove the party intended and meant by an ambiguous libel. In this case the defamation was directed against Russell by the name of J. The substance of the averment is, that the writer, by J, meant the plaintiff Russell. The colloquium, specific averments and inuendoes, are all of them sufficient, if true, to point fo the meaning of the writer, and leave no doubt upon the mind as to the party intended to be defamed. But how shall the court and .jury ascertain the truth or falsity of them ? The defendant pleads not guilty. He would not admit them. Must a slanderer escape punishment because he has had the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>genuity to so compose a slanderous article that strangers would not know whom he intended to vilify, while, at the same time, his victim is so referred to, that none of his acquaintances would mistake the application ? The rule contended for would work this result. Fortunately, that rule is as illy sustained by the authorities as by right reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Starkie says the colloquium and other averments which connect the libel with the plaintiff, must be proved, and that it is usually shown by the testimony of one or more witnesses who knew the parties and circumstances, and -who state their opin ion and judgment as to the intention of the defendant, to apply his words or libel to the parties or circumstances as alleged. It is sufficient if the witness, in the first instance, state his general belief and opinion as to the defendant\u2019s meaning, without disclosing his reasons, leaving it to the defendant if he thinks proper, to inquire as to the grounds and reasons which support that conclusion. Stark. Ev. part 4, p. 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Numerous authorities have been adduced to the same point. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckingham, </em>Thatcher\u2019s Crim. Cases 29; Starkie on Slander, vol. 2, p. 50; Cooke on Def. 146; 2 Greenleaf\u2019s Ev. 394; <em>Bourke </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>12 Eng. C. L. 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">On the other hand, two eases are relied upon from New York as supporting a contrary doctrine. Did they both come up to the point we should refuse to follow them. But the leading case of <em>Van Vechton </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>5 Johns. 24, does not reach this point. The point decided in <em>Van Vechton, </em>which is supposed to bear on this question was, that a witness could not be permitted to testify to the construction of a libel, unaided by any circumstances within the knowledge of the witness, exccept what he derived from reading the libel. To have held otherwise, would have been against every principle of law, says Judge Spencer, and we concur with him. This case does not purportito overrule the law as stated in Starkie.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The case of <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>4 Wend. 326, however, does. The court, in that case, copy the very passage which I have quoted above, and remark, that Mr. Starkie cites no case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>as authority in support of his position, and express the belief that none is to be found, and that it is not sustained by any other writer upon the law of libel or the rules of evidence. '</p>\n<p id=\"A-ms\">With due deference, we think the learned judge who deliv ered that opinion, was altogether mistaken as to the state of the authorities and the opinions of <em>law writers, </em>and not less mistaken in supposing that the case of <em>Van Veohton </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>the only one to which he referred, overruled the text in Starkie. It is evident to my mind that Judge Spencer, Kent and Thompson, when assenting to that decision, thought of nothing of the kind. They never suspected that their decision would work such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
