Haller and Nicholas Zanglien, two of the old commissioners of said county, still acting as such, convened in special session at the office of the auditor of said county, smd then and there appointed the said Thomas K. Jacobs, treasurer of said county, to fill said vacancy; and that on the 29th day of said month the said Jacobs gave bond, to the acceptance of the commissioners of said county, as required by law, took the oaths of office, which said oaths were indorsed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>upon said bond, and said bond so executed and indorsed, was then deposited with said auditor, and the said Jacobs, on said day, entered upon the discharge of the duties of said office, and continued in the discharge thereof until the expiration of said term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">It is further agreed that said Haller, on the said 28th and 29th days of said month, was a legal commissioner of said county; and that said Zanglien was also a legal commissioner of said county, unless he was disqualified by the following state of facts, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">On the second Tuesday of October, 1847, said Zanglien was duly and legally elected commissioner of said county, for the term of three years-; that he was legally qualified as such commissioner ; and that he entered upon the discharge of the duties of said office, and continued in the discharge thereof until after the said 28th and 29th days of said month. On the 14th day of February, 1848, the legislature of Ohio passed a law erecting the <em>county of Auglaize; </em>which act took effect for the purposes of the organization of said Auglaize county on the 1st day of March, 1848. On the said 14th, 28th and 29th days of said month, said Zanglien resided within the limits of said county of Auglaize, but within tho old boundaries of said county of Allen.. Immediately after the passage of said act, the said Zanglien elected to remove into the said county of Allen, and discharge the duties of his said office for the said term; of which said election said Zanglien immediately gave notice, and made arrangments to remove as soon as practicable. And that on the said 28th and 29th days of February, 1848, said Zanglien had rented a house in said county of Allen, to which he then intended to remove in a few days \u2014 of all which facts said Zanglien, on the 6th day of March, 1848, gave notice to the associate judges of said county of Allen. On the said 6th day of March, the said associate judges of said county met at the clerk\u2019s office in said county, and declared the offices of said Zanglien, and one Samuel Walker, as commissioners of said county of Allen (who also, by the said division of said county of Allen, then resided in the said county of Auglaize), vacant,, and proceeded to appoint Josiah B. Roberts and Elmer Harts-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>horn to fill said supposed vacancies. And on the same day, said Roberts and Hartshorn took the oaths prescribed by law to be administered to county commissioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-4\">It is further agreed that the said Haller refused to recognize the said Roberts and Hartshorn as his proper colleagues in the board of commissioners of said county of Allen; but, on the contrary, recognized said Zanglien and Walker as his proper colleagues, who continued to act as such commissioners until they resigned their said offices, a short time prior to the October election, 1848, when their places were supplied without controversy. And that said Zanglien was not present at the June session, 1848; that he, after the commencement of the proceedings in the nature of <em>quo warranto </em>against him, abandoned his intention of removing into said Allen county; and that he and said Walker never actually removed their residence into said county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\">It is further agreed that said Roberts and Hartshorn (except in making the appointment of Moses B. Newman, hereinafter mentioned), never acted as commissioners of Allen county\u2014 but on the contrary thereof, said Haller, Walker, and Zanglien acted as such commissioners of said county, and transacted all of the business of said offices until the resignation of the two latter, as before stated. And it is agreed that said Roberts and Hartshorn met on the first Monday of June, 1848, and demanded their seats as commissioners of said county, which were refused to them by said Haller and Walker, who were then acting, and continued to act as aforesaid, as the board of commissioners of said county; and in compliance with the decision of said Haller and Walker, the auditor of said county declined recording any separate proceeding of said Roberts and Hartshorn; but continued to record for said board of Haller and Walker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-6\">And it is further agreed that on the 24th day of May, 1848, the said Roberts and Hartshorn appointed the said Moses B. Newman to fill a'supposed vacancy in the office of treasurer of said county, occasioned by the death of said Beaty, as before stated \u2014 that said Newman gave bond as required by law, to the acceptance of said Roberts and Hartshorn, and took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>statutory </em>oath, which was indorsed on said bond, which said bond, so executed and indorsed, was deposited with the auditor of said county.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-5\"><em>B. </em>Stanton, for the relator.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-6\">Upon the agreed statement of facts three questions arise. 1st. Were Zanglien and Walker commissioners <em>de facto </em>of Allen county, after the*creation of Auglaize county, whose acts are valid, and cannot be inquired into collaterally ? 2d. Is this a collateral proceeding, in which the validity of their acts cannot be inquired into ? 3d. Was the office vacant on the first Monday in June, so that a valid appointment could be made by any authority ? And,</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-9\">1st. Were they commissioners <em>de facto f</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-10\">An officer <em>de facto </em>is one who has some colorable, though defective, title to the office which he claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-11\">An election to an office does not give a man a colorable title to it forever afterward^ Suppose their term had expired, or they had remained beyond the original limits of Allen county, could it still have been claimed that they had a colorable title to their offices ? Commissioners must reside in their counties. And where they cease to do so, whether by their own act or by operation of law, they cease to have any color of title to their office. In Angel\u00ed &amp; Ames on Corporations, p. 160, it is said an officer <em>de facto </em>is one who \u201c has the reputation of being an officer.\u201d An illustration is given where an under steward receives rent after the death of his principal. But it is said, if the death of the principal was known to the tenants, his acts would not be valid. The doctrine of officers <em>de facto </em>is a sort of fiction,' invented for the protection of strangers who are ignorant of the defect in the official title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-12\">The reason of the law does not exist in this case, and therefore the-law ought to cease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-13\">The case of the <em>State </em>v. <em>Alling, </em>12 Ohio Rep. 16, is not like this case. There the judges were elected and commissioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>, for the constitutional term of seven years, and it might well be doubted whether any change of^the boundaries of the county could deprive them of their office until the expiration of the term for which they were elected. Here the term of office is. fixed by law, and may be changed at the pleasure of the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-4\">2d.. Is this a collateral proceeding, in which the title of these commissioners cannot be inquired into ? If it were an action of trespass against a supervisor for opening a highway, established by these men claiming to be commissioners, it would look to me much more like a collateral proceeding. But this is a quo warranto to inquire into the defendant\u2019s title to the office which he claims. It .is in the nature of a contested election. And in such a proceeding, what can be more directly in issue than the qualifications of the electors. How can it be said that a man is legally elected, or appointed to an office, when it is admitted that those who voted for him were not legally qualified electors ? There is no such thing as voters <em>de facto </em>who are not voters <em>de jure. </em>The election or appointment of an officer is a very different thing from a judgment of a court affecting the rights of parties, who have acknowledged the jurisdiction, .by litigating their cause before it. Of course such judgments cannot be impeached collaterally, by impeaching the title of the judge to his office. But where the title to an office is directly put in issue, it seems to me that the rightful authority of the appointing power to make the appointment, ^cannot be a collateral matter. And so are the authorities. \u201c It has been held that an information may be granted to impeach the title to an office, though the objection arise from a defect in the title of the officer\u2019s electors.\u201d Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations 481; <em>The King </em>v. <em>The Corporation of Punyu, </em>8 Mad. Rep. 216. And a judgment of ouster against the elector is evidence against the officer. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Hebden, </em>2 Strange 1109. In the case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Lile, </em>2 Strange 1091, the defendant was elected church warden of the corporation of Christ .Church, at a meeting at which one Goldmeyer presided as mayor. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>first question was whether Goldmeyer was mayor defacto, and it was held that he was not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-5\">2d. If he was, whether the presiding of a mayor <em>do facto, </em>was sufficient. And the court strongly inclined to the opinion-that it was not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-6\">In the case of <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Jays, </em>Croke\u2019s Eliz. 699, the queen\u2019s auditor and surveyor for the county of Nottingham, appointed a steward of a -manor, <em>pro hoc vice, </em>who held the court-leet and granted by copy, land which had anciently been copy and had escheated to the crown for felony, to the defendant and his heirs. It was held, 1. That a copyhold may be granted by the lord of the manor, and by the steward, <em>if he be the steward. </em>2. That the appointment of the steward by the auditor and surveyor is not good. 3. Admitting that he is not steward <em>de jure, </em>yet he sitting in the court and granting the copy, and admitting him, and the fine being paid to the queen, whether it be good or not. <em>Per curiam ; </em>the grant is void for it is not a thing of necessity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-7\">The case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Hebden, </em>2 Strange 1109, was an information, in the nature of -a quo warranto, against the defendant, as bailiff of Scarborough. He made title under the bailiffship of Batty &amp; Armstrong. Upon issue joined, whether Batty &amp; Armstrong were bailiffs, a judgment of ouster against them was read in evidence. And upon a motion for a new trial, it was held that the evidence was properly admitted, and a new trial was refused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-8\">The case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Mein, </em>3 Term Rep. 596, was an information against the defendant as portreeve of the borough of Eourey, in Cornwall. The defendant claimed under an election by the tenants of the Prince of Wales, upon the court rolls of the borough and manor. It was replied, that 22 of the persons who had voted for the defendant, had not been duly admitted tenants of the borough and manor, upon the court roll of the manor. To this it was replied, that this was a collateral proceeding, in which the right of the tenants to vote could not be inquired into, until it was settled by an informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>tion against them. But it was held by the court, Lord Kenyon, chief justice, that the question might be tried in this proceeding, and an information was granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-4\">The case of <em>The King </em>v. Grimes, 5 Burrows 2599, was a quo warranto against the defendant, as one of the chief burgesses of the borough of Yarmouth. The two principal questions in this case were : 1. Whether the defendant was legally elected? 2. Whether John Leigh was mayor at the time of the election ? On the second question, a judgment of ouster against Leigh was produced and held competent evidence,, though not conclusive, as it might have been procured by collusion. Further evidence was given by the crown, which was held sufficient, and judgment of ouster was given against the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-6\">In the case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Wilson &amp; Gould, </em>2 New Hampshire Rep. 202, the plaintiff was elected town collector, and accepted the office, but was not sworn in. When the tax list was prepared, it was tendered to him for collection, but he refused to receive it, without an indemnity, which the selectmen refused to give. They treated this as a refusal to serve, declared the office vacant, and on the next day appointed the defendant Wilson, collector. He distrained the plaintiff\u2019s property for taxes and sold it, and this action of trespass was brought to recover damages for this distress and sale. And it was held by the court that the selectmen had no power to appoint the defendant treasurer \u2014 that he could not justify as an officer <em>de facto, </em>and judgment was given for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-7\">The case of <em>Ex parte </em>v. <em>Wilcox et al., </em>7 Cowen 402, was a motion to vacate the election of directors of the Utica Insurance Company. The principal ground of objection was, that the inspectors of the election had not been appointed in the manner required by the charter. In answer to this it was said, that, at all events, they acted under color of authority, and therefore were inspectors <em>de facto, </em>and that was enough. It was said in reply, that the exception in favor of officers <em>defacto </em>only operates in favor of innocent strangers, and can have no application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>in a proceeding instituted to test the validity of the election. And of this opinion was the court, and the election was set aside on this ground'.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-5\">These cases most abundantly sustain the principle quoted from Angel\u00ed &amp; Ames, and if that is admitted to be good law, it is conclusive. But if the court are against me on these points; then</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-6\">3. Was the office of treasurer vacant on the first Monday in June, when the defendant\u2019s last appointment was made, so that a valid appointment could be made ? Roberts and Harts-. horn were commissioners <em>de jure </em>as well as <em>de facto, </em>from the 6th pf March, 1848, until the annual election. They appointed the relator treasurer, on the 24th of May, for the term of two years, from the first Monday in June, 1848. He had been qualified, and given bond according to law. County commissioners can only appoint a treasurer to \u201c fill a vacancy.\u201d But there was no vacancy to fill on the first Monday in June, and therefore the appointment was void, and the relator is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-7\"><em>Rose \u00a7 Bliss, </em>for the defendant, submitted the case without argument.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b149-8\">Avery, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvE\">Was the appointment of Jacobs, the defendant, to the office of treasurer, valid ?</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Two commissioners, under the law, constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; and they have authority, by statute, to fill a vancancy in the office of treasurer. Haller was, without dispute, a commissioner; Zanglien claimed to be a legal commissioner, and on the 29th of February, 1848,-probably was so. But conceding that he was not, then can a commissioner de <em>facto </em>merely, make a valid appointment of treasurer ? And if he can, was Zanglien such a commissioner ? Judges <em>de facto </em>of the court of common pleas, though they be not judges <em>de jure, </em>can make a valid appointment of a clerk of the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Alling, </em>12 Ohio Rep. 16. That decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>was made, we believe, in accordance with the authorities; and the doctrine will apply to a commissioner of the county as well as a judge of the court. A denial of it, in either case, would be productive of great mischief in the community, creating derangement in business, and involving innocent men, who have dealt with officers upon the faith of a public appointment, in difficulty and losses. We say, then, that a commissioner <em>de facto </em>can make a valid appointment of <em>treasurer; </em>and if Zanglien, on the 28th day of February, was a commissioner defacto, the defendant, at the institution of these proceedings, legally held the office of treasurer, and could not be ousted.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Was Zanglien a commissioner <em>de facto ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">It will be seen from the statement of facts, that Zanglien and Walker, who were legally the commissioners of. Allen county, when the new county of Auglaize was erected, claimed still to be the commissioners of Allen county, and continued to act as such commissioners, until after the appointment of the defendant ; and that the two persons named as commissioners by the associate judges, were never recognized by the other commissioner, or the auditor of Allen county, and never acted as commissioners, except in making the appointment of the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">They, with Haller, the other commissioner, had the control of the books and papers; and the auditor acting under the law, as clerk of the commissioners, recorded all their proceedings and orders, as the acts of the lawful commissioners. This would seem to be a strong case of an officer <em>de facto. </em>Such an officer is described by Lord Ellenborough, in-the case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>The Corporation of Bedford </em>Level, as \u201c one who has the reputation of being the officer he assumes to be, and yet is not a good officer in point of law.\u201d - In the case before referred to, in 12 Ohio Rep., the court say that the court held that Choate and Somers, who appointed the clerk, <em>\u201c </em>were not- judges of Huron countyand those judges were- held to have lost their offices before the expiration of the term for which they were elected, because, by a change of the county line, their place of residence was not within the new limits established, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>for the county, yet the circumstances connected with their claim to retain the office, made their acts valid, until the decision against them. And in the case before us, Zanglien, the commissioner, would find in the act, which it is claimed put an end to his office immediately, good reasons for doubting or denying that such was the effect of the law. The tenth section of the \u201c act to erect the county of Auglaize \u201d (Ohio Laws, Vol. 46, page 130), directs \u201cthat the county commissioners of each of the counties effected by the passage of the act, shall here proceed, immediately upon the passage thereof, to attach townships and parts of townships, etc., and to organize said parts of townships, etc., that they may deem expedient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">By other sections, suits within the limits of Auglaize, if pend ing before the first of March, shall not be tried in Auglaize ; but after the first day of March, \u201c suits and other legal process, etc., shall be styled of Auglaize county,\u201d and collectors for the counties .respectively shall collect taxes till the first Monday of March. The court have no difficulty in deciding that Zanglien was an officer defacto, and that his acts cannot be impeached collaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The question is raised in the argument on the part of the relator, whether the defendant is entitled to hold for the term commencing on the first day of June, 1848. That case is not before us under the information, and cannot therefore be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">But further, there is an objection to the proceeding in this case, even as to the appointment of February the 28fch, because the term of office has at this time expired. In England it seems not to be considered necessary that the person should continue to hold the office at the time of applying for the information. In New York, however, and Massachusetts, the information has been refused, when the time must expire before the inquiry would have any effect, leaving the parties to their common remedies. Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, 436-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Such, it is understood, has been the course of decisions in this state, and this court, as far as.known, never entertains the suit where the term of office has expired, and no judgment of ouster can be pronounced. <em>Judgment against the relator.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
