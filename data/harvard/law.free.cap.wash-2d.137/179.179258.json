The appeal of Respondent Oseguera was consolidated with his pro se personal restraint petition, arising from the same incident, in which he claimed ineffective assistance of counsel and illegal search and seizure. This court granted review. We reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the Court of Appeals and also dismiss Leonardo Oseguera Acevedo\u2019s personal restraint petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The questions presented in this case are (1) whether the mandatory one-year term of community placement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> imposed upon Respondent Leonardo Oseguera Acevedo, resulting from his plea of \u201cguilty\u201d to possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, constitutes a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of his guilty plea; and (2) whether there is merit to the claims by Respondent Oseguera of ineffective assistance of counsel and illegal search and seizure in relation to his charge of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">On January 18, 1995, Chelan County Sheriffs Deputy Brent R. Patterson<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was on patrol heading westbound from Wenatchee when he observed a brown Toyota C\u00e9lica, license number KCW 674, proceeding on the road.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *As Deputy Patterson passed the automobile, he recognized the driver as Respondent Leonardo Oseguera Acevedo.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Deputy Patterson knew Respondent Oseguera from previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>encounters with him and suspected he was driving without a valid license.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The deputy confirmed with the dispatch operator that Respondent Oseguera\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After stopping Respondent, Deputy Patterson learned from dispatch that Respondent had an outstanding felony warrant for forgery<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and arrested him on the warrant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> During the search incident to arrest,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Deputy Patterson found on Respondent\u2019s person in a coat he was wearing<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a pager, $804.95 in United States currency<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and four small plastic bags of white powder later determined to be cocaine.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">On January 23, 1995, Respondent Oseguera was charged by information filed in the Chelan County Superior Court with the crime of unlawful possession of a controlled substance\u2014cocaine with intent to deliver in violation of RCW 69.50.401.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">On March 8, 1995, Respondent Oseguera, represented by his court-appointed counsel, David S. Delong,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> submitted to the Chelan County Superior Court a signed \u201cStatement of Defendant on Plea of Guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Appearing before the Honorable Carol A. Wardell, Respondent under a plea bargain entered a plea of \u201cguilty\u201d to unlawful possession of a controlled substance\u2014cocaine with intent to deliver.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As part of the plea bargain, the State recommended dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>of three unrelated charges pending against Respondent, including forgery,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> obstructing a police officer, and driving with a suspended license,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and recommended a prison term at \u201cthe bottom of the standard range.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-t\">Ordinarily a defendant becomes aware of the mandatory community placement requirement prior to pleading \u201cguilty\u201d from the \u201cstatement of defendant on plea of guilty\u201d which CrR 4.2(g) requires to include the following language where applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\"><em>In addition to confinement, the judge will sentence me to community placement for at least 1 year. </em>During the period of community placement, I will be under the supervision of the Department of Corrections, and I will have restrictions placed on my activities.<footnotemark>[21]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In this case, the plea form signed by Respondent Oseg-uera and submitted to the trial court did not include the statement that one consequence of conviction for a drug related offense was community placement for at least one year.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">During the hearing, prior to acceptance of Respondent\u2019s guilty plea, Judge Wardell engaged in the following exchange with Respondent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">THE COURT: And you understand the Court does not have to follow the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation for a sentence? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">RESPONDENT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">THE COURT: [Y]ou understand the Court can either go above the range or below the range if there are substantial reasons to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>RESPONDENT: It depends on what the Judge wants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">THE COURT: <em>Right. Okay. And do you understand that when you get out of prison you would be supervised by the Department of Corrections if you remain in the country, and you would have to do what the Department of Corrections tells </em>you? <em>Do you understand </em>that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">RESPONDENT: Yes. He came to talk to me.<footnotemark>[23]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">THE COURT: Do you also understand that if you are not a citizen of the United States, this offense is reason to have you deported and to also exclude you from coming back to the United States. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">RESPONDENT: Yes, I understand that, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">THE COURT: And do you understand, . . . that if you are deported it is a federal crime for you to return to the United States?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">RESPONDENT: If they deport me, I won\u2019t come back here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">THE COURT: Okay. And . . . it is stated in here that you are not admitting guilt, but you are making this plea in order to take the State\u2019s offer. ... Is that your statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">RESPONDENT: Well, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">THE COURT: Do you understand at the time of sentencing the Court does not treat you any differently than someone who admits guilt. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">RESPONDENT: Yes. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-15\">THE COURT: To the charge of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, . . . how do you plead, guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-16\">RESPONDENT: Well, yes, I plead guilty. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-17\">THE COURT: Do you plead guilty freely and voluntarily? RESPONDENT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-18\">THE COURT: Has anybody threatened you to have you plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>RESPONDENT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">THE COURT: All right. This Court will accept [Respondent Oseguera\u2019s] plea of guilty as being freely and voluntarily made. He knows the consequences of that plea. He knows he\u2019s facing substantial time in prison. And there\u2019s a factual basis for the plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">THE COURT: [Respondent Oseguera], Mr. [Victor] Gonzalez read to you the Statement on Plea of Guilty.<footnotemark>[24]</footnotemark> Did you understand what he read to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">RESPONDENT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">THE COURT: Do you have any questions about your plea of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">RESPONDENT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">THE COURT: All right. Okay. Then I\u2019ll accept the plea, and I\u2019ll dismiss the other charges.<footnotemark>[25]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Respondent Oseguera wrote three letters to the trial court requesting new court-appointed counsel.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The basis for his request was unclear.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In his March 24, 1995 letter to the court, Respondent Oseguera continued to object to being represented by defense counsel David S. Delong and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>stated he wanted to withdraw his plea of guilty.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In that letter Respondent Oseguera stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">The only reason I pled that way is because I felt overwhelmed. Mr. Delong told me that I should plead guilty as . . . he didn\u2019t feel like he had enough experience to be of any real help to me in this case.<footnotemark>[29]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">At the April 24, 1995 sentencing hearing, the Honorable Ted W. Small addressed the requests of Respondent Oseg-uera for new counsel and withdrawal of his plea of guilty.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> At that time, defense counsel Delong denied telling Respondent he was too inexperienced to handle the case.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The Prosecuting Attorney offered into the record a letter he received from Mr. Delong dated March 3, 1995<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> which indicated Mr. Delong had been discussing with Respondent the options available to him at least five days before hearing on his plea.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Judge Small denied the motion for a new court-appointed counsel for absence of \u201cany factual basis to allow [Respondent Oseguera] to change counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In addition, the court granted a continuance of the sentencing hearing and the motion to withdraw the plea of guilty, ordering further inquiry into the reasons Respondent sought to withdraw his plea.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">In the interim, at a hearing on May 8, 1995, Judge Carol A. Wardell also denied Respondent\u2019s request for new court-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>appointed counsel.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Judge Wardell advised Respondent Os-eguera:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">You have not set forth sufficient reason for a change of an attorney. . . . There is absolutely no basis to indicate that Mr. Delong has not done a good job for you. . . . The law provides that when you\u2019re appointed an attorney, the Court has to make the decision whether to change the attorney, not you. . . . [T]he Court is familiar with Mr. Delong\u2019s experience, and the Court appoints him based upon that experience.<footnotemark>[37]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">After the hearing, defense counsel Delong filed a \u201cmotion to withdraw guilty plea\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> on behalf of Respondent Oseg-uera.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">At the second sentencing hearing on May 15, 1995, the Honorable John E. Bridges asked Respondent Oseguera why he wanted to withdraw his plea of guilty.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Respondent stated \u201c[Tjhere seems to be a lot of confusion about my case or a tangle and I don\u2019t feel right about it and that\u2019s why I w\u00e1nt to take my plea back and fight it.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">At sentencing, the Prosecuting Attorney asked the court to sentence Respondent to 87 months in prison and \u201c[c]om-munity placement as provided by law.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Based upon the facts before him and review of the transcript of the March 8, 1995 proceeding,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Judge Bridges denied the motion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Respondent Oseguera to withdraw his guilty plea,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> finding that Respondent\u2019s plea \u201cwas not only fully informed as to the charges and the penalties but also was freely and voluntarily made, . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The court agreed with the recommendation of the Prosecuting Attorney and sentenced Respondent Oseguera to 87 months in prison, the lowest end of the standard range, in accord with the plea bargain.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The court signed a judgment and sentence setting Respondent\u2019s punishment at 87 months in prison and community placement \u201cfor the period of time provided by law.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">On June 16, 1995, Respondent Oseguera filed a pro se \u201cnotice of appeal\u201d to the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> He also filed a personal restraint petition on September 18, 1995.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u201camended order of indigency and order appointing attorney\u201d filed on March 17, 1996 removed David S. Delong as counsel for Respondent and appointed Thomas E. Weaver, Jr. as his counsel for review.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The Court Commissioner\u2019s ruling filed October 30, 1996 denied Petitioner\u2019s \u201cMotion to Present Additional Evidence,\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> but its \u201cMotion to Supplement Record\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> was granted without objection on January 28, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The Court of Appeals (Judge John A. Schultheis writing, Chief Judge Dennis J. Sweeney dissenting) reversed the trial court and granted the motion of Respondent Oseguera to withdraw his plea of guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to deliver.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">[Respondent Oseguera\u2019s] contention that his plea was involuntary is of constitutional magnitude. Because the error, if proven, was reasonably likely to have affected [Respondent Oseguera\u2019s] decision to plead guilty, we find it manifest and accept review.<footnotemark>[53]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Finding that no \u201cclear and convincing evidence [existed] that [Respondent Oseguera] explicitly understood that one consequence of his guilty plea was mandatory community placement for one year,\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the \u201cplea [of Respondent Oseguera] was involuntary and may be withdrawn pursuant to CrR 4.2(f).\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Petitioner State of Washington then sought review by this court, which was granted on May 8, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\n<em>Community Placement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Petitioner State of Washington contends Respondent Leonardo Oseguera Acevedo has not raised an issue of manifest constitutional error which may be reviewed for the first time on direct appeal.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Respondent Oseguera offers three counterarguments: (1) his assignment of error is not raised for the first time on appeal, but was in fact raised at trial when he claimed his plea was involuntary; (2) if this court concludes the assignment of error is raised for the first time on appeal, then the Court of Appeals was nevertheless correct in reaching the merits because the issue before this court involves a manifest error affecting a constitutional right of Respondent; and (3) Respondent should have the benefit of the decision of this court in <em>State v. </em>Ross<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> on direct appeal.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The Court of Appeals agreed with Respondent Oseguera and granted his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty based upon its interpretation of the decisions of this court in <em>State v. Ross </em>and <em>State v. </em>McFarland.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">In <em>State v. Ross, </em>this court held that a mandatory period of community placement is a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of a plea of guilty concerning which the defendant must be informed before entering a voluntary plea of \u201cguilty.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Petitioner argues the Court of Appeals should not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>granted Respondent Oseguera relief on this basis because (1) Respondent did not challenge the plea on that ground before the trial court<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and (2) the record is not sufficient for the appellate court to consider the issue.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Petitioner claims the decision of the Court of Appeals conflicts with the decision of this court in <em>State v. McFarl</em>and.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> In <em>McFarland, </em>this court held that a constitutional error is not \u201cmanifest\u201d and cannot be raised initially on appeal under RAP 2.5<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> if \u201cthe facts necessary to adjudicate the claimed error are not in the record on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The question becomes whether the \u201cfacts necessary to adjudicate\u201d the challenge raised by Respondent Oseguera to withdraw his plea of guilty require further development. The answer to this question must take into consideration that \u201c[t]he State bears the burden of proving the validity of a guilty plea,\u201d including the defendant\u2019s \u201cKnowledge of the direct consequences\u201d of the plea, which the State may prove from the record or by clear and convincing extrinsic evidence.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> A defendant, in contrast, bears the burden of proving \u201cmanifest injustice,\u201d defined as \u201c \u2018an injustice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>is obvious, directly observable, overt, not obscure.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> This court elaborated on the determination of a \u201cmanifest\u201d constitutional error in <em>McFarland, </em>and stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">The defendant must identify a constitutional error and show how, in the context of the trial, the alleged error actually affected the defendant\u2019s rights; it is this showing of actual prejudice that makes the error \u2018manifest\u2019, allowing appellate review.<footnotemark>[68]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">This court based its decision in <em>Ross </em>on omission of the community placement requirement from the plea form and the \u201cclaim by the defendant that he would not have agreed\u201d to the plea bargain if he had been informed of that requirement.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Although <em>State v. Ross </em>relies upon earlier cases which have concluded that a plea is not voluntary, knowing, and intelligent unless the defendant was aware of all direct consequences,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> the apparent significance attributed by this court to the defendant\u2019s assertion that he would not have entered the plea if he had known of the community placement requirement suggests in that case the term of community placement was a \u201cmaterial\u201d factor in the defendant\u2019s decision to enter a plea of guilty. In this case, unlike the situation in <em>Ross, </em>there is no indication the term of community placement was \u201cmaterial\u201d or relevant to the decision by Respondent Oseguera to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The incidental significance of the community placement requirement to Respondent Oseguera\u2019s plea is the basis for the dissenting opinion of Chief Judge Dennis J. Sweeney which states in summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">Neither this record nor [Respondent Oseguera\u2019s] argument shows any likelihood that he would have rejected the plea agreement had community placement been listed as a consequence of his plea. The record here demonstrates, for me, the contrary. ... He was already on community placement for a previous drug possession conviction at the time of this offense .... [H]e has not met his burden of showing that he would not likely have pleaded guilty if he had been warned of the mandatory community placement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">Moreover, it is unlikely that the community placement mandated by . . . RCW 9.94A.120(9)(a) for a drug felony offense would even apply to [Respondent] Oseguera. He was in this country illegally when he committed the crime and will be deported as soon as he is released from prison.<footnotemark>[71]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The presentence report of Respondent Oseguera prepared by the Department of Corrections included an oblique reference to community placement as an incident to his sentence:<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">Because [Respondent Oseguera] has been deported before, it is likely that he will be deported when he is released from prison on this matter. <em>He will not, therefore, serve his community placement </em><footnotemark>[73]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Also, at the time of his arrest for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, Respondent Oseguera was facing three additional unrelated charges, all of which were dismissed upon his agreement to enter a plea of guilty to the ding offense.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><footnotemark>74</footnotemark> In addition, the pro se personal restraint petition filed by Respondent Oseguera challenges the plea of guilty on entirely different grounds.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Respondent Oseguera has not claimed, nor even suggested, he would have insisted upon going to trial if he had been fully informed of the community placement requirement. The focus in this case is not on the adequacy of the record, but on the significance of the facts shown by the record. The record to a limited extent supports the conclusion of the Court of Appeals. It is true Respondent was not fully informed of the community placement requirement. However, the record also supports a conclusion this requirement was not a \u201cmaterial\u201d part of the plea bargain, even though it was not clearly stated in Respondent Oseguera\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In this case, Respondent Oseguera is an undocumented alien from Mexico who has once been deported, returned to this country illegally, and will most likely be deported again upon his release from prison. He will not likely ever be available to serve a term of community placement. The reference to community placement in <em>Ross </em>that it produces a \u201cdefinite, immediate and automatic effect on a defendant\u2019s range of punishment\u201d simply does not apply.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> One cannot logically conclude Respondent Oseguera\u2019s mandatory term of community placement is a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Petitioner next claims the record is not sufficient for appellate review of the issue of Respondent Oseguera\u2019s withdrawal of his plea of guilty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">[T]he record relevant to what the defendant knew at the time of his guilty plea relative to community placement is obviously incomplete. . . . [TJhere are facts in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>indicating the defendant would have known of such requirement .... [and] there is other material evidence which could be presented on this issue.<footnotemark>[78]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Petitioner attempts to distinguish <em>Ross </em>by arguing that Respondent Oseguera was adequately advised of the community placement requirement. That argument is not persuasive. The trial court alluded to community placement at the March 8, 1995 plea hearing by stating that Respondent Oseguera \u201cwould be supervised by the Department of Corrections, . . . and [Respondent] would have to do what the Department of Corrections tells [him]\u201d upon his release from prison if he remains in the country.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> It is true the trial court did not indicate the actual term of community placement applicable to Respondent Oseguera. The Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s sentencing recommendation<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> and the judgment and sentence<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> simply referred to a period of community placement \u201cas provided by law.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AY\">In an attempt to prove Respondent Oseguera entered his plea with knowledge of its \u201cdirect consequences,\u201d Petitioner, through a motion to supplement the record,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> submitted a judgment and sentence from a prior drug conviction of Respondent Oseguera for which he received a prison sentence and a one-year term of community placement.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> In fact, Respondent was on community placement at the time of his arrest in this case. The utility of that prior judgment and sentence is questionable because the form has only boxes allowing the court to check the appropriate term of community placement applicable to each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>defendant<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and does not explain that either a one-year or two-year period is mandatory for certain offenses. Respondent Oseguera was not specifically advised that a mandatory period of one year in community placement following his prison term would result from his plea of guilty in this case to possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. However, his expected deportation upon release from prison satisfies us that his term of community placement was not a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of his plea of guilty. His plea of guilty was voluntary and not the product of a \u201cmanifest\u201d constitutional error.

Jeffries.</em><footnotemark><em>87</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">A defendant must first show that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> To satisfy the \u201cperformance\u201d part of the test, defendant must prove that defense counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness based on consideration of all the circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> To satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d part of the test, a defendant must prove defense counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant, \u201cshow[ing] . . . there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, [defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ant] would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The court may begin its review of a defendant\u2019s claim with an examination of either part of the two-part test.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s representation was effective.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Respondent Oseguera claims defense counsel David S. Delong committed several errors constituting ineffective assistance which resulted in Respondent being \u201cforced to ple[a]d guilty against his wishes.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> Respondent claims Mr. Delong told him he did not have enough experience to defend him in a jury trial of this case.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> At the April 24, 1995 sentencing hearing, Mr. Delong denied making such a statement.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> In response, Judge Small denied Respondent\u2019s motion for new court-appointed counsel, concluding an absence of \u201cany factual basis to allow [Respondent] to change counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Judge Wardell also denied Respondent\u2019s request for new counsel, citing \u201cno basis to indicate that [defense counsel] Delong has not done a good job for [Respondent] .... [T]he Court is familiar with [defense counsel] Delong\u2019s experience, and the Court appoints him based on that experience.\u201d<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Respondent Oseguera did not provide the trial court in either instance with sufficient evidence of his claimed ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Respondent Oseguera contends he demanded a jury trial on the drug charge and implies his counsel\u2019s inaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>compromised his case.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> However, Respondent was given ample opportunity to request a jury trial during the three hearings he attended. He chose not to do so. He claims defense counsel Delong \u201cdid not have any trial strategy what[so]ever\u201d and that the \u201conly defense [offered to Respondent] was to have [him] plea[d] guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Notwithstanding Respondent Oseguera\u2019s status on community placement when the arrest was made in this case, the three additional unrelated charges pending against him at the time of his arrest, and his criminal history and its impact on the severity of any proposed sentence, from the work of his counsel Respondent realized resolution of all his criminal charges and received \u201cthe lowest end of the standard range\u201d for this offense. From this we conclude he actually benefited from Mr. Delong\u2019s representation instead of being prejudiced in any way. The Prosecuting Attorney offered into the record a letter of March 3, 1995 written to him five days before trial by David S. Delong which implies both Respondent Oseguera\u2019s \u201cwillingness to plead to less time\u201d<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> and his desire to have Mr. Delong negotiate with the Prosecuting Attorney on his behalf. \u201cIf a defense counsel\u2019s conduct which is later complained of can be characterized as legitimate strategy or tactics, it does not constitute ineffective assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> In entering into a plea bargain on behalf of Respondent Oseguera, based upon the facts of this case, defense counsel Delong was reasonably engaging in a legitimate strategy or tactic to minimize Respondent\u2019s prison sentence. He was successful.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Respondent argues the failure of defense counsel Delong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>to forward to him a prepared motion and affidavit for order of indigency for his sign\u00e1ture, upon notification of Respondent\u2019s filing a pro se notice of appeal,<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> is an example of Mr. Delong\u2019s ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> The Chelan County Superior Court acknowledged that defense counsel \u201cnormally . . . prepared] the motion and affidavit for order of indigency\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> for their clients. But the order of indigency was accomplished. Postponement in forwarding the signed motion and affidavit for order of indigency, however, did not prejudice Respondent\u2019s appeal in this matter.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Respondent has not established that defense counsel David S. Delong engaged in any deficient performance in his case, nor has Respondent established that prejudice resulted from his plea agreement.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Respondent has not met the burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel and prejudice under the <em>Strickland </em>test, that \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient and such deficient performance prejudiced the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\n<em>Illegal Search and Seizure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In the personal restraint petition of Respondent Oseguera, he claims Sheriffs Deputy Brent R. Patterson subjected him to a <em>\u201cTerry </em>stop\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> in absence of \u201cprobable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>cause\u201d and an illegal \u201cwarrantless search\u201d of his person.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> \u201cA police officer can conduct an investigative or <em>Terry </em>stop based on less than probable cause to arrest\u201d when the police officer has a \u201c \u2018 \u201cwell-founded suspicion not amounting to probable cause.\u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> But Respondent Oseguera mischaracterizes adequate probable cause. In this case, Deputy Patterson\u2019s recollection and past knowledge of Respondent Oseguera and his suspicion that Respondent was driving without a valid license were confirmed by his call to the dispatch operator.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> After stopping Respondent for the violation of driving while his license was suspended, Deputy Patterson learned from the dispatch operator that Respondent Oseguera had an outstanding felony warrant for forgery and arrested him on that warrant. The search of Respondent\u2019s person in this case occurred after his arrest by Deputy Patterson on the outstanding felony warrant.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> The pager, money and cocaine were found in Respondent\u2019s coat incident to that arrest.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> \u201cA warrantless search is not presumed to be invalid under the Fourth Amendment if it is made incident to a lawful arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> Deputy Patterson\u2019s search of Respondent Oseguera was proper as incident to his lawful arrest on the outstanding felony warrant for forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">A mandatory period of community placement is a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of a plea of guilty concerning which a defendant must be informed before entering the plea. Ordinarily a defendant will learn of the mandatory community place<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ment prior to pleading \u201cguilty\u201d either from the Statement of Defendant on Plea of Guilty form required by CrR 4.2(g) or orally from defense counsel or the court. However, if the situation arises that the community placement requirement is omitted from the plea form and a statement is made by the defendant to the effect the defendant would not have agreed to plead \u201cguilty\u201d if the defendant had been informed of that requirement, a review of the facts on the record is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">A review of the record is required to determine the materiality of the omission and statement by the defendant and to determine whether actual knowledge of the mandatory term of community placement was a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">To determine the materiality of a direct consequence of a plea of guilty, the significance of the facts shown by the record must be examined. If the mandatory community placement produces a \u201cdefinite, immediate and automatic effect on a defendant\u2019s range of punishment,\u201d the term of community placement will be considered a true direct consequence of a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty. If the term of community placement is found \u201cnot definite, not immediate and having no automatic effect on a defendant\u2019s range of punishment,\u201d the mandatory term of community placement is not a direct consequence of the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty and the defendant\u2019s plea should be considered voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In this case, Respondent Oseguera was not provided direct information that a specific period of community placement would result from his plea of guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. However, under the facts in this case, the expected deportation of Respondent Oseguera after his release from prison leads to the conclusion that his term of community placement was not a \u201cmaterial factor\u201d and not a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The plea of guilty of Respondent Oseguera was voluntary and not the product of a manifest constitutional error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>which would come within the exception for appellate review under RAP 2.5(a)(3). The Court of Appeals was in error in granting Respondent Oseguera\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Respondent Oseguera has not shown that defense counsel David S. Delong engaged in any deficient performance in representing him in this case, nor has Respondent established that prejudice resulted from his plea of guilty. Respondent has not met the burden of establishing \u201cprejudice\u201d under the <em>Strickland </em>test. His claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Respondent Oseguera\u2019s claim that Sheriffs Deputy Brent R. Patterson did not have probable cause to arrest him is without merit. Deputy Patterson had probable cause to stop Respondent because of his reasonable belief, confirmed by the dispatch operator, that Respondent was driving while his license was suspended. The search of Respondent\u2019s person was incident to a valid arrest on the outstanding felony warrant for forgery which was discovered through communication with the dispatch operator. None of the claims in Respondent Oseguera\u2019s personal restraint petition has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals which reversed the judgment of the Chelan County Superior Court which denied the motion of Respondent Leonardo Oseg-uera Acevedo to withdraw his plea of guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. We also dismiss Respondent Oseguera\u2019s personal restraint petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Guy, C.J., Talmadge, J., and Dollivee, J.

Accordingly, the constitution requires Oseguera be informed of community placement because it is a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of his plea. <em>State v. Ross, </em>129 Wn.2d 279, 280, 916 P.2d 405 (1996). Where I part company with the majority and the dissent is that, under the facts, Oseguera was sufficiently informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u201cKnowledge of the direct consequences of a guilty plea may be satisfied from the record of the plea hearing or clear and convincing extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>129 Wn.2d at 287 (citing <em>Wood v. Morris, </em>87 Wh.2d 501, 511, 554 P.2d 1032 (1976)). Here, the record demonstrates Oseguera was informed and aware that community placement was a direct consequence of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The majority acknowledges that during the plea hearing, prior to the acceptance of Oseguera\u2019s plea, Judge Wardell engaged in the following exchange with Oseguera:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">THE COURT: . . . <em>And do you understand that when you get out of prison you would be supervised by the Department of Corrections if you remain in the country, and you would have to do what the Department of Corrections tells you </em>? <em>Do you understand that?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">RESPONDENT: Yes. He came to talk to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Majority at 186 (citing Clerk\u2019s Papers at 38). Thus, Oseg-uera was informed as to the condition of community placement before pleading guilty, understood that condition, and acknowledged his understanding to the court at the plea hearing. That is all that is required.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Despite this evidence the majority concludes, as did the Court of Appeals, Oseguera did not understand community placement to be one of the direct consequences of his plea. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The Court of Appeals apparently was persuaded in part because no <em>written </em>warning of community placement had been provided to Oseguera as required under CrR 4.2(g). <em>See State v. Oseguera, </em>88 Wn. App. 232, 236, 945 P.2d 225 (1997); <em>see also </em>Majority at 185 (noting a defendant ordinarily becomes aware of community placement consequence under requirements of CrR 4.2(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">I agree the better course is to follow the specific dictates of CrR 4.2(g) because the record would then be clear. However, failing to do so does not necessarily result in \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d requiring withdrawal of the plea. Although CrR 4.2 contains numerous procedural safeguards designed to ensure a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, the rule\u2019s procedural requirements are not constitutionally mandated. <em>State v. Branch, </em>129 Wn.2d 635, 642, 919 P.2d 1228 (1996). \u201cFailure to adhere to the technical requirements of CrR 4.2(g) does not in itself result in a constitutional violation or amount to a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Branch, </em>129 Wn.2d at 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u201cWhether a plea is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made is determined from a totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Branch, </em>129 Wn.2d at 642 (citing <em>Wood, </em>87 Wn.2d at 506). Here, the circumstances confirm Oseguera was fully aware community placement would be a consequence of his plea. Accordingly, Oseguera has not shown manifest injustice requiring withdrawal of the plea. Therefore, I concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Durham and Madsen, JJ., concur with Johnson, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"116\">\n<p id=\"b243-11\">The State also submitted evidence that Oseguera had previously been found guilty on a drug charge for which he received a prison sentence and one-year community placement. Majority at 197 (citing Clerk\u2019s Papers at 119-24). Indeed, Oseguera <em>was under the supervision of the Department of Corrections and serving community placement at the time of his arrest on the current charge. </em>Majority at 197; <em>see also State v. Oseguera, </em>88 Wn. App. 232, 238, 945 P.2d 225 (1997). While this evidence, without more, would be insufficient to sustain the validity of the plea, it supports the conclusion that Oseguera understood the nature of the trial court\u2019s question and the specific terms of community placement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b244-7\">Alexander, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvF\">(dissenting) \u2014 The majority concludes that although the sentencing judge did not inform Oseguera that a period of community placement would result from his plea of guilty, the omission was not significant because Oseguera would be deported to Mexico following his release from prison and, therefore, would not have been subject to community placement. Because of this \u201cexpected deportation,\u201d the majority concludes, community placement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>not a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of his plea, and the failure to inform him about it was immaterial. Majority op. at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">If deportation of Oseguera can be said to be a certainty, I would agree with the majority. The record does not, however, support a conclusion that his deportation is inevitable. Significantly, the State has not asserted in its brief or in oral argument that deportation is a foregone conclusion. Indeed, counsel for the State admitted at the hearing before this court that \u201cI don\u2019t think that we can conclude that he [Oseguera] was in fact going to be deported.\u201d Oral argument tape (Sept. 10, 1998). The deputy prosecutor stated, additionally, that \u201cI don\u2019t believe that there is anything in the record that this court can look at to say for sure that this man was going to be deported\u201d or that he will be \u201csubject to the United States\u2019 jurisdiction, not the state of Washington.\u201d<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> Oral argument tape (Sept. 10, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In light of the fact that the record does not support the necessary conclusion that Oseguera will be deported to Mexico upon his release from prison, we should presume, as did the Court of Appeals, that he will not be deported and that mandatory community placement is a direct consequence of his plea.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> The sentencing court\u2019s failure to advise Oseguera that he will be subject to community placement upon release from prison is, therefore, a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>omission<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> which can be cured only by permitting Oseg-uera to withdraw his plea of guilty. Because the majority and concurring opinions have concluded otherwise, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Sanders, J., concurs with Alexander, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"117\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The only reference in the record to a possible deportation is in the presentence report forwarded to the sentencing judge. It indicates only that \u201cit is likely that he [Oseguera] will be deported.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 53.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"118\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Although Justice Johnson indicates in his concurring opinion that he agrees with me that the record does not state that Oseguera will be deported to Mexico, he nevertheless determines that Oseguera was sufficiently informed as to the condition of community placement before pleading guilty. <em>See </em>Concurring op. at 204-05. He bases this conclusion on colloquy between the sentencing court and Oseguera, wherein the court informed Oseguera that he would be subject to the supervision of the Department of Corrections (DOC) when he was released from prison. <em>See </em>Concurring op. at 205. In my view, this statement by the sentencing court does not support his conclusion because it assumes that if one is told that they are subject to the supervision by DOC, they would somehow know that they are subject to community placement. Such an assumption is not warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"119\">\n<p id=\"b246-13\">In <em>State v.
