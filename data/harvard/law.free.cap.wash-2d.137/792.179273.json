We uphold Mr. Finch\u2019s underlying convictions but reverse and remand his sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The Defendant, Charles Finch, married Thelma Finch in September 1993. They lived together in a mobile home owned by Thelma and her mother, Margaret Elizares. Charles and Thelma separated on July 11, 1994. When they separated, Thelma told Charles not to return and asked him for his key, which he refused. At the end of July, Thelma told Charles that Ron Modlin, a blind friend of Thelma\u2019s, was going to move into a travel trailer located on her property. Ron was a longtime friend of Thelma\u2019s who had lived on the property for many years prior to her marriage to Charles.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Around this time, Charles began asking co-workers and friends about buying a gun. Finally, a co-worker agreed to sell him a .40 caliber Ruger automatic for $350. After Thelma and Charles separated, Thelma stated that they talked only a couple of times when they would encounter each other at work. On the only two occasions they did speak, Charles asked Thelma if she had paid her burial insurance. Also, sometime in May or June, while Thelma and Charles <em>f?ere </em>still married, Michael Thomas, a friend of Charles\u2019, was doing some work on the property. While inside the mobile home, Michael said that he \u201cfelt a little tension in the air\u201d between Thelma and Charles, so he went outside. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (RP) (Jury Trial) at 1940. Later, Charles came outside and said, \u201cI thought about buying a gun and shooting him in the head.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 1941. Charles did not specify who \u201che\u201d was but Michael Thomas did testify that Ron was Thelma\u2019s only male friend. RP (Jury Trial) at 1941-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">On the day of the crime, August 15, 1994, Charles asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>his boss if he could take the following two days off work. After work he went to the credit union, withdrew money, and purchased the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">At approximately 7:30 that evening, Charles arrived at Thelma\u2019s mobile home. Thelma, her mother, Margaret, and Ron Modlin were eating dinner in the kitchen. As Charles drove up, Thelma went onto the front porch to get the cat. Charles got out of his car carrying a 12-pack of beer. Thelma told Charles that he could not bring the beer inside, so he left it on the porch. Charles then went back and got something out of the car, proceeded back to the house and told Thelma that he had a gift for her. Charles then \u201cpassed [Thelma] real fast with the case and brushed against [her] real fast and walked in the house.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Upon entering, Charles yanked the phone off the wall. Ron stood up and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s <em>going </em>on?\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 63. Charles said, \u201cThis,\u201d and shot him in the head, killing him. RP (Jury Trial) at 64. After he shot Ron, he stated that he had been planning that for three months. RP (Jury Trial) at 63-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">After Charles shot Ron, Thelma grabbed his hand and they struggled. As they struggled, Charles stated that he had planned to kill Thelma for a long time. Eventually, Thelma and Charles stopped struggling. Charles told Thelma and Margaret that he would \u201cblow them up\u201d if they went outside or tried to help Ron. RP (Jury Trial) at 74-75. Charles repeated that he had come there to kill himself and Thelma and later stated he had also come there to kill Ron. Additionally, Charles stated that he would kill anyone who came in, including police officers. When Margaret asked why, he stated because \u201cI don\u2019t like the lousy cops.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">After a long period of pleading, Margaret convinced Charles to call 911. Charles called at 10:24 p.m. and reported that a man had been shot. When asked who did it, Charles said that he did. Charles further stated that he shot Ron on purpose. Charles also told the operator he would come out when the police arrived and the gun was outside. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>he got off the phone, he went to the back bedroom with his gun to wait for the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Among the first officers to arrive on the scene were Sgts. James Kinard and Arnold Aljets of the Snohomish County Sheriffs Office. Sgt. Kinard called to the house and asked everyone to come out. When Thelma and Margaret came out onto the porch Sgt. Kinard asked the address and at approximately that time shots rang out. Sgt. Kinard was hit in the head by one of the bullets and was killed. Thelma and Margaret left the house and hid outside. After Sgt. Ki-nard was shot, another officer took out the yard light to reduce visibility. When the officer shot out the yard light, Charles fired more shots from the window. At this point, the SWAT team was called in. An armored personnel carrier was used to rescue Thelma and Margaret from their hiding place by the side of the house and to position the officers closer to the house so they could shoot gas into the trailer. Although many rounds of gas were fired into the trailer, Charles did not come out of the trailer. At one point, Charles went to the front sliding glass door and shot at the armored personnel carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Meanwhile, SWAT negotiators isolated the phone in the trailer, established contact with Charles and attempted to persuade him to surrender. During the conversations, Charles stated that he was going to shoot at officers he saw outside, that he had been shot in the shoulder and that he had a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his foot. At around 5:30 a.m., the negotiator, Officer Heifers, became concerned that Charles was becoming increasingly agitated and upset. Officer Heifers tried to calm the situation by suggesting that what Charles had done was not as bad as it seemed. Officer Heifers asked, \u201c[a]re you sure it wasn\u2019t in self-defense.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 735. Charles answered, \u201c[h]ell, it wasn\u2019t no self-defense. It was premeditated, man.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Shortly thereafter, the SWAT team entered the trailer and placed Charles under arrest. After Charles was ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>rested and given Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings, he made further incriminating statements to a police officer. The Defendant also made other inculpatory statements in letters and conversations with friends and co-workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">During the investigation of the crime scene, the police tried to determine how visible Sgt. Kinard was from the bedroom window. To do this, the officers went to the scene the following evening and placed officers in the same positions as Sgts. Kinard, Aljets and Simpson were the night of the shootings. The officers recreated the same lighting as the previous evening and then videotaped what could be seen from the bedroom window.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">On August 18, 1994, the Snohomish County Prosecutor\u2019s Office charged Charles Finch with the aggravated murder of Ron Modlin, the aggravated murder of Sgt. James Ki-nard, the second degree assault of Thelma Finch and the unlawful imprisonment of Thelma Finch and Margaret Elizares.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">On November 23, 1994, the State indicated its intent to seek the death penalty by filing a Notice of Special Sentencing Proceeding. Over defense objections, the trial court ordered Mr. Finch to wear leg shackles throughout the trial and sentencing proceedings and to wear handcuffs during the testimony of Thelma Finch and Margaret Elizares. The jury found Mr. Finch guilty on all counts and sentenced him to death. Charles Finch appealed directly to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">PRETRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Notice of Special Sentencing Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">When the State decides to seek the death penalty it is required to file written notice of its intent. RCW 10.95-.040(1). Written notice must be served on the defendant or counsel \u201cwithin thirty d\u00e1ys after the defendant\u2019s arraignment upon the charge of aggravated first degree murder unless the court, for good cause shown, extends or reopens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>the period for filing and service of the notice.\u201d RCW 10.95.040(2). If the State does not file and serve notice as provided by the statute then it is precluded from seeking the death penalty. RCW 10.95.040(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In this case, there were two extensions for filing notice of special sentencing. Only the second extension is at issue. Mr. Finch was arraigned on August 22,1994. On September 19, 1994, the State and the defense stipulated to an order extending the filing period to November 14, 1994. Defense counsel requested the first extension to compile mitigation evidence for the State. The court found good cause existed for the extension until November 14 and required the Defendant to provide the State with mitigation material by November 4. Mr. Finch was present in the courtroom and signed the order extending time.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">On November 4, defense counsel submitted a draft mitigation statement to the prosecutor\u2019s office and on November 7, submitted the final mitigation statement. Though substantially similar, the final statement contained material not contained in the draft. On November 10, the State requested an extension based on late receipt of the mitigating information and the need to have time to consider the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Defense counsel agreed to the extension explaining that it would benefit both sides. Defense counsel noted that the current prosecutor had lost his election two days prior to the hearing. Thus, defense counsel wanted time for the prosecutor\u2019s office to consider the decision in light of the election. The judge granted the extension until November 23. The Defendant was present, although he did not sign the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">The Defendant argues the second extension was improper because the State failed to make the requisite showing of good cause to justify the extension and Mr. Finch did not waive the statutory deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">We need not decide whether good cause existed because this procedural right was waived by defense counsel. As a general rule, a defendant\u2019s attorney may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>waive a procedural (as opposed to substantive) right for tactical purposes. <em>Graves v. P.J. Taggares Co., </em>94 Wn.2d 298, 303, 616 P.2d 1223 (1980); <em>see also </em>7A C.J.S. <em>Attorney and Client </em>\u00a7 208 (1980). Although we have not discussed waiver with regard to RCW 10.95.040(1) we have associated the statutory time limitation for the notice requirement with the statutory time limits for a speedy trial under CrR 3.3. <em>See State v. Dearbone, </em>125 Wn.2d 173, 183, 883 P.2d 303 (1994); <em>State v. Luvene, </em>127 Wn.2d 690, 718 n.7, 903 P.2d 960 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Looking to CrR 3.3, this court has held that a defendant\u2019s right to trial within 60 days is a procedural right which can be waived by defense counsel over defendant\u2019s objection, to ensure effective representation and a fair trial. <em>Luvene, </em>127 Wn.2d at 698-99; <em>State v. Campbell, </em>103 Wn.2d 1, 15, 691 P.2d 929 (1984); <em>see also State v. George, </em>39 Wn. App. 145, 692 P.2d 219 (1984); <em>State v. Fanger, </em>34 Wn. App. 635, 663 P.2d 120 (1983); <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>18 Wn. App. 517, 569 P.2d 1211 (1977); <em>State v. Franulovich, </em>18 Wn. App. 290, 567 P.2d 264 (1977). While recognizing the inability of counsel to waive certain fundamental guarantees, courts have explained that \u201c[b]eing of statutory origin, a defendant\u2019s rights . . . are \u2018merely supplementary to and a construction of the Constitution . . . .\u2019 They do not carry the force or weight of constitutionally mandated imperatives.\u201d <em>George, </em>39 Wn. App. at 155 (quoting <em>Townsend v. Superior Court, </em>15 Cal. 3d 774, 781-82, 543 P.2d 619 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">This court has determined that the right to notice of special sentencing proceeding within 30 days of arraignment is <em>statutory </em>only. <em>State v. Clark, </em>129 Wn.2d 805, 811, 920 P.2d 187 (1996). We explained that while the State is required to give formal notice by information to the defendant of the criminal charges to satisfy the Sixth Amendment and our state constitution, article I, section 22 (amend. 10), constitutional notice does not extend to the penalty exacted for conviction of the crime. <em>Clark, </em>129 Wn.2d at 811. \u201cDue process in sentencing requires only adequate notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>possibility of the death penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, like CrR 3.3, the time limitation for the notice of special sentencing provided in RCW 10.95.040 is a procedural right which may be waived by defense counsel for tactical reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Defendant next argues that while courts have allowed defense counsel to waive the speedy trial time limitations in CrR 3.3, the courts have always considered the reasons for the waiver. In the speedy trial context, courts have recognized that \u201c[c]ounsel\u2019s power in this regard is not unlimited .... Nor may counsel effectively waive his client\u2019s rights where the record reveals that the latter was the victim of inadequate representation.\u201d <em>George, </em>39 Wn. App. at 155. Here, the Defendant makes no allegation of ineffective representation by counsel. Moreover, defense counsel believed the election of a new prosecutor could have an impact on the State\u2019s decision to seek the death penalty against Mr. Finch. Defense counsel moved to recuse the Snohomish County Prosecutor\u2019s Office because of allegedly biased comments made by former prosecuting attorney, Seth Dawson, to the local press. It follows that defense counsel believed a change in prosecuting attorney could have a beneficial impact in his client\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Finally, the Defendant argues that even if his counsel can waive this procedural right he must still understand the right being waived. Contrary to arguments by the Defendant, this court, with regard to CrR 3.3, has never required the \u201cunderstanding\u201d of the defendant before counsel could waive his statutory right to a trial within 60 days. <em>See Luvene, </em>127 Wn.2d at 698-99; <em>Campbell, </em>103 Wn.2d at 15. If a defendant\u2019s consent is not required to waive a procedural right then it is illogical to conclude that the defendant must nevertheless understand fully the right being waived. <em>Accord </em>7A C. J.S. <em>Attorney and Client </em>\u00a7 208 (a defendant may be bound to his lawyer\u2019s decision on procedural matters affecting his legal rights even if he does not fully know and understand those rights). Thus, we find the trial court did not err in extending the time period for filing notice of special sentencing proceeding because defense counsel waived this procedural right.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Motion to Recuse Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The Defendant argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to recuse the Snohomish County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. This motion was primarily based on a statement made by Seth Dawson, prosecuting attorney at the time of the incident, that appeared in the Everett Herald. Seth Dawson stated that Sgt. Kinard \u201cwas respected by every member of our department and people are taking this as hard as the people in the sheriffs office.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 2005. The Defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s office violated the appearance of fairness doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The appearance of fairness doctrine, however, only applies to <em>judicial and quasi-judicial decision makers. </em>The doctrine seeks to prevent \u201cthe evil of a biased or potentially interested judge or quasi-judicial decisionmaker.\u201d <em>State v. Post, </em>118 Wn.2d 596, 619, 826 P.2d 172, 837 P.2d 599 (1992). This doctrine not only requires the judge to be impartial but \u201c \u2018it also requires that the judge appear to be impartial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618 (quoting <em>State v. Madry, </em>8 Wn. App. 61, 70, 504 P.2d 1156 (1972)). The Defendant asserts that the doctrine applies to prosecutors, based on a line of cases out of the Washington Courts of Appeals. <em>See State v. Perez, </em>77 Wn. App. 372, 891 P.2d 42 (1995); <em>State v. Ladenburg, </em>67 Wn. App. 749, 840 P.2d 228 (1992). The Courts of Appeals have applied the appearance of fairness doctrine to prosecutors to the extent that they act in a quasi-judicial capacity in determining what charges to file and whether or not to plea bargain. <em>See Perez, </em>77 Wn. App. at 376; <em>Ladenburg, </em>67 Wn. App. at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">This court, in <em>Carrick v. Locke, </em>125 Wn.2d 129, 143 n.8, 882 P.2d 173 (1994), however, found that the appearance of fairness doctrine did not apply to the prosecutor in that case. In <em>Carrick, </em>the court found the separation of powers doctrine was not violated where the coroner\u2019s statute and executive order permitted a district court judge to preside over an inquest for any death for which a Ring County law enforcement agent may be responsible. <em>Id. </em>at 140-43. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>this context, the court rejected an appearance of fairness challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s participation in the inquest, finding that the \u201c \u2018appearance of fairness doctrine is directed at the . . . potentially interested judge or quasi-judicial decisionmaker.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143 n.8 (quoting <em>Post, </em>118 Wn.2d at 618-19). The court explained that \u201c[t]he prosecutor is not the decision maker at the inquest, so there can be no appearance of fairness challenge to his or her involvement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The Defendant attempts to distinguish <em>Carrick, </em>arguing that it is limited to the facts of the case, and that the doctrine applies to a prosecutor\u2019s decision to bringing charges, including whether to seek the death penalty. Our decision in <em>Carrick, </em>however, was not so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Whether a decision is quasi-judicial in nature depends on whether the decision was adjudicatory in nature. <em>See Harris v. Hornbaker, </em>98 Wn.2d 650, 659-60, 658 P.2d 1219 (1983) (the Legislature\u2019s determination of where to place a road was a distinctly <em>legislative </em>decision and therefore the appearance of fairness doctrine did not apply). The State correctly argues that the prosecutor\u2019s decision whether to file charges or to plea bargain is an executive, not adjudicatory, decision. This court has never recognized a prosecutor\u2019s discretion to file charges or to seek the death penalty as a judicial function. <em>See Campbell, </em>103 Wn.2d at 26; <em>State v. Dictado, </em>102 Wn.2d 277, 298-99, 687 P.2d 172 (1984). A prosecutor need not hold a public hearing before deciding whether to file charges;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[t]he decision to prosecute [is] based on the prosecutor\u2019s ability to meet the proof required by the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Lee, </em>87 Wn.2d 932, 934, 558 P.2d 236 (1976). Additionally, this court has emphasized that when making the determination to seek the death penalty \u201c[t]he prosecutor does not determine the sentence; the prosecutor merely determines whether sufficient evidence exists to take the issue of mitigation to the jury.\u201d <em>Dictado, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>102 Wn.2d at 297-98. The jury or the judge makes the determination of guilt and the appropriate sentence, not the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that \u201crigid requirements . . . designed for officials performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions, are not applicable to those acting in a prosecutorial or plaintiff-like capacity.\u201d <em>Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc., </em>446 U.S. 238, 248, 100 S. Ct. 1610, 64 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1980). The Court observed that, unlike judges, \u201c[pjrosecutors need not be entirely \u2018neutral and detached,\u2019 \u201d and may be rewarded for initiating and carrying out prosecutions in the name of the people. <em>Id. </em>at 248. As such, they \u201care necessarily permitted to be zealous in their enforcement of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the constitution prevents prosecutors from making decisions that are \u201cmotivated by improper factors or . . . contrary to law. . . . [T]he strict requirements of neutrality cannot be the same for . . . prosecutors as for judges . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The evils the appearance of fairness doctrine seek to prevent are not implicated in this case because a prosecutor is not a quasi-judicial decision maker. A prosecutor\u2019s determination to file charges, to seek the death penalty or to plea bargain are executive, not adjudicatory, in nature and therefore the doctrine does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">GUILT PHASE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Evidentiary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">This court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>E.g., State v. Stenson, </em>132 Wn.2d 668, 701, 940 P.2d 1239 (1997); <em>State v. Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d 628, 648, 904 P.2d 245 (1995); <em>State v. Lane, </em>125 Wn.2d 825, 831, 889 P.2d 929 (1995); <em>State v. Powell, </em>126 Wn.2d 244, 258, 893 P.2d 615 (1995). When a trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion is manifestly unreasonable or based upon untenable grounds or reasons, an abuse of discretion exists. <em>Stenson, </em>132 Wn.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>a. Admissibility of \u201cin-life\u201d photographs with dogs</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">The Defendant objects to the trial court\u2019s ruling allowing the State to introduce \u201cin-life\u201d photos of Ron Modlin and Sgt. Kinard with their dogs. The picture of Ron Modlin depicted him with his Seeing Eye dog and the picture of Sgt. Kinard presented him, in uniform, with his police dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\"> The admission of in-life photographs lies within the discretion of the trial court. Such photographs have been held relevant to establish the identity of the victim. <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 651-53; <em>State v. Rice, </em>110 Wn.2d 577, 598-99, 757 P.2d 889 (1988). The State need not accept a stipulation as to identity and may insist on proving the issue in the manner it wishes. <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 652; <em>Rice, </em>110 Wn.2d at 599; <em>State v. Brett, </em>126 Wn.2d 136, 159-60, 892 P.2d 29 (1995). Once the court has determined that such evidence is relevant, then the court must determine whether its probative value is substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice to the defendant. <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 651-53; <em>Rice, </em>110 Wn.2d at 598-99; <em>see also State v. Furman, </em>122 Wn.2d 440, 452, 858 P.2d 1092 (1993) (\u201c \u2018In life\u2019 pictures are not inherently prejudicial, particularly where . . . the jury has seen \u2018after death\u2019 pictures of the victim\u2019s body.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">In this case, the court found the photos relevant to the question of identification. The Defendant, however, argues that the presence of the dogs did not serve the purpose of identifying the victims and unnecessarily increased the potential to inflame the jury because they suggest the dogs had lost their owners and were victims too. Only one jurisdiction has dealt squarely with this issue. In <em>State v. Hagen, </em>181 Wis. 2d 934, 512 N.W.2d 180 (1994), the Wisconsin Court of Appeals found no abuse of discretion where a picture of the victim with his dog was admitted, despite the defendant\u2019s contention that the State\u2019s sole purpose was to evoke sympathy from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Referring to the presence of the dogs, the trial court in this case found that the photos were just a fraction of large numbers of exhibits to be admitted at trial and that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>acts and the incidents involved here are serious enough to overshadow any influence [that] the dog in a picture might have . . . RP (Pretrial) at 1422. Additionally, since Mod-lin was blind and Sgt. Kinard was a K-9 officer, the presence of the dogs was a part of their identification. Thus, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the \u201cin-life\u201d photographs with the dogs into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">b. Admissibility of autopsy photograph</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The Defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence an autopsy photograph of Sgt. Kinard because the photograph was inflammatory and unduly prejudicial. The photograph presents Sgt. Kinard\u2019s head with his skin peeled back and the top portion of his cranium removed. The picture shows a probe through the entrance and exit wounds to demonstrate the path of the bullet through his skull.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The Defendant argues the photo was of only marginal relevance as it was undisputed at trial that Mr. Finch fired the shot from the bedroom window to the area where Sgt. Kinard stood. Additionally, the medical examiner could have adequately shown the jury the path of the bullet with a diagram or sketch. The effect of the photograph, argues the Defendant, was to evoke an unfairly prejudicial response from the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The decision of whether to admit photographs lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Lord, </em>117 Wn.2d 829, 870, 822 P.2d 177 (1991). This court has explained that gruesome photographs are admissible if the trial court finds their probative value outweighs their prejudicial effect. <em>Id. </em>at 871. In particular, autopsy photographs have probative value where they are used to illustrate or explain the testimony of the pathologist who performed the autopsy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">In <em>Gentry, </em>this court upheld the admission of photographs that showed the head injuries of the victim. <em>State v. Gentry, </em>125 Wn.2d 570, 607-09, 888 P.2d 1105 (1995). In one of the pictures, the skin was peeled back to show the skull <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>fractures. Despite their gruesome nature, the court found the photographs relevant to show the extent of the victim\u2019s injuries which were relevant to the contested issues of intent to kill and premeditation. <em>Id. </em>at 608-09. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that a diagram should have been used instead of the photographs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">In this case, the trial court found that not only did the photograph show the mechanism of death, but that it showed the trajectory of the bullet as well. By helping to establish the bullet\u2019s trajectory, the photograph could assist in establishing Sgt. Kinard\u2019s relative position in relation to the house and what direction he was looking at the time he was shot. In this case, a contested fact was whether Mr. Finch could see Sgt. Kinard. This disputed fact was relevant to the issues of intent and premeditation. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the autopsy photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">c. Admissibility of video and officer testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">On the evening of August 16, 1994, officers went to the scene of the crime to video what could be seen from inside the residence under the same conditions as existed the night of the incident. In order to create similar lighting conditions, the yard light,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which was shot out the night before, was replaced. Additionally, the lights in the southern portion of the trailer were on and the porch light was on. These conditions were consistent with the lighting conditions that existed the night of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The officers also had information that Sgt. Kinard left the rear flashers of his patrol vehicle on, which illuminate the back portion of the vehicle. However, Sgt. Aljets, who helped recreate the scene, did not recall those lights being on. Because Sgt. Aljets wanted to be consistent with his testimony and to err on the side of less light, a similarly lighted vehicle was used during the video.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Sgt. Aljets was standing next to Sgt. Kinard when Ki-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>nard was shot, and, therefore, he was chosen to position the officers. Two different officers of similar size and attire stood in for Sgts. Kinard and Simpson. Sgt. Aljets placed himself and the two other officers approximately 100 feet from the trailer next to two utility poles, relying on a bloodstain on the ground directly in front of the officer he had placed in Sgt. Kinard\u2019s position.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The officers captured three different vantage points in the video.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, officers took footage from the master bedroom window of the trailer because from that area the police had sufficient evidence indicating that Mr. Finch had fired the shots which killed Sgt. Kinard. The officers located by the utility poles were instructed to conduct themselves in a manner similar to the night before, moving as needed to see what was going on at the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Although the nighttime video showed some of the foliage in the vicinity of the officers, it did not show any images or movement from the officers by the utility poles. Detective Slack, who was present in the bedroom of the mobile home while Detective Freisen was videotaping, testified that he could see the officers moving behind the rhododendron by the utility poles. Detective Slack stated that he could see a luminescent object moving in that area, through a \u201ctunnel\u201d in a large rhododendron. Detective Freisen also looked out the window without the video camera and testified that he could also see a \u201clight-colored object\u201d moving behind the rhododendron.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">When the officers realized the video camera was not picking up these images they moved out of the residence to the roadway, about 50 feet from the officers. Filming from that vantage point the camera did show an officer bent over and luminescent objects moving. The following day, the officers decided to take a daytime shot from the bedroom window with the officers placed in the same loca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>tion. This part of the video clearly shows the foliage in the area and also shows the movement of the officers behind the bushes. Defense counsel did not object to the daytime portion of the video; thus, arguments made by the Defendant regarding its admissibility were not properly preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Defense counsel did, however, object to showing the jury the audio and video portions of the video conducted at night and to the officers\u2019 supplemental testimony. The court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection to the audio portion of the tape<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but allowed the jury to see the video portion of the tape. Additionally, the trial court allowed the officers\u2019 testimony. The trial court reasoned that the nighttime portion of the video took place under substantially similar conditions as those of the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The trial judge found the officers\u2019 testimony would assist the jury. He found no unfair prejudice to the Defendant noting that any differences existing between the night of the video and the night of the crime could be adequately handled through cross-examination and would go to the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Turning to the video, the trial judge recognized that its probative value was diminished because what the officers purport to have seen during the taping is not apparent on the video. However, he found the video still had probative value as it depicted much of what could be seen from the window demonstrating the nature of the investigation. Additionally, the trial judge was concerned that if the officers testified about conducting this video experiment but failed to show the videotape it would seem suspicious. The judge found no prejudice to the Defendant and noted that the video could be advantageous to the defense, since it did not show what the officers claimed to have seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">On appeal, the Defendant claims the trial court erred in admitting the videotape and the testimony of the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>because the State failed to demonstrate the conditions were the same as the night of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\"> The use of demonstrative evidence is encouraged when it accurately illustrates facts sought to be proved. <em>Jenkins v. Snohomish County Pub. Util. Dist. No.l, </em>105 Wn.2d 99, 107, 713 P.2d 79 (1986). Demonstrative evidence is admissible if the experiment was conducted under substantially similar conditions as the event at issue. <em>Jenkins, </em>105 Wn.2d at 107. Determining whether the similarity is sufficient is within the trial court\u2019s discretion and the decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Id,.; see also DiPangrazio v. Salamonsen, </em>64 Wn.2d 720, 727, 393 P.2d 936 (1964); <em>State v. Stockmyer, </em>83 Wn. App. 77, 85, 920 P.2d 1201 (1996). If the similarity is sufficient to justify admission, any lack of similarity goes to the weight of the evidence. <em>Id.; see also State v. Rogers, </em>70 Wn. App. 626, 633, 855 P.2d 294 (1993); <em>Kramer v. J.I. Case Mfg. Co., </em>62 Wn. App. 544, 555, 815 P.2d 798 (1991); <em>Jones v. Halverson-Berg, </em>69 Wn. App. 117, 126, 847 P.2d 945 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Additionally, the evidence sought to be admitted must be relevant. \u201c \u2018The ultimate test for the admissibility of an experiment as evidence is whether it tends to enlighten the jury and to enable them more intelligently to consider the issues presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>105 Wn.2d at 107 (quoting <em>Sewell v. MacRae, </em>52 Wn.2d 103, 107, 323 P.2d 236 (1958)). If the evidence is more prejudicial than probative then the court should refuse its admission. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Contrary to the Defendant\u2019s arguments, videos admitted into evidence for demonstrative purposes need not exactly portray the event in question. In <em>Jenkins, </em>David and Barbara Jenkins brought suit on behalf of their seven-year-old son, Jonathan, and themselves for injuries suffered by Jonathan when he climbed the fence of a Snohomish County Fublic Utility District (FUD). <em>Jenkins, </em>105 Wn.2d at 100. The trial court allowed the admission of a video recording of a boy about Jonathan\u2019s age and size climbing over the gate Jonathan climbed over and it also showed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>boy climbing over other portions of the fence. <em>Id. </em>at 107. Although the court noted that the video was not an exact representation of the events as they occurred, it found no abuse of discretion in admitting the tape. The court emphasized that the conditions were similar to the event in question and any differences were explained to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 108. <em>See also Jones, </em>69 Wn. App. at 126-27 (the admission of a video taken 10 years after the event in question was not an abuse of discretion because any differences were brought out in testimony and cross-examination); <em>Kramer, </em>62 Wn. App. at 554-55 (a videotape prepared to support the contention that a properly operated backhoe could not have gone out of control and slid or rolled down the street was properly admitted where witness testified the slope on the day of the demonstration was more slippery than it was on the day of the accident).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The Defendant, however, relies on the Washington Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Stockmyer </em>where the court upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling to exclude a video reenactment of the crime in question. <em>Stockmyer, </em>83 Wn. App. at 82-85. In <em>Stockmyer, </em>several different individuals attempted to portray the actual assault on George Benson and the killing of Carl Heagle. <em>Id. </em>at 82. In affirming, the appellate court noted the particular dangers associated with videotaped crime reenactments. <em>Id. </em>at 84. The court agreed there were justifiable concerns about the factual inaccuracies of the video and its potential prejudicial effects. <em>Id. </em>at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Contrary to arguments by the Defendant, the video in this case was not a reenactment. The prosecution used the tape only to show what could be seen from the bedroom window under similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The Defendant next argues that the trial court erred in its ruling that the conditions on the night of the video were substantially similar to the night of the crime. In particular, the Defendant argues that the lighting conditions were not substantially similar noting that a police car was not placed in a similar position as Sgt. Kinard\u2019s car with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>rear flashers on. However, Sgt. Aljets testified that the lighting conditions were \u201cpretty much the same\u201d as the night before and that he did not recall those lights being on. RP (Jury Trial) at 487. Additionally, the car was a substantial distance (four hundred feet) from where Sgt. Kinard was located and the lights were not projecting directly toward that area.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the lights on the patrol car, on or off, had little impact on the lighting in the area. Moreover, shooting the video in less fight would clearly not prejudice the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The Defendant also argues that the officer standing in for Sgt. Kinard was not the same height, was not wearing a baseball cap, and was wearing different clothing. However, the testimony of the officers indicates that the person standing in for Sgt. Kinard was about the same height as Sgt. Kinard and, although the actual clothing was not the same, it was similar in color. The individual standing in for Sgt. Kinard was not wearing a baseball cap but this difference is not significant enough to preclude the admission of the video or the oral testimony as to what the officers could see that evening. The officers were not only concerned with whether Sgt. Kinard was visible but whether any of the officers in the location could be seen from the bedroom window.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">We find that the conditions during the videotaping were substantially similar to those on the night in question and any differences were brought out in testimony and cross-examination. What could be seen from the bedroom window was relevant to questions of intent and premeditation, and therefore the officers\u2019 testimony and the video had probative value. The probative value of this evidence was not outweighed by prejudice to the Defendant, especially with regard to the video, which tended to show that the officers were not visible. Thus, we find that the trial court properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>admitted the nighttime video and officer testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">d. Admissibility of the officers\u2019 reactions to the death of Sgt. Kinard</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Defense counsel submitted a motion in limine objecting to testimony by officers concerning their emotional reaction to Sgt. Kinard\u2019s death. During argument on the motion, the court asked defense counsel to define more clearly what type of statements he was objecting to. Counsel indicated that he was concerned with reflective thoughts such as how the impact of Sgt. Kinard\u2019s death had affected the other officers\u2019 lives. The court then asked if defense counsel was attempting to restrict the testimony regarding their state of mind or emotions as the events unfolded. Defense counsel stated that generally he was not, but he expressed concern that the testimony could \u201cget out of hand.\u201d RP (Pretrial) at 1398.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The trial judge granted the defense motion, stating he would allow only testimony relevant to the witnesses\u2019 state of mind or ability to perceive events which took place at the time and, perhaps, to explain their actions. He agreed with defense counsel that such testimony could go too far and stated that objections would have to be made in the course of examination. RP (Pretrial) at 1399.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">On appeal, the Defendant objects to testimony regarding the officers\u2019 reaction to Sgt. Kinard\u2019s death which was admitted at trial. Defense counsel, however, with one exception, made no objection to the testimony it now argues was erroneously admitted. Without such objection, an evidentiary error is not preserved for appeal. <em>State v. Powell, </em>126 Wn.2d 244, 256, 893 P.2d 615 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\"> Defendant, however, argues that the motion in limine preserved the issue. When an evidentiary ruling is pursuant to a motion in limine, only <em>the losing party </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>deemed to have a standing objection and need not specifically object at trial to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the Defendant\u2019s motion in limine was granted. Additionally, a party\u2019s objections to evidence made in their motion in limine are not preserved for appeal if the \u201c \u2018trial court indicates that further objections at trial are required when making its ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Koloske, </em>100 Wn.2d 889, 895, 676 P.2d 456 (1984), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Brown, </em>111 Wn.2d 124, 761 P.2d 588 (1988)). The trial court specifically stated that any further objections with regard to this issue were to be made during the trial. Thus, those allegedly emotional statements which were not objected to at trial by defense counsel were not properly preserved for appeal and will not be reviewed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The one objection made at trial concerned Detective Pin-ce\u2019s interview of Mr. Finch. The testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">Q: Detective Pince, did you know Sergeant Kinard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">A: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">Q: How well did you know him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">A: I\u2019ve known him\u2014known him the whole time he\u2019s worked</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">Q: Did you have any feelings about interviewing the person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-12\">that you knew had been accused of killing Sergeant Kinard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-13\">A: I knew that it was going to be a difficult interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-14\">Q: Detective Pince, what mental preparation did you make in order to do this interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-15\">A: During the brief ride up the elevator, I was attempting to remove all of the emotional feelings that I had about the victims in this case and I wanted to prepare myself to do a nice, clean interview with Mr. Finch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">RP (Jury Trial) at 1017, 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-17\">Defense counsel objected to this line of questioning argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>ing that the emotions of Detective Pince were not relevant to the statements made by Mr. Finch during questioning. The trial court allowed the testimony explaining that, in prior testimony, there had been an insinuation that Mr. Finch had been mistreated. The court was therefore concerned with the possible inference which could be drawn from the previous testimony and from the fact that this was an in-house investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Based on these facts, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Detective Pince\u2019s testimony was relevant to describe his actions on that evening and to dispel possible inferences of unfair treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">e. Admissibility of a letter written by Mr. Finch</p>\n<p id=\"Atok\">The Defendant argues error in the admission of a portion of a letter he wrote to a friend while he was in jail. The significant paragraph, with the sentences objected to by defense counsel underlined, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-7\">Chip has probably told you all the things [Thelma] has done to me. I\u2019m glad that she is out of my life now. I\u2019m just sorry that it had to come to this. As you know, I will probably be in a place like this for the rest of my life. I am just sorry that my story won\u2019t ever be told. No one wants my side out. Just that there was some lousy cop killed, and idiot blind person. Nothing about the person that asked her husband to do the killing, promising to stand by him and do whatever it takes to get through this. As soon as I am caught, she is telling lies, and doing things to cause trouble.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">RP (Jury Trial) at 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">The Defendant argues the trial court erred in not redacting the two underlined sentences from the letter, asserting they had little or no probative value and tremendous prejudicial impact. The Defendant contends that the irreverent reference to the two men likely stirred the passions and prejudices of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">The State contends that omitting them would distort the meaning of the paragraph which is probative because it could tend to show, if believed, that killing Ron was planned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>at Thelma\u2019s request. Additionally, the State argues that the challenged sentences are relevant to show the Defendant\u2019s motive because they show hostility toward the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">We turn first to the State\u2019s argument that the statements indicated hostility toward the victims of the crime and, thus, were relevant. Both prior and subsequent hostile acts or declarations have been found admissible, to issues of motive, malice, deliberation and state of mind, where relevant to such conditions as of the time of the offense. <em>See, e.g., People v. Harris, </em>47 Cal. 3d 1047, 767 P.2d 619, 255 Cal. Rptr. 352 (1989) (defendant\u2019s statements during a confession that he hated white people were relevant because they revealed a motive for the killing); <em>Hutchinson v. State, </em>477 N.E.2d 850 (Ind. 1985) (letters written by the defendant were relevant to the issue of intent); <em>Commonwealth v. Kaster, </em>300 Pa. Super. 174, 446 A.2d 286 (1982) (letter written after commission of crime was relevant as evidence of malice); <em>Bankhead v. State, </em>33 Ala. App. 269, 32 So. 2d 814 (1947) (declaration after commission of crime could he taken to antedate the time of the shooting and for this reason was admissible); <em>Henley v. State, </em>31 Ala. App. 433, 18 So. 2d 98 (1944) (subsequent statements of defendant may be admissible to show defendant\u2019s hostility during the killing); <em>see also </em>41 C.J.S. <em>Homicide </em>\u00a7 209, at 50 (1991); 2 John Henry Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 395, at 348 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">A defendant\u2019s hostility toward his victims, even though expressed prior to or subsequent to the crime, may be admitted to show that the hostility existed at the time of the crime. <em>Henley, </em>31 Ala. App. at 434. If the earlier or later emotions are not relevant as evidence of its existence at the time at issue, then the evidence should be excluded. <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>360 S.W.2d 198, 202 (Ky. Ct. App. 1962). The potential for error is that the prior emotion may have been brought to an end before the time at issue, and the subsequent one may have been first produced since that time. <em>Id; </em>Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 395, at 348; <em>see also Karsner v. Commonwealth, </em>235 Ky. 710, 32 S.W.2d 43 (1930) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>(admission of a statement by defendant indicating callosity of heart and bearing on question of malice held inadmissible where the statement was made six months after the commission of the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">In <em>Raster, </em>the trial court admitted a letter written by the defendant to his friend six weeks after the chief of police was shot. <em>Raster, </em>300 Pa. Super, at 177. Enclosed with the letter was a drawing, depicting another police officer chained and hanging by a noose in front of a burning house with his nickname \u201cNipper of Corse [sic]\u201d written at the top. <em>Id. </em>at 177. The appellate court upheld the admission of the letter as evidence of malice and ill will toward the police and to corroborate testimony that there was evidence of a plan to kill several police officers. <em>Id. </em>The court stated that \u201cevidence of a defendant\u2019s actions both before and after a crime may be admissible to show motive and malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In a similar case, the Supreme Court of Indiana found no abuse of discretion in admitting a letter written by the defendant postdating the crime. <em>Hutchinson, All </em>N.E.2d at 853-54. The defendant appealed his conviction of attempted murder assigning error to the admission of letters, arguing they were unduly prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>at 853. A contested portion of one of the letters reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-7\">I knew these cops were fucking with my mail again. I knew that I should have received a letter from you. The rotten bastards think they\u2019re slick. I wish I had a gun in my hand. I\u2019d make the fucking pigs do the funky chicken. I\u2019d pull a Humphrey Bogart on them. \u2018Come and get me, Copper. You\u2019ll never take me alive. The only thing coming out of my cell is a stream of lead.\u2019 Smile. I wish I had just one more chance at the punk who shot me. The dirty, Jew bastard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">The court found the edited letters relevant to the issue of intent but did recognize the obvious prejudicial nature of the letters. Since the court found the scales of justice were near equipoise it deferred to the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>In this case, the statements by the Defendant indicate his hostility toward the victims and have probative value to issues of motive and intent. Also, the creation of the letter was not so far removed in time from the crime to render it irrelevant. The challenged sentences also have some probative value because they provide a context for the statement by the Defendant that Thelma asked him to kill Ron. The obvious prejudice of these statements is that it presents the Defendant as a callous human being. As in <em>Hutchinson, </em>the question is close and, thus, we will defer to the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">f. Admissibility of testimony by the Defendant\u2019s friend</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">During the State\u2019s case in chief, Darald Wendlin, a friend and co-worker of the Defendant, testified that Mr. Finch stated he deliberately shot the police officer. The Defendant sought to rebut this evidence with testimony of Linda Hein, who would testify that, in a separate conversation, Mr. Finch told her that he did not intend to kill the officer. The trial court excluded Ms. Hein\u2019s testimony as self-serving hearsay and the Defendant claims error.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Courts have repeatedly recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">Out-of-court admissions by a party, although hearsay, may be admissible against the party if they are relevant. However, if an out-of-court admission by a party is self-serving, and in the sense that it tends to aid his case, and is offered for the truth of the matter asserted, then such statement is not admissible under the admission exception to the hearsay rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-9\"><em>State v. Haga, </em>8 Wn. App. 481, 495, 507 P.2d 159 (1973) (citation omitted); <em>State v. Fallen, </em>7 Wn. App. 369, 381, 499 P.2d 893 (1972); <em>State v. Huff, </em>3 Wn. App. 632, 636, 477 P.2d 22 (1970); <em>see also State v. King, </em>71 Wn.2d 573, 577, 429 P.2d 914 (1967); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>60 Wn.2d 21, 31, 371 P.2d 611 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">In <em>State v. Johnson, </em>the trial court excluded a written denial of improper relations with the prosecution\u2019s witness. <em>Id. </em>at 30-31. The statement was made to a police officer seven days before his written confession. <em>Id. </em>at 30. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>court upheld the exclusion, finding that it was self-serving hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">The problem with allowing such testimony is that it places the defendant\u2019s version of the facts before the jury without subjecting the defendant to cross-examination. <em>State v. Bennett, </em>20 Wn. App. 783, 787, 582 P.2d 569 (1978). This deprives the State of the benefit of testing the credibility of the statements and also denies the jury an objective basis for weighing the probative value of the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The Defendant argues, however, that the exclusion denied him his right to compulsory process. A defendant\u2019s right to admit evidence pursuant to his right to compulsory process is subject to established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence. <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 302, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973). In this case, the right to compulsory process does not allow the defendant to escape cross-examination by telling his story out-of-court. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Linda Hein\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Failure to give Mr. Finch <em>Miranda </em>warnings during negotiations with SWAT team negotiators.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Mr. Finch argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress incriminating statements he made to a SWAT team negotiator. At around 2:45 a.m. the morning of the incident, SWAT team negotiators contacted Mr. Finch and negotiators isolated the phone in the house so that he could not make, or receive, any outside calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">The first negotiator, Sgt. Gray, had little success calming Mr. Finch. All conversations were extremely terse and ended with Mr. Finch hanging up the phone. Mr. Finch did repeatedly request to be connected to his sister in California and the police negotiator told him they would try to get her on the line. Shortly after 3 a.m., Mr. Finch told the negotiator he had shot himself in the foot and, soon thereafter, he threatened to shoot at another officer stating that he could see a \u201cguy by the tree\u201d and that he was \u201cfixing to fire at him.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Negotiations were turned over to Officer Heifers at about 4:20 a.m. While talking with Officer Heifers, Mr. Finch repeatedly stated that he was shot in the shoulder. Officers who were attempting to initiate a three-way line with Mr. Finch\u2019s sister informed Officer Heifers that establishing the line was not possible with the equipment they were using. Officer Heifers told Mr. Finch they were having difficulty establishing a line which upset Mr. Finch further. Finally, Mr. Finch indicated a willingness to have a conversation with Officer Heifers. During this conversation, Mr. Finch made incriminating statements. At no time during the negotiation was Mr. Finch given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974 (1966). Officer Heifers recounted this conversation in his testimony at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-5\">A: I asked him if he wanted to talk to his sister, to which he replied \u201cI want to talk to anybody now.\u201d ... So I responded \u201cYou can talk to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-6\">Q: What happened after you said that \u201cYou can talk to me\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-7\">A: Charlie stated \u201cI had an argument and a fight with another male.\u201d ... I asked Charlie what the male\u2019s name was and he stated Ron something. He then went on to state that he had shot Ron.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-8\">Q: How would you describe Charlie\u2019s . . . emotional state at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-9\">A: It sounded like he was becoming agitated and upset on the phone at me . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-10\">Q: How did you respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-11\">A: I asked about the situation in a manner that I asked\u2014I asked \u201cWell it sounds like you had a disagreement. Are you sure you didn\u2019t shoot Ron in self-defense?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-12\">Q: What were you trying to do by framing a question like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-13\">A: I was trying to plant a seed in Charlie\u2019s mind that maybe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>what he had done isn\u2019t as bad as it seemed. I was trying to offer him some hope in the light that he wouldn\u2019t take his life or somebody else\u2019s life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">Q: Despite everything that had gone on during that night, were you still trying to talk Charlie out of the residence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">A: Oh, yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">Q: \u2014without harm to either him or anyone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-8\">A: Very much so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-9\">Q: After you said, \u201cIt sounds like had you [sic] a disagreement\u201d and mentioned \u201cself-defense,\u201d did Charlie respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-10\">A: Looking at my notes, Charlie replied, \u201cHell, it wasn\u2019t no self-defense. It was premeditated, man. I shot him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-11\">Q: Did you respond to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-12\">A: I again tried to downplay the situation by asking \u201cAre you sure it wasn\u2019t self-defense? There\u2019s a lot of arguments that could be made against that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-13\">To which Charlie again stated \u201cNo, it was premeditated. I went in and shot him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-14\">Q: Did Charlie go on to tell you any other information after the premeditated statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-15\">A: He stated that he initially went back to the house because he was going to shoot his wife and then commit suicide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">RP (Jury Trial) at 733-36. During this conversation with the Defendant, the SWAT team entered the room and placed Mr. Finch under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-17\">The Defendant argues that the incriminating statements should have been suppressed for lack of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Prior to a custodial interrogation by the police, a defendant must be given <em>Miranda </em>warnings<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to protect the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>The Court reasoned that the interaction of custody and official interrogation \u201ccontains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467. If police conduct a custodial interrogation without <em>Miranda </em>warnings then statements made by the defendant during the interrogation may not be introduced in a trial against him. <em>Id. </em>at 479. Mr. Finch argues he was both in custody and being interrogated.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\"> We need not determine whether Mr. Finch was being interrogated while in custody because this case clearly falls within the public safety exception to the <em>Miranda </em>requirement. In <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 656, 104 S. Ct. 2626, 81 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1984), the Supreme Court, in response to concerns for police and public safety, created a \u201cpublic safety exception\u201d to the <em>Miranda </em>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">In <em>Quarles, </em>the Court concluded \u201cthat the need for answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to the public safety outweighs the need for the prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657. There, the defendant was arrested in a supermarket and police believed that just before the arrest the defendant had discarded a loaded firearm inside the supermarket in a place where a third party could gain access. Without first administering <em>Miranda </em>warnings, police questioned the defendant about the location of the gun and the defendant responded with an inculpatory statement. Based on public safety concerns, the Supreme Court concluded that the statement need not be suppressed. Recognizing that handling emergencies requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>split-second decisions, the Supreme Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-5\">decline[d] to place officers ... in the untenable position of having to consider, often in a matter of seconds, whether it best serves society for them to ask the necessary questions without the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and render whatever probative evidence they uncover inadmissible, or for them to give the warnings in order to preserve the admissibility of evidence they might uncover but possibly damage or destroy their ability to . . . neutralize the volatile situation confronting them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 657-58. The Supreme Court has noted that the public safety exception created by the Court in <em>Quarles </em>reflects the reality that the Constitution \u201cis not a suicide pact.\u201d <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 160, 83 S. Ct. 554, 9 L. Ed. 2d 644 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">To determine whether the public safety exception applies, the Court asks whether there was \u201can objectively reasonable need to protect the police or the public from any immediate danger . . . .\u201d <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 659 n.8. Other jurisdictions have applied the public safety exception in circumstances similar to this case. For example, in <em>People v. Manzella, </em>150 Misc. 2d 956, 571 N.Y.S.2d 875 (1991), the defendant sought to suppress statements made to a police negotiator while armed and barricaded in his home. <em>Id. </em>at 957. The defendant, Manzella, had shot two officers who were walking up his driveway to serve an arrest warrant. <em>Id. </em>The court found that an emergency existed creating a substantial danger to the lives of the police officers and to the suicidal defendant. Relying on <em>Quarles </em>the court found that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required. <em>Id. </em>at 962; <em>see also People v. Mayfield, </em>14 Cal. 4th 668, 733, 928 P.2d 485 (1997); <em>People v. Treier, </em>165 Misc. 2d 665, 670-71, 630 N.Y.S.2d 224 (1995); <em>Howard v. Garvin, </em>844 F. Supp. 173, 175 (S.D.N.Y. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Requiring the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in the present case could have further upset Mr. Finch and eroded the potential for a peaceful resolution. The <em>Miranda </em>warnings are intended to \u201cwarn\u201d a suspect that the police have interests that are antagonistic to his, and that his statements can be used against him in court. This type of warning would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>erode the atmosphere of trust necessary to convince Mr. Finch to surrender peacefully. <em>See Manzella, </em>150 Misc. 2d at 962 (giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u201cwould have only provided Defendant with reason to discontinue communication, thereby destroying the one thing that was at least maintaining the status quo and that was probably preventing a more violent confrontation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In this case, the Defendant shot and killed two people, one of whom was a police officer, without provocation. Mr. Finch barricaded himself in the trailer and indicated an intent to shoot other police officers. After Sgt. Kinard was shot, two or maybe three more shots were fired from the trailer and during a phone conversation with the negotiator he stated that he could see a \u201cguy by a tree\u201d and that he was \u201cfixing to fire\u201d at him. RP (Jury Trial) at 714. Additionally, as the evening progressed it was apparent that the Defendant\u2019s life could also be at risk. He indicated that he was suicidal and that he had a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his foot and another to his shoulder.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In a case such as this, establishing telephone contact with the armed, barricaded suspect is important not only to calm the agitated suspect but also to help the police to control a volatile situation. Establishing telephone contact keeps the individual\u2019s mind focused on the conversation at hand and not on committing another act of violence. Moreover, it was important to keep the Defendant on the phone so the SWAT team would know exactly where he was when they entered to place him under arrest. Keeping a defendant on the line when the SWAT team enters distracts the defendant and makes injury less likely. An objectively reasonable need to protect the police and the Defendant from immediate danger existed in this case and thus <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Sufficiency of the evidence of premeditation</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The test for reviewing a defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of evidence in a criminal case is \u201c \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 643 (quoting <em>Gentry, </em>125 Wn.2d at 596-97). All reasonable inferences from the evidence are drawn in favor of the State and interpreted against the defendant. <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 643; <em>Gentry, </em>125 Wn.2d at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\"> Premeditation must involve \u201cmore than a moment in point of time,\u201d RCW 9A.32.020(1), but mere opportunity to deliberate is not sufficient to support a finding of premeditation. <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 644. Rather premeditation is \u201c \u2018the deliberate formation of and reflection upon the intent to take a human life\u2019 \u201d and involves \u201c \u2018the mental process of thinking beforehand, deliberation, reflection, weighing or reasoning for a period of time, however short.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 644 (quoting <em>Gentry, </em>125 Wn.2d at 597-98 and <em>State v. Ortiz, </em>119 Wn.2d 294, 312, 831 P.2d 1060 (1992)). Premeditation may be proved by circumstantial evidence where the inferences drawn by the jury are reasonable and the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s finding is substantial. <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 643; <em>Gentry, </em>125 Wn.2d at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">A number of appellate cases have considered the sufficiency of evidence with respect to premeditation and demonstrate that a wide range of proven facts will support an inference of premeditation. <em>See, e.g., State v. Rehak, </em>67 Wn. App. 157, 834 P.2d 651 (1992) (evidence showing the victim was shot three times in the head, twice after he had fallen to the floor, was sufficient to show premeditation); <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number><em>Massey, </em>60 Wn. App. 131, 803 P.2d 340 (1990) (evidence the defendant brought a gun to the murder site supported finding of premeditation); <em>State v. Gibson, </em>47 Wn. App. 309, 734 P.2d 32 (1987) (evidence of a brief lapse of time between blunt force blows to the head and later strangulation was sufficient to show premeditation); <em>State v. Sargent, </em>40 Wn. App. 340, 698 P.2d 598 (1985) (evidence the victim was struck by two blows, with some interval of time between the blows, while the victim was lying face down supported finding of premeditation).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The facts of this case, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, show the following with regard to the shooting of Ron Modlin:</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Two or three months before the crime, while Charles Finch was still living with Thelma, a friend of his was over to help fix a fence. His friend testified that, after an unpleasant conversation with Thelma, Charles said, \u201cI thought about buying a gun and shooting him in the head.\u201d RE (Jury Trial) at 1941. The jury could have reasonably inferred that Charles was talking about Ron when he made this statement since testimony indicated Ron was Thelma\u2019s only male friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">In July 1994, Thelma and Charles separated. Toward the end of that month, Thelma told Charles that Ron was moving into the Streamliner on the property. Shortly thereafter, Charles started asking other co-workers about buying a gun and eventually acquired a gun on the day of the crime. A few hours after he bought the gun he went over to Thelma\u2019s trailer. He entered the trailer with a small box, telling Thelma it was a present. After he entered, Charles yanked the phone out of the wall. Ron then stood up and asked what was going on. In response, Charles opened up the case, took the gun out, loaded the clip, worked the slide, pushed Ron down, said \u201cThis,\u201d pointed the gun at his head and fired. RE (Jury Trial) at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">From this evidence, the jury could reasonably conclude that the Defendant knew Ron was at the property and went there with the intention of killing him. The time and planning here is sufficient to show that Charles reflected upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>his decision to take Ron\u2019s life. Additionally, Charles\u2019 actions immediately preceding the shooting, opening the case, taking out the gun, loading the clip into the gun, working the slide, shoving Ron, pointing the gun at his head, and firing, indicate premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">There are also statements by the Defendant indicating that he premeditated Ron\u2019s death. In his statement to Detective Pince, Charles said he believed Ron had been back at the trailer for a couple of weeks and that he had purchased the gun to protect himself from Ron. Immediately after he shot Ron, Charles stated that \u201che was planning that for three months.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 64. Margaret also testified that Charles said he came there that evening to kill Ron, Thelma, and himself. Later that night, police negotiator Officer Heifers asked Charles if he shot Ron in self-defense. Charles responded stating \u201cHell, it wasn\u2019t no self-defense. It was premeditated,\u201d to which Detective Heifers asked \u201care you sure it wasn\u2019t in self-defense?\u201d Again Charles stated \u201cNo, it was premeditated. I went in and shot him.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Charles also wrote several letters one of which said \u201cI did what she wanted me to do. She told me Ron was coming back knowing that I said I would kill him.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 1984. In another letter Charles wrote, \u201cNo one wants my side out. Just that there was some lousy cop killed, and idiot blind person. Nothing about the person that asked her husband to do the killing, promising to stand by him and do whatever it takes to get through this.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 1990. In sum, the evidence is sufficient for a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Charles Finch premeditated the death of Ron Modlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Turning to the death of Sgt. Kinard, the evidence of premeditation when viewed in the light most favorable to the State shows the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">After Charles shot Ron Modlin, he said that he would shoot any officer that came in because \u201cThey\u2019re lousy.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 73. Thelma\u2019s mother, Margaret, testified that Charles repeated his intent to kill a police officer three times. In fact, during a conversation they had while in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>back bedroom, right before the police arrived, Margaret tried to explain to him that he would be in much more trouble if he shot a police officer. Charles, however, reiterated that he hated cops and if he saw a cop it would be a dead cop. These statements indicate that Charles had time to reflect, deliberate, and even consider the consequences of taking a police officer\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Additionally, the evidence shows that Charles was attempting to set a trap for the officers. During the 911 call, he told the operator he would give himself up when the officers arrived. He also said the gun was outside. Instead, Charles had the gun in his hand and went into the back bedroom to watch for the officers to arrive. The jury could reasonably infer that he was intentionally misleading the authorities to lull them into a false sense of security.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">When the police arrived, Charles stated that he was not going to leave but told Margaret to go. Sgt. Kinard was the officer communicating with the people in the house. There was also testimony and concern that dogs were barking and indicating the officers\u2019 location. Additionally, there was a yard light, porch light and lights on the police cars that were illuminating the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Charles\u2019 own statements indicate that he knew where the police officers were located when he shot at them. Although he told Detective Pince after the incident that he had shot \u201crandomly\u201d out the window that night, RP (Jury Trial) at 1032, in a letter to Melody Thomas he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-8\">I saw them outside and I shot where I knew they were hoping I hit one. I didn\u2019t know that I had hit one until 4:30 AM or after. I didn\u2019t know that he was dead until about 9:00 AM on the 16th. So, I did shoot where I did, hoping that I would hit one or at least back them up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">RP (Jury Trial) at 1993-94. Additionally, another friend of Charles asked him if he shot the police officer deliberately and Charles said yes. The jury could reasonably conclude from this evidence that Charles knew where the police officers were and that he shot in that area with the intent to kill one or more of the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence indicates Charles had threatened to kill any police officer that came to the scene and that he had ample time to reflect upon this decision. The evidence was also sufficient to establish that Charles knew the location of the officers when he fired the rounds from the bedroom window that killed Sgt. Kinard. Thus, we find that sufficient evidence existed for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that Charles Finch premeditated the deaths of both Ron Modlin and Sgt. Kinard.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">Sufficiency of the evidence of the aggravators</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">In challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove an aggravating factor in aggravated murder, this court must view the evidence most favorably toward the prosecution to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the presence of the aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Green, </em>94 Wn.2d 216, 221, 616 P.2d 628 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">a. Common Scheme or Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The Defendant argues that sufficient evidence does not exist to find that he killed Ron Modlin and Sgt. Kinard as part of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan.\u201d <em>See </em>RCW 10.95-.020(10). Under this aggravator multiple murders are required and there must be a \u201c \u2018nexus between the killings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 661 (quoting <em>State v. Dictado, </em>102 Wn.2d 277, 285, 687 P.2d 172 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">This aggravator may refer to the situation where \u201c \u2018several crimes constitute constituent parts of a plan in which each crime is but a piece of the larger plan.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 662 (quoting <em>State v. Lough, </em>125 Wn.2d 847, 855, 889 P.2d 487 (1995)). The term refers to a larger criminal design, of which the charged crime is only part. <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 662; <em>State v. Bowen, </em>48 Wn. App. 187, 192, 738 P.2d 316 (1987). To prove the existence of this aggravator the killings must be connected by a larger criminal plan. <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 662. Thus, the \u201cnexus\u201d exists when an overarching criminal plan connects both murders. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number><em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 662; <em>see also Dictado, </em>102 Wn.2d 277 (killings were in furtherance of a gambling scheme); <em>State v. Grisby, </em>97 Wn.2d 493, 496, 647 P.2d 6 (1982) (multiple killings in revenge for being sold bad quality drugs).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">In <em>Pirtle, </em>the defendant argued that there must be evidence of a plan to commit multiple murders to satisfy this aggravator. This court rejected the argument explaining that it misconstrued common scheme or plan. <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 663. The court explained the evidence need not show the existence of a plan to kill the named individual or even that the killings be committed for precisely the same reasons, only that the killings are connected by a larger criminal purpose. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the State, the jury could have found that the murders were committed in the course of the Defendant\u2019s plan to kill Thelma, himself, Ron and whoever else was at the trailer that evening or got in the way. At the least, the Defendant had a plan, as shown by the evidence, to go to Thelma\u2019s home and kill her and himself. For a month prior to the killing, the Defendant asked several co-workers about buying a gun. He asked his boss if he could take the 16th and 17th of August off work. He also asked Thelma on different occasions if she had paid her burial insurance. He took money out of his account and purchased the gun. He even planned to conceal the weapon by telling her it was a present for her birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">As discussed above, the jury could have reasonably found that killing Ron was a part of Charles\u2019 plan that evening. Knowing that Ron was moving back in, the jury could infer that Mr. Finch knew he would be there that evening. Upon entering the trailer he loaded his gun and killed Ron. This could be viewed as part of an overall plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">With regard to Sgt. Kinard, the jury could have reasonably found that Mr. Finch was prepared to kill anyone who interfered with his plan; therefore, Sgt. Kinard\u2019s death was connected to the overall scheme. The Defendant argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>that since Sgt. Kinard was shot as Thelma and Margaret left the trailer, the nexus was broken. However, Charles had not yet carried through with his intention to kill himself. Also, after Margaret and Thelma left the trailer, Charles yelled out to send the women back in. Thus, it could he inferred that he was still intent on carrying out his plan. The fact that he did not succeed in killing himself and Thelma does not affect the analysis. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, Sgt. Kinard\u2019s murder appears to have been sufficiently connected to Mr. Finch\u2019s overall plan to find the existence of this aggravator beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">b. In the course or furtherance of a burglary</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The Defendant argues there was not sufficient evidence to prove Ron Modlin\u2019s death was committed in the course or furtherance of a burglary. <em>See </em>RCW 10.95.020(11). The jury was properly instructed that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of burglary in the first degree when he or she enters or remains unlawfully in a dwelling with intent to commit a crime against a person or property therein, and if, in entering or while in the dwelling or in immediate flight therefrom, that person or an accomplice in the crime is armed with a deadly weapon or assaults any person therein.\u201d CP (Jury Trial) at 617. The jury was also instructed that \u201c[a] person enters or remains unlawfully in or upon premises when he [or she] is not then licensed, invited, or otherwise privileged to so enter or remain.\u201d CP (Jury Trial) at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The Defendant argues that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that Mr. Finch entered or remained on the premises unlawfully. The Defendant argues that Thelma never acted to prevent him from entering the trailer that evening. He contends that by asking him not to bring the beer into the house Thelma impliedly invited him to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">When Thelma and Charles separated, she asked Charles to move out and not to return. She also asked him to give his key back but he refused. When Charles arrived at Thelma\u2019s she did tell him not to bring the beer inside. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>she also testified that she did not give him permission to enter. She testified that the sliding glass door was already open when he arrived and that she didn\u2019t have a chance to say anything stating that he \u201cbrushed against [her] real fast and walked in the house.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\"> Additionally, the Defendant told Detective Pince that he was not invited to enter the trailer and that the women explicitly told him not to come in. Mr. Finch stated \u201c[t]hey [Margaret and Thelma] told me not to come in.\u201d RP (Jury Trial) at 1038. The Defendant, however, argues that the corpus delicti rule prohibits a conviction based on a confession absent a prima facie case that the crime has been committed. The crime for which the defendant has been convicted is first degree aggravated murder, not burglary Proof that a burglary was committed in the course of the murder is only an element of the charge. Therefore, the statement can be used to prove the existence of this aggravator.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The corpus delicti rule prohibits the admission of a confession absent prima facie evidence that a crime has been committed. <em>See State v. Aten, </em>130 Wn.2d 640, 655-56, 927 P.2d 210 (1996). The purpose of the rule is to prevent a person from being convicted based on a confession to a crime that has not been committed. <em>City of Bremerton v. Corbett, </em>106 Wn.2d 569, 576-77, 723 P.2d 1135 (1986); <em>State v. Dodgen, </em>81 Wn. App. 487, 492, 915 P.2d 531 (1996). The Defendant in this case was convicted of first degree aggravated murder of Ron Modlin. In a homicide case, the corpus delicti consists of two elements the State must prove at trial; (1) the fact of a death and (2) a causal connection between the death and a criminal act. <em>Aten, </em>130 Wn.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Corpus delicti is more than adequately established in this case. There is clearly sufficient independent evidence of Ron\u2019s death at the hands of the Defendant. Establishing that the homicide occurred in the course of a burglary is but an aggravator of the initial charge of murder and was not charged as a separate crime. Therefore, once corpus de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>licti for the charge of first degree aggravated murder has been established, the statement may be used as proof of the existence of this aggravator.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Turning to whether the evidence was sufficient in this case to establish that Ron\u2019s murder was committed in the course or furtherance of a burglary, we find the evidence sufficient to establish the presence of this aggravating factor. The evidence noted above, along with the Defendant\u2019s actions before the crime, including obtaining a gun and asking Thelma if she had paid her burial insurance, indicate that he unlawfully entered Thelma\u2019s trailer that evening to commit a crime therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\"> The Defendant contends that he was denied a fair trial because the prosecutor made improper statements in his rebuttal closing argument. Trial court rulings based on allegations of prosecutorial misconduct are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Stenson, </em>132 Wn.2d at 718; <em>Brett, </em>126 Wn.2d at 174; <em>Lord, </em>117 Wn.2d at 887. In making such a challenge the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was both improper and prejudicial. <em>Stenson, </em>132 Wn.2d at 718; <em>Gentry, </em>125 Wn.2d at 640. If the prosecutor\u2019s conduct is improper it does not constitute prejudicial error unless the appellate court determines there is a substantial likelihood the misconduct affected the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Stenson, </em>132 Wn.2d at 719; <em>Brett, </em>126 Wn.2d at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">If the defendant fails to object to an improper remark it is considered waived unless the remark is \u201cso flagrant and ill-intentioned that it evinces an enduring and resulting prejudice that could not have been neutralized by an admonition to the jury.\u201d <em>Stenson, </em>132 Wn.2d at 719; <em>Gentry, </em>125 Wn.2d at 596. In this case, since the Defendant did not object to any of the Prosecutor\u2019s statements this latter standard will apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">The relevant portion of the Prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal closing statement, with the language objected to by the Defendant underlined, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Ladies and gentleman, when something happens in a civilized land, we want that something to be dealt with by the rule of law and we need somebody to make the decision. We can\u2019t call everybody in Snohomish County down to the courthouse to have a trial for what happened here if, for no other reason, that there\u2019s no place big enough to put everybody and society would grind to a halt. So we bring in a representative sampling of the community to make the decision and you are the representative sampling of that community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-5\">We put on a trial and we tell you what the facts are or what the evidence is from which you may find the facts and the Judge tells you what the law is, and then you\u2019re told \u201cOkay, now you\u2019ve heard all the evidence and you\u2019ve heard all the law. Now go back there and you all figure this out.\u201d And that\u2019s going to happen here in just a couple of minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-6\">In this way and following the law, as you have to do, you are the conscience of the community; you are the voice of the law in the community. We talked earlier. Raised the question during voir dire; I raised it during closing argument about how important it is that the verdict that you reach in this case should represent the truth, and it should. You all agreed with that. We are ultimately here about justice and your verdict should not only be a truthful verdict, but it should be a just verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">RP (Jury Trial) at 2350-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Relying on Washington Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions in <em>State v. Bautista-Caldera, </em>56 Wn. App. 186, 783 P.2d 116 (1989), and <em>State v. Coleman, </em>74 Wn. App. 835, 876 P.2d 458 (1994), the Defendant asserts that the challenged statements by the Prosecutor were improper. In <em>BautistaCaldera, </em>the defendant appealed his conviction of first degree statutory rape and one count of indecent liberties arguing, among other things, that prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument denied him a fair trial. <em>BautistaCaldera, </em>56 Wn. App. at 193. The court found the following statements by the prosecution to be improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-9\">[D]o not tell that child that this type of touching is okay, that this is just something that she will have to learn to live with. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Let her and children know that you\u2019re ready to believe them and [e]nforce the law on their behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 195. The court found the prosecution\u2019s plea improper because it \u201cin effect exhorts the jury to send a message to <em>society </em>about the general problem of child sexual abuse.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In <em>Coleman </em>the prosecutor presented a short rebuttal closing with the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-7\">It is your job to apply the facts to the law, and we cannot second guess you, and will not second guess you, and if you determine that the only thing that happened here was a theft then that is your judgment. And you are entitled to make it, but I would suggest to you that to do so you have to do two things. And one is to ignore the actual evidence in front of you, and the second is thereby to violate your [oa]th as jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-8\"><em>Coleman, </em>74 Wn. App. at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">The court found the above argument to be improper because it implied that the jury would violate its oath if it disagreed with the State\u2019s theory of the evidence. The court relied in part on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 18, 105 S. Ct. 1038, 84 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1985), where the Court found it was error for the prosecutor to try to exhort the jury to \u201cdo its job.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">The Defendant contends that the challenged comments by the prosecution improperly exhorted the jury to \u201cdo its job\u201d as a representative of the community and improperly implied that anything less would be a failure of the rule of law or a failure to meet the requirements of a civilized land.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">While the prosecutor\u2019s remarks here constitute an appeal to the jury to act as the conscience of the community, they do not rise to the level of improper conduct seen in <em>Young, Coleman </em>or <em>Bautista-Caldera. </em>Moreover, although the courts in <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Bautista-Caldera </em>found that the prosecutors acted improperly they did not find prejudicial error. In <em>Coleman, </em>the court found no substantial likeli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>hood that the misconduct affected the verdict. <em>Coleman, </em>74 Wn. App. at 841. The court explained that while it did not condone the comments, they were tempered by the preceding comments that \u201cwe cannot second guess you, . . . and if you determine that the only thing that happened here was a theft then that is your judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These comments, reasoned the court, indicated that the jury\u2019s verdict would be honored and outweighed the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments. <em>Id. </em>The court in <em>Bautista-Caldera </em>found the improper statements did not create any prejudice that could not have been neutralized with a curative instruction. <em>Bautista-Caldera, </em>56 Wn. App. at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Additionally, federal courts have found, as a general rule, that \u201cappeals for the jury to act as a conscience of the community are not impermissible, unless specifically designed to inflame the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Lester, </em>749 F.2d 1288, 1301 (9th Cir. 1984); <em>accord United States v. Bascaro, </em>742 F.2d 1335, 1354 (11th Cir. 1984); <em>United States v. Kopituk, </em>690 F.2d 1289, 1342-43 (11th Cir. 1982); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>547 F.2d 1030, 1036-37 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Alloway, </em>397 F.2d 105, 113 (6th Cir. 1968). There is nothing in the Prosecutor\u2019s argument to indicate it was specifically designed to inflame the jury. Thus, we find that the statements made by the Prosecutor during rebuttal closing did not amount to prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Mr, Finch\u2019s appearance in court in shackles and handcuffs</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The Defendant argues that the trial court erred in its decision to have him shackled throughout the trial and special sentencing proceeding and also handcuffed during the testimony of Margaret Elizares and Thelma Finch. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">It is well settled that a defendant in a criminal case is entitled to appear at trial free from all bonds or shackles except in extraordinary circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Illinois v.

This close judicial scrutiny of inherently prejudicial practices has not always led to reversal however. In <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>the Court emphasized that a defendant may be prejudiced if he appears before the jury bound and gagged. \u201cNot only is it possible that the sight of shackles and gags might have a significant effect on the jury\u2019s feelings about the defendant, but the use of this technique is itself something of an affront to the very dignity and decorum of judicial proceedings that the judge is seeking to uphold.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. at 344. Yet the Court nonetheless observed that in certain extreme situations \u201cbinding and gagging might possibly be the fairest and most reasonable way to handle\u201d a particularly obstreperous and disruptive defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">When determining whether restraints should be used during a courtroom proceeding this court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-6\">A trial judge must exercise discretion in determining the extent to which courtroom security measures are necessary to maintain order and prevent injury. That discretion must be founded upon a factual basis set forth in the record. A broad general policy of imposing physical restraints upon prison inmates charged with new offenses because they may be \u2018potentially dangerous\u2019 is a failure to exercise discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-7\"><em>Hartzog, </em>96 Wn.2d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Thus, this court and courts of other jurisdictions have universally held that restraints should \u201cbe used only when necessary to prevent injury to those in the courtroom, to prevent disorderly conduct at trial, or to prevent an escape.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Hartzog, </em>96 Wn.2d at 398; <em>see also Ollison, </em>68 Wn.2d at 69; <em>Sawyer, </em>60 Wn.2d at 86; <em>State v.

Tolley, </em>this court in <em>Hartzog </em>also set forth several factors that a trial court could consider in deciding whether to use physical restraints:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"anc-dedup-1\">[T]he seriousness of the present charge against the defendant; defendant\u2019s temperament and character; his age and physical attributes; his past record; past escapes or attempted escapes, and evidence of a present plan to escape; threats to harm others or cause a disturbance; self-destructive tendencies; the risk of mob violence or of attempted revenge by others; the possibility of rescue by other offenders still at large; the size and the mood of the audience; the nature and physical security of the courtroom; and the adequacy and availability of alternative remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-6\"><em>Hartzog, </em>96 Wn.2d at 400 (quoting <em>State v. Tolley, </em>290 N.C. 349, 368, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976)). This court did not actually apply these factors in <em>Hartzog </em>because it was reviewing a general security order applicable to all defendants and witnesses who were penitentiary inmates requiring them to remain in arm and leg restraints while in court. <em>Id. </em>at 386-87. This court found the general policy of restraint to be unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 400-01.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Although these factors were listed by the Supreme Court of North Carolina over 30 years ago, they have been cited in only a limited number of cases. <em>See Boose, </em>66 Ill. 2d at 263; <em>Stockton v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va., 192, 402 S.E.2d 196 (1991). While this court, too, has cited the factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>simply listing these factors, without more, is not particularly helpful. The court in <em>Tolley </em>did not indicate how these factors are to be used, i.e., what factors could and could not be determinative in a trial court\u2019s decision to restrain a defendant during trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The court in <em>Tolley </em>did recognize that a trial court is to use physical restraints only when necessary to \u201cprevent escape, to protect others in the courtroom or to maintain order during trial.\u201d <em>Tolley, </em>226 S.E.2d at 367. Thus, only factors which indicate a manifest need for some measure to be taken to maintain the security of the courtroom should be considered. <em>Id,.; Boose, </em>66 Ill. 2d at 265; <em>Duran, </em>16 Cal. 3d at 290; <em>see also Theriault, </em>531 P.2d 281; <em>Kennedy, </em>487 F.2d at 105-06. In <em>Tolley, </em>the trial court\u2019s decision to restrain the defendant during trial was upheld because the defendant attempted to escape during the preliminary hearing. <em>Tolley, </em>226 S.E.2d at 363-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The problem with the <em>Tolley </em>factors is that a number of the factors could be present but still not indicate a \u201cmanifest need\u201d to restrain the defendant. For example, the Illinois Supreme Court listed the factors in <em>People v. Boose </em>and found that, although one of the factors was present, it did not justify the court\u2019s decision to shackle the defendant during his competency hearing. In <em>Boose, </em>the court found that the trial court abused its discretion where it based its decision to restrain the defendant on the fact that he was accused of murdering a guard while in prison. Although the court recognized that the seriousness of the offense charged is one of the factors to be considered by the trial court, \u201cwe cannot say that ... it ... is enough to sustain this court\u2019s ruling.\u201d <em>Boose, </em>66 Ill. 2d at 267. The court stated that \u201c[i]f the shackling here were judged defensible it would seem all persons accused of violent crimes could be shackled in the jury\u2019s presence solely because of the character of the crimes charged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>The Supreme Court of California also found that the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered the defendant to be shackled during trial. The court stated that there was \u201cno showing that defendant threatened to escape or behaved violently before coming to court or while in court. The fact that defendant was a state prison inmate who had been convicted of robbery and was charged with a violent crime did not, without more, justify the use of physical restraints.\u201d <em>Duran, </em>16 Cal. 3d at 293. Although the facts of the case satisfied two of the factors listed above, the use of shackles was not found to be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">It is clear that the existence of one or more factors does not necessarily mean that a defendant should be restrained. Courts must consider only those factors which indicate that \u201ccompelling circumstances that some measure [is] needed to maintain security of the courtroom.\u201d <em>Duckett, </em>67 F.3d at 748 (citations omitted). The trial court must base its decision to physically restrain a defendant on evidence which indicates that the defendant poses an imminent risk of escape, that the defendant intends to injure someone in the courtroom, or that the defendant cannot behave in an orderly manner while in the courtroom. To do otherwise is an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Finally, the Supreme Court has cautioned that the use of handcuffs, shackles and other forms of physical restraints should be used only as measures of \u201clast resort.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. at 344. Thus, the court must consider less restrictive alternatives before imposing physical restraints. <em>Duck-ett, </em>67 F.3d at 748; <em>Jones v. Meyer, </em>899 F.2d 883, 885 (9th Cir. 1990); <em>Spain v. Rushen, </em>883 F.2d 712, 720 (9th Cir. 1989); <em>Kennedy, </em>487 F.2d at 111; <em>Hamilton, </em>17 F.3d at 1154; <em>United States v. Baker, </em>10 F.3d 1374, 1401-02 (9th Cir. 1993); <em>State v. Jones, </em>311 Minn. 176, 181-82, 247 N.W.2d 427 (1976); <em>Elledge, </em>823 F.2d at 1451.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">In the present case, the Defendant was shackled during the entire course of his trial and special sentencing proceeding. He was further restrained during Thelma\u2019s and Margaret\u2019s testimonies by having his right hand handcuffed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>to his chair and his shackles handcuffed to the table leg. The judge based his decision to restrain the Defendant on the fact that, while in custody, he had repeated his desire to kill Thelma to doctors from Western State Hospital. Additionally, the State and correctional officers were concerned because \u201che\u2019s a rather large man . . . and once he got going, he\u2019d have quite a lot of momentum.\u201d RP (Pretrial) at 1135. The State also noted that the courtroom was small and Thelma would have to pass within close proximity of the Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Although the court had some concerns with regard to Thelma, these concerns do not justify the court\u2019s decision to shackle Mr. Finch when she was not testifying. There is no indication from the record or the hearing on this matter that the Defendant posed a threat to anyone else in the courtroom, that the Defendant posed an escape risk, or that he had been disruptive during courtroom proceedings. The State, however, argues that the trial court\u2019s decision was justified because Mr. Finch was on trial for murder, he had prior convictions for \u201cviolent\u201d offenses, he was a large man, and he attempted suicide while he was in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">First, the trial court did not indicate that anything but the size of the Defendant and his threats toward Thelma formed the basis for his decision. Second, and more importantly, these facts do not indicate a \u201cmanifest need\u201d for restraints. Thus, the decision to restrain Mr. Finch throughout the course of his trial, based on these facts, is contrary to the overwhelming case law in this area. Mr. Finch\u2019s prior crimes were committed over 25 years earlier and none involved a conviction for escape. Additionally, during his incarceration he had no history of violence and he never attempted escape. Moreover, the crimes charged in this case do not warrant physical restraints. A defendant is presumed innocent when he stands trial and, as stated above, to justify the imposition of restraints based on the charge in this case would mean that every person charged with aggravated first degree murder could then be restrained during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Mr. Finch did attempt suicide while in custody; however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>this does not evince a need for physical restraints. Mr. Finch attempted suicide in September 1994, eight months prior to trial, and there was no evidence in the record that he was suicidal at the time of trial. After he was placed on antidepressant medication no suicidal notions were present. The State does not cite to, and this court cannot find any case which has allowed physical restraints in such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Moreover, the Defendant attended numerous pretrial proceedings in which he was completely compliant with the decorum of the court. In fact, during one of the pretrial proceedings, Thelma testified and also had to pass very close to the Defendant. The trial judge noted as much stating that \u201cso far during any court proceedings, there have been absolutely no problems with Mr. Finch\u2019s behavior, and that included a brief period of testimony of Thelma Finch.\u201d RP (Pretrial) at 1148. However, the court still allowed the Defendant to be restrained throughout the entire trial and special sentencing proceeding stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-6\">I am concerned during the course of the trial, as things are unfolding concerning the events that allegedly took place in August, that we\u2019re going to need to have the courtroom controlled in a fashion that protects everyone within it. I don\u2019t think I can ignore the concerns of the Department of Corrections\u2019 personnel who are responsible for the courtroom safety of individuals and the protection of both the public and Mr. Finch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">RP (Pretrial) at 1148. These were the trial court\u2019s reasons for shackling the Defendant during the course of the trial. The judge\u2019s reasons do not indicate any concern that the Defendant was an escape risk, that he was an imminent threat to those in the courtroom, or that he was a disruptive presence. A concern that a defendant is \u201cpotentially dangerous\u201d is not sufficient to warrant the restraint of the defendant. <em>See Hartzog, </em>96 Wn.2d at 400 (\u201cimposing physical restraints upon prison inmates charged with new offenses because they may be \u2018potentially dangerous\u2019 is a failure to exercise discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Additionally, the deference given to the correctional officers is error. Courts have specifically found reversible error where the trial court based its decision solely on the judgment of correctional officers who believed that using restraints during trial was necessary to maintain security, while no other justifiable basis existed on the record. <em>See People v. Vigliotti, </em>203 A.D.2d 898, 611 N.Y.S.2d 413 (1994); <em>People v. Thomas, </em>125 A.D.2d 873, 510 N.Y.S.2d 460 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The trial court\u2019s decision to shackle Mr. Finch during the trial and sentencing was clearly an abuse of discretion. Mr. Finch was never disruptive in court, he was not an escape risk, and he posed no threat to anyone other than, possibly, Thelma. The trial court\u2019s decision was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Next, we turn to the trial court\u2019s decision to use restraints during the testimony of Margaret and Thelma. During their testimony, the Defendant\u2019s shackles were handcuffed to the table leg and his right hand was handcuffed to the chair. However, with regard to Margaret, the court stated \u201cI\u2019ve not heard anything in particular with respect to Ms. Elizares that causes the same concerns [as with Thelma] and I wouldn\u2019t have any special rulings with respect to her testimony.\u201d RP (Pretrial) at 1150. There was no reason for the use of these additional restraints during Margaret\u2019s testimony. Again, this is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">With regard to Thelma, the court allowed restraints based on the fact that Mr. Finch threatened to kill Thelma if he had the opportunity. This was ordered despite the fact that Thelma previously testified in the presence of the Defendant, walking directly by him, with no incident. Although the Defendant had caused no disruption during the preliminary hearings, the Defendant\u2019s statements could warrant some precautionary measures. However, during the course of the hearings, the trial judge did not consider any less restrictive alternatives. This court in <em>Hartzog </em>noted that the court should consider other alternatives such as the \u201crelocation of the witness stand[,] . . . the reasonable use of additional security personnel^] . . . [and] the use of metal detectors and other security devices.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number><em>Hartzog, </em>96 Wn.2d at 401 (quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>State v. Hartzog, </em>26 Wn. App. 576, 589, 615 P.2d 480 (1980)); <em>see also Elledge, </em>823 P.2d at 1439 (although the defendant threatened courtroom personnel and was proficient at karate, there was no indication that the trial court considered less restrictive alternatives to placing the defendant in leg irons for the remainder of the sentencing phase of capital trial and therefore the court reversed and remanded for resentencing); <em>Hardin, </em>365 E Supp. 39 (although defendant posed an escape risk the trial court did not consider less restrictive means to shackling the defendant throughout trial and therefore the court set aside the conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">No alternatives were considered by the trial court in this case. Thus, even if the trial court were warranted in taking precautions during Thelma\u2019s testimony, the court erred by not considering the use of less restrictive methods rather than physically restraining him in the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Next, we determine if these errors require reversal of the jury\u2019s determination of guilt and their imposition of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The State argues that any error made by the trial court was harmless because it took precautions that would have precluded the jury from seeing the Defendant\u2019s leg shackles. When the Defendant\u2019s motion to be unrestrained during trial was denied, the trial court ordered that skirts be placed around counsel tables which would have obstructed the jury\u2019s view of the shackles.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">The State argues that but for the Defendant\u2019s motion to remove the skirts the jury would not have seen the shackles. During jury voir dire, on April 27, 1994, the Defendant did ask the trial court to remove the skirting around counsel table. This, however, was only after the Defendant was brought into the Ginni Stevens Hearing Room wearing leg restraints during the voir dire proceedings <em>beginning on </em>April 13, 1994, in front of the potential jury members. The trial court discussed, on the record, the fact that the Defendant would be entering the room with his shackles on in the presence of the jury and found that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>was inevitable that the jury would see the shackles as Mr. Finch entered the room.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-5\">I should just indicate in terms of what the jury may or may not see, the jury may well be able to see that there\u2019s some restraining going on and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way of avoiding that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">RP (Pretrial) at 1271. There is no indication in the record why the Defendant could not have been brought in and out of the room outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Only after the Defendant was required to enter the courtroom in leg restraints in front of the jury panel during the jury voir dire proceedings did defense counsel ask for the removal of the skirts. Defense counsel stated that, after a discussion with Mr. Finch, they concluded the skirts were \u2018\u2018counterproductive.\u2019\u2019 RP (Supplement) at3. TheDefend-ant argues that since he was entering the hearing room in shackles in the presence of the jury panel, placement of table skirts would no longer serve the purpose for which they were intended, that is, to keep the jury from seeing his leg restraints. Additionally, the Defendant did not want the jury to speculate as to what, if any, other safety measures were being hidden by the skirts. The skirts were removed for the remainder of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Because the record was unclear as to the extent to which the jury could detect that the Defendant was physically restrained, this court remanded for a hearing on the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-9\">(1) Was it possible for the jury to see that the Defendant was restrained when entering, leaving or sitting in the hearing room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-10\">(2) If the restraints were not visible, was it possible for the jury to know that the Defendant was restrained in some way based on a restriction of the Defendant\u2019s movements?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Washington State Supreme Court Order (Feb. 20, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">On April 9, 1998, pursuant to that order, the trial court held a hearing and answered both questions in the nega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>tive. The trial court\u2019s conclusions, however, were based on conflicting findings which proved both confusing and beyond the scope of this court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Factual findings are erroneous where not supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>State v. Hill, </em>123 Wn.2d 641, 870 P.2d 313 (1994). Substantial evidence exists where there is a \u201csufficient quantity of evidence in the record to persuade a fair-minded, rational person of the truth of the finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644 (citing <em>State v. Halstien, </em>122 Wn.2d 109, 128, 857 P.2d 270 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">With regard to the first question of our February 20, 1998 order, the trial court found that the Defendant wore Velcro leg restraints placed under his pant leg and snugly around his lower ankles. RP (Remand Hearing) at 6. The restraints made no noise which could have been heard by the jurors. <em>Id. </em>The effect of the restraints was to shorten the Defendant\u2019s stride. RP (Remand Hearing) at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">The Defendant entered the hearing room after the jurors were seated. RP (Remand Hearing) at 6. When the Defendant was sitting, his lower body was completely obscured by the second tier in the hearing room so that the jury could not have seen his restraints in such a position. RP (Remand Hearing) at 7-8. When the Defendant was escorted into and out of the hearing room, the court found that he was surrounded by three officers and his two attorneys. RP (Remand Hearing) at 7. The court further found that even if the jurors were standing, the Defendant\u2019s position with respect to the jury\u2019s view was blocked so that they could not see the Defendant\u2019s restraints. RP (Remand Hearing) at 10. The trial court did note, however, that a number of photographs admitted into evidence showed that it was possible, from certain positions in the hearing room, that someone could see the Defendant\u2019s ankles if he were in an \u201cexaggerated position, with his leg fully extended, not in any natural fashion in which someone would negotiate steps and not one which was required by the leg restraints placed upon the defendant.\u201d RP (Remand Hearing) at 9. However, from the jury\u2019s seated position in the room, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>photographs demonstrated it would have been impossible to actually see the Defendant\u2019s shackled ankles. RP (Remand Hearing) at 8-9. The trial court concluded that it was not possible for the jury to see that the Defendant was restrained when he was entering, leaving or sitting in the hearing room.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">With regard to the second question, the trial court found that the Defendant\u2019s movements were noticeably restricted. This is because the restraints caused the Defendant to walk slowly and his stride to be obviously shortened. RP (Remand Hearing) at 10, 12. As the trial court itself found, \u201cthe effect of the Velcro restraint was to shorten the defendant\u2019s stride. They would have served no purpose otherwise.\u201d RP (Remand Hearing) at 8. The court noted that it was certainly possible for the jury to notice the Defendant\u2019s obviously restricted movements, and that some jurors may have speculated that he was in fact restrained. RP (Remand Hearing) at 12-13. At the same time, however, the court indicated that the jury could have speculated as to a number of other reasons why Defendant\u2019s movements were restricted\u2014\u201cthe solemnity of the occasion, the fact that the defendant was surrounded by a group of people, the fact that he may have been looking at jurors when he walked out. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court concluded that it was not possible for the jury to know that the Defendant was restrained based on his movements.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The trial court\u2019s reasoning is confusing, inconsistent with its earlier observations, and does not support its conclusion. Regardless of whether the jury may have speculated as to other reasons for the Defendant\u2019s restricted movements, it was clearly possible that the jury could have known that the Defendant was restrained. As the court itself found, \u201cit was clear that the defendant\u2019s movements were restricted.\u201d RP (Remand Hearing) at 12. The restraints caused the Defendant\u2019s restricted movements, not the solemnity of the occasion or the individuals who escorted him. The Defendant\u2019s obviously slow walk and shortened stride were caused by the restraints, so much so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>that the Defendant could not walk or extend his leg in \u201cany natural fashion in which someone would negotiate steps.\u201d RP (Remand Hearing) at 9. These facts, together with the trial court\u2019s original remarks on the record\u2014 cautioning that the \u201cjury may well be able to see that there\u2019s some restraining going on . . .1 don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way of avoiding that\u201d\u2014reveal that it was indeed possible for the jury to know that Defendant was restrained based on the restriction of his movements. RP (Pretrial) at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The trial court found that it was clear the restriction of the Defendant\u2019s movements was caused by the restraints. The jury could observe the impact of the restraints because the Defendant\u2019s walk was slow, his stride obviously shortened. The trial court also found that it was possible that the jury could have inferred that the Defendant was restrained. In light of these findings and the trial court\u2019s original remarks indicating the inevitability that the jury would observe that \u201cthere\u2019s some restraining going on,\u201d clearly it was possible for the jury to know that he was restrained. RP (Pretrial) at 1271. Even if the table skirts remained attached to the Defendant\u2019s table, they would not have mitigated the trial court\u2019s error since the jury would have known he was physically restrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The State also argues that but for defense counsel\u2019s actions drawing attention to the fact that the Defendant was handcuffed, the jury would not have noticed the additional use of those restraints. At the end of Thelma\u2019s testimony and right before the next witness was called, counsel for the Defendant asked if, pursuant to the judge\u2019s order, the Defendant could be released from the handcuff. The bailiff then unhandcuffed him in the presence of the jury. Although the defense counsel\u2019s actions did draw attention to the handcuff, this action does not alter our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">The record does not indicate whether the jury could, in fact, see the additional use of handcuff, or that the Defendant\u2019s leg shackles were also handcuffed to the table during the testimony of Thelma and Margaret. However, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>the defendant was handcuffed to his chair he could not stand up when court was brought into session. Additionally, the trial court made no effort to conceal the handcuff and specifically noted that he was \u201cconcerned with arm restraints because it\u2019s tough to make them not visible.\u201d RP (Pretrial) at 1149. Thus, the fact that defense counsel brought attention to the handcuff does not affect the inquiry where the handcuffs were likely visible to the jury and the jury knew that Defendant wore other restraints throughout his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Generally, an error that violates a constitutional right of the accused is presumed to be prejudicial. <em>See State v. </em>Stephens, 93 Wn.2d 186, 607 P.2d 304 (1980). The appellate court determines whether the State has overcome the presumption from an examination of the record, from which it must affirmatively appear the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Belmarez, </em>101 Wn.2d 212, 676 P.2d 492 (1984) (error in instruction on deadly weapon was of constitutional magnitude and not harmless). The rule is occasionally stated in its approximate converse, i.e., that the error is harmless if the evidence against the defendant is so overwhelming that no rational conclusion other than guilt can be reached. <em>State v. Guloy, </em>104 Wn.2d 412, 705 P.2d 1182 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Many courts have found that where the trial court has abused its discretion allowing the defendant to be physically restrained during trial, such an error is not harmless. <em>See Vigliotti, </em>203 A.D.2d 898 (error of shackling and handcuffing the defendant during trial not harmless where the decision was based solely on Sheriff\u2019s recommendation); <em>Dickson v.

Cockerham v. Butler, </em>515 So. 2d 1134 (La. Ct. App. 1987) (error harmless where three victims identified the defendant and the jury saw the defendant in handcuffs for only a short period of time); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>489 So. 2d 301 (La.

Jacla, </em>77 Cal. App. 3d 878, 144 Cal. Rptr. 23 (1978) (error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt although the defendant was shackled throughout the trial); <em>Zygadlo v. State, </em>341 So. 2d 1053 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1977) (the court stated that although leg shackles were used on the accused during his trial, the record disclosed overwhelming evidence of his guilt); <em>People v. Prado, </em>67 Cal. App. 3d 267, 136 Cal. Rptr. 521 (1977) (error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt based on the compelling evidence against the defendant); <em>Chandler v. State, </em>92 Nev. 299, 550 P.2d 159 (1976) (error harmless where the defendant confessed to the murder not only to an FBI agent but also in a letter written to the victim\u2019s wife); <em>People v. Thompson, </em>23 Cal. App. 2d 339, 72 P.2d 927 (1937) (although the defendant was placed in leg irons throughout the trial evidence of guilt was overwhelming and thus reversal was not warranted); <em>but see Boose, </em>66 Ill. 2d at 269 (Supreme Court of Illinois reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, on a guilty plea of murder, where he was erroneously required to be handcuffed and shackled during his competency hearing stating \u201c[hjowever strong the evidence against an accused may be, ... a fair trial, in all its stages, is a fundamental requirement in a criminal prosecution and when such a requirement is not met, it amounts to a denial of due process of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">This court has recently held that a claim of unconstitutional shackling is subject to a harmless error analysis. <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>135 Wn.2d 863, 888, 959 P.2d 1061 (1998). There, the court concluded error occurred when the defendant was shackled, but because the jury never saw the defendant in shackles and the defendant failed to show he was prejudiced in any way, the error was harmless. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">There is no excuse for the use of physical restraints <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>in this case. It was clear error. Nevertheless, even this error may be harmless based on the overwhelming evidence of guilt. There were many eyewitnesses to the crimes committed in this case and the Defendant confessed to killing Ron and the police officer not only to the police but in letters and statements to his friends. Based on the compelling evidence admitted during trial of the Defendant\u2019s guilt, we believe that any reasonable jury would have reached the same result in the absence of the trial court\u2019s error. <em>See Guloy, </em>104 Wn.2d at 425 (\u201c[a] constitutional error is harmless if the appellate court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that any reasonable jury would have reached the same result in the absence of the error\u201d). Only because evidence of guilt is overwhelming do we affirm the conviction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The determination that error in shackling a defendant is harmless error in the guilt phase of a capital proceeding does not resolve the question whether such error is harmless in the sentencing phase. This is because the purposes of the two phases are distinct. In the guilt phase, the inquiry is whether the defendant is guilty of the crime(s) charged. The conviction of a defendant who has suffered prejudice as a result of unconstitutional shackling may nevertheless be upheld where overwhelming evidence supports the determination of guilt. If there is such evidence, and the reviewing court can therefore conclude that beyond a reasonable doubt any reasonable jury would have convicted the defendant, the reliability of the guilt determination is assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">At sentencing, however, the inquiry is not the same. Instead of deciding whether the defendant committed the charged offense(s), the jury must decide whether to impose a death sentence on the defendant. Unlike the guilt phase, the prejudice to the Defendant during a special sentencing proceeding cannot necessarily be overcome by objective and overwhelming evidence. \u201c \u2018[T]he fundamental respect for humanity underlying the Eighth Amendment . . . requires consideration of the character and record of the individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 112, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982) (quoting <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 304, 96 S. Ct. 2978, 49 L. Ed. 2d 944 (1976)). The evidence considered during the special sentencing proceeding is of a more subjective nature dealing with not only the nature of the crimes involved but also with personal history and the character of the Defendant. <em>See Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1978); <em>Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 671.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Here, the issue is the possible impact which shackling the Defendant may have had on the sentencing decision, particularly in connection with the question of future dangerousness. It is undisputed that placing the defendant in restraints indicates to the jury that the Defendant is viewed as a \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cunmanageable\u201d person, in the opinion of the court, who cannot be controlled, even in the presence of courtroom security. The Eleventh Circuit has emphasized that \u201ca jury might view the shackles as first hand evidence of future dangerousness and uncontrollable behavior which if unmanageable in the courtroom may also be unmanageable in prison, leaving death as a proper decision.\u201d <em>Elledge, </em>823 F.2d at 1450.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The converse, of course, is that evidence that a defendant does not pose a risk of probable future dangerousness is also relevant. The United States Supreme Court has held that evidence of probable future conduct in prison as a well-behaved, well-adjusted prisoner is relevant mitigating evidence which is appropriately considered by a jury in deciding on a sentence less than death. <em>Skipper v. South Carolina, </em>476 U.S. 1, 4-5, 106 S. Ct. 1669, 90 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1986). In deciding whether to impose a death sentence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>the \u201csentencer may not be precluded from considering, and may not refuse to consider, any constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d <em>Buchanan v. Angelone, 522 </em>U.S. 269, 118 S. Ct. 757, 761, 139 L. Ed. 2d 702 (1998); see <em>also Pirtle, </em>127 Wn.2d at 679 (if the jury is precluded from giving effect to a single mitigating factor, the proceeding is constitutionally flawed). It is irrelevant whether the barrier to the sentencer\u2019s consideration of mitigating evidence exists because of a statute, because of the sentencing court, or because of an evidentiary ruling. <em>Mills v. Maryland, </em>486 U.S. 367, 375, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384 (1988) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Thus, future dangerousness or the probable lack of future dangerousness of the defendant is a relevant factor for a jury\u2019s consideration in deciding whether to impose a death sentence. \u201cIn the penalty phase of a capital trial, the jury knows the defendant is a convicted felon. But the extent to which he continues to be dangerous is a central issue the juxy must decide in determining his sentence.\u201d <em>Duckett, </em>67 F.3d at 748. This is true even where the alternative to a death sentence is that the defendant would be incarcerated for the rest of his or her life. <em>Skipper, </em>476 U.S. at 5 (\u201c[E]vidence that the defendant would not pose a danger if spared (but incarcerated) must be considered potentially mitigating. Under <em>Eddings, </em>such evidence may not be excluded from the sentencer\u2019s consideration.\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Our state statutes embody this principle. One of the statutory factors the jury may consider when deciding to impose the death penalty is \u201c[wjhether there is a likelihood that the defendant will pose a danger to others in the future.\u201d ROW 10.95.070(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">The question here does not involve either governmental or defense evidence as to future dangerousness. However, just as State evidence of future dangerousness or defense evidence of probable lack of future dangerousness may affect the jury\u2019s decision whether to impose a death sentence, shackling a defendant during the proceedings might affect the jury\u2019s sentencing decision as well. Shack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>ling sends a message to the jury that, in the court\u2019s view, the defendant is so dangerous that he or she cannot be allowed to attend the proceedings, even with other security measures, without physical restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">It is true that the presumption of innocence does not apply during the sentencing phase of a capital proceeding. However, shackling or otherwise physically restraining the defendant may still implicate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights because of its possible impact on the sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">As the court in <em>Duckett </em>observed, in cases where shackling has been approved there was evidence of defendant\u2019s disruptive courtroom behavior, defendant\u2019s escape attempts, assaults or attempted assaults while in custody, or defendant\u2019s pattern of defiant behavior toward corrections officials and judicial authorities. <em>Duckett, </em>67 F.3d at 749. The court reasoned that a defendant\u2019s status as a convicted felon is not reason alone to impose restraints, and that absent evidence like that listed by the court the state trial court had committed constitutional error in allowing the defendant to appear before the sentencing jury in physical restraints. <em>Duckett, </em>67 F.3d at 749.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Undeniably, the presence of Mr. Finch in physical restraints indicated to the jury that his character is dangerous and prejudiced him in such a manner that warrants a reversal of his death sentence. The Defendant was not presented in restraints for but a brief period of time; in fact, Mr. Finch never appeared before the jury without being physically restrained. To make matters worse, the Defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>ant\u2019s leg restraints were handcuffed to the leg of the table and his right arm was handcuffed to his chair during the testimony of two of the victims. In this case, the error with regard to the jury\u2019s decision to impose the death penalty was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We reverse the jury\u2019s sentence of death and remand for a new special sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Motion for a new trial</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. A trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial will not be disturbed absent abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Williams, </em>96 Wn.2d 215, 221, 634 P.2d 868 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The Defendant argues that he was denied a fair trial because evidence concerning the response of the law enforcement officers created unfair prejudice, Sgt. Kinard\u2019s parents sat close to the jury box, and Mr. Finch was handcuffed during the testimony of Margaret and Thelma. There was no indication from the record of unfair prejudice concerning the testimony of the officers in this case and there is no reason the parents of Sgt. Kinard could not sit anywhere they would like. With regard to the handcuffing issue, we determined that a reversal of the guilt phase was not warranted on this basis. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">The court\u2019s prohibition of future contact with jurors</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">The Defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s jury protective order. That order precludes the attorneys and their agents from initiating contact with the jurors, except on prior approval of the court. This restriction applies only to the attorneys in the case and their agents, anyone else may initiate contact with the jurors. Additionally, the jurors themselves may initiate contact with anyone, including the attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\"> Courts generally disfavor postverdict interviewing of jurors. <em>See Haeberle v. Texas Int\u2019l Airlines, </em>739 F.2d 1019 (5th Cir. 1984); <em>United States v. Riley, </em>544 F.2d 237 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>(5th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>732 F.2d 1221 (5th Cir. 1984); <em>King v.

Minneapolis Gas Co., </em>291 Minn. 334, 191 N.W.2d 418 (1971).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-5\">[Courts] have repeatedly refused to \u2018denigrate jury trials by afterwards ransacking the jurors in search of some new ground, not previously supported by evidence, for a new trial.\u2019 Prohibiting post-verdict interviews protects the jury from an effort to find grounds for post-verdict charges of misconduct, reduces the \u2018chances and temptations\u2019 for tampering with the jury, increases the certainty of . . . trials, and spares the district courts time-consuming and futile proceedings. We have therefore uniformly refused to upset the denial of leave to interview jurors for the purpose of obtaining evidence of improprieties in the deliberations unless specific evidence of misconduct was shown by testimony or affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-6\"><em>Haeberle, </em>739 F.2d at 1021 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">The Defendant claims that he has been deprived of the means to uncover jury misconduct. However, there is no allegation of juror misconduct in the case nor showing of specific instances of juror misconduct. We decline to disturb the trial court\u2019s order restricting the attorneys\u2019 contact with the jurors after the trial. The order does not infringe upon news gathering, the rights of the attorneys to talk to anyone else besides the jurors, or jury contact by other persons besides the litigants in this case. <em>See State v. Bassett, </em>128 Wn.2d 612, 911 P.2d 385 (1996) (gag order forbidding attorneys in a judicial proceeding from communicating with anyone outside the court is an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech); <em>Journal Publ\u2019g Co. v.

The order is to protect the jurors privacy interests and we find that it was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Issues relating to sentences for assault and unlawful imprisonment</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The Defendant challenges his life sentence for second degree assault pursuant to the Persistent Offender Accountability Act and his 29-month sentence for unlawful imprisonment. The Defendant argues that he cannot be sentenced as a persistent offender unless he is charged with that \u201ccrime.\u201d This argument, however, was rejected in <em>State v. Thorne, </em>129 Wn.2d 736, 921 P.2d 514 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">The Defendant also argues that the assault and the unlawful imprisonment convictions encompassed the same criminal conduct. Under the \u201cconcurrent sentence doctrine,\u201d an appellate court has discretion not to consider the validity of multiple convictions when concurrent sentences are imposed. <em>State v. Schneider, </em>36 Wn. App. 237, 240, 673 P.2d 200 (1983). Courts will not speculate as to possible or remote collateral consequences of sentencing. <em>State v. Bowman, </em>36 Wn. App. 798, 807, 678 P.2d 1273 (1984).

Unlike a civil case, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>may not test a jury\u2019s apparent improvident acquittal against a substantial, or even overwhelming, evidence standard. Indeed the annals of the criminal justice system are replete with jury acquittals returned notwithstanding overwhelming evidence of guilt. Since it is simply not our legal prerogative to reverse an acquittal for lack of eviden-tiary support, it seems inconsistent to uphold a conviction notwithstanding manifest constitutional error based upon how we, as appellate judges, would weigh evidence offered by witnesses we have neither seen nor heard.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">But even assuming, hypothetically, overwhelming evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>dence of guilt is sufficient to render even so fundamental a constitutional error as this merely harmless, I see several debatable links in the chain which binds Finch to the conclusion that he is guilty of a double aggravated murder. Our law is clear that a constitutional error is presumed to be prejudicial and the state bears the burden of proving the error was harmless. <em>State v.

Rather it is the claim of this defendant that there was insufficient evidence, no evidence in fact, of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d so as to even merit presenting this aggravating factor to the jury for its deliberation. The law in this regard is sufficiently set forth by the majority at 835-37, to obviate the necessity of further citations to authority; however, suffice to say, rejecting defendant\u2019s insufficiency argument by \u201c[d]rawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the State,\u201d Majority at 836, is hardly proof positive of the reciprocal proposition, that there were no reasonable inferences upon which the jury could reject the conclusion that each of the two killings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>were connected by \u201ca larger criminal purpose.\u201d Majority at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">Nor is the conclusion that the homicide of Modlin \u201cwas committed in the course of, or in furtherance of, or in immediate flight from burglary in the first degree,\u201d forgone. Once again the majority analyzes the burglary aggravator in terms of whether there was \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to present the issue to the jury, Majority at 837, rather than whether there was reasonable basis for an argument to the contrary. In this regard the jury was instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-5\">A person commits the crime of burglary in the first degree when he or she enters or remains unlawfully in a dwelling with intent to commit a crime against a person or property therein, and if, in entering or while in the dwelling or in immediate flight therefrom, that person or an accomplice in the crime is armed with a deadly weapon or assaults any person therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">CP at 617 (Instruction No. 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Finch argued that he did not enter or remain \u201cunlawfully in a dwelling\u201d because he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-8\">was privileged to enter the trailer because Thelma had never acted to exclude him and because she did not refuse him permission to enter on the night of the incident. In fact, by asking him not to bring the beer inside because her mother was present on August 15, 1994, Thelma impliedly invited him to come inside without it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Br. of Appellant at 141-42.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, argues Finch, his entry into the trailer was not burglary and the aggravator was at least arguably not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Were the presumption of Finch\u2019s innocence not destroyed by the shackling, I cannot say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury would not have rejected both of these alleged aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">The conviction of Finch for the aggravated premeditated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>murder of Officer Kinard (Count II) may also have resulted from destruction of the presumption of innocence to which the accused is constitutionally entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Finch argued that the shot which took Kinard\u2019s life was random and reckless rather than premeditated.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The circumstances surrounding the killing at least lend some arguable basis for this claim since the distance between Finch and the officer was considerable for a pistol<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the view of the officer was arguably obscured.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, the aggravating factor regarding common scheme or plan, as previously discussed, is definitely problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Therefore, in a sense, I agree with the thrust of Justice Talmadge\u2019s dissent that it is \u201cillogical\u201d (Talmadge, J., dissenting op. at 877) to conclude that the shackling error was prejudicial when it came to the penalty phase yet harmless in the guilt phase, although, unlike Justice Talmadge, I would consistently find the error prejudicial on both counts, rather than neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">For these reasons I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial, and therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Johnson, J., concurs with Sanders, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b907-6\"><em>United States v.

The defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution is violated if the defendant appears before a jury in shackles or other restraints. Because restraints have implications as to a defendant\u2019s dangerousness, an appearance in restraints as we noted in <em>Hutchinson </em>may deprive a defendant of the presumption of innocence before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">We have also noted, however, this right is not absolute. A trial court has broad discretion to determine if a defendant\u2019s conduct is so dangerous or disruptive as to require restraints in the courtroom. <em>State v. Breedlove, </em>79 Wn. App. 101, 113-14, 900 P.2d 586 (1995). In the seminal case <em>State v. Hartzog, </em>96 Wn.2d 383, 400, 635 P.2d 694 (1981), we enunciated the factors a trial court must consider before a defendant may be restrained in court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-6\">[T]he seriousness of the present charge against the defendant; defendant\u2019s temperament and character;<footnotemark>[24]</footnotemark> his age and physical attributes; his past record; past escapes or attempted escapes, and evidence of a present plan to escape; threats to harm others or cause a disturbance; self-destructive tendencies; the risk of mob violence or of attempted revenge by others; the possibility of rescue by other offenders still at large; the size and mood of the audience; the nature and physical security of the courtroom; and the adequacy and availability of alternative remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">By this time, trial courts should be well aware the <em>Hartzog </em>factors require an individualized assessment on the record of the necessity for restraint of a defendant in a courtroom proceeding. This is not a decision that can be delegated by the trial court to correctional personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>In the present case, there were ample grounds supporting an individualized decision that Charles Finch should be restrained at trial. Neither we nor the trial court should be oblivious to the fact Finch was charged with a double murder. He had a history of convictions for five prior felonies including manslaughter and assault with a dangerous weapon. Moreover, in the process of arresting Finch for these crimes, law enforcement personnel attempted to subdue him with tear gas. Despite the tear gas, three deputy sheriffs were required to subdue him. The trial court noted, \u201cAnd the Court was aware of two of those officers as being very strong, very large deputy sheriffs.\u201d Report of Proceedings (Remand) at 1. Finch is a large man who made threats to his wife in the course of the alleged crime. He took his ex-wife and her elderly mother as hostages. Armed, Finch kept law enforcement personnel at hay by shooting indiscriminately in their direction. Finch, while incarcerated, attempted suicide. The proposed jury room for trial was relatively small, giving Finch ready access to some of the witnesses, including his ex-wife against whom he had expressed violent feelings. All of these individualized factors supported the use of restraints under the <em>Hartzog </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">The trial court here erred, however, because it did not undertake the individualized assessment of Finch\u2019s situation <em>Hartzog </em>requires. Contemporaneous consideration on the record of the <em>Hartzog </em>factors for the particular defendant is required to avoid error and a deprivation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to appear before the jury unrestrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">A. HARMLESS ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">The key consideration in this case, and why I depart from the majority\u2019s analysis, is the majority\u2019s failure to apply harmless error analysis. In <em>Hutchinson, </em>we made it clear a harmless error analysis applies to the question of restraint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-8\">A claim of unconstitutional shackling is subject to harmless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>error analysis. In order to succeed on his claim, the Defendant must show the shackling had a substantial or injurious effect or influence on the jury\u2019s verdict. Because the jury never saw the Defendant in shackles, he cannot show prejudice. <em>Rhoden v. Rowland, </em>10 F.3d 1457, 1459-60 (9th Cir. 1993). The Defendant does not argue persuasively that he was prejudiced in any way by the unseen restraints. Accordingly, we hold any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>109 F.3d 1413, 1418 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 870 (1997).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-5\"><em>Hutchinson, </em>135 Wn.2d at 888. The majority simply ignores <em>Hutchinson </em>by failing to do a harmless error analysis of the restraints on Finch during the sentencing phase. All the majority does is conclusorily decide any restraints constitute prejudice and are never harmless error: \u201cUndeniably, the presence of Mr. Finch in physical restraints indicated to the jury that his character is dangerous and prejudiced him in such a manner that warrants a reversal of his death sentence.\u201d Majority op. at 865.1 disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">After finding Finch guilty of aggravated first degree murder, the jury had to decide whether to sentence Finch to death or life in prison without the possibility of release or parole. These were the only two sentences allowed under RCW 10.95.030.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The majority decides the presence of restraints impermissibly induced the jury to choose the death penalty because the restraints indicated to the jury Finch was too dangerous to be turned loose on the prison population.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">This conclusion requires a substantial suspension of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>disbelief. It requires one to assume that uppermost in the jurors\u2019 minds when they were considering whether to sentence Finch either to death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was his future dangerousness to the prison population to which he would be exposed for the rest of his life.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>1 do not believe it plausible that solicitude for the safety of imprisoned criminals persuaded the jury to impose the death sentence on Finch.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Equally implausible is the majority\u2019s notion that but for the appearance of restraints on Finch, the jury would not have voted for the death penalty. Having found him guilty of aggravated first degree murder, the jury knew the following information about Finch: He admitted he had been planning to kill Modlin, a blind man who was essentially defenseless, for three months. 1 Trial Report of Proceedings at 64. He ambushed and killed a police officer for no reason other than \u201cI don\u2019t like the lousy cops.\u201d 1 Trial Report of Proceedings at 92. He was without remorse, as exemplified by his statement in a letter: \u201cI\u2019m just sorry that I didn\u2019t finish the job I started.\u201d 11 Trial Report of Proceedings at 1984. He had committed violent crimes in the past, including manslaughter, first degree rape, and assault with a dangerous weapon, as well as two burglaries. 14 Trial Report of Proceedings at 2466. In spite of all that, the majority holds it was only the appearance of Finch in restraints that impermissibly planted the seed in the jurors\u2019 heads that Finch might be a dangerous man, causing the jury to choose the sentence of death, rather than life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The majority\u2019s refusal to consider harmless error is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>inexplicable. After engaging in a harmless error analysis to uphold the guilty verdict in the guilt phase, despite the jurors\u2019 knowledge of the restraints on Finch, the majority rejects a similar harmless error analysis for the penalty phase verdict, giving as a reason for doing so only that \u201c[t]he evidence considered during the special sentencing proceeding is of a more subjective nature dealing with not only the nature of the crimes involved but also with personal history and the character of the Defendant.\u201d Majority op. at 863. The majority\u2019s approach is illogical. If Finch\u2019s restraint during the guilt phase, when the jury had yet to decide Finch was actually guilty, was harmless error, how can the presence of restraints during the sentencing phase not also be harmless?</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">Moreover, while it is true that consideration of mitigating factors during the capital sentencing phase calls for a \u201creasoned moral response,\u201d <em>In re Personal Restraint of Rupe, </em>115 Wn.2d 379, 387, 798 P.2d 780 (1990) (quoting <em>California v. Brown, </em>479 U.S. 538, 545, 107 S. Ct. 837, 93 L. Ed. 2d 934 (1987) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)), the majority offers no clue as to why this makes a difference in concluding we should not even do a harmless error analysis. The mere presence of some subjectivity in the sentencing decision does not logically compel the majority\u2019s tendentious conclusion.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Indeed, if we do the analysis, we may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>conclude the error was not harmless, but we should at least do the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The majority\u2019s refusal to apply a harmless error analysis here is contrary to a huge body of law allowing it. The United States Supreme Court \u201chas recognized that most constitutional errors can be harmless.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Fulmi-nante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 306, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991). The rule is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-6\">[I]f the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other errors that may have occurred are subject to harmless-error analysis. The thrust of the many constitutional rules governing the conduct of criminal trials is to ensure that those trials lead to fair and correct judgments. Where a reviewing court can find that the record developed at trial establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the interest in fairness has been satisfied and the judgment should be affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-7\"><em>Rose v.

Caldwell, </em>94 Wn.2d 614, 618, 618 P.2d 508 (1980), and the State bears the burden of proving harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Guloy, </em>104 Wn.2d 412, 425, 705 P.2d 1182 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>U.S. 1020, 106 S. Ct. 1208, 89 L. Ed. 2d 321 (1986). Most directly on point, however, is <em>Hutchinson, </em>where we said, <em>\u201cA </em>claim of unconstitutional shackling is subject to harmless error analysis. In order to succeed on his claim, the Defendant must show the shackling had a substantial or injurious effect or influence on the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Hutchinson, </em>135 Wn.2d at 888. Despite <em>Hutchinson, </em>the majority simply concludes restraints always have a \u201csubstantial or injurious effect,\u201d irredeemably prejudicing the jurors, hardening their hearts and implacably impelling them to the death penalty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Also missing from the majority opinion is a discussion of constitutional law. Where was the constitutional error here? Finch had no presumption of innocence at the sentencing hearing. The majority identifies no constitutional infirmity and does not say what constitutional right Finch was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Because the majority does not permit a harmless error analysis, it establishes the principle that no matter how heinous a crime, no matter how certain the guilt, in all circumstances, without exception, if during the sentencing phase of a trial the jury learns the defendant is being physically restrained, the defendant is deprived of some right, the verdict is irretrievably tainted, and a retrial of the sentencing phase must occur. While such a conclusion may obtain, absent harmless error, for the <em>guilt </em>phase of a trial,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> during which the accused is presumed innocent until the verdict of guilty is actually pronounced, it is totally incomprehensible for the <em>penalty </em>phase, where the presumption of innocence no longer exists for the now-convicted murderer awaiting sentencing. <em>Commonwealth v. Edmiston, </em>535 Pa. 210, 634 A.2d 1078, 1089 (1993) (\u201c[Pjresumption of innocence which accompanies the accused throughout the proceedings to determine his guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>has no direct application to the sentencing determination.\u201d).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As the Utah Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-4\">This presumption [of innocence] no longer applies during the penalty phase of a capital trial. Indeed, a jury sitting at a penalty phase recently found the defendant guilty of first degree murder during the guilt phase of the trial. As a result, the constitutional foundation for the right to be free from shackles or other restraint no longer exists, and we accord greater significance to public safety concerns. Where the defendant has already lost the presumption of innocence, it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to determine the safety measures necessary to insure the security of the courtroom and its occupants. These safety measures may include shackling a defendant in appropriate circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-5\"><em>State v. Young, </em>853 P.2d 327, 350 (Utah 1993) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">The majority cites only one case <em>Elledge v. Dugger, </em>823 F.2d 1439 (11th Cir. 1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 1014, 108 S. Ct. 1487, 99 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1988), to support its proposition that the presence of physical restraints during the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial always requires a retrial, and that harmless error analysis does not apply. <em>Elledge </em>is in fact the <em>only </em>case that so holds. All other courts to have considered the presence of physical restraints on convicted murderers during sentencing proceedings disagree with Elledge.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">First among those decisions was the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Elledge v. State, </em>408 So. 2d 1021 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 981, 103 S. Ct. 316, 74 L. Ed. 2d 293 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>(1982).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> There, the trial judge ordered the convicted defendant to wear leg irons during the death penalty hearing after learning the defendant had stated his intention to attack the bailiff, and was proficient in karate. The Florida Supreme Court, after noting the presumption of innocence attaches to an accused person, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">But appellant did not stand before the sentencing jury as an innocent man; rather he stood as a confessed murderer of three persons. The critical issue in a restraint case is the degree of prejudice caused by the restraints. Here, we can find very little prejudice since the appellant was an avowed dangerous individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1022-23. Likewise, Finch was a convicted double murderer, a \u201cdangerous individual\u201d by any measure, at his sentencing hearing. It is difficult to understand how his jurors could have been first inclined to sentence him to life in prison but then changed their minds and unanimously sentenced him to death upon discovering he was wearing Velcro ankle restraints. But the majority, following its one, lonely case, <em>Elledge, </em>does not permit considerations of prejudice, despite the <em>Hutchinson </em>holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">In <em>Bowers v. State, </em>306 Md. 120, 507 A.2d 1072, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 890, 107 S. Ct. 292, 93 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986), Maryland\u2019s highest court held the trial court had not abused its discretion by ordering a convicted murderer to wear leg irons during his death penalty sentencing hearing. Similarly to the Florida Supreme Court in <em>Elledge, </em>the <em>Bowers </em>court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-8\">In this case there is no presumption of innocence because Bowers was convicted at the earlier trial and we affirmed on appeal. He stands in the position of a convicted felon brought before a trial court for sentencing. He thus is unlike the ordinary defendant who at trial stands clothed with a presumption of innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1078. After a lengthy, scholarly review of the history of restraining accuseds at trial, the court concluded Bowers was not prejudiced by the restraints, and the trial court had not abused its discretion in ordering it. <em>Id. </em>at 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">A subsequent Maryland case reaffirmed the reasoning of the <em>Bowers </em>decision. In <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 583 A.2d 218 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 835, 112 S. Ct. 117, 116 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1991), upholding the trial court\u2019s restraint of a convicted murderer during the death penalty sentencing hearing, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-6\">Shackling a defendant during the guilt/innocence phase of trial is inherently prejudicial because it highlights the \u201cneed to separate a defendant from the community at large. ...\u201d <em>Holbrook v. Flynn, </em>475 U.S. at 569, 106 S. Ct. at 1346, 89 L. Ed. 2d at 534. This concern is not as great during the sentencing hearing. It is clear that the defendant will be separated from the community. The only issue is whether the defendant will receive the death penalty or life imprisonment. The defendant\u2019s guilt of first degree murder is established and the jury is less likely to be prejudiced by the defendant\u2019s appearance in leg irons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 228. Once again, a court, unlike <em>Elledge </em>and the majority, has taken into account prejudice to the convicted murderer in its determination of the propriety of physical restraints during a death penalty sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">Two state courts have specifically addressed the holding of <em>Elledge </em>and rejected it. The Nevada Supreme Court in <em>Duckett v. State, </em>104 Nev. 6, 752 P.2d 752 (1988), held a trial court did not commit reversible error by refusing Duckett\u2019s request to he free of manacles and prison garb during the sentencing phase of his trial. As had other courts, <em>Duckett </em>noted a convicted murderer\u2019s constitutional right to appear in court in street clothes does not exist at a postconviction sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 755. In <em>State v. Young, </em>853 P.2d 327, 350 n.95 (Utah 1993), the Utah Supreme Court noted, \u201cA jury may expect that a person it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>has just found guilty of murder will be restrained in some fashion.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The court went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-5\">Further, defendant has shown no prejudice resulting from the shackling. Aside from showing that some jurors briefly viewed the shackles, defendant has offered no evidence of the effect of the shackles upon the jurors or of the likelihood that the shackles had a bearing on the verdict. A defendant is not necessarily prejudiced when jurors briefly view him wearing shackles.<footnotemark>[35]</footnotemark> The trial court took steps to minimize the effects of the shackles by placing them underneath defendant\u2019s coat and by having those present remain seated while the court and the jurors entered the room. Therefore, the effect of the shackles did not likely prejudice defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 351 (footnote omitted). Again, a court took possible prejudice into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">In <em>Duckett v. Godinez, </em>67 F.3d 734 (9th Cir. 1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1158, 116 S. Ct. 1549, 134 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1996), the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered Duckett\u2019s habeas corpus petition and addressed the restraint question. The court largely adopted <em>Elledge, </em>with one important exception: it asked if Duckett had been prejudiced by shackling, and adopted a harmless error analysis for the determination. <em>Id. </em>at 749 (remanding for evidentiary hearing on the issue of prejudice).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AofU\">In summary, the majority ignores our recently reaffirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>rule in <em>Hutchinson </em>and adopts a singular minority case as authority for its conclusion we should not review the restraint of Finch during the sentencing phase of his trial for harmless error. In so doing, it elevates form over substance. In the words of the United States Supreme Court, the harmless error rule \u201c \u2018promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose, </em>478 U.S. at 577 (quoting <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986)). There was no unfairness to Finch. The majority\u2019s approach here will not promote public respect for the criminal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">B. REFERENCE HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"awi-dedup-0\">Turning to the question of whether there was any error at all in this case, we ordered the unusual procedure of a reference hearing in a direct appeal. Specifically, we directed two questions to the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-6\">(1) Was it possible for the jury to see that the Defendant was restrained when entering, leaving or sitting in the hearing room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-7\">(2) If the restraints were not visible, was it possible for the jury to know that the Defendant was restrained in some way based on the restriction of the Defendant\u2019s movements?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Washington State Supreme Court Order, Feb. 20, 1998. The trial court conducted an April 9, 1998 hearing on this question and answered both questions directed by us in the negative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-9\">1. At the hearing on April 27, 1995, it was not possible for the jurors to see that the Defendant [sic] was restrained when he was entering, leaving, or sitting in the hearing room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-10\">2. At that hearing, the defendant\u2019s movements were not restricted in any way that would make it possible for the jurors to know that the defendant was restrained. It is possible that some of the jurors may have speculated that he was restrained, but it is not possible that any of them knew.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">Rather than relying on the trial court\u2019s enunciated find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>ings of fact, the majority chooses instead to parse out sentences in the trial court\u2019s <em>oral </em>ruling in order to discredit the trial court\u2019s findings. Even though the trial court found \u201cit is not possible that any of [the jury] knew\u201d Finch was in Velcro leg restraints, the majority \u201cfinds\u201d just the opposite: \u201cit was clearly possible that the jury could have known that the Defendant was restrained.\u201d Majority op. at 857. And based on the mere <em>possibility </em>the jury knew of the restraints, as opposed to the jury\u2019s <em>actual knowledge </em>of the restraints, the majority decides to remand this case for a retrial of the sentencing phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Frankly, I find this appellate court fact-finding offensive to the trial judge. We asked the trial court to hold a hearing and make findings of fact in answer to two specific questions. This was done. Now the majority decides the trial court did not know what it was talking about because of what the majority decides are inconsistent statements in the oral ruling. Nobody on this court knows what the Ginni Stevens Hearing Room in the Snohomish County Courthouse looked like or even how it was arranged for the Finch proceedings. The trial court judge in this case does. Nevertheless, the majority decides not to believe him. A decent respect for the work of our trial court judges should preclude such tendentious second-guessing of their findings of fact where those findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Plainly, the trial court, with the benefit of the witnesses, demonstrations, and its own consideration of the factual circumstances of this case including actual, personal knowledge of the layout of the courtroom, determined the jury would not have seen Finch\u2019s restraints before defense counsel specifically requested the trial court remove any skirting around the counsel table so the jury could see the restraints on the defendant. Until that time, the restraints were not visible to the jury. The majority presumes to substitute its understanding of the facts for the trial court\u2019s, even though the trial court was obviously in a better position to see and understand the circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>physical layout of the courtroom. What substantial evidence supporting its own findings of fact does the majority rely upon?</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Given the majority\u2019s analysis of the harmless error question, some might believe the majority had already determined any form of restraint of a criminal defendant during trial is per se prejudicial error in Washington. If so, then the special reference hearing we ordered the trial court to conduct was meaningless window dressing and a waste of everybody\u2019s time.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The general rule trial courts should follow is that physical restraints of defendants are the exception and not the rule. If there are clear security concerns regarding a defendant\u2019s presence in the courtroom, the trial court must undertake the individualized assessment of the circumstances required by <em>Hartzog </em>and undertake such an analysis on the record before ordering any kind of physical restraint of the defendant in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">At the same time, courts cannot be oblivious to the realities of courtroom security. I am not so confident as the majority Finch was no threat simply because he had not <em>recently </em>expressed any violent tendencies or been a security problem. We should not announce a rule that requires trial court judges to wait until a defendant on trial commits a violent act in the courtroom before physical restraints may be considered. Rather, we should leave such evaluations to the discretion of the trial court judge, who, after all, is ultimately responsible for the safety of jurors, court personnel, and spectators, and review such evaluations only for abuse of discretion. It is easy to decide in our Olympian detachment, long after the fact and far from the courtroom, that an accused murderer posed no threat to anyone; it is not so easy to make such decisions when one is personally responsible\u2014right now, on the spot\u2014for preventing harm to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">When the majority can believe a large man who has previously committed violent acts, including manslaughter, first degree rape, and assault with a deadly weapon, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>was on trial for aggravated first degree murder after killing two people including a blind man and a police officer, who took hostages in the course of the crimes, who had threatened a key witness in the case, who had attempted suicide, and who, despite a discharged tear gas canister in a trailer, required three armed deputies to subdue him is not a person about whom the trial court judge could have security concerns, I express little wonder the public finds the judiciary so often out of touch with reality. I would affirm the judgment on the verdict of the jury, both as to Finch\u2019s culpability and as to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Durham, J., and Dolliver, J. Pro Tern., concur with Tal-MADGE, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[24]\">\n<p id=\"b911-8\">24The majority opinion disregards this factor. Finch premeditated and in cold blood shot a blind man in the head, and then murdered a deputy sheriff from ambush. He was charged with aggravated first degree murder and the State sought the death penalty. Nevertheless, the majority says at 851, astoundingly, \u201c[T]he crimes charged in this case do not warrant physical restraints.\u201d One may well wonder what crimes, in the majority\u2019s view, <em>would </em>be serious enough to warrant physical restraints. The majority\u2019s statement here effectively abrogates the first of the <em>Hartzog </em>factors. If indeed the majority wishes to overrule this part of <em>Hartzog, </em>it should say so explicitly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b913-8\">The Legislature enacted very strong language to ensure one convicted of aggravated first degree murder shall never leave prison. RCW 10.95.030(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-9\">Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, any person convicted of the crime of aggravated first degree murder shall be sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of release or parole. A person sentenced to life imprisonment under this section shall not have that sentence suspended, deferred, or commuted by any judicial officer and the indeterminate sentence review board or its successor may not parole such prisoner nor reduce the period of confinement in any manner whatsoever including but not limited to any sort of good-time calculation. The department of social and health services or its successor or any executive official may not permit such prisoner to participate in any sort of release or furlough program.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Notably, Finch himself did not argue to the jury he posed no danger to the prison population. Finch may well have concluded such an argument coming from a double murderer is so absurd it would have angered the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b914-8\">Although we held in <em>State v. Gentry, </em>125 Wn.2d 570, 641, 888 P.2d 1105, <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 843, 116 S. Ct. 131, 133 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1995), as an evidentiary matter, \u201cit was not unreasonable for the prosecuting attorney to argue that the Defendant is a dangerous person who would continue to present a danger even while incarcerated[,]\u201d I deem it highly unlikely that such considerations would sway a sentencing jury one way or the other after it had already found a defendant guilty of aggravated first degree murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b915-5\">That some element of subjectivity enters into a jury\u2019s deliberations during the penalty phase is inevitable. Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court has admonished the states to observe strict procedures to avoid caprice in sentencing. As we said in <em>State v. Dodd, </em>120 Wn.2d 1, 13-14 n.2, 838 P.2d 86 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-6\">The Eighth Amendment, which prohibits \u201ccruel and unusual punishments\u201d, applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Robinson v. California, </em>370 U.S. 660, 8 L. Ed. 2d 758, 82 S. Ct. 1417 (1962). Infliction of the death penalty especially invokes the concerns of the Eighth Amendment because the penally is irrevocable. <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 306, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346, 388, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 2760 (1972). The Supreme Court, therefore, imposes procedural and substantive restrictions on legislatures and sentencing authorities, to ensure that \u201ccapital punishment is not imposed without . . . serious and calm reflection . . . .\u201d <em>Thompson v. Oklahoma, </em>487 U.S. 815, 856, 101 L. Ed. 2d 702, 733, 108 S. Ct. 2687, 2710 (1988). The sentencing scheme must not allow the death penalty to be wantonly or freakishly imposed, it must direct and limit jury discretion, to minimize the risk of arbitrary or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>capricious action, and it must allow particularized consideration of relevant aspects of the character and record of each defendant, and the circumstances of the offense, before imposition of the sentence. <em>Gregg v.
