It made this finding after having observed firsthand the testimony of the defendant and his former counsel. According these findings the appropriate deference due them, we discern no basis to disturb the hearing court\u2019s determination that the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty was motivated by a desire to avail himself of an extremely advantageous plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Moreover, defendant has failed to demonstrate that the claimed misadvice, even if it had been rendered, would constitute ineffective assistance of counsel as the record fails to show any merit to the alleged speedy trial violation <em>(see, People v Robideau, </em>133 AD2d 903, <em>lv denied </em>71 NY2d 902; <em>People v Divine, </em>193 AD2d 562, <em>lv denied </em>82 NY2d 717; <em>People v Minors, </em>189 AD2d 899; <em>People v De Gaspard, </em>170 AD2d 835, <em>lv denied </em>77 NY2d 994; <em>cf., People v Jackson, </em>224 AD2d 330; <em>People v O\u2019Connell, </em>133 AD2d 970).
