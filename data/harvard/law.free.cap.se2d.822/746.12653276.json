For a more detailed description of the facts underlying Defendant's convictions, refer to this Court's prior opinion in\n   <em>\n    Byers I\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for post-conviction DNA testing on 31 July 2017. In his motion, Defendant asserted that he was on the other side of town waiting for a bus when the attack on Ms. Burke occurred. Defendant further alleged that one of the State's witnesses testified she saw Defendant getting on the 9:00 p.m. city bus on the night of the\n   events in question. Defendant alleged that a private investigator swore in an affidavit that it would have been impossible for Defendant to arrive at Ms. Burke's apartment prior to the alleged 911 call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant further stated in his motion that, when he arrived at Ms. Burke's apartment, he noticed the \"back door smashed in.\" Defendant also asserted that he went inside the apartment to investigate and was attacked by a man wearing a plaid jacket. The two men struggled, which Defendant argues explains the presence of his DNA throughout the apartment. Defendant stated he lost his balance during the attack and fell, allowing the assailant to escape. Defendant argues that, because both he and Ms. Burke struggled with the unknown assailant, DNA testing of his and Ms. Burke's previously untested clothing would reveal the identity of the actual perpetrator. Defendant noted that the State's DNA expert reported the presence of human blood in various locations throughout Ms. Burke's apartment that did not match either Defendant or Ms. Burke; however, this information was not introduced at trial. Defendant further requested that the items of clothing be preserved and that an inventory of the evidence be prepared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court entered an order dated 3 August 2017 denying Defendant's motion. The trial court held that Defendant had failed to sufficiently allege how DNA testing of the requested items would be \"material to his defense.\" Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The issues Defendant argues are that the trial court erred in denying his motion for post-conviction DNA testing: (1) \"prior to obtaining and reviewing the statutorily required inventory of evidence\" collected during the criminal investigation, and (2) \"before appointing counsel when [his] motion for such testing establishe[d] that ... [D]efendant [was] indigent and that the testing may be material to his defense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Denial of Motion Prior to Inventory of Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred by denying his motion for postconviction DNA testing before obtaining and reviewing the statutorily required and requested inventory of physical and biological evidence collected during the criminal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   1. Appellate Jurisdiction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Initially, the State responds by arguing Defendant \"lacks the right to appeal\" the denial of a motion to locate and preserve evidence under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7A-27(b)(1) and N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-270.1. The State\n   further argues that Defendant failed to preserve this issue for appellate review by failing to obtain a ruling on the motion as required by N.C. R. App. P 10(a)(1), that \"ordinarily results in waiver of appellate review of the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    In re B.E.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8159698\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/186/656/#p657\">\n    186 N.C. App. 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 657,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12639693\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/652/344/#p345\">\n    652 S.E.2d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 345 (2007). However, the State misconstrues Defendant's argument. Defendant does not argue, as the State contends, that the trial court erred by failing to order the preservation and inventory of the requested evidence. Instead, Defendant argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for post-conviction DNA testing prior to receiving the inventory of evidence. Therefore, this case is distinguishable from the case cited by the State,\n   <em>\n    State v. Doisey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=240%20N.C.%20App.%20441\">\n    240 N.C. App. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=770%20S.E.2d%20177\">\n    770 S.E.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), where this Court dismissed a defendant's argument that the trial court erred in failing to order the inventory of biological evidence.\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-270.1 (2017) explicitly states that \"[t]he defendant may appeal an order denying the defendant's motion for DNA testing under this Article, including by an interlocutory appeal.\" Therefore, appeal was the proper avenue for reversing the trial court's order, and Defendant preserved this issue for appellate review by appealing the denial of his motion for post-conviction DNA testing. Defendant has also filed a petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   for review of this issue. However, having found that Defendant's appeal is proper under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-270.1, we deny his petition as unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2. Procedure for the Inventory of Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In order to fully analyze Defendant's argument, we must consider the statutory procedure for requesting an inventory of evidence and the role of the inventory within the post-conviction DNA testing statute. The statutory procedure for compiling an inventory of evidence is set out in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-268(a7), which requires custodial agencies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon written request by the defendant, the custodial agency shall prepare an inventory of biological evidence relevant to the defendant's case that is in the custodial agency's custody. If the evidence was destroyed through court order or other written directive, the custodial agency shall provide the defendant with a copy of the court order or written directive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-268(a7). N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-269(f) (2017) similarly requires: \"Upon receipt of a motion for postconviction DNA testing, the custodial agency shall inventory the evidence pertaining to that case and provide the inventory list, as well as any documents, notes, logs, or\n   reports relating to the items of physical evidence, to the prosecution, the petitioner, and the court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant's argument that the trial court erred by denying his motion for postconviction DNA testing prior to obtaining an inventory of evidence was recently addressed by this Court in\n   <em>\n    State v. Tilghman\n   </em>\n   , --- N.C. App. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12652744\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/821/253/\">\n    821 S.E.2d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204700630\">\n    2018 WL 4700630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (filed 2 October 2018). In\n   <em>\n    Tilghman\n   </em>\n   , the defendant made similar arguments under both N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-268(a7) and N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-269(f), that the trial court erred by denying his motion for post-conviction DNA testing prior to receiving an inventory of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Tilghman\n   </em>\n   , --- N.C. App. at ----, 821 S.E.2d at ----. In\n   <em>\n    Tilghman\n   </em>\n   , this Court, addressed both statutes in turn, rejected the defendant's arguments and found no error in the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addressing N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-268(a7),\n   <em>\n    Tilghman\n   </em>\n   held the trial court \"did not err in denying [d]efendant's motion for postconviction DNA testing prior to obtaining an inventory of biological evidence which [d]efendant never requested, and we must dismiss this argument.... Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   [d]efendant properly requested an inventory of biological evidence, case law would bind us to dismiss this argument.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204700630\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12652744\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/821/253/\">\n    821 S.E.2d at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted) (citing\n   <em>\n    Doisey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=240%20N.C.%20App.%20441\">\n    240 N.C.

Unlike the defendants in both\n   <em>\n    Tilghman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Doisey\n   </em>\n   , Defendant in the present case clearly filed a written request for an inventory of biological evidence. While Defendant's motion was titled a \"Request for Post-Conviction DNA Testing,\" on page fourteen of his motion, Defendant specifically states: \"Defendant also request [sic] the court to order preservation, preparation of the evidence and its inventory.\" Defendant's motion cites to both N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-268(a7) and N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-269(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   However, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Randall\n   </em>\n   , --- N.C. App. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12651537\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/817/219/#p222\">\n    817 S.E.2d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 222 (2018) this Court addressed the requirements of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-268(a7) and held that the written request for an inventory of evidence must be directed to the custodial agency. This Court held that, without evidence in the record that the defendant made a proper request under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-268(a7), there was no ruling for this Court to consider and that defendant's appeal must be dismissed. Similarly, the record in the case before us is devoid of any evidence indicating Defendant ever made a request to a custodial agency; therefore, Defendant was not entitled to an inventory of the evidence under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-268(a7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addressing N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-269, this Court in\n   <em>\n    Tilghman\n   </em>\n   held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The statute is silent as to whether a defendant or the trial court bears the burden of serving the motion for inventory on the custodial agency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Here, the record lacks proof either Defendant or the trial court served the custodial agency with the motion for inventory. Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   it is the trial court's burden to serve the custodial agency with the motion, any error by the court below [in denying the defendant's motion for postconviction DNA testing prior to receiving the inventory] is harmless error. As held\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Defendant failed to meet his burden of showing materiality. Accordingly, the trial [court] did not err by denying his motion for DNA testing prior to an inventory under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-269(f).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Tilghman,\n   </em>\n   --- N.C.

As discussed below, Defendant in the present case, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Tilghman\n   </em>\n   , met his burden of showing materiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   3.

Whether the requested evidence is still in the possession of the custodial agency is immaterial to the trial court's determination under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-269(b).
