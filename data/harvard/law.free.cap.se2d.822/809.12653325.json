RUSSELL\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is an appeal by a railroad corporation from a judgment in favor of one of its employees in an action brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (\"FELA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2051\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   through - 59, as amended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In accordance with familiar principles of appellate review, the facts will be stated in the light most favorable to the prevailing party at trial. Mark A. Sumner (the plaintiff) was an employee of Norfolk Southern Railway Company (the defendant), a corporation operating a railroad as a common carrier in interstate commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 26, 2013, the plaintiff was working as the conductor of a northbound Norfolk Southern freight train running from Greensboro, North Carolina through Danville, Virginia and points north. The temperature was in the 30's and it was cloudy with light mist or rain. The yardmaster at Greensboro warned the train's engineer, Teddy Lester, that some ice might be encountered farther north. The engineer had orders to proceed through the railroad yard at Danville and stop at a point about two miles north of the yard where a side track called the \"East Bradley pass track\" diverged from the northbound main line. The train crew was directed to make a \"cut,\" a designated series of cars that were to be separated from the train and left on the side track to be picked up by another locomotive later for delivery to a nearby destination. The train's remaining cars were then to be reunited on the main line and continue northbound. The train was stopped on the main line at a point where the last car of the \"cut\" was just south of the switch to the side track.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As conductor, the plaintiff's duties required him to separate the last car of the \"cut\" from those to be left on the main line, to board the last car of the \"cut,\" and, using his hand-held radio, to call the engineer to proceed. The locomotive then pulled the \"cut\" north of the switch to the side track and stopped on the conductor's signal. This part of the operation was performed without incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, the evidence is entirely circumstantial as to the fall that resulted in the plaintiff's injury. The plaintiff had no memory of the event and there were no eyewitnesses to the fall. The conductor's duties required him to dismount the last car in the \"cut\" and walk south, away from the locomotive, turning off an electric timing device on the switch, and continue walking south nearly 200 feet to release the \"derail,\" a protective device to prevent movement of cars on the side track. He would then return north to throw the switch and call the engineer to back the \"cut\" onto the side track.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the plaintiff dismounted and began to walk south, the engineer expected a radio\n   call from him but heard nothing. He called the plaintiff but there was no response. Concerned, he dismounted the locomotive and began walking south in the \"walk path\" that ran east of and parallel to the side track. Close to the east edge of the path was a steep embankment that dropped down a 70-degree slope into a ravine. Looking over the edge of the embankment, the engineer saw movement and recognized the plaintiff lying about 36 feet below. The engineer climbed down to the plaintiff with some difficulty, using one hand to support himself. The plaintiff was lying on his back, with his head uphill. At trial, the engineer testified that the plaintiff was conscious but \"very disoriented.\" The plaintiff said: \"What are we doing here? What happened?\" He complained of great pain in his shoulder and chest. He had bitten through his tongue. Using the plaintiff's handheld radio, which was lying nearby, the engineer called the Danville Yardmaster who in turn called a team of paramedics to come to the scene. The team tied the plaintiff to a \"backboard,\" placed it inside a fiberglass \"sled,\" and with ropes pulling from above and men pushing from below, hoisted the plaintiff out of the ravine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff was taken to the Danville Medical Center where he was treated for his injuries. At trial, two medical expert witnesses testified by video deposition. Steven Norris, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon, diagnosed the plaintiff with a displaced fracture of the clavicle (i.e., collarbone) and three fractured ribs. This required surgery on two occasions: the first to realign the fragments of the clavicle, to secure them with a metal pin, and the second to remove the pin when healing was well advanced. David Meyer, M.D., a neurologist, diagnosed a brain concussion. It was his opinion that this had caused the plaintiff to suffer amnesia, which destroyed his memory of the traumatic event itself and for the events during the period of time immediately preceding and following it. In some patients, he said, fragmentary recollections of these events would occur in later years, but others would never recall them. He testified that brain scans showed no condition that would have caused the plaintiff to have a seizure or spontaneous \"blackout.\" The doctors found the plaintiff to be disabled by his injuries but able to return to work eight months after his fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff brought this action in the Circuit Court of the City of Danville to recover damages under the FELA for his injuries. The case culminated in a three-day jury trial wherein the jury found for the plaintiff and awarded him damages in the amount of $336,293. The court entered judgment on the verdict and we awarded the defendant an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, the plaintiff testified that he had no memory of any events after he dismounted the train to begin his walk south. He said: \"It's like somebody flipped a switch.\" He had no memory of his hospital stay. He testified that he later had a vague, dreamlike recollection of Teddy Lester, the engineer, looking down at him and of being placed on a \"backboard.\" He said that continuous, accurate memory did not begin again until he was in therapy in July, five months after the accident. As stated above, there were no eyewitnesses to the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiff called as an expert witness Raymond Duffany as an expert in \"railroad engineering practices, including track construction, inspection, maintenance and repair, especially with respect to railroad walkways.\" There was no objection to his qualifications. He had a degree in Civil Engineering and had been working in the railroad industry since 1975 as a construction engineer, an executive and as a safety consultant. He examined the scene of the accident in 2015, two years after the plaintiff's fall. He went over the scene with Terry Lester, the engineer, and examined depositions of other witnesses and photographs of the scene taken at the time of the accident. He concluded that the conditions he observed were substantially unchanged from those existing at the time of the plaintiff's fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The East Bradley pass track ran parallel to, and just east of the Norfolk Southern northbound main line. The terrain on the east side of the pass track sloped downhill at an angle of 20 degrees to the walkway the railroad provided for its employees to walk between the switch to the north and the derail to the south. The walkway ran along\n   the foot of this slope. The eastern edge of the walkway extended to a cliff that dropped at an angle of approximately seventy degrees into a ravine over 30 feet deep. No guardrail or other protection was provided to prevent falls into the ravine. Both tracks, the 20-degree slope down to the walkway, and the walkway itself, were covered with \"track ballast.\" These facts were undisputed at trial and were shown to the jury by photographs admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Duffany testified that, at the point where the plaintiff had evidently fallen and gone over the edge of the embankment, the walkway was only 15 inches wide. At the north end, beside the switch, it was about 48 inches wide, but rapidly narrowed to 15 inches and remained at that approximate width all the way south to the derail. In his opinion, those conditions did not afford railroad employees a safe place in which to work. He testified that safety standards accepted by railroads throughout the country specify a minimum width of 24 inches for walkways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He said that a walkway 24 inches wide \"gives you that extra margin you have to recover from a possible fall or an area [in which] to fall [ ] other than over the cliff.\" He said that this is especially important when walking over ballast rock \"which moves and tends to roll under foot traffic.\" A 24-inch walkway \"give[s] you an adequate place to walk [and] if you do stumble on the ballast or trip, you have room to recover.\" The grade of a walkway, he testified, should be relatively flat, not exceeding seven to eight degrees in slope. For that reason, the area west of the walkway was unavailable to foot traffic as it sloped upward at an angle of 20 degrees. This state of affairs confined users of the walkway to a narrow and unprotected passage between the toe of the slope and the edge of the cliff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Duffany also testified that the walkway was covered with \"track ballast,\" defined as large crushed rock pieces 2 to 2 \u00bd inches in diameter used to support and stabilize the main line of the railroad. This large ballast is unsafe for foot traffic because of its tendency to roll or slide underfoot. Instead, he said that smaller pieces of crushed rock should be used in railroad yards and on walkways. This material, called \"yard ballast,\" was about \u00be inch in diameter, compacted well, was stable, and made a smooth walking surface.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The FELA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2051\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , was enacted by Congress in 1908, and has since been amended to serve the humanitarian purpose of imposing on railroads engaged in interstate commerce as common carriers the duty to provide their employees a safe place to work.

The jurors were told that they could use their common sense in judging the evidence and could draw all reasonable inferences from it. They were also instructed that the defendant had a continuing duty to afford the plaintiff a reasonably safe place to work and to maintain and keep it in a safe condition. A failure to perform these duties was negligence. As instructions given without objection, these instructions became the law of the case.\n   <em>\n    Online Res. Corp. v.

Here, the defendant made no objection when Duffany was offered as an expert witness. Aside from a bare and conclusory assertion that Duffany's testimony exceeded the scope of his expertise, the defendant makes no argument and cites no authority to that effect on brief. That argument is therefore waived. Rule 5:27(d),\n   <em>\n    Palmer v.

The court overruled the objection. The defendant's opening brief expressly waives that objection on appeal. The only remaining assertion that Duffany made bearing on causation was the danger of 2 \u00bd inch pieces of ballast rock shifting underfoot, leading to stumbling, tripping and possible falling. The\n   defendant makes no challenge to this evidence on appeal. Moreover, to the extent that testimony fell outside the range of expert opinion, it was merely declaratory of matters within the common knowledge and experience of the jury. There is no error in permitting a witness to refer to such matters and the jury was expressly instructed that it could rely on its common sense in considering any testimony. Accordingly, we find no merit in the defendant's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   There were two issues before the jury, negligence and causation. The second assignment of error, like the first, does not address negligence. The jury's finding that the defendant was negligent in failing to provide the plaintiff a safe place to work is, for that reason, not before us. The second assignment of error presents the question whether the evidence was sufficient to create a jury issue with regard to causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In FELA cases, causation may be proved by circumstantial evidence alone and does not require direct evidence.\n   <em>\n    Norfolk &amp; W.

There was evidence to support the inference that the defendant's negligence played a part, however small, in causing the fall which was the source of the plaintiff's injury. The evidence may also have been sufficient to support an inference that the plaintiff's fall resulted from causes unrelated to the defendant's negligence. Under the settled principles governing FELA cases, that juxtaposition created a jury issue as to which inference should be drawn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lavender\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"413818\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/645/#p648\">\n    327 U.S. at 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"413818\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/645/#p648\">\n    66 S.Ct. 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Only when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support the conclusion reached does a reversible error appear.

Although the FELA has diluted the standard for\n   <em>\n    proximate\n   </em>\n   causation, a plaintiff must still prove \"but for\" causation. The plaintiff's theory was that the railroad was negligent in that it provided only 15 inches of level walkway instead of 24 inches, which, according to the plaintiff's expert, is the industry standard. The plaintiff theorized that the extra nine inches in width would have allowed the plaintiff to recover his step and avoid the fall. No evidence, however, supported this theory. No witness established where the plaintiff was standing or how he fell. There is, therefore, no basis in fact upon which a jury could draw an inference that the extra width would have spared the plaintiff from a fall, and the plaintiff thus failed to establish that \"but for\" the railroad's negligence, he would not have fallen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   I. THE FELA REQUIRES THE PLAINTIFF TO PROVE \"BUT FOR\" CAUSATION.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Causation is ordinarily a two-step inquiry. The first step is factual causation. \"The requirement of factual causation is often described as the 'but for' or\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   rule. Generally a person is not liable to another unless[,] but for his negligent act[,] the harm would not have occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Wells v.

Prosser, The Law of Torts 242 (3d ed. 1964) ). The second step is proximate causation. \"Proximate cause has been described as a shorthand descriptive phrase for the limits the law has placed upon an actor's responsibility for his conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20S.E.2d%20422\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Prosser,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 240). \"But for\" cause is a predicate of proximate cause; it does not add to proximate cause.

The plaintiff's expert was unable to provide a causal link between the narrowness of the walkway and Sumner's fall. He was asked the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. You have no idea what role, if any, that that walk path could have played, he could have been looking over his shoulder, he could have been distracted, he could have been not paying attention, you have no idea, all we know is that he was walking south somewhere; isn't that true?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A.

No evidence establishes where the plaintiff was situated when he fell. He could have been walking in the middle of the path, on the edge of the path, or off of the path altogether. No evidence establishes how he fell, or why he fell. From this evidence, a number of possible conclusions emerge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \u2022 The plaintiff slipped, tripped, or stumbled in such a way that he pitched forward and fell with no opportunity to recover;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \u2022 The plaintiff fell because he lost consciousness due to some medical episode;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \u2022 The plaintiff was walking on the edge of the path such that the hypothetical extra width would not have helped him recover;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \u2022 The plaintiff was not walking on the level portion of the path at all;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   OR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \u2022 The plaintiff was positioned in the path\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   slipped, tripped, or stumbled in such a way that the extra inches would, in fact, have helped him recover his step and he would not have fallen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   There is no evidence that justifies a factual finding that this final possibility is the correct one - that but for a few extra inches of width on the level portion of the path, the plaintiff would have recovered and would not have fallen down the embankment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   III.

Sumner's fall, alone, is not evidence that connects the railroad's alleged negligence to his injury and it is not a justification, by itself, for liability under the FELA. \"If a defendant's conduct is not a necessary condition for the plaintiff's harm, it quite simply lacks the essential connection that is the glue for all tort claims.\" Michael D.
