West, appeal the district court\u2019s order denying their motion for attorney\u2019s fees. After filing a complaint, the Plaintiff-Appellee, Richard B. Mayer, settled his FLSA overtime pay claim with his former employer. Mayer\u2019s attorney filed the settlement with the district court and requested attorney\u2019s fees. After the district court dismissed the case pursuant to settlement, Wall Street Equity and West filed their opposition to Mayer\u2019s fee motion and then requested their own attorneys\u2019 fees, alleging that Mayer\u2019s attorney pursued the litigation in bad faith. The district court denied Wall Street Equity and West\u2019s motion without explanation. Wall Street Equity and West then appealed that order to this court while Mayer\u2019s fee motion remained pending before the district court. Since the filing of this appeal, a magistrate judge has entered a report and recommendation that the district court grant Mayer\u2019s fee motion and deny Wall Street Equity and West\u2019s fee motion. We conclude that because the fee dispute is not yet final in the district court, we lack jurisdiction to consider this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">Generally, this Court has jurisdiction only of appeals from \u201cfinal decisions of the district courts.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. A final decision is typically \u201cone that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute its judgment.\u201d <em>World Fuel Corp. v. Geithner, </em>568 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Postjudgment decisions are likewise subject to the test of finality. <em>Delaney\u2019s Inc. v. III. Union Ins. Co., </em>894 F.2d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir.1990). However, in post-judgment proceedings, such as attorney fee disputes, \u201cthe meaning of a \u2018final decision\u2019 is less clear because the proceedings necessarily follow a final judgment.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass\u2019n, </em>594 F.3d 823, 829 (11th Cir.2010). Even so, \u201c[w]e \u2018treat the postjudgment proceeding as a free-standing litigation, in effect treating the final judgment as the first rather than the last order in the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ass\u2019n of Cmty. Orgs. for Reform Now v. Ill. State Bd. of Elections, 75 </em>F.3d 304, 306 (7th Cir.1996)). Thus, an order is deemed final if it disposes of all the issues raised in the motion that initially sparked the postjudgment proceedings. <em>See Thomas, </em>594 F.3d at 829; <em>Solis v. Current Dev. Corp., 557 </em>F.3d 772, 776 (7th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">In the instant case, Mayer\u2019s fee motion initiated the postjudgment proceedings, and the district court did not resolve Mayer\u2019s fee motion when it denied Wall Street Equity and West\u2019s fee motion. Even if the motions had been filed in reverse order, this court would still lack appellate jurisdiction because the other fee motion would remain outstanding. Only if a postjudgment order is \u201capparently the last order to be entered in the action\u201d is it final and appealable. <em>Delaney\u2019s Inc., </em>894 F.2d at 1304 (quoting 9 J. Lucas et al., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 100.14[1], at 196-97 (2d ed. 1988)). For us to hold otherwise invites litigants to appeal every attorney\u2019s fee order, even if other requests remain outstanding, resulting in a proliferation of piecemeal or repetitious appeals. <em>See Solis, 557 </em>F.3d at 776. Furthermore, our ruling is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s practical construction of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949) (\u201cThe effect of [\u00a7 1291] is to disallow appeal from any decision which is ... incomplete,\u201d and \u00a7 1291\u2019s \u201cpurpose is to combine in one review all stages of the proceeding that effectively may be reviewed and corrected if and when final judgment results.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">For the aforementioned reasons, we dismiss Wall Street Equity and West\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1237-14\">. Before we dismissed the present appeal on Feb. 22, 2012, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, granted Mayer's fee motion, and denied Wall Street Equity and West\u2019s fee motion on Feb. 17, 2012. Our opinion does not address the substance of Wall Street Equity and West\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s Feb. 17, 2012 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
