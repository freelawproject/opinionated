A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b65-16\">Defendant appeals from a judgment entered by the Law Division after a trial <em>de novo </em>on the municipal court record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>finding it guilty of violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4(a) because its agent made harassing telephone calls to one of its debtors while she was at work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4 reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">A person commits a petty disorderly persons offense if, with purpose to harass another, he: a. Makes, or causes to be made, a communication or communications anonymously or at extremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language, or any other manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s initial contention that the evidence failed to support a finding that the statute was violated. On the evidence presented, the trial judge reasonably could have found that defendant\u2019s agent persisted in calling the debtor at her job at Resorts International where she worked as a cashier supervisor. These calls were made after she informed them that she was not permitted to accept calls. One of defendant\u2019s employees also directed a racial slur at her and threatened police and Casino Control Commission intervention. From such constant dunning conduct defendant\u2019s agent\u2019s \u201cpurpose to harass\u201d was reasonably deducible. In addition, defendant must be charged with the knowledge that the constant calls, although made during the day, were made at \u201cextremely inconvenient hours\u201d from the debtor\u2019s viewpoint, and that the racial epithet was \u201coffensively coarse\u201d or at least \u201clikely to cause annoyance or alarm.\u201d Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Rosenfeld, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>594 (1973), is unavailing. The statute there interpreted attempted to regulate the content of speech, which the court held was permissible only as to words likely to threaten an immediate breach of the peace. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4, on the other hand, addresses not offensive language but rather verbal harassment which lacks the intent to communicate political, philosophical, social or artistic expression entitled to special constitutional deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Defendant also contends that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33 4(a) is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. In the Law Division this argument was summarily rejected. The State disputes defendant\u2019s standing to argue overbreadth, reasoning that defendant\u2019s theory that the statute will impinge upon protected conduct is so speculative as to defeat standing. Although the State did not raise the standing issue below, we chose to address it because of the constitutional values allegedly at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The leading case is <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 <em>U.S. </em>601, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2908, 37 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>830 (1973), in which the court denied standing to state employees who sought to overturn, on grounds of overbreadth, a state law barring public employees from partisan political activities. The court acknowledged the general rule that a \u201cperson to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied will not be heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, in other situations not before the Court.\u201d 413 <em>U.S. </em>at 610, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2914. But the court noted an exception where the statute is claimed to impair First Amendment freedoms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">... [T]he Court has altered its traditional rules of standing to permit \u2014 in the First Amendment area \u2014 \u201cattacks on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow specificity.\u201d <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>[479] 486, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1116 [1120], 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965). Litigants, therefore, are permitted to challenge a statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute\u2019s very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression. [Id. at 612, 93 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2915]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In order to acquire standing to assert an overbreadth claim, defendant must make a \u201cstrong showing that the \u2018statute\u2019s deterrent effect on legitimate expression is . . . real and substantial\u2019 [citations omitted] and that the sweep of the legislation will impermissibly hobble the exercise of protected First Amendment rights [citations omitted].\u201d <em>N.J. Chamber of Commerce v. N.J. Elec. Law Enforcem., Comm\u2019n, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>57, 66 (1980), quoting in part from <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>50, 60, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2440, 2447, 49 L.Ed.2d 310, 320 (1976). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>More than allegations of a subjective chill must be made; defendant must claim a specific objective harm, either present or predictable. <em>Bigelow v. Virginia, </em>421 <em>U.S. </em>809, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>2222, 44 L.Ed.2d 600 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We consider it important that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4 principally proscribes conduct and only incidentally commercial speech in this case. In concluding that the overbreadth claimed by appellants was too insubstantial to confer standing, the court in <em>Broadrick, supra, </em>reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">... [F]acial overbreadth adjudication is an exception to our traditional rules of practice and ... its function, a limited one at the outset [,] attenuates as the otherwise unprotected behavior that it forbids the State to sanction moves from \u201cpure speech\u201d towards conduct and that conduct \u2014 even if expressive \u2014 falls within the scope of otherwise valid criminal laws that reflect legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct. Although such laws, if too broadly worded, may deter protected speech to some unknown extent, there comes a point where that effect \u2014 at best a prediction \u2014 cannot, with confidence, justify invalidating a statute on its face and so prohibiting a State from enforcing the statute against conduct that is admittedly within its power to proscribe. <em>Cf. Alderman v. United States, </em>394 <em>U.S. </em>165, 174-175, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>961 [966-967], 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969). To put the matter another way, particularly where conduct and not merely speech is involved, we believe that the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep. [413 <em>U.S. </em>at 615, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2917]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Whatever overbreadth may exist, the court added, should be cured \u201cthrough case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its sanctions, assertedly, may not be applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615-616, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2917-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">As the State argues persuasively, the statute here is preserved by the requirement that the speaker have the specific intention of harassing the listener. Harassing phone calls are not entitled to First Amendment protection. <em>Walker v. Dillard, </em>523 F.2d 3, 4 (4 Cir.1975), <em>cert. </em>den. 423 <em>U.S. </em>906, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>208, 46 L.Ed.2d 136 (1975). Of course, such calls may not be proscribed in language which sweeps in protected expression as well. <em>Ibid. </em>But for the purposes of determining standing, it is sufficient to note that defendant herein was convicted of conduct falling squarely within the proscription. Thus, it has been said that standing in such cases</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>... is reserved for those defendants whose speech is at the fringes of that activity which the statute is designed to regulate. Those defendants whose speech is central to the interests which the statute seeks to protect and is clearly of a type regulated by the statute in question, cannot attack the statute as overbroad. They must demonstrate that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to them. <em>[People v. Weeks, </em>197 <em>Colo. </em>175, 591 P.2d 91, 94 (Sup.Ct.1979); citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Defendant herein has posed no examples of protected speech which this statute might chill. Rather, it is content to argue generally that the law reaches protected expression and cites some out-of-state cases holding somewhat similar statutes to be overbroad.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But we would have to speculate as to possible excessive extensions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4. We prefer, as counselled by <em>Broadrick, </em>to cure any such misapplication on a case-by-case basis. This statute regulates conduct too far removed from pure speech and too closely linked to the State\u2019s police power to warrant an overbreadth challenge by one who clearly violated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Where similar statutes, requiring a specific intention to harass, have been challenged in other jurisdictions, they have withstood attack for overbreadth. See generally, Annotation, \u201cValidity, Construction, and Application of State Criminal Statute Forbidding Use of Telephone to Annoy or Harass,\u201d 95 <em>A.L.R. </em>3d 411, 422-424 (1979). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>34 <em>Conn.Super. </em>689, 389 A.2d 1270 (Super.Ct.App.1978), defendant was found guilty of violating a statute declaring a person guilty of harassment when, \u201cwith intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, he makes a telephone call, whether or not a conversation ensues, in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.\u201d The factual basis of the charge was that defendant telephoned complainant at her place of work and levelled insults and threats at her. In rejecting defendant\u2019s overbreadth argument, the court recognized that the statute aimed, not at the content <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>of the offending statements but rather at the manner in which they were communicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">... The overbreadth principle is not violated by the unrestricted scope of the messages which the statute may ban because it is the manner and means employed to communicate them which is the subject of the prohibition rather than their content. The statute is not flawed because a recital on the telephone of the most sublime prayer with the intention and effect of harassing the listener would fall within its ban as readily as the most scurrilous epithet. The prohibition is against purposeful harassment by means of a device readily susceptible to abuse as a constant trespasser upon our privacy. That words may be the instrument of annoyance does not insulate such wrongful conduct from criminal liability. [389 A.2d at 1273-1274]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Thus the court rejected defendant\u2019s contention, also advanced herein, that only \u201cfighting words\u201d could be proscribed, impliedly acknowledging that the cases approving criminalization of speech only if an immediate breach of the peace would result, did not address that class of statutes aimed at purposeful harassment. <em>Id. </em>at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Defendant in <em>Anonymous </em>later unsuccessfully sought a federal writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>In denying the writ the court reaffirmed that the \u201cstatute regulates <em>conduct, </em>not mere speech,\u201d and opined the argued overbreadth was negated by the specific-intent element of the offense. <em>Gormley v. Conn. State Dept. of Prob. Dir., </em>632 F.2d 938, 941-942 (2 Cir.1980), <em>cert. </em>den. 449 <em>U.S. </em>1023, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>591, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>485 (1980). Moreover, the court deemed any possible chilling effect to be minor compared with the compelling need of the State to deter the increasing misuse of the telephone to harm others. <em>Id. </em>636 F.2d at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The specific-intent requirement has similarly been held to preserve other statutes. For example, a provision barring the use of the telephone \u201cfor repeated calls, if with intent to annoy, abuse, torment, harass or embarrass,\u201d was upheld in <em>von Lusch v. State, </em>39 <em>Md.App. </em>517, 387 A.2d 306, 310 (Ct.App. 1978). There the court stated: \u201cFreedom of speech does not encompass the right to abuse the telephone with the specific intent to annoy and to harass the recipient of the call.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>And in <em>States v. Hagen, </em>27 <em>Ariz.App. </em>722, 558 P.2d 750, 752-753 (Ct.App. 1976), the court upheld a law prohibiting threatening, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>obscene, lewd or profane telephone calls, where there is an \u201cintent to terrify, intimidate, threaten, harass, annoy or offend.\u201d The <em>Hagen </em>court explained that \u201c[b]y specifying the <em>intent </em>with which the call must be made and the nature of the language prohibited, the statute clearly demonstrates that the prohibited activities find no protection under the First Amendment.\u201d 558 P.2d at 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">We have no difficulty concluding that the victim\u2019s privacy interest prevails over any right of commercial expression defendant may enjoy in the circumstances. We also observe that the United States Supreme Court has consistently extended less First Amendment protection to commercial expression than to noncommercial expression. <em>See Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>490, 505-509, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2882, 2891-93, 69 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>800, 813-816 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Defendant also seeks to invalidate the statute on the ground of vagueness, contending that the language used was so imprecise as to give it no notice of the conduct proscribed. Specifically, defendant protests that the terms \u201cextremely inconvenient hours,\u201d \u201coffensively coarse language\u201d and \u201cany other manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm\u201d are impermissibly vague. But defendant does not claim any imprecision in the qualifying phrase \u201cwith purpose to harass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">We concede that if viewed in isolation, each of the phrases might be deemed vague. But each is modified in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4(a) by the requirement that there be a purpose to harass. The trial court found that defendant had such a purpose. Moreover, defendant cannot seriously deny, notwithstanding any arguable general vagueness, that the conduct which it engaged in fell squarely within the Statute\u2019s proscription. Thus, once defendant\u2019s agent learned that the calls were not welcome at work, he must have known that the hours of the calls were \u201cextremely inconvenient\u201d and \u201clikely to cause annoyance.\u201d Likewise, defendant must reasonably be charged with knowing that the slur \u201csmart-ass nigger\u201d was \u201coffensively coarse,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>that that comment plus the threat of police and Commission intervention were very \u201clikely to cause annoyance or alarm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Thus we conclude that defendant\u2019s agent \u201creceived fair warning of the criminality of his own conduct from the statute in question\u201d and defendant may not \u201cattack it because the language would not give similar fair warning with respect to other conduct which might be within its broad and literal ambit.\u201d <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 <em>U.S. </em>733, 756, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>2547, 2561, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974). It is a well-settled principle of constitutional law that, \u201cOne to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\"> One Morelli, defendant\u2019s employee, was the original defendant.
