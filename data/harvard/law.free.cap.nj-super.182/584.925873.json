We are not prepared to say that under no circumstances will a decision of a county tax board be binding in subsequent proceedings before the Tax Court dealing with assessments for later years. We think, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>however, that here the Tax Court properly considered the matter <em>de novo. </em>In a sense the claim for farmland assessment leading to the subsequent administrative and judicial proceedings may be regarded as generating a new cause for action since the assessments were contested in successive years. Consequently in the absence of evidence that the same issue was litigated the Tax Court was not bound by the prior proceedings. <em>See Harbor Land Development Corp. v. Mirne, Nowels, Tumen, Magee &amp; Kirschner, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538 (App.Div.1979). Finally, we observe that extension of the advantages of farmland assessments to noncontiguous properties not directly entitled to such treatment could lead to unworkable criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
