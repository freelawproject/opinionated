J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">On July 24,1981 IGP-East, Inc. filed a petition (supplemented on September 8, 1981) with the Casino Control Commission seeking approval to organize and promote a casino craps tournament pursuant to the Commission\u2019s authority under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-5. As described in its petitions, the tournament, to be held at Resorts International Hotel Casino in March, would consist of a series of elimination rounds in the casino game of craps. The top six winners would receive cash prizes amounting to a total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>of $250,000. To participate, each contestant must purchase $750 worth of tournament gaming chips to be used in making bets and would pay a $250 entry fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">On October 30,1981 the Division of Gaming Enforcement filed with the Commission a position paper relating to casino tournament games. The Division\u2019s position was that though the Commission had the authority under \u00a7 5 of the Casino Control Act to approve casino gaming tournaments as a permissible form of casino gaming, the charging of an entry fee turned the otherwise acceptable tournament into a lottery proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:37-1 <em>et seq. </em>Notwithstanding the Division\u2019s views, on November 4, 1981 the Commission granted IGP\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Subsequently, IGP began to promote the tournament. The Division, however, persisted in the position that such a tournament was an illegal lottery and consequently threatened both IGP and Resorts with criminal prosecution if the tournament were held.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">As a result of these threats, on December 21, 1981 IGP sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the Attorney General and the Division in the Law Division. Specifically, IGP requested an order affirming the legality of its tournament and restraining defendants from instituting criminal charges. This relief was granted by Judge Gruccio on December 28, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">We conclude that a tournament involving an authorized casino game by the Casino Control Commission, even if it takes on some indicia of a lottery, is not proscribed by the Code of Criminal Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">We read the \u201cGambling Offenses\u201d chapter of the Criminal Code not to prohibit every gambling scheme which falls within the definition of a lottery. Only those gambling schemes which are \u201cunlawful\u201d are proscribed. The pertinent sections read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">h. \u201cLottery\u201d means an <em>unlawful </em>gambling scheme in which (a) the players pay or agree to pay something of value for chances, represented and differentiated by numbers or by combinations of numbers or by some other media, one or more of which chances are to be designated the winning ones; and (b) the winning chances are to be determined by a drawing or by some other method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>based upon the element of chance; and (c) the holders of the winning chances are to receive something of value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1S\">k. \u201cUnlawful\u201d means not specifically authorized by law. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:87-1; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Thus, if a gambling scheme, which would otherwise be considered a lottery, is \u201cspecifically authorized by law,\u201d promoting or conducting that scheme would not constitute a criminal violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The Casino Control Act defines an \u201cauthorized gambling game\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">Roulette, baccarat, blackjack, craps, big six wheel, slot machines, and any variations or composites of such games, provided that such variations or composites are found by the commission suitable for casino use after an appropriate test or experimental period under such terms and conditions as the commission may deem appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Clearly, any of the six games specifically enumerated in this section, as well as any variations thereof which are properly authorized by the Commission, are \u201cgambling schemes\u201d which are \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d As such, they fall outside of the scope of the Criminal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">If the casino craps tournament here proposed was properly determined to be a variation of craps by the Commission, then as an \u201cauthorized gambling game\u201d it is not prohibited by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:37-1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Moreover, that this was the intent of the Legislature seems without doubt in light of the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:37-9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit any activity authorized by the \u201cCasino Control Act\u201d (P.L.1977, c. 110; C. 5:12-1 et seq.), or to supersede any provision of said act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">Since the casino craps tournament here was authorized by the Commission under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-5, it is not an illegal gambling scheme under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:37-l(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">To a certain extent it is somewhat premature to review the Commission\u2019s decision at this time. Pursuant to its power under <em>N.J.S.A. 5:12-5, the </em>Commission merely authorized this craps tournament \u201con an experimental basis to determine whether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>not tournament play should be adopted as a new authorized game.\u201d The experimental period is mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-5 which requires the Commission to determine whether the variation would be \u201csuitable for casino use.\u201d The decision we review here, then, is the Commission\u2019s threshold determination that an entry-fee craps tournament is a variation of an authorized game so as to qualify for experimental testing. It is still within the Commission\u2019s province, at the conclusion of the experimental period, to find that such a tournament is not \u201csuitable for casino use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The determination that a craps tournament, which consists of a series of crap games, is a variation of craps, is clearly reasonable and is not challenged by defendants. The fact that an entry fee is charged does not, in our opinion, change the fundamental nature of the underlying game. As discussed above, the Legislature did not intend <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:37-1 <em>ct seq. </em>to be a limitation on the Commission\u2019s authority under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-5. Therefore the Commission\u2019s determination that the entry-fee craps tournament was a variation of an authorized game was a reasonable one and will not be disturbed at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
