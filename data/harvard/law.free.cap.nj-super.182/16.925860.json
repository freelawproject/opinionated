Defendant sought to have the confirmation order vacated on the ground that it had not been properly served with the order to show cause and complaint filed by the union seeking confirmation and thus the court did not obtain <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over defendant in the matter. The union had served the New York City attorney who had represented defendant in the arbitration matter. Defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the confirmation order was denied by the trial court which held that when defendant authorized the New York attorney to execute a written submission to arbitration agreement on defendant\u2019s behalf, defendant placed no limitation on the attorney\u2019s agency either as an attorney or otherwise. The court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">\u201cby thus holding him out as the individual responsible for the conduct of the proceeding on behalf of the employer, defendant here must be said to have so acted as to justify plaintiff\u2019s presuming that [the attorney] was an authorized agent for receipt of service of the order to show cause and verified complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Defendant\u2019s contention on appeal is no different from its contention below. Defendant argues that the confirmation order entered by default against it is void for lack of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over defendant because plaintiff\u2019s service of the order to show cause and verified complaint upon the New York attorney at his New York office was insufficient and ineffective for jurisdictional purposes since the attorney was not one of those persons delineated by <em>R. </em>4:4-4(c)(l) to receive service of process on defendant\u2019s behalf. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>R. </em>4:4-4 prescribes the manner in which summonses, writs and complaints are to be served in this State. Subsection (c)(1) deals with service of process upon corporations and provides that service of process shall be made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">... upon a domestic or foreign corporation, by serving, in a manner prescribed in paragraph (a), either an officer, director, trustee, or managing or general agent; or any person authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process on behalf of the corporation; or the person at the registered office of the corporation in charge thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The question is whether the New York attorney representing defendant in the arbitration proceeding falls within any of the categories delineated in the court rule as appropriate persons to receive service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">While there are no reported cases in this State defining what is meant by a \u201cperson authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process\u201d for a corporation, our state court rule is virtually identical to that found in the <em>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 4(d)(3)) and thus we may look for guidance to cases emanating from the federal jurisdictions as well as to treatises dealing with the <em>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>and <em>Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil </em>provide concise articulations about what is meant by the phrase \u201cany other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.\u201d Paragraph 4.22[1] of <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>(2d ed. 1979) explains that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">\u201cAny other agent authorized by appointment\u201d refers to an agent expressly or impliedly appointed by the corporation, partnership or other unincorporated association subject to suit under a common name....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">The agency for the receipt of process may be implied from the surrounding circumstances. But the mere appointment of an agent, even with broad authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ty is not enough; it must be shown that the agent had specific authority, express or implied, for the receipt of service of process. While an attorney may be such an agent, the same principles apply in determining whether the attorney was specially vested with authority to receive service of process. An agent\u2019s acceptance of service, or his own statement as to his authority is insufficient, standing alone, to establish authorization to receive service of process, [at 4-186 to 4-188; footnotes omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Sections 1097 and 1101 of <em>Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil </em>state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">The cases dealing with agency by appointment indicate that an actual appointment for the specific purpose of receiving process normally is expected. Accordingly, the mere fact that a person acts as a defendant\u2019s agent for some purposes does not necessarily mean that he has authority to receive process. The courts look to the circumstances of the agency relationship, and although authority to accept process need not be explicit, it must either be expressed or implied from the type of relationship between defendant and the alleged agent. Thus, a financial agent or manager of defendant\u2019s business or even his attorney probably will not be deemed an agent appointed to receive process absent a factual basis for believing that an appointment of this type has taken place. Consistently with this judicial construction of \u201cappointment,\u201d the courts have held that protestations by an agent that he has authority to receive process or the fact that an agent actually accepts process is not enough to bind defendant; there must be evidence that defendant himself intended to confer such authority upon the agent. The requisite intent, however, may be implied from the terms of a broad power of attorney or from the circumstances surrounding the service upon the agent. [\u00a7 1097 at 370-372]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The federal courts have consistently held that, in the absence of an express agreement between the agent and principal or in the absence of circumstances which clearly show that such an agreement was intended by the parties, authorization to accept service of process on behalf of a corporation or an individual would not be deemed to exist. <em>Miree v. United States, </em>490 <em>F.Supp. </em>768 (N.D.Ga.1980); <em>United States v. Marple Community Record, Inc., </em>335 <em>F.Supp. </em>95 (E.D.Pa.1971); <em>WICA, Inc. v. WWSW, Inc., </em>191 F.2d 502 (D.C.Cir.1951), <em>Burger Chef Systems, Inc. v. Baldwin Inc., </em>365 <em>F.Supp. </em>1229 (S.D.N.Y.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The only evidence in this record concerning the \u201cauthority\u201d vested in the New York attorney by defendant is in the form of the written submission agreement \u2014 a standard form provided by the New Jersey State Board of Mediation which contains blanks wherein the specific controversy is to be stated, as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>parties\u2019 names and the name of the arbitrator. There are signature lines provided for the representative of the employer and the union as well as a witness to their signatures. The submission form indicates that the representatives, \u201cthe undersigned,\u201d agreed to submit the captioned controversy to arbitration. It further asserts that a collective bargaining agreement existed between the employer and the union, that the controversy was to be submitted for a decision to a particular arbitrator and that the undersigned representatives \u201cfurther agree that we will faithfully abide by and perform any award made pursuant to this agreement and that such award shall be binding and conclusive upon us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Obviously, that submission form contains no express authorization by defendant to its New York attorney-representative to accept service of process on defendant\u2019s behalf. Nor do we see any possibility that such authorization can be implied from either the language in the submission agreement or the circumstances of the New York attorney\u2019s representation of defendant. There is nothing in the agreement\u2019s language to even suggest the attorney\u2019s authorization to receive service of process for defendant. Moreover, unlike the situation in <em>Burger Chef Systems, Inc. v. Baldwin Inc., supra, </em>there is no rule governing State Board of Mediation proceedings which authorizes a party or its attorney to accept service of process in any action connected with the arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">It is clearly plaintiff\u2019s burden of proving that an agency relationship existed between defendant\u2019s New York attorney-representative and defendant. Since the only evidence in the record concerning this relationship is the written submission to arbitration agreement, we must conclude that plaintiff failed to meet its burden of proof and that the trial judge erred in deciding to the contrary. The courts of this State never obtained <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over the corporation because defendant was improperly served and thus the order of confirmation entered against defendant is void. The order denying'defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the confirmation order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The attempted maimer of service, while insufficient under our rules, was made in good faith. Accordingly, we hold that our determination vacating the judgment shall be without prejudice to the right of respondent Local 617 to continue the litigation by effecting service on Hudson, based on the complaint presently on file, without the necessity of filing a new complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Respondent Local 617 contends that the State rule\u2019s use of the words \u201cperson authorized by appointment or by law\u201d instead of \u201cagent authorized by appointment or by law,\u201d as in the federal rule, renders the federal rule sufficiently different so as to preclude any effective analogy to federal cases. We disagree. The two rules present a distinction without a difference. A <em>person </em>authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process is certainly a corporation <em>agent </em>for that purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
