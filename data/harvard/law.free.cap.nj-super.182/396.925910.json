Freda, </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>436, 440-442 (Law Div. 1980). <em>See Trainor v. Santana, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>403, 407-408 (1981) (commenting on <em>dictum </em>in the Appellate Division\u2019s opinion in <em>Trainor </em>which criticized the trial court\u2019s application of the fireman\u2019s rule in this case and expressly holding that <em>Hill v. Yaskin, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>139 (1977), \u201clacked precedential value insofar as the application of the fireman\u2019s rule [to policeman] was concerned\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Since we have affirmed the judgment on the basis that the fireman\u2019s rule applied to the policeman in the circumstances of this case, it is unnecessary for us to consider the other ground advanced by the trial judge in support of the summary judgment, to wit, that \u201cas a matter of law, a reasonably prudent person would not foresee that his act of leaving the keys in the car would result in the use of the car as a weapon.\u201d <em>Berko v. Freda, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 439. Our failure to consider this issue should not be construed as an approval of the trial judge\u2019s holding with respect thereto. <em>Cf. Trentacost v. Brussel, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>214, 220-223 (1980); <em>Braitman </em>v. <em>Overlook Terrace Corp., </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>368, 380-383 (1975); <em>Zinck v. Whelan, </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>432, 444-151 (App.Div.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
