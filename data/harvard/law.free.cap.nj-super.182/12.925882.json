A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Defendant was charged on two complaints for disorderly conduct arising from the sale of obscene materials, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-2(b). It is stipulated that the proofs proposed to support the complaints would be that defendant on two separate days sold to a prosecutor\u2019s investigator tickets to view an allegedly pornographic film. From an order of the Law Division dismissing the complaints on the ground that they do not charge the offense contemplated by the statute the State appeals. The sole question presented is whether on the stipulated facts defendant was chargeable with the offense of selling obscene material.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">In its entirety <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-2, dealing with the sale of obscene material to a person 18 years of age or older, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">a. Definitions for purpose of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-12\">(1) \u201cObscene material\u201d means any description, narrative account, display, or depiction of sexual activity or anatomical area contained in, or consisting of, a picture or other representation, publication, sound recording, live performance, or film, which by means of posing, composition, format or animated sensual details:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-13\">(a) Depicts or describes in a patently offensive way, ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, masturbation, excretory functions, or lewd exhibition of the genitals,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-14\">(b) Lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, when taken as a whole, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-15\">(c) Is a part of a work, which to the average person applying contemporary community standards, has a dominant theme taken as a whole, which appeals to the prurient interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-16\">b. A person who sells obscene material to a person 18 years of age or older is a disorderly person and any person charged pursuant to this section shall have the right to a trial by jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit a municipality from adopting as a part of its zoning ordinances an ordinance permitting the sale of obscene material, in which event such sale shall be deemed legal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The State argues that the foregoing legislation should be broadly read to embrace not only the physical film itself, but the exhibition thereof as well. Reliance is placed upon that portion of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-2(a)(1) which includes in its definition of obscene materials a \u201clive performance, or film.\u201d The State reasons that since the Legislature cannot sensibly be thought to have contemplated the physical sale of live performers it could only have had in mind the sale of tickets to the performances themselves. The argument continues that the proximity of \u201cfilm\u201d to \u201clive performance\u201d in the definitional portion of the statute demonstrates a similar intent as to \u201cfilm.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">We agree with the prosecutor\u2019s contention insofar as it demonstrates that the statute is, in the respect noted, of unclear meaning. But the ambiguity, if such it is, was not created by the defendant; therefore, if interpretation must be resorted to, it is the rule of strict construction which governs, barring liability \u201cwhen the words of the enactment are not clear in fixing it.\u201d <em>State v. Mundet Cork Corp., </em>8 <em>N.J. </em>359, 365 (1952), <em>cert. </em>den. 344 <em>U.S. </em>819, 73 <em>S.Ct. </em>14, 97 <em>L.Ed. </em>637 (1952); <em>State v. Fair Lawn Service Center, Inc., </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>468, 472 (1956); 1 <em>Schlosser, Criminal Laws of New Jersey </em>(3 ed. 1970), \u00a7 5:5; 3 <em>Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>(4 ed. 1974), \u00a7 59.03. \u201c[A]ll doubts must be resolved in defendant\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>State v. Alveario, </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 137 (App.Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">It has long been settled that \u201c \u2018[b]efore a man can be punished, his case must be plainly and unmistakably within the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Caez, </em>81 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315, 319 (App.Div.1963). Penal statutes \u201c \u2018are not to be regarded as including anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>which is not within their letter as well as their spirit, which is not clearly and intelligently described in the very words of the statute, as well as manifestly intended by the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Cannizzaro, </em>133 <em>N.J.L. </em>383, 384 (E. &amp; A.1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Our agreement with the action of the trial judge is fortified by a reading of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-3, which deals with the distribution of obscene materials to persons under 18 years of age. Subsection C specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">Any person who knowingly admits a person under 18 years of age to a theater then exhibiting an obscene film is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">It has been recognized that the Legislature has no difficulty in expressing itself \u201c \u2018when it has the will.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Wright, </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174, 180 (App.Div.1977). Our reading of the legislation leaves no doubt as to the lawmakers\u2019 intention to differentiate between persons under and over the age of 18 years with respect to the exhibition of obscene films since no comparable proscription is contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:34-2. The omission of such language therein, we feel, was not inadvertent, and it is fundamental that what the Legislature omits the courts cannot supply. <em>Craster v. Newark Bd. Comm\u2019rs., </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>225, 230 (1952); 73 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Statutes, </em>\u00a7 203. The power to insert words and clauses, where it exists, is exercised with \u201cunusual caution\u201d; it is a dangerous business to fill in the text of a statute from its purposes * * 2A <em>Sutherland, op. cit., </em>\u00a7 47.38. As the court said in <em>Railroad Com\u2019n of Indiana v. Grand Trunk Western R. Co., </em>179 <em>Ind. </em>255, 100 <em>N.E. </em>852, 855 (Sup.Ct.1913),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">It is far better to wait for necessary corrections by those authorized to make them, or, in fact, for them to remain unmade, however desirable they may be, than for judicial tribunals to transcend the just limits of their constitutional powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Within the context of these settled principles it is notable that on February 27, 1980 Governor Byrne filed Senate Bill No. 1306 without signature after passage by both houses of the legislature. If signed by the governor its terms would have amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34 \u2014 2 b. to add the words \u201cor exhibits\u201d after \u201csells\u201d so that the penalties of the statute would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>become applicable to any \u201cperson who knowingly sells <em>or exhibits </em>obscene material to a person 18 years of age or older.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) It would appear that the legislature was aware that the statute expressly proscribed the sale of the physical material only and that the amendatory language was necessary to express its intent to criminalize the type of conduct here involved, or at least to clarify that intent so as to make it understandable to an ordinary person. That the amendatory language has not since been enacted further evidences that the lawmakers knowingly chose to leave the law unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u201cAn amendment to an act may be resorted to for discovery of legislative intent in the enactment amended.\u201d <em>Matawan Borough v. Monmouth Cty. Tax Bd., </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>291, 299 (1968). \u201c[O]rdinarily a change in legislative language signifies a purposeful alteration in the substance of the law.\u201d <em>State v. Maguer, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>451, 453 (App.Div.1977). In fact, it has been said that such action is evidence that the previous statute meant the \u201cexact contrary.\u201d This rests upon the theory \u201cthat the legislature is not presumed to do a useless act.\u201d 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 49.11, p. 265 (4 ed. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-9\"> It is conceivable that the reference to \u201clive performance\u201d is intended to apply to the action of a booking agent in arranging for such performances at theaters or other places of amusement. On this understanding the cited language would not be regarded as superfluous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
