A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">In July 1979 the Department of Insurance charged Progressive Life Insurance Company (PLICO) with engaging in unfair claims settlement practices, unfair competition and other deceptive practices. Extensive hearings were conducted by an administrative law judge (ALJ) who concluded that PLICO had engaged in unfair practices in violation of the Unfair Claim Settlement Practices Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:30-2. In her initial decision Administrative Law Judge Dower-LaBastille made specific, detailed factual findings on each of 114 charges against PLICO. She also found that \u201ca terrible injustice\u201d had been done to 17 individual claimants, not represented by counsel, who were entitled to receive insurance benefits aggregating in excess of $17,000 which had been unjustifiably denied. Although she recommended that a cease and desist order be issued as to each of the improper practices specifically set forth in her opinion, she also determined that the Commissioner of Insurance lacks jurisdiction to order \u201crestitution\u201d (i.e., payment of insurance benefit claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">The Commissioner in his final decision accepted and adopted the findings and conclusions of Judge Dower-LaBastille except for her determination that he lacked jurisdiction to order pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>ment of claims to individual claimants by way of \u201crestitution.\u201d Hence, he modified the initial decision to include \u201crestitution\u201d of the disputed benefits to the 17 individual claimants in the amounts set forth, together with 8% interest, payable within 30 days from the date of his order.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">PLICO did not make the \u201crestitution\u201d payments but instead filed its notice of appeal to the Appellate Division from the final agency determination. Shortly thereafter the Commissioner instituted suit in the Law Division for imposition of statutory penalties against the insurer for its failure to comply and enjoining further noncompliance with the \u201crestitution\u201d order. The Law Division judge refused to consider the merits of the agency determination then on appeal. He nonetheless ordered PLICO to comply with the \u201crestitution\u201d order pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:9-l(a), refused to stay enforcement of the order pending appeal and imposed a $5,000 penalty for previous noncompliance. PLICO paid the $5,000 penalty to avoid contempt proceedings, posted a cash bond to guarantee such payments to claimants as it might ultimately be required to make and obtained a stay of the final agency and Law Division rulings pending appeal. Its appeal from the Law Division judgment has been consolidated with that from the agency determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">PLICO attacks the final agency decision and the judgment, asserting that the administrative law judge should have disqualified herself; that the agency acted arbitrarily, unreasonably and in violation of due process; that there cannot have been 114 separate violations of the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act and that the Commissioner lacks power to order payment of insurance benefits to individual claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">PLICO insists that Judge Dower-LaBastille should have disqualified herself because she previously had been associated with the Commissioner of Insurance in private law practice and as a hearing officer appointed by him to the Department of Insurance. We cannot agree that her rejection of PLICO\u2019s demand for her recusal from the administrative law hearing was \u201chighly improper\u201d as it is characterized by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Judge Dower-LaBastille is not disqualified under the express terms of the applicable statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-49, by #.1:12-1 or by the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3. She developed expertise as a hearing officer in the Department of Insurance prior to the establishment of the Office of Administrative Law within the Executive Branch of State Government. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14F-1. Appellant suggests no specific evidence of bias, prejudice or impropriety on her part. Although the criteria applicable to members of the judiciary may differ in some respects from those which apply to administrative adjudicators, see 3 <em>Davis, Administrative Law Treatise </em>(2 ed. 1980), \u00a7 19:1 <em>et seq., </em>we conclude that similar standards are generally applicable. Judge Dower-LaBastille had no interest in the outcome other than her responsibility to act in her official capacity according to law. Her primary concern was, as it should be, not that the Commissioner of Insurance be the \u201csuccessful\u201d litigant, but rather that he arrive at the proper factual and legal conclusions. He, after all, must make the ultimate findings of fact and conclusions of law in his \u201cfinal decision\u201d by accepting or rejecting any or all of the recommendations in the ALJ\u2019s \u201cinitial decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Upon establishment of the administrative law courts it was inevitable that many hearing officers previously employed by their respective agencies would be transferred to the new Office of Administrative Law, and many of them were. It would be unfortunate, indeed, if they could not now be assigned to hear cases referred from the agencies with which they had been previously associated. The expertise they have developed over the years is a valuable asset. Without some other reason therefore, there is no inference of bias based solely upon such prior association with the agency or department head who, under our statutory scheme, continues to have authority \u201cto adopt, reject or modify the findings of fact and conclusions of law of any administrative law judge.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14F-7; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>We neither expect nor desire the \u201ctotal absence of preconceptions.\u201d <em>See In re J. P. Linahan, Inc., </em>138 F.2d 650, 651-52 (2 Cir. 1943). There is no suggestion here that the judge manifested any prejudgment of the adjudicative facts or any bias during the conduct of the hearing. Nor has appellant challenged any of her 257 findings of fact as being dictated by prejudice. Several counts of the order to show cause were dismissed and she rejected one of the Department\u2019s major demands as not within the Commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction. The Commissioner, in turn, rejected Judge Dower-LaBastille\u2019s legal conclusion in this regard, asserting that he has the jurisdiction to order payment of policy benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In essence, we believe that creation of the Office of Administrative Law has in fact freed the former hearing officers from possible domination by the department head to whom the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law are directed. Whether any such influence may still exist, consciously or subliminally, is a question which is appropriately left to the conscientious judgment of the individual judge. See R.l:12-l(f). We discern no basis for the conclusion that such influence existed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Defendant next argues that in failing to promulgate administrative rules and regulations governing the conduct of insurance companies, the Department could not determine, consistent with due process, whether PLICO\u2019s business practices were unacceptable. It maintains that there were no standards established for investigation of insurance company practices nor any guidelines adopted with which insurance firms must comply. Although PLICO concedes that an applicable statute exists, it urges that the \u201cvague language\u201d therein vests investigative officials with unbridled discretion to determine whether a company\u2019s practices are acceptable. PLICO fears that the absence of established regulations will cause the practices of similarly situated insurance firms to be treated differently,</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>The Commissioner asserts that the pertinent standards enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:30-1 <em>et seq. </em>sufficiently regulate practices in the insurance industry and adequately alert companies of that which is prohibited conduct. He urges that \u201cthere is no rigid legal or constitutional requirement that legislative standards must be translated into formal regulations before they may be applied to a particular case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:30-13.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">No person shall engage in unfair claim settlement practices in this State.

Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 <em>U.S. </em>267, 294-295, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>1757, 1771-1772, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974); <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 <em>U.S. </em>194, 201-203, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>1575, 1579-1580, 91 <em>L.Ed. </em>1995 (1947). In <em>Chenery Corp., </em>the United States Supreme Court reviewed action taken pursuant to statute by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although no specific rule had been promulgated by the Commission to deal with the problem confronting it, the Commission was found to possess the power to perform its statutory duty. <em>Id. </em>at 201-202, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1579-1580. \u201cTo hold that the Commission had no alternative . .. but to approve the proposed transaction, while formulating any general rules it might desire for use in future cases of this nature, would be to stultify the administrative process. That we refuse to do.\u201d Id. at 202, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1580. Unforeseeable problems may arise which must still be resolved despite the absence of administrative regulation or rule. Or, where the agency\u2019s experience with a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>problem is limited, the absence of a specific regulation may prevent the rigidification of tentative judgment into an absolute rule. Similarly, a problem may be so specialized or varying in nature that it is impossible to capture it within the parameters of a general regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 203, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1580. In such situations, the agency must have the \u201cpower to deal with the problems on a case to case basis if the administrative process is to be effective.\u201d \u201c[T]he choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual, ad hoc litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Ibid. See NLRB v. Bell </em>Aerospace <em>Co., supra, </em>416 <em>U.S. </em>at 294, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1771.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We have expressed our concurrence with the <em>Chenery </em>view in <em>Data Access Systems, Inc. v. State, </em>117 <em>N.J.Super. </em>95, 102 (App.Div. 1971), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 63 <em>N.J. </em>158 (1973). There we held that the New Jersey Bureau of Securities \u201cmust be afforded a fair opportunity, based on experience, to evolve statutory standards within the framework of the law.\u201d Although sustained experience with the standards contained in the relevant statute may dictate \u201cguidelines which should then be embodied in appropriate regulations,\u201d we accepted the Bureau\u2019s case-by-case approach to problems. Accordingly, we rejected appellant\u2019s challenge that the statutory language, \u201cunreasonable promoters\u2019 participation,\u201d is so broad that basic fairness requires promulgation of a rule defining the term. <em>Id. </em>at 103. The agency\u2019s expertise must be recognized together with \u201cthe necessity of using a flexible approach to the matters that come before it. The rigid application of standards suggested by appellant would deny to the Bureau the discretion so essential to proper application of its expertise.\u201d <em>Ibid. See, also, Jansco v. Waldron, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>320, 328 (1976); <em>Danton v. State, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 313 (App.Div. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Although \u201cthe Legislature may not vest unbridled or arbitrary power in the administrative agency but must furnish a reasonably adequate standard to guide it, ... the exigencies of modern government have increasingly dictated the use of gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>al rather than minutely detailed standards in regulatory enactments under the police power.\u201d <em>In re Heller Suspension, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>292, 303 (1977). It is for this reason that \u201cthe powers of an administrative agency should be liberally construed to permit the agency to achieve the task assigned to it, and that such administrative agency has such implied incidental powers as may reasonably be adapted to that end.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting <em>In re Banking &amp; Ins. Comm\u2019r v. Parkwood Co., </em>98 <em>N.J.Super. </em>263, 271-272 (App.Div. 1967). Accordingly, the court was unpersuaded that absent statute or regulation defining \u201cunprofessional conduct,\u201d the Board could not properly act to revoke the license of a registered pharmacist. <em>Id. </em>at 304-305. However, \u201cthe decision as to whether an agency\u2019s adjudicatory ruling is proper will vary from case to case and depend upon all the relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305. Defendant\u2019s argument notwithstanding, such terms as \u201creasonably,\u201d \u201cpromptly,\u201d \u201creasonably clear\u201d and \u201creasonable explanation,\u201d which are found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:30-13.1, are not unconstitutionally vague. <em>See, e.g., Trap Rock Indus., Inc. v. Kohl, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>471, 483 (1971), <em>cert. </em>den. 405 <em>U.S. </em>1065, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1500, 31 L.Ed.2d 796 (\u201cmoral responsibility\u201d); <em>N.J. Ass\u2019n of Health Care Facilities v. Finley, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>67, 82 (1980), app.dism. <em>sub nom. </em>Wayne <em>Haven Nursing Home v. Finley, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>944, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>342, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>208 (1980) (\u201creasonable number,\u201d \u201cjust and reasonable rate on equity\u201d); <em>Troy Hills v. Parsippany-Troy Hills Tp. Council, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>604, 628-630 (1975) (\u201cjust and reasonable\u201d); <em>Ward v. Scott, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>117, 123-124 (1952) (\u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d and \u201cnecessary to control or prevent unfair, unjust, destructive or demoralizing practices\u201d). The standards set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:30-13.1 \u201cdra[w] specificity from each setting.\u201d <em>Trap Rock Indus., Inc. v. Kohl, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 483. They are \u201cgeneral in terms but measured by common understanding [they] fairly and adequately conve[y] [their] meaning to all concerned.\u201d <em>Laba v. Newark Bd. of Ed., </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>364, 384 (1957). More is not constitutionally required. In fact, a general standard is often \u201call that may sensibly be expected if delegated authority is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>equal to the sundry situations which may arise and for which a more precise formula cannot be devised without hurtful inflexibility.\u201d <em>Elizabeth Fed. S &amp; L Ass\u2019n v. Howell, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>190, 194 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">PLICO\u2019s violations of the statute were fully exposed and fully explored in the administrative hearing. Specific, detailed factual findings and legal conclusions were set forth. There was no <em>ad hoc </em>legislation involved. The standards of performance articulated in the statute are neither so imprecise nor so vague as to offend due process. Rather, the guidelines contained in the Unfair Claim Settlement Practices Act are sufficiently informative to instruct insurance companies in the regulation of their business practices and to adequately guide the department in its review of those practices. The Legislature could not have intended that insurers\u2019 claim settlement practices go unmonitored or uncorrected until promulgation of administrative rules. <em>See Trap Rock Indus., Inc. v. Kohl, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">There is no indication that the final decision of the Commissioner or the initial decision on which it was based were arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. <em>Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571 (1980); <em>Campbell v. Civil Service Dep\u2019t, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">PLICO next argues that the Commissioner improperly concluded that 114 separate statutory violations had been committed. PLICO suggests that since the consequences \u201care severe and may result in loss of rights,\u201d the administrative proceedings are <em>quasi </em>-criminal in nature. Hence it concludes that since the 114 alleged violations are all of the same nature, they should merge in one offense. We find that argument frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Although one may not be punished twice for the same offense, <em>State v. Best, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>56, 60 (1976), we do not deal here with a criminal or <em>quasi </em>-criminal proceeding. Furthermore, the acts with which defendant is charged are not a single offense but separate and multiple offenses. The separate acts charged violated the rights of different persons or manifested distinctly different violations of the rights of a single individual. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>conclude that PLICO was properly determined to have committed 114 separate violations of the Unfair Claim Settlement Practices Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">We next turn to defendant\u2019s argument that the Commissioner lacks authority to order insurance benefit payments referred to in the administrative decision as \u201crestitution\u201d to the 17 individual claimants. It is conceded that the Unfair Claim Settlement Practices Act contains no direct reference to such power. Hence appellant insists that absent specific legislative authorization, the Commissioner exceeded his authority and could not lawfully order payment of individual claims. Instead, it insists that \u201cthe only forum for a money judgment remedy on a contract claim is in the courts, not in the office of the Commissioner of Insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">As the administrative law judge recognized, the \u201crestitution\u201d ordered here was not reimbursement to the individuals of premiums paid but rather the payment of disputed claims. Hence she concluded \u201cthat the proper and only forum for a money judgment remedy on a contract claim is in the judicial branch, not the executive branch.\u201d We agree with her conclusion that an Executive Department head lacks implied power to act as a court of claims. Absent \u201cexplicit statutory grant of power\u201d, no such jurisdiction may be assumed by an administrative agency. Where there is reasonable doubt that a particular power resides in an administrative agency, the power is denied. <em>Swede v. Clifton, </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>303, 312 (1956). Considerations of sound judicial administration lead us to conclude that jurisdiction to adjudicate such claims, involving as they do here interpretation of contractual rights and remedies, is originally cognizable in the Law Division where such plenary proceedings as may be necessary can be provided. <em>Frapaul Constr. Co. v. Transportation Dep\u2019t, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 92 (App.Div. 1980); <em>see, also, Pfleger v. N.J. State Highway Dep\u2019t, </em>104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>289, 293 (App.Div. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Nevertheless, the administrative tribunal was also required to deal with each count alleging unfair practices, including those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>charging failure to pay legitimate claims. Detailed evidence was taken and specific findings of fact were made. Under those circumstances it would be imprudent and wasteful to require each claimant to institute a new action at law for breach of contract and produce the same evidence heard by the administrative law judge. We conclude, therefore, that the action instituted in the Law Division by the Commissioner was an appropriate vehicle for prosecution of the 17 individual claims as a limited class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Our Supreme Court has recently recognized \u201cthat there are important goals to be achieved from the prudent and selective application in administrative proceedings of such doctrines as <em>res judicata, </em>collateral estoppel, and the single controversy rule.\u201d <em>Hackensack v. Winner, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>1, 31 (1980). We are satisfied that the concept enunciated in <em>Winner </em>is equally appropriate here. The findings of an administrative law judge, when fully and amply supported by substantial credible evidence in the record and amply enlarged by specific detailed findings of fact, can suffice to provide the Law Division with prima facie evidence of validity of the individual claims by a limited application of the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>Where, as here, no jury demand has been made, the administrative findings are sufficient to shift the burden to defendant to go forward with proof to justify denial of relief to any individual member of the class of claimants identified in the agency determination. \u201cWhen an administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity and resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate, the courts have not hesitated to apply <em>res judicata </em>to enforce repose.\u201d <em>United States v. Utah Constr. &amp; Min. Co., </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>394, 421-422, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1545, 1560, 16 L.Ed.2d 642 (1966). See, also, cases collected in <em>Davis, Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 18.03.1 to \u00a7 18.07 at 116 to 123 (1980 supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We conclude, therefore, that a remand to the Law Division is appropriate. Defendant shall be given the opportunity to produce any additional evidence it may deem relevant with regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>to the 17 individual claims for insurance benefits. Appropriate notice should be given to the individual claimants to enable them to participate and produce additional proofs should they deem it necessary. In connection with any individual claim on which additional proofs are presented, new findings of fact and conclusions of law will be required. On those claims which are not the subject of additional proofs, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>may be applied and a final judgment entered as to each such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Since the penalty imposed was based upon PLICO\u2019s failure to comply with the Commissioner\u2019s order to \u201cmake restitution\u201d of the individual claims for insurance benefits, it cannot stand. Imposition of the penalty is reversed without prejudice to the right of the Department of Insurance to institute such further proceedings therefor as it may deem appropriate. The judgment of the Law Division is vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In all other respects and except as modified herein, the administrative order appealed from is affirmed. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
