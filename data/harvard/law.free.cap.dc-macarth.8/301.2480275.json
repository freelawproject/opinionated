Merrill for re-issue of patent No. 28,762, granted January 19,1860, for improvement in lamps. The Commissioner rejected the application on the ground that the alleged improvement had been anticipated by a patent granted to Hale &amp; Chandler March 1, 1859;. The invention is described in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-12\"><em>A. Pollock </em>and M. <em>Bailey </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-13\"><em>Marcus S. Hopkins </em>for the Commissioner of Patents:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-14\">The only difference between the two devices, if there be a difference, is in the position of the flanges on the wick-tube as shown by the respective drawings and models. Merrill shows his flange at the top of the wick-tube, and Hale &amp; Chandler <em>near </em>the top \u2014 about one-sixteenth of an inch below it \u2014 in their model. But they direct in their patent that it is to be put <em>at </em>or near the top.\u201d Whether or not the effect would be materially different with the flange one-sixteenth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>of an inch from the top instead of at the top is, perhaps, questionable, and I have, at present, no means of determining. But, admitting that it would be different, tlie question for the court is whether the words \u201c <em>at or </em>near, \u201d in the patent of Hale <em>&amp; </em>Chandler, did not mean <em>at </em>the top as well as <em>near </em>the top of the wick-tube. No argument can aid the court in deciding this. Patents are to be construed liberally. <em>Parker </em>vs. <em>Stiles, 1 </em>Fish., P. R. If the devices be held to be practically the same in construction and position, and it be thought that Merrill was seeking a different object or effect, which Hale <em>Si </em>Chandler did not contemplate, then I submit this is immaterial; that Hale <em>&amp; </em>Chandler are entitled to all the benefits of the operation of their flange in the position they specified, whether they understood and contemplated them when they made their invention or not. The discoverer of the fact that, when applied <em>\u201cat\u201d </em>the top of the tube, as their patent specified, instead of <em>near </em>the top, the flange produced-a better effect, was not an inventor of a new device, but the mere dicoverer of a function of an existing device. <em>Morton </em>vs. <em>New York Eye Infirmary, </em>2 Fish., 320.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-6\">The case resolves itself into this question: When one man has a patent for employing a flange \u201cat or near\u201d the top of a lamp-wick tube, can another man properly be granted a patent for employing a like flange <em>at </em>the top of a like lamp-wick tube in the same manner, to be used in the same way, because he sets up a different reason for doing it, or a different theory of its effect ? If Hale <em>&amp; </em>Chandler should come into the Office now with a re-issue application, and claim the flange \u201cat or near\u201d the top of the tube, such a claim, according to the established practice of the Office, would be granted them, (Commissioner\u2019s Decisions for 1870, p. 170,) because that is the invention actually set forth by them in their patent. <em>O\u2019Reilly </em>vs. <em>Morse, 15 </em>Howard; <em>Battin </em>vs. <em>Taggart, </em>17 Howard; <em>Hussey </em>vs. <em>McCormick, 1 </em>Fish., 509.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b316-7\">Cartter, Ch. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amo\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents rejecting an application for the re-issue of patent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>No. 28,762, granted to Iiufus S. Merrill, January 19, 1860, for an improvement in lamps.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The invention is a flanged lamp-wick tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The flange is placed on the tube, or made a part of it, and extends around its mouth in the plane of its top. The object of employing it in this position, as stated in the application, is to deflect the ascending current of air which supports combustion, and cause it \u201cto impinge at an angle upon the flame, to produce more perfect combustion.\u201d The appellant claims, \u201cin flat-wick lamp-burners, of otherwise ordinary or suitable construction, a laterally-projecting deflecting-flange, adapted to the top or mouth of the wick-tube, and constructed substantially as described, to operate in the manner and for the purpose set forth.\u201d This claim whs rejected by the Commissioner upon the patent of Hale &amp; Chandler, No. 23,085, granted March 1, 1859, which shows a like flange placed upon a flat lamp-wick tube, as the patent describes, <em>\u201cat or near </em>the top of the wick-tube,\u201d for the purpose \u201cof equalizing the aerial current as it passes upward toward the flame,\u201d and making \u201cthe flame more even and uniform.\u201d The model and drawing of this patent show the flange a trifle below the top of the tube. Nothing is said in either of the patents, or in. the re-issue application under consideration, with reference to the width of the flange employed, although it is obvious that its effect in deflecting the ascending current of air depends about as much upon its width as upon its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The object sought by both patentees in the use of the flange was to obtain a better light; but their explanations how and why the flange improved the flame were different. Hale &amp; Chandler said it equalized the ascending air-current and made the flame more uniform; while Merrill has another hypothesis \u2014 in fact, two others. In his original patent he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">\u201cThis my improvement relates to coal-oil burners, constructed in such a manner as to impel the vapors generated in the oil-reservoir, and issuing therefrom, to mingle with a current of air, and to impinge upon the flame, and thus supply it v ith the quantity of oxygen requisite to consume entirely the hydrogen and carbon of the oil and vapor decomposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>by heat, and thereby avoid the production of smoke and increase the brilliancy of the light, without, however, augmenting the consumption of oil.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In his re-issue application he says the \u201c main point\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnI\">\u201c That the ascending current shall be deflected away from the base of the flame and caused to impinge upon the flame at a point higher up. The flange constitutes a shield or barrier which surrounds the base of the flame, and the air must pass outwardly around this obstacle before it can reach the flame, and is consequently compelled to strike the flame at a point above its base.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The latter explanation is probably the true one, and it no-doubt sets out the most important function of the flange. But there is nothing in either of the patents before us to show that this was originally contemplated or understood by either of the patentees. The solution of the issue herein is to be found in the naked statement of the case. The improvement of Merrill, sought <em>to </em>be re-issued, was anticipated by the patent granted to Hale <em>&amp; </em>Chandler March 1, 1859. The specification of Hale &amp; Chandler, enlightened, by their model, makes their earlier invention identical with the subsequent invention of Merrill. It is true that each declares a different purpose in the result of their respective inventions. And perhaps if the claim of different and distinguished results was to control the subject, the applicant might be entitled to a re-issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">It is not purpose or results that are the subject of patent, but the instrumentality, contrivance, or machinery through the agency of which results are effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">It is an axiom in mechanics and mathematics, and a self-evident truth of universal application, that the same causes produce the same results. Itj therefore, the two inventions are substantially the same in fact, whatever may be claimed by either party in effect, in contemplation of patent-law they are one as a necessary and legal consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">The subsequent invention of Merrill must yield to the-prior patent of Hale <em>&amp; </em>Chandler.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">It is the judgment of the court that the decision of the Commissioner is right, and it is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
