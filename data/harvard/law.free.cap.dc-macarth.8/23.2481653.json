It was also shown upon the trial that about the middle of April, 1870, the glass-works were destroyed by fire, and that plaintiff, at the request of defendant, superintended the rebuilding of the same for nearly two months, when he again commenced the manufacture of glass, and continued so to do until February 11,1871. It was while plaintiff was superintending the rebuilding of the works that the original agreement was reduced to writing, and at the expiration of the eight months therein mentioned, he elected to have the sum of $600 in money instead of an interest to that amount in the glass-works, which the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>refused to pay. Upon this state of the proof the defendant\u2019s counsel prayed the court to instruct the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">\u201c If the jury find from the evidence that, during several months of the period referred to in this special agreement offered in evidence, the glass-factory of the defendant was not in operation, having been destroyed by fire, then the plaintiff is nob entitled to recover the $600 provide'd for in said special agreement, but only so much as the services actually rendered by the plaintiff were reasonably worth, over- and above what has been paid to him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">Which said instructions the court refused, and the case is-here upon exceptions to this ruling.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-8\"><em>Brown &amp; Hawes </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-9\"><em>Cox &amp; Webb </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b38-10\">By the Court :</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">We think the proof shows a substantial compliance on the-part of the plaintiff with the agreement. It is contended that he could not perform his duties as foreman of the glass-works, from the time they were destroyed by fire until they were rebuilt ; but we think that this proposition is not applicable to the facts of the case. The contract was made and executed about two months after the fire, and the defendant having-signed it with knowledge of that fact, he is now estopped from denying that the plaintiff is entitled to the full benefit., of its provisions. It is clear to 11s that, by executing the agreement at that time, the defendant recognized the services, rendered by the plaintiff as having been rendered in performance of its conditions. It was reduced to writing after the-destruction of the works, and while the plaintiff was superintending their reconstruction. By the terms of the contract, plaintiff is to take charge of the works, and by the proof he was then engaged, with the knowledge and approbation of the defendant, in the work of superintending them. We think there is no substantial variance between the proof and the allegation. The instruction asked for was properly refused, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
