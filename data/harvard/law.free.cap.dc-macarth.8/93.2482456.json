The declaration describes the bond and alleges a breach of its condition, and then concludes, \u201c Wherefore, the defendants became liable to pay the amount aforesaid,\u201d but it does not show that the defendants neglected to pay the same, or that it was still unpaid. The defendants demurred that the declaration was bad in substance, which was overruled by the court below, whereupon the defendants appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-10\"><em>Fred.

The declaration should not only state the breach complained of, but the non-payment of the amount due upon the specialty. The simplified form prescribed by our common-law rules makes it a necessary allegation that the sum claimed \u201c is still unpaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">As this essential requisite is wanting, the circuit court erred in overruling the demurrer, and the order appealed from must therefore be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
