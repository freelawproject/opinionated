The facts appearing from the bill of exceptions are? that the plaintiff purchased an emigrant through-ticket from New York to the city of Washington, and received through-checks for her baggage; that she procured all her baggage upon reaching Washington, with the exception of the piece represented by a check introduced in evidence, and which has never been delivered to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-14\">The three roads which constitute the throngk-line, are the Camden and Amboy, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Companies, and the fare received for through-tickets is accounted for by the first company to the other companies according to their established rates, but there is no division of losses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-15\">The defendant owns and operates the railroad extending from Baltimore to the city of Washington, and by the arrangement between said companies the emigrant-baggage is transferred by the Philadelphia and Wilmington to the Bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>timore and Ohio Company at their station in the city of Baltimore, and there receipted for by defendant\u2019s agent; that defendant had no baggage-agent at New York; and that in point of fact the baggage in question was not received or receipted for by defendant\u2019s agent in the month of April, 1870, in the city of Baltimore, or elsewhere. Whereupon the defendant\u2019s counsel prayed the court, if the jury believed that there was such an arrangement as has been stated between the three companies, then the plaintiff was not entitled to recover without showing the receipt of the missing baggage by the agent of the defendant, which the court refused; and this constitutes the. first exception, and is the only one necessary to mention in this statement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-6\">W. <em>A.

Because the court below erred in overruling the first prayer of the defendant in the court below, as said prayer was, and is, a correct statement of the law applicable to the state of facts proved on the trial of the case at bar in the court below, and, therefore, it should have been granted. In support of this proposition the counsel for the appellant cit\u00e9 and rely upon the following authorities:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-9\">2 Redfield on Railways, 106, sec. 102, and cases cited in notes. <em>McCann </em>vs. <em>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad </em>Company, 20 Maryland Reports, 202, 208, 209, and 211. <em>Nutting </em>vs. <em>Connecticut River Railway Company, </em>1 Gray\u2019s Report, 502.

This case was decided in 1871; and it was further held in this case that the receipt of the goods, and the delivery thereof by the last carrier, and the payment of the charges of its predecessors, do not render it liable for damages which occurred, before the goods came on its line. (See same case, at page 305 of 2 Redfield's Railway Cases.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b508-7\">Mr. Justice Mac Arthur</author>\n<p id=\"Asa\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Upon the facts stated it is quite clear that the defendant has been guilty of no negligence. The first carrier took the fare for the entire route, and gave a through check for the plaintiffs trunk, and that company is undoubtedly liable for its transportation through to Washington. It is now very well settled that, where a continuous line for transportation of passengers and freight is established by the owners of different railroads, the first carrier who receives fare for the whole route, and gives a through check for baggage, becomes liable for any loss or injury, not only on its own line, but on any other road in the connecting line throughout the whole distance. <em>Central Railroad </em>vs. <em>Copeland, </em>24 Ill., 332; <em>Lock Company </em>vs. <em>Nashua Railroad, </em>48 N. H., 330; S. C., 2 Redf Railway Cases, 290; Redf. Railway, 109, where the authorities on this point are reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The contract of the first company is to transport the pas. senger and his baggage to their destination without injury and without delay, and this rule meets public convenience by giving a certain remedy for any loss happening on any portion of the through line.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">An arrangement between the companies, such as is disclosed by the testimony, may resemble, but it certainly does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>not constitute, a partnership. Bach company in the connection receives its portion of the fare, according to a tariff established and regulated by its own will, and with regard to which the other companies are not consulted. They divide neither profits nor losses, but each receives its own fare through the agency of the first company. It would seem unreasonable to hold them responsible upon a principle of joint liability for any loss not occurring on their own road, except the company with which the contract was made. The trunk said to be lost in this case never came into the possession of the defendant\u2019s agents to be transported, and was in fact lost on another portion of the line. The instruction, therefore, asked by defendant\u2019s counsel was improperly refused. The judgment must be set aside, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
