The court unanimously held that the privilege of a witness-before Congress, or before any of its committees, stands on the same footing as the privilege of the members of that body, and that this does not extend to freedom from the service of a simple summons but only from arrest. As no&gt; privilege had been violated, the motion was overruled.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b580-9\"><em>R. S. Sale, </em>of New York, and <em>R. D.

Davidge </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion><p id=\"b580-7\">The privilege of a witness in attendance upon a congressional committee-is not higher than that of a member of Congress; he may, therefore, be served with a summons as defendant in a suit commenced in this court.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
