Seitz, his wife, principal defendants^ and certain other defendants whose rights are not affected by the decree passed in the cause. The bill alleges judgments obtained by plaintiff against George Seitz in 18C8, and in full force from that time to date of filing of bill, and that execution has been issued and returned <em>nulla bona. </em>It further alleges sundry purchases of real estate, made nominally by Mary E. Seitz, and in her name, in 1870 and in October, 1872; and charges specifically that said real estate was purchased really by George Seitz, and was paid for with money earned by him alone, and not by his wife; further, that the said real estate was conveyed to Mary E. Seitz with the fraudulent purpose of thereby hindering and delaying the plaintiff and other judgment-creditors of George Seitz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-13\">The answer of defendants, George and Mary E. Seitz, denies all fraud, and alleges that both pieces of property embraced in said bill were purchased out of Mary E. Seitz\u2019s \u201c own means and money \u2014 money earned and procured wholly by herself, and not from the said George, nor by or through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Mm or his exertions.\u201d How it was earned, or from whom it was procured, is not stated. A general replication was filed to the answers, and testimony was taken by defendants, Seitz and wife, to show that Mrs. Seitz acquired the means of purchasing property by engaging in the business of keeping boarders, who averaged about four in number, and the profits were proved to be but small. No other means of acquisition in Mrs. Seitz were made to appear in the testimony. The interest of the other defendants arose out of certain trust-deeds which need not be stated, as they were held to have been executed in good faith, and were therefore superior in equity to the judgments of complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-6\">On the hearing below, a decree was directed to be entered in favor of the plaintiff, not affecting, however, the rights of the other defendants as already mentioned. From this decree George and Mary E. Seitz appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-7\"><em>Samuel L. Phillips </em>and <em>R.

The cardinal rule of equity pleading, \u201c that a defendant who submits to answer must answer fully,\u201d has never been modified to any greater extent than this, viz, that he need not answer to any matter from a discovery of which he might have protected himself by demurrer or plea.

Whatever the opinion of the court might have been in regard to the sufficiency of the answer, had the case been set for hearing on bill and answer, it is submitted that, after replication filed and proofs taken on the part of the plaintiff, it was incumbent on the defendants to rebut any evidence tending to establish the fraud charged by the plaintiff. In the absence of such proof, a mere reliance on the denial, in terms of the bill itself, of the facts on which the fraud rested, is suspicious. Such an answer is unsatisfactory, and the presumption is against it, and not in its favor. <em>Clark's Executors </em>vs. <em>Van Riemsdyk, </em>9 Cranch, 160; <em>Callan vs. Statham, </em>23 Howard, 477; <em>Parker </em>vs. <em>Phetteplace, </em>1 Wallace, 684.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-10\">3.

Seitz, wife of the said George. The judgments in question were obtained in 1868. The property in question was purchased, part of it in 1870, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>and the other part in 1872. The bill charges that it was bought with the money of the husband, and that the deeds were made out in the name of the wife for the purpose of committing a fraud upon the husband\u2019s creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The answer denies all fraud, and alleges that the property was paid for by the wife\u2019s \u201c own means and money \u2014 money earned and procured wholly by herself, and not from the said George, nor by or through him or his exertions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Such an answer to such a charge appears to us to be entitled to very small, if any consideration. It is most vague and unsatisfactory, sets up no fact, contains nothing to satisfy the mind upon the subject, does not say how the money was earned or procured, or from what source \u2014 only that it was \u201cearned and procured.\u201d As we understand these terms, they mean that Mrs. Seitz by means of her own exertions earned the money during coverture; that it did not come to her by gift, or by bequest, but that in some way, in trade, in keeping boarding-house, or by other such business, she had procured the money with which the property in question was purchased. In this sense, the answer, so far from denying the charge of the bill, amounts to a confession of its truth. For, notwithstanding our recent act permitting married women to obtain and hold property in their own right, the earnings of a married woman are still the property of her husband, as much as they were, at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">But, in addition to this, the evidence in the cause establishes the fact beyond all controversy, at least beyond all doubt in our minds, that the property in question was paid for by the money of George Seitz himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">It is true that Mrs. Seitz performed the duty of a wife, and aided her husband in her own sphere, and that they kept a few boarders, and thus, possibly, some small profits were made. .But these profits, if any, were very insignificant in comparison with the value paid for the property, and, besides, they belonged to the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">On the other hand, he was carrying on the business of a baker, with an extensive custom, making money, and not paying his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">The decree of special term is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-12\">Mr. Justice Olin dissenting.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
