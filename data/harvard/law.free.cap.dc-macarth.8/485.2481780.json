He alleges performance, hut claims that defendant broke the contract by refusing to deliver to him any more papers. Held, that the plaintiff could not maintain an action on said contract, for the reason that it is void for uncertainty and want of mutuality \u2022 also for the reason that it is not alleged to he in writing- or to he performed within a year, and is therefore void, within the 4th .section of the statute of frauds.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-9\">STATEMENT OR THE CASE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-10\">This is an action for $6,000 damages for breach of contracts. The declaration contains three counts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-11\">I. The plaintiff says that John W. Forney, former proprietor of the Daily Morning Chronicle, agreed with the plaintiff to give him the exclusive right to sell and deliver the Daily Chronicle on a certain route in Washington City, in consideration of $250, and the further consideration that the plaintiff would faithfully deliver the same, and solicit subscribers therefor; said Forney to furnish as many papers as plaintiff might require for a reasonable compensation, and plaintiff to receive from subscribers a reasonable advance price therefor, said contract to continue as long as plaintiff should faithfully perform his part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-12\">That on January 3, 1S71, said Forney sold said paper to John M. Morris; and on June 16, 1871, the defendant was incorporated by act of Congress, and succeeded to the ownership of said paper; and said contract was renewed by the plaintiff with both said Morris and the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-13\">That the plaintiff always performed his part of said contract faithfully; but since July 1, 1873, the defendant broke the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>contract, by refusing to deliver him any papers, and by delivering directly to the subscribers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-6\">II. The second count is substantially the same as the first, except it alleges the contract was made directly with the defendant on the 16th June, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-7\">III. The third count states another similar contract and like breach thereof for another route, made December 9, 1872-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-8\">To this declaration the defendant demurs:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-9\">1st. Because the alleged contract is void for uncertainty and want of mutuality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-10\">2d. Because said contract is not alleged to be in writing, and shows a contract not to be performed within the year, and is void under statute of frauds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-11\">3d. Because said contract is in restraint of trade, and is therefore void as being against public policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-12\">4th. Because neither of tbe three counts allege the damage suffered for the separate and specific injury complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-13\">And the defendant demurs specially to the 1st count of the declaration:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-14\">1st. Because it does not state when the contract between plaintiff and John W. Forney was entered into.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-15\">The plaintiff joins in the demurrers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-16\">The circuit court sustained the demurrers to the declaration, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-17\"><em>Enoch </em>Totten, for the plaintiff, insists:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-18\">First. The demurrer was sustained below on the ground that the contract declared upon was within the statute of frauds, and therefore void, because by the terms thereof it <em>\u201c </em>was not to be performed in one year.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-19\">The agreement set out in the declaration does not fall within the statute. Brown on the Statute of Frauds, secs.. 276, 278, 279, and 282.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-20\">Second. The contract set forth in the declaration is good and is well pleaded. 1 Chitty\u2019s Pleadings, 297.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-21\"><em>W. Penn Clarke </em>and <em>William A. </em>Cook, for defendants, argued the following points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-22\">1. <em>The </em>contract, <em>as alleged in the </em>declaration, <em>is void for uncertainty and uiant of mutuality.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The adjudicated cases on this question are numerous and uniform. Among the earliest is that of <em>Lees </em>vs. <em>Whitcomb, </em>5 Bingham, 34, where it was held that a written agreement \u201c to remain with A B two years for the purpose of <em>learning </em>a trade,\u201d is not binding for want of reciprocity \u2014 namely, an engagement in the same instrument on the part of A B <em>to teach. </em>This is, in fact, the leading case. So, in <em>Sykes </em>vs. <em>Dixon, </em>1 P. and D., 463, an agreement by A to <em>work </em>only for B, without an engagement by B to <em>employ </em>A, was held not binding. And to the same purpose are the following cases: <em>Bates vs. Cost, </em>3 D. and R., 676; <em>Livingston </em>vs. <em>Rogers, </em>1 Caines, 583; <em>Tucker </em>vs. <em>Woods, </em>12 Johns., 190; <em>Keep </em>vs. <em>Goodrich, </em>12 Ib., 397; <em>Townsend </em>vs. <em>Fisher, </em>2 Hilton, 47; <em>Ballingall </em>vs. <em>Bradley, </em>16 Ill., 373; <em>Sims </em>vs. <em>McEwen, </em>27 Ala., 461; <em>Nounenbaker </em>vs. <em>Hooper, </em>4 E. D. Smith, 401. And in <em>Livingston </em>vs. <em>Rogers, </em>1 Caines, 583, it was expressly decided that mutual promises, to be binding, <em>must be concurrent and obligatory on both parties at the same time.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-6\">2. <em>The contract alleged, not being in writing, shows a contract not to be performed within the year, and is void under the statute of frauds.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-7\">The earliest and leading case on this subject is the well-known one of <em>Boydell </em>vs. <em>Drummond, 11 </em>East., 142, in which it was held that a parol agreement to become a subscriber to the <em>Boydell Shakspeare, </em>which was jpublished in numbers, which undertaking, in the contemplation of the parties, could not be performed or brought to a close for several years, was within the statute of frauds, and was, therefore, void. In another case, <em>Birch </em>vs. <em>The Earl of Liverpool, </em>9 B. and C., 392, a contract whereby a coachmaker agreed to let a carriage for a term of five years, in consideration of receiving an annual payment for the use of it, but which, by the custom of the trade, was determinable at any time within that period upon the payment of a year\u2019s hire, was an agreement to be performed within a year, and came within the prohibition of the statute. So in <em>Bracegirdle </em>vs. <em>Heald, </em>1 B. &amp; A., 722, an agreement for a year\u2019s service, to commence at a subsequent day, being a contract not to be performed within the year from the time of the agreement, must be in writing, and, therefore, no action could be maintained for the breach of a verbal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>contract made on the 27th day of May, for a year\u2019s service, to commence on the 30th of June following.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-6\">Modern cases are consistent with these early decisions, giving a construction to the fourth section of the statute of frauds, and without going into them at length, we refer to the following: <em>Hinkey </em>vs. Southgate, 11 Vermont, 428; <em>Foote </em>vs. Emmerson, 10 Ib., 338; <em>Drummond </em>vs. <em>Burrell, </em>13 Wend., 307; <em>Squire </em>vs. <em>Whipple, </em>1 Vermont, 69; <em>Cabot </em>vs. <em>Hashins, </em>3 Pick., 83; <em>Derby </em>vs. <em>Phelps, </em>2 N. Hamp., 515; <em>Wilson </em>vs. <em>Bay, </em>13 Indiana, 1; <em>Shute </em>vs. <em>Daw, </em>5 Wend., 204; <em>Sower </em>vs. <em>Winters, </em>7 Cowen, 263; <em>Hill </em>vs. <em>Hooper, </em>1 Gray, 131.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-7\">And the fact that the contract has been performed <em>in part </em>will not take the case out of the purview of the statute. Otherwise, if it has been fully performed. Upon this point see <em>Henin </em>vs. <em>Butlers, </em>2 App., 119; <em>Baldwin </em>vs. <em>Palmer, </em>6 Seld., 232; <em>Pierce </em>vs. <em>Payne, </em>2 Wms., (28 Vermont,) 34; Browne on Stat., of Frauds, 448.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-8\">Nor need the statute of frauds be pleaded where it appears from the record that the contract relied upon comes within its provisions. <em>Amburger </em>vs. <em>Marvin, </em>4 E. D. Smith, 393; <em>Smith </em>vs. <em>Fah, </em>15 B. Monroe, 443; <em>Osborne </em>vs. <em>Endicott, </em>6 Cal., 149; <em>Thurman </em>vs. <em>Stevens, </em>2 Duer., 609.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b502-9\">Cartter, Ch. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1g\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The judgment of the circuit court must be affirmed in this case for two reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">1. For want of mutuality in the contracts sued upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">2. Because the contracts come within the fourth section of the statute of frauds, requiring contracts not to be performed-within a year to be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
