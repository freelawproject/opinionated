Plea, <em>son assault demesne; </em>replication <em>de </em>injuria, on which issue was joined. The general issue was not pleaded. The defendant claimed the right to open and close; but the court ruled that although no plea of the general issue had been actually filed, it must be regarded as filed, the special plea not having been filed within the time prescribed by the rules of court, and, against the defendant\u2019s exception, gave the open and close to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>One King, a witness called by tbe plaintiff, among other things testified that within a day or two after the alleged assault he gave a written statement to one of the defendant\u2019s counsel. It was claimed that this testimony was not true, and, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, the court allowed one Henry Hilliard to testify that he was present and saw the statement of King taken down by the counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-4\">The court limited the number of experts to throe on each side. The plaintiff called three witnesses as experts. He then called one Davis, a physician of twelve years\u2019 practice, and the court, without intending to change or modify its order relative to the number of expert witnesses, against the defendant\u2019s exception allowed the witness to describe the condition in which he found the plaintiff on examination, and that on such examination he felt with his. hands the muscles of the plaintiff\u2019s legs and feet, and found those of the left leg softer than those of the right, and the left foot colder than the right. The defendant contended that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were, to some extent, feigned; andas tending to show this* he called a witness to testify to statements of the plaintiff on a former trial, and, against the defendant\u2019s exception, the plaintiff was allowed to put in evidence all that he said on that occasion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">The defendant excepted to the exclusion of the testimony of one Childs, a physician, called as an expert, who had examined the plaintiff\u2019s pulse, and who took the rate of the pulse of several healthy men who were present when the plaintiff\u2019s pulse was taken, and who had been subjected to nearly the same conditions as to temperature as the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">The action was originally commenced in the county of Coos, and on the defendants\u2019 motion the venue was changed to the eastern district of the county of Grafton. In opening the case to the jury, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel said the suit was brought in Coos county, nearly a hundred miles north, and after it had been pending there nine years, because it was said the defendant could not get a fair trial among his acquaintances, \u201c I am not saying for what reason \u201d \u2014 the defendant\u2019s counsel, interrupting, objected to these remarks. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cIt is important to know why we are here,\u201d and complained of the increased expense of trial caused by the change of venue. In his argument the defendant\u2019s counsel made some observations in justification of the defendant\u2019s application for a change of venue to a county where a trial might be had before a jury and in a community uninfluenced by local excitement or prejudice. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in his closing address to the jury, argued'that it was the defendant\u2019s assault that created a feeling against him in Coos county, where the public were familiar with the transaction, and that if a state of feeling existed in that county unfavorable to the defendant, it was simply because his case was of that kind that no civilized being could help being prejudiced against it. To this the defendant objected. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Further on in his argument the plaintiff\u2019s counsel said, \u201c I submit that for putting ns off, this delay, this dragging us into another county, we are entitled to compensation.\u201d To this the defendant objected. The court instructed the jury that the plaintiff was not entitled to damages for delay nor for the change of venue.

There being an absence of any evidence that injustice was done by the ruling on this point, this exception is not sustained. <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Woodman, </em>47 N.

H. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The number of witnesses called as experts may be limited by a special order, which should not be so modified as to give either party an unfair advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The admissibility of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony on a former trial, stands on the same ground as his statements on a former occasion. They are both admissible to contradict him, -but in such cases it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Ms right to have the whole statement relating to the same subject-matter, so that the connection may be seen and understood, and thus the jury be able to give the proper effect to the .contradiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The testimony of Childs was upon a collateral question, and it was for the court to determine whether any evidence should be received on that question, and to what extent the inquiry should be carried.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The exceptions to the remarks of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the opening statement are sustained. The objectionable remarks in the opening were upon a point not in issue, upon which evidence was not admissible, and about which comments were improper, and they were of a character to prejudice the jury against the defendant. So with the remarks in the closing argument to which exception was taken. They were not warranted by the evidence, and were upon a point which was not in any aspect of the case material. Why the venue was changed, and whether for sufficient reasons or not, was not in issue, and the subject was wrongfully presented for the consideration of the jury. The defendant was -entitled to a fair and impartial trial, and to the verdict of the jury upon evidence relevant and competent to prove the issues presented. It was the right of counsel in the closing argument to comment upon the evidence received on the trial, to criticise the character, conduct, appearance, motives, and testimony of the witnesses, so far as they had appeared and were relevant to the issue, and this field was broad enough. It is held to be the duty of the court to check any departure from the evidence, and to stop counsel when they introduce irrevelant matters or facts not supported by the evidence; and if objection is made it is error to permit it, and .a new trial will be granted. Proffatt Jury Trial, <em>s. </em>250.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The remarks objected to were calculated to withdraw the attention of the jury from the true issue, to excite in their minds a prejudice against the defendant which was not based on the evidence, and, if they had the slightest weight in the mind of a single juror, the defendant did not have that fair and impartial trial which was his right, and which it is the duty of courts to give. The verdict was not a true verdict, according to the law and the evidence given to the jury. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Henniker, </em>41 N. H. 317; <em>State </em>v. Foley, 45 N. H. 466; <em>State </em>v. Smith, 75 N. Ca. 306; <em>Coble </em>v. Coble, 79 N. Ca. 589; <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 49 Ind. 33; <em>Hennies </em>v. Vogel, 66 Ill. 401; <em>Rolfe </em>v. Rumford, 66 Me. 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">It is neither the duty nor the right of counsel to appeal to prejudices, just or unjust, against his adversary, outside the case he has to try. The fullest freedom of speech within the limits of the evidence should be accorded to counsel; but it is license, not freedom of speech, to travel outside the record, basing his argument on statements not supported by evidence, and appealing to prejudices which find no warrant in the case. <em>Brown </em>v. Swineford, 44 Wis. 282. The remarks to which exception was taken were of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>character. In his opening address to the jury, the plaintiff called their attention to the change of venue, and was arguing against the defendant upon the reason of his claiming that he could not have a fair trial among his acquaintances and neighbors, when he was interrupted by the defendant\u2019s objection. He. then insisted upon the propriety of such an opening, and complained of the change of venue. If the wrong had stopped here, the verdict could not have been sustained. Enough was done in the opening .to secure an unfair trial, and enough was afterwards done to accomplish the same result. By the plaintiff\u2019s opening, the defendant, in argument, was led into the natural mistake of justifying his application for a change of venue. The error of the defendant, in thus attempting to defend himself against the plaintiff\u2019s irrelevant and illegal attack, did not justify the repetition of that attack made in the plaintiff\u2019s closing argument. After the defendant had a second time objected to this course of proceeding, the plaintiff asked the jury to give him damages for the change of venue. This change, made for the purpose of giving the defendant a fair trial, was not only used to defeat that purpose, but was set up as a distinct ground of damages. The question is, whether the plaintiff can compel ^n abandonment of all effort to secure a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In some cases there may be a just presumption of fact that the jury are not influenced by evidence or arguments which they are instructed to disregard. <em>Burnham </em>v. Butler, 58 N. H. 568; Com. v. Cunningham, 104 Mass. 545, 547. In this case, such presumption would relieve the plaintiff from the consequences of his wrongful claim of damages for the change of venue, but not from the consequences of his reiterated argument that the state of feeling in Coos, on account of which the venue was changed, showed that he was entitled to damages for the alleged assault. On this point, the defendant's repeated objections were not sustained at the trial,, and the state of things which made the change of venue necessary was allowed to have unlimited effect in making it nugatory. The ability and persistence of the plaintiff\u2019s exertions in that direction leave no just ground for a presumption that they were unsuccessful. To sustain this verdict would be to hold that the change of venue was rightfully used to prevent the fair trial it was made to secure, and that a change of venue is always legal cause for turning justice aside by influences which the change is intended to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\"><em>Verdict set </em>aide.</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-7\">Bingham and Smith, JJ., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
