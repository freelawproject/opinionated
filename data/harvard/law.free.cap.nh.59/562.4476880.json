Facts found by a referee. Before February 10, 1879, the plaintiff used the horse in his staging business between New London and Bradford. February 9, he abandoned that business, and determined to seek other occupation. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>morning of February 10, he left the horse and other stage property in the care of an agent, and went in search of employment, intending to find work by which he could earn his living by teaming with this horse. Afterwards on the same day the horse was attached by the defendant. In a day or two the plaintiff made a bargain to work with the horse, teaming for a merchant of Sutton.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-4\">Flanders, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-5\">Albin, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-6\">Staging was the plaintiff\u2019s only business, and this he abandoned the night before the horse was attached. From that down to the time he closed his arrangement with the merchant at Sutton he was out of business. When the attachment was made he was not engaged in farming or teaming, nor had he any other actual use in which the labor of the horse was required.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b575-7\">Doe, C.
