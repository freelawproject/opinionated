The plaintiff claimed that it was exempt from attachment. He was superintendent of the Grafton county poor-farm. Besides three horses owned by the county, he kept his own horse on the farm; and his evidence tended to show that he used it to go to the store, post-office, and mill, buy cattle for the farm, convey his children to school three or four times a week, and his family to church on Sundays. Subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception, the court refused to instruct the jury that if the plaintiff required the horse in educating his children, such use would be actual within the meaning of the statute, \u2014 and instructed them that it must be required and used in gaining his livelihood, and not merely to occasionally convey his children to school and his family to church. Verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-12\"><em>Bingham, Mitchell Batchellor, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-13\">The plaintiff is entitled to the exemption of his horse when required for \u201c other actual use,\u201d as well as \u201c farming or teaming purposes.\u201d The statutes impose upon parents the duty of educating their children (Gen. Laws, <em>c. </em>91, s. 14), and provide in certain cases for the conveyance of children to school at the public expense. Gen. Laws, <em>c. </em>86, <em>ss. </em>24, 25, 26, 27. The statute of exemption should receive a liberal construction. <em>Peverly </em>v. <em>Sayles, </em>10 N. H. 357.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-14\"><em>Carpenter, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-15\">Actual use by the debtor, not by his family, exempts a horse from attachment. <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>58 N. H. 49. The purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>of the statute is to protect for poor debtors their means of subsistence. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. Alley, 45 N. H. 551; <em>Patten </em>v. Smith, 4 Conn. 455; <em>Caswell </em>v. Keith, 12 Gray 354. It is a statute of details, and is not to be extended beyond its fair import. <em>Somers </em>v, Emerson, <em>supra. </em>It is a fundamental principle, that all a man\u2019s property shall be liable for his debts <em>(Remmington </em>v. Cady, 10 Conn. 48; <em>Davenport </em>v. Lacon, 17 Conn. 281), and a statute in derogation of the rights of creditors should receive strict construction. <em>Patten </em>v. Smith, <em>supra; Buckingham </em>v. Billings, 13 Mass. 85.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b219-5\">Bingham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD\">Beasts of the plow, not exceeding a yoke of oxen or a horse, when required for farming or teaming purposes, or other actual use, are exempt from attachment and levy on execution. Laws of 1871, <em>c. </em>30 ; Gen. Laws, <em>c. </em>224, <em>s. </em>2. The \u201c other actual \u201d use is such other labor as the reasonable necessities of the debtor require. <em>Somers </em>v. Emerson, 58 N. H. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The duty of parents to educate their children is of the greatest importance. 1 Bl. Com. 450, 451. At common law this is said to be a moral but not a legal obligation. Cooley on Torts 40. Blackstone says it is a defect in the municipal laws of some countries that parents are not constrained to .perform this duty. Our constitution declares the promotion of morality and learning to be a public duty, and ten chapters of the statutes are devoted to the cause of education. Const., Part 1, Art. 6; Part 2, Art. 83; Gen. Laws, <em>cc. </em>85-94. The penalty imposed by Gen. Laws, <em>c. </em>91, <em>s. </em>16, for not sending children to school, illustrates the legal necessities of the plaintiff. It is not a matter of law that the use of a horse for conveyance cannot be necessary in the discharge of the duty of supplying a family with mental and moral instruction. The plaintiff\u2019s use of his horse for that and other purposes should have been submitted to the jury in.a more liberal way, on the broad question whether the horse was required for the plaintiff\u2019s actual use. While his mere unperformed duty of using his horse for any purpose is no ground of exemption, his duty and business, and his use of his horse in that duty and business, are evidence on the question of requirement for actual use.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-8\">Smith, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
