The plaintiff, a surety on the defendant\u2019s bond, is satisfied with the amount fixed by the decree, but appeals for the alleged reason that the account was settled upon insufficient notice, and that by reason of this defect the decree will be of no avail to the plaintiff in determining the sum for which he is liable as surety.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-11\">Dodge, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-12\">The purpose of the appeal is to cause the decree of the probate court to be affirmed so as to protect the plaintiff against all parties.

Hall, 56 N. H. 324; <em>Clark v. </em>Courser, 29 N. H. 173. If the notice was insufficient to give the probate court jurisdiction, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>can cause another proceeding to be instituted, upon due notice, for the settlement of the defendant\u2019s account in the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b329-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
