Since then the plaintiff has rendered other services for the defendant in the above suits, for which he has brought a third suit against the defendant. All three suits are still pending-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">The defendant claims that this action cannot be maintained, because the contract was entire and indivisible, and the action was prematurely brought, and this question was reserved.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-6\"><em>Dodge </em>and Smith, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-7\">Hatch, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9\">cited <em>Eliot </em>v. <em>Lawton, </em>7 Allen 274, 276; <em>Mygatt </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>45 N.

This is an exception to the general rule in relation to contracts for services, and is not recognized here. <em>Livermore </em>v. <em>Rand, </em>26 N. H. 85. It is claimed that that case was not well considered, but we see no sufficient reason for the exception, or for not adhering to that decision. No good reason can be given for applying a different rule to contracts for the services of an attorney, from that applied to the physician, the mechanic, or the laborer. The question in all such cases is, What was the contract? Was it entire and indivisible, or the contrary? And these questions depend upon the particular evidence in each case, and are to be decided in the same manner and are governed by the same rules as all other questions of this character. What was the agreement and understanding of the parties ? Upon what common ground did their minds meet ?</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">The auditor has failed to answer these questions, and the report should be recommitted for him to find specifically what the contract was.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b29-12\">Allen, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
