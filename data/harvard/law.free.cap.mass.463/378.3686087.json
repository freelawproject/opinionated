L. c. 265, \u00a7 16; armed home invasion in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C; assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A <em>(b)\\ </em>and assault and battery in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A divided panel of the Appeals Court affirmed the convictions, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 587 (2011), and we granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the assault constituted a consensual sexual encounter. He thus argues that, in light of the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 577-578 (2003) <em>(Lawrence), </em>the trial judge committed constitutional error by not instructing the jury that consent is a defense to the crimes of armed home invasion and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The defendant also claims that the judge erred by admitting certain evidence regarding materials retrieved from his home computer. This evidence included eight photographs and one ninety-second \u201cvideo clip\u201d (video), each depicting a nude or partially nude woman being strangled seemingly to death; an Internet article reporting the successful appeal of a man convicted of four strangulation murders; and testimony regarding the number of images stored on the computer \u201cthat were strangulation-oriented or had strangulation themes,\u201d as well as testimony about Internet searches and the number of files saved on the computer that concerned asphyxiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">We conclude that there is no conflict between the reasoning of <em>Lawrence, supra, </em>and our prior decisions holding that consent is not a defense to the crimes charged, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>430 Mass. 643, 652-653 (2000) (armed home invasion), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 310 (1980) (assault and battery by means of dangerous weapon), and the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>appropriately instructed the jury on consent. We further conclude that, although admission of the photographs, article, and testimony were proper, the judge\u2019s failure to view the video prior to ruling that its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect was an abuse of discretion. Consequently, we have independently reviewed the content of the video in the context of its use at trial and conclude that it was highly probative of the defendant\u2019s motive and intent, the principal issues contested at trial, outweighing its plainly prejudicial effect. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><em>Background. </em>We recite the essential facts the jury could have found, the details of which are set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carey, supra </em>at 588-591.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">1. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case. </em>In the spring of 2007, the victim and her husband were separated, the victim living with their twelve year old son in Hamilton, and her husband residing in an apartment in Arlington. The couple were in the process of reconciling, however, and the husband frequently spent time at the Hamilton home. The defendant lived with his girl friend in Braintree; however, the defendant\u2019s former wife lived near the victim and was her friend. The defendant performed work on the victim\u2019s home and had become acquainted with the victim\u2019s husband through their mutual interest in golf. The defendant\u2019s daughter was also friendly with the victim\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">On the evening of June 6, 2007, the victim\u2019s son informed her that he needed to bring a Spanish food dish to school the following day. After a brief trip to the market to purchase ingredients, the victim began making a flan in the kitchen on the first floor of her home. Her son was in his second-floor bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">At approximately 9:40 p.m., the victim heard a knock on a glass door that separated the kitchen area from a rear deck. Thinking it was her husband, who had just left to return to his apartment, the victim walked toward the door and recognized instead the defendant. She opened the door for the defendant, who entered and asked for her husband. When the victim informed him that her husband was not there, the defendant responded, in an aggressive tone, \u201cWhy would he invite me over for a drink if he\u2019s not here?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Frightened, the victim sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>gested that they telephone her husband, but the defendant declined the offer. The victim then asked the defendant, who looked \u201cdrunk\u201d and whose breath smelled of alcohol, to leave. She explained that she had to finish making the dessert, and moved toward the glass door through which the defendant had entered the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The defendant, however, did not leave. Instead, he attacked the victim, wrapping a necktie around her neck and pulling it from both ends. The victim managed to place her hands between the tie and her throat as the defendant continued to pull on the ligature. The two struggled, and the victim knocked over a heavy chair before falling to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">As the victim \u201cbegan to fade out,\u201d she heard her son run downstairs. The son testified that, on reaching the kitchen area, he saw the defendant choking his mother, who was on the floor and trying to free herself from the defendant\u2019s grasp. When the son yelled, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d the victim told him to \u201c[g]et a knife and stab him.\u201d The son went to the kitchen, retrieved a small knife, and stabbed the defendant in the back. When he did so, the blade of the knife separated from the handle. The son then dropped the handle, grabbed the defendant, and attempted to pull the defendant away from his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">At some point, the defendant released his hold on the victim\u2019s throat and advanced toward the son. When he saw that the victim had risen to her feet, however, the defendant moved back toward her and punched her in the forehead and mouth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The victim, her son, and the defendant then ran from the house. The victim ran to one neighboring house, and her son fled to another. The defendant got into his vehicle and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The victim\u2019s neighbors contacted the police soon after the victim and her son arrived at their respective houses. Police officers arrived and examined the area, noticing signs of a struggle in the victim\u2019s house and discovering a piece of a necktie on the deck behind it. A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analyst testified at trial that hairs found on the tie matched that of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>victim, and that \u201chandler DNA\u201d discovered on the tie was a mixture from at least three people, including the victim and the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">As part of their investigation, State police conducted a forensic examination on the defendant\u2019s home computer. Sergeant Thomas Neff testified that, during the examination, he retrieved from the computer \u201cfour hundred or more\u201d images \u201cthat were strangulation-oriented or had strangulation themes,\u201d as well as the ninety-second video depicting a man strangling a naked woman, apparently to her death. Neff also informed the jury that he found 978 \u201chits\u201d and forty-seven files related to the term \u201casphyxia.\u201d One of the \u201chits\u201d led to an article, accessed by the defendant, about a man whose convictions of strangling four women to death were reversed on appeal. Eight photographs, the video, and the article were admitted in evidence, as was testimony concerning the quantity of material retrieved from the defendant\u2019s computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">2. <em>The defense. </em>The defendant admitted at trial that he had entered the victim\u2019s house and strangled her with a ligature.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But he testified that he did so as part of a consensual sexual encounter, and without any intention to harm or kill the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">According to the defendant, he and the victim had sexual intercourse twice in February, 2007.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He enjoyed asphyxiation as a means toward sexual gratification, and the victim had allowed him to choke her with his hands on one occasion. When he arrived at her home on the evening of June 6, 2007, the defendant intimated his desire for sexual intercourse, and the victim acquiesced. He then placed the tie around her neck and began to pull it, all the while rubbing his genitals against her body to obtain an erection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant admitted that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>continued his efforts even after the victim knocked over a chair, fell to the floor, and warned him that her son was in the house. He claimed to have stopped only when he felt the son\u2019s presence behind him, at which point he released the victim and left the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">3. <em>Jury instructions on consent. </em>Defense counsel alluded to the encounter as consensual in his opening statement and stressed that view again during his closing argument, although he did not use it as a basis to request a jury instruction that the victim\u2019s consent could act as a defense to the charges of armed home invasion and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The judge, however, raised the issue of consent during the charge conference, at which time defense counsel conceded that controlling precedent precluded such instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>430 Mass. 643, 653 (2000) (Mahar); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 310 (1980) <em>(Appleby). </em>Thus, defense counsel did not object when the judge instructed the jury, both during the initial charge and in response to a question submitted during their deliberations, that \u201cconsent is immaterial\u201d to the charge of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similarly, defense counsel did not object to the judge\u2019s instruction that, with regard to the offense of armed home invasion, \u201cconsent cannot be considered legally significant unless the occupant who is allowing the person in has been made aware that the person at the door is armed with a dangerous weapon and is about to commit an assault once inside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Consent as a </em>defense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant now contends that, in light of the holding in <em>Lawrence, supra, </em>the judge erred by not instructing the jury that consent was a defense to his conduct. In that case, the Court deemed unconstitutional a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Texas statute that prohibited two persons of the same sex from engaging in consensual sexual intercourse. <em>Lawrence, supra </em>at 577-578. Overruling its decision in <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Hardwick, </em>478 U.S. 186 (1986) <em>(Bowers), </em>the Court recognized that \u201cliberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex,\u201d <em>Lawrence, supra </em>at 572, and concluded that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provided the petitioners \u201cthe full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578. The Court also adopted the reasoning of Justice Stevens\u2019s dissenting opinion in the <em>Bowers </em>case: \u201c[T]he fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice.\u201d <em>Lawrence, supra </em>at 577, quoting <em>Bowers, supra </em>at 216 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Grasping on to this language, the defendant contends that our decision in <em>Appleby, supra </em>at 309-311, in which we first ruled that consent was not a defense to a charge of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon committed as or as part of sexual activity, is no longer valid. Fie argues that the <em>Appleby </em>holding was motivated by a public policy disapproving of certain consensual sexual behavior and, therefore, represents precisely the type of morals-based judgment the Supreme Court rejected in <em>Lawrence. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In <em>Appleby, supra </em>at 298-299, the victim alleged that the defendant, Appleby, struck him with a riding crop after he served Appleby melted ice cream. Appleby, in turn, testified that, although he did not recall the specific incident at issue, he regularly beat the victim in the context of a consensual sadomasochistic relationship, in which the victim attained sexual gratification from the physical pain Appleby administered to him. <em>Id. </em>at 300-302. Consequently, the defendant requested that the judge instruct the jury that \u201cprivate, consensual sadomasochistic behavior is an \u2018absolute defense to the charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312. The judge declined to do so, and the jury convicted the defendant on one indictment charging him with \u201cassault and battery with a dangerous weapon, to wit: a riding crop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Affirming the conviction on appeal, we rejected Appleby\u2019s underlying assertion that, as a matter of law, a party could consent to become the victim of an assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. <em>Appleby, supra </em>at 309-311. We reasoned: \u201cThe fact that violence may be related to sexual activity (or may even <em>be </em>sexual activity to the person inflicting pain on another . . . ) does not prevent the State from protecting its citizens against physical harm\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 311. Accordingly, we adhered to the traditional view and fit the facts of the case into the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that \u201cto commit a battery upon a person with such violence that bodily harm is likely to result is unlawful, and consent thereto is immaterial.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>322 Mass. 606, 620 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The defendant\u2019s contention that <em>Lawrence </em>vitiates the validity of this holding is premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of the <em>Appleby </em>decision, as well as a selective misreading of <em>Lawrence </em>itself. First, in reaching our conclusion that one could not consent to violent conduct related to or constituting sexual activity, the court recognized the existence of some \u201cright to sexual privacy that citizens enjoy.\u201d <em>Appleby, supra </em>at 310. However, we reasoned that such a right \u201cwould be outweighed in the constitutional balancing scheme by the State\u2019s interest in preventing violence by the use of dangerous weapons upon its citizens under the claimed cloak of privacy in sexual relations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the foundation from which our decision sprang anticipated the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Lawrence </em>twenty-three years later that there is some sphere of sex-related activity on which the government should not, and cannot, intrude. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298, 301-302 (1974). Although we proceeded to set a boundary to this protected sphere of activity, we did not do so because of any societal disapproval of the underlying sexual conduct, but rather because the government has a legitimate interest in discouraging violent behavior between and against its citizens. See <em>Appleby, supra, </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farrell, supra </em>at 620-621 (Appleby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u201cwas tried for violating a statute that implies, as a matter of public policy, that one may not consent to become a victim of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon\u201d). See also Hanna, Sex Is Not a Sport: Consent and Violence in Criminal Law, 42 B.C. L. Rev. 239, 261 (2001) (\u201ccourt in <em>Appleby </em>goes out of its way to suggest that this is not a case directed against homosexuals, but rather focuses on the nature of the violence itself\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">At the core of his argument, the defendant suggests that in <em>Lawrence, </em>the Supreme Court articulated a sweeping prohibition against the regulation of consensual sexual conduct or, to state the converse, announced an absolute right of privacy in sexual affairs. As the Supreme Court of Nebraska explained in <em>State </em>v. <em>Van, </em>268 Neb. 814, 826 (2004), the Court did no such thing: \u201cThe <em>Lawrence </em>Court did not extend constitutional protections to <em>any </em>conduct which occurs in the context of a consensual sexual relationship. Rather, the Court indicated that State regulation of [private, consensual sexual activity] was inappropriate \u2018absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects.\u2019 <em>[Lawrence, supra </em>at 567]. In addition, it specifically noted that the case it was deciding did not involve \u2018persons who might be injured [or coerced].\u2019 <em>[Id. </em>at 578].\u201d We agree with this reading of <em>Lawrence </em>and understand the express limitations of that decision not only to align with our conclusion in <em>Appleby, </em>but also to anticipate and reject the very argument the defendant raises on appeal. The judge, therefore, appropriately adhered to our precedent. His instructions concerning the issue of consent were and remain correct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">2. <em>Admission of computer materials and related testimony. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The defendant next claims that the judge abused his discretion by allowing the Commonwealth to introduce in evidence the eight photographs and the ninety-second video depicting women in various states of undress being strangled, ostensibly to death; the Internet article regarding the successful appeal of a man convicted of four strangulation murders; and testimony regarding the number of explicit images and Internet searches found on the defendant\u2019s home computer. According to the defendant, admission of this inflammatory and explicit evidence was erroneous because it was of minimal relevance to any issue in the case, and any probative value it may have had was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. The defendant also claims that the judge abused his discretion by not watching the video before ruling on its admissibility or allowing the jury to view it.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">All evidence, including that of a violent or sexual nature, must meet the threshold test of relevancy; that is, it must have a \u201crational tendency to prove an issue in the case,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. LaCorte, 373 Mass. 700, 702 (1977), or render a \u201cdesired inference more probable than it would have been without it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>406 Mass. 78, 83 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>375 Mass. 438, 443 (1978). This, however, is only the first step in the inquiry, for even relevant evidence may not be admitted if \u201cits probative value is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 403 (2012). We entrust questions of relevancy and prejudicial effect to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose determinations we will not disturb except for \u201cpalpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvia, </em>456 Mass. 182, 192 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>434 Mass. 570, 579 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Here, the judge ruled that, while the computer materials as a whole were \u201ccertainly prejudicial to the defendant,\u201d they were highly probative of his intent and motive, as well as the victim\u2019s alleged consent. With regard to the photographs, article, and testimony, we see no cause to disrupt this ruling. The defendant\u2019s intent was the principal issue at trial, as the Commonwealth and the defendant sparred over whether he possessed the specific intent to kill the victim, a necessary element of the attempted murder charge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franchino, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 373 n.1 (2004), discussing G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 16. Thus, while the defendant alleged that he only strangled the victim as a means toward sexual gratification and without any intent to do her harm, the Commonwealth was entitled to introduce evidence revealing the scope of this fantasy and the likelihood that it included continuing the act to its natural completion \u2014 the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Although there was scant evidence establishing a temporal connection between the defendant\u2019s consumption of these materials and the incident at issue,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the contested materials fulfilled precisely this purpose. They were found stored on the defendant\u2019s computer, and the jury reasonably could have inferred that he possessed and viewed them. Contrast <em>United States </em>v. <em>Curtin, </em>489 F.3d 935, 962 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (Kleinfeld, J., concurring) (admission of five graphic, sexual stories selected from 2,998 single-spaced pages of material found on defendant\u2019s personal digital assistant failed relevancy standard of Fed. R. Evid. 401, in part because there was no evidence defendant had read them). The photographs depicted women being strangled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>and portrayed them afterward, seemingly lifeless and in sexual positions. These images, and the testimony regarding the additional images and searches related to strangulation and asphyxiation stored on the defendant\u2019s computer, were sufficiently similar to the way in which the defendant assaulted the victim to be relevant to and probative of his sexual desire and state of mind. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 757, 765-766 (2007) (where defendant alleged that touching of child victim\u2019s breast was accidental, presence of photographs of fully clothed young girls, photographs of nude adult men and women, pornographic magazines containing pictures of teenage girls, and small-sized underwear in his automobile was relevant to and probative of whether touching was intentional). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>408 Mass. 811, 820 n.9 (1990), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 469-472 (1982) (defendant\u2019s possession of magazine article about serial killings admissible as evidence of sexual desire and contemplation of modus operandi, where circumstances surrounding manner of death were sufficiently similar). The article similarly relates to the defendant\u2019s interest in and research of strangulation murders, even though it reported an incident void of sexual overtones.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">To be sure, this evidence was prejudicial to the defendant, insofar as the subject matter explored was explicitly sexual and violent. Yet, that fact alone is not enough to render the evidence inadmissible; to meet that threshold, any prejudicial effect must substantially outweigh the probative value. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olsen, </em>452 Mass. 284, 294 (2008) (\u201cThat the [contested evidence] may be gruesome or have an inflammatory effect on the jury does not render [it] inadmissible as long as [it] possesses] evidentiary value on a material matter\u201d). The judge took deliberate and meaningful steps to mitigate the prejudicial effect of the evidence,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and appropriately concluded that its probative value, which related to the core issue in dispute, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>comparatively high. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Darby, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 652, 654 (1994) (prejudicial error to admit photograph of male defendant in sexually turgid state where impotence or sexual dysfunction \u201cwas not, directly or inferentially, relevant to any issue in the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">We separately review the judge\u2019s decision to admit the ninety-second video. This video generally portrays a nude woman being strangled. More specifically, it depicts a man dressed in black standing behind the woman, who is seated on a chair. The man asks the woman if she is ready for her \u201csurprise,\u201d and, when she answers in the affirmative, he takes a cloth strip from his pocket, wraps it around the woman\u2019s neck, and strangles her. The woman struggles at first, but less so as time wears on. Her face begins to turn blue and, at the end, she apparently expires.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Commonwealth moved in limine to admit the video. After a hearing at which the Commonwealth described what it depicted and its relevance to the case, the judge ruled it to be admissible. As the defendant notes, the judge did not view the video himself, relying instead on the Commonwealth\u2019s description of it to render a ruling on its admissibility.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u201c[Tjrial judges must take care to avoid exposing the jury unnecessarily to inflammatory material that might inflame the jurors\u2019 emotions and possibly deprive the defendant of an impartial jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>420 Mass. 95, 109 (1995). Consequently, a judge must engage in a careful and reasoned assessment of any evidence proffered by the government that a criminal defendant contests; only then will the judge truly appreciate the substance and purpose of the evidence, thus enabling him fairly to balance the submission\u2019s prejudicial impact against its probative value. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Liefer, </em>778 F.2d 1236, 1241 (7th Cir. 1985) (\u201ctrial court must carefully assess all evidence offered by the government ... to ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>that . . . [it] has probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Although there may be instances where a judge can discharge this duty without reviewing the contested evidence personally, this is not such a case. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Loughry, </em>660 F.3d 965, 971 (7th Cir. 2011), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez-Flores, </em>418 F.3d 1093, 1098 (9th Cir. 2005) (positing that \u201c[t]here may be cases where the probative value of the evidence is so minimal that it will be obvious to the court that the potential prejudice to the defendant substantially outweighs any probative value the evidence might have\u201d). As the dissenting Justice in the Appeals Court so aptly noted, there is a particular nuance and impression of watching a video of the strangulation \u201cdeath\u201d of a woman that the Commonwealth\u2019s description, however accurate, simply could not capture. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 587, 597-598 (2011) (Grainger, J., dissenting). Given the highly inflammatory nature of the evidence, of which he was aware, the judge ought to have recognized the great potential for prejudice it carried and taken a moment to familiarize himself with its contents. Without having done so, the judge simply \u201ccould not have fully assessed the potential prejudice to [the defendant] and weighed it against the evidence\u2019s probative value.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Loughry, supra </em>at 972. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Curtin, </em>489 F.3d 935, 957-958 (9th Cir. 2007) (\u201cinflammatory . . . and reprehensible nature of [sexually explicit] stories, although generally relevant, is such that a district court . . . must know precisely what is in the stories in order for its weighing discretion to be properly exercised and entitled to deference on appeal\u201d; \u201c[o]ne cannot evaluate in a [Fed. R. Evid. 403] context what one has not seen or read\u201d). This failure is itself an abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fredette, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 253, 259 n.10 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">This conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry. Rather, it requires us to evaluate whether the error in failing to view the video personally before ruling on its admissibility prejudiced the defendant, if his objection was preserved, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), or posed a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, if not. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fredette, supra </em>at 258-259. Because the defendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>explicitly request that the judge watch the video himself and failed to raise this precise issue before the Appeals Court,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Commonwealth strenuously urges us to consider the defendant\u2019s argument under the less stringent standard of review. The defendant, in contrast, treats the evidentiary issue as though it were preserved and references the \u201cprejudicial error\u201d standard in his brief before us. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Because the error does not warrant reversal under either standard, we need not resolve this dispute. We have reviewed all of the disputed evidence and concur that the video, like the photographs, article, and Internet search testimony, was highly probative of the defendant\u2019s intent in strangling the victim. Granted, it posed a greater risk of prejudicing the defendant, but that risk did not subsume the probative value. The judge provided a curative instruction before playing it, and its content was confined to the exact act with which the defendant was charged. Contrast <em>United States </em>v. <em>Curtin, supra </em>at 938, 956-959 (although evidence relevant, admission of graphic stories portraying \u201cadults having sex with children\u201d constituted reversible error where judge did not read stories before admitting them and stories contained graphic descriptions of \u201cexcrescence\u201d of different order of magnitude than acts charged). The video, and all of the contested evidence, illuminated the defendant\u2019s state of mind. Thus, it was admitted for the legitimate purpose of establishing the probability that the defendant possessed the specific intent to kill the victim, and not merely to dupe the jury into believing he was \u201ca lewd man, and . . . that a man of his character would be likely to commit the crimes charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaSota, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 15, 27 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>321 Mass. 669, 670 (1947).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The jury acquitted the defendant on one other indictment charging him with assault and battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Both the defendant and the husband testified that, prior to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>arrival at the Hamilton home, the defendant had telephoned the husband and learned that he was driving to his apartment in Arlington, not to Hamilton.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-11\">The defendant was charged in separate indictments with assault and battery for each of these acts.

Given our ultimate conclusion that the judge\u2019s instructions on consent were not erroneous, however, we need not resolve the parties\u2019 resulting dispute regarding the appropriate standard of review.

We determined that \u201c[w]hen consent to enter is allegedly given to someone, in circumstances such as presented here, the purported consent cannot be considered legally significant unless the occupant has been made aware that the person at the door is armed with a dangerous weapon and is about to commit an assault once inside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652-653. Thus, \u201c[fjor practical purposes, permissive entry into a dwelling, and entry while armed in order to commit an armed assault, are mutually exclusive concepts because G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, implies, as a matter of public policy, that an occupant of a dwelling cannot consent to allow an armed intruder like the defendant inside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>to commit an assault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653, referencing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 310 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\">That American courts, by and large, have condoned certain harmful and injurious conduct carried out in a sporting contest does not diminish this conclusion. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collberg, </em>119 Mass. 350, 353 (1876). Cf. <em>Jaworski </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>241 Conn. 399, 408 (1997) (adopting reckless or intentional conduct standard of care for determining tort liability for injuries sustained during athletic events). To be sure, the leap between that body of law and the issue before us appears short: in both scenarios, an actor may perpetrate a seemingly violent act against his or her partner, but only in one is that actor held legally responsible for the resulting injury. Appearances, however, are often deceiving, as this leap disregards the vast gulf that exists between the organized, regulatory apparatus of sports competitions, and the intensely personal and private negotiations outlining the permissible bounds of sexual conduct. See Hanna, Sex Is Not a Sport: Consent and Violence in Criminal Law, 42 B.C. L. Rev. 239, 247-248, 255-256, 287-290 (2001). See also <em>Nabozny </em>v. <em>Barnhill, </em>31 Ill.
