Because parties to California RDPs have rights and responsibilities identical to those of marriage, pursuant to our recent decision in <em>Elia-Warnken </em>v. <em>Elia, ante 29 </em>(2012), the judge did not err in treating the parties\u2019 RDP as equivalent to marriage in the Commonwealth. We also conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in awarding physical custody of the children and attorney\u2019s fees to Hunter. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\"><em>Facts and background. </em>We present the essential facts found by the judge in her extensive written findings, reserving details for our discussion of the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Hunter and Rose began a dating relationship in Massachusetts in 2001. In the spring of 2002, they moved to California so that Rose could establish in-State residency and attend medical school. In the summer of 2003, the couple began to try to conceive a child; Hunter was the intended birth mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In September, 2003, the couple executed a declaration of domestic partnership that was registered in California in October, 2003. Important for our purposes is that, in September, 2003, the California Legislature amended its domestic partnership laws to grant same-sex domestic partners rights that are identical to those of marriage. 2003 Cal. Stat. 421, codified at Cal. Fam. Code \u00a7 297.5(a) (West Supp. 2012). The law applied retroactively to all RDPs that were not terminated prior to the statute\u2019s effective date of January 1, 2005. Cal. Fam. Code \u00a7 299.3 (West Supp. 2012). Hunter and Rose had notice of the change in the law; they did not dissolve their RDP, making them subject to the provisions of the 2003 statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In 2004, the couple bought a house. In 2006, after Hunter had several unsuccessful attempts to conceive a child that included undergoing medical procedures, the couple agreed that Rose would try to conceive. Her attempts were successful. While Rose was pregnant, the couple moved to Massachusetts, in part so that Hunter could obtain better health care coverage. Rose had obtained \u201cmedical rotations\u201d on the east coast. Rose gave birth to a daughter, Jill,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in a hospital in Rhode Island in August, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Both women contributed to Jill\u2019s care. Because Hunter\u2019s work schedule was more flexible, she accommodated Rose\u2019s clinical rotations. In September and October, 2007, Hunter was Jill\u2019s primary caretaker; she took time off from work and worked from home to care for her. In January, 2008, Rose contacted an attorney to initiate Hunter\u2019s adoption of Jill and the couple began collecting supporting affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The couple also planned to have another child together. After several more fertility treatments, Hunter conceived a child in April, 2008, using the same sperm donor Rose had used. Shortly thereafter, the relationship between the couple deteriorated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>ended in August, 2008, although they continued to live together. Because of Rose\u2019s rotation schedule, after the breakup, Hunter had an even greater parenting role.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In October, 2008, Rose and Jill moved out of the home they shared with Hunter, who continued to coparent Jill. Rose notified Hunter that she was accepting a four- to six-week rotation in Oregon and was taking Jill with her. She deceived Hunter by assuring her that she and Jill would return in late November or early December, and that she would provide regular updates about Jill as well as utilize a \u201cWeb camera\u201d so that Hunter could see Jill.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Instead, in November, 2008, Rose ceased all communication with Hunter. Rose canceled her cellular telephone service (and has never given Hunter her new telephone number), and did not respond to Hunter\u2019s attempts to communicate \u201cwith [Jill] by sending [her] packages . . . and home videos and [by] emailing and texting.\u201d Rose refused Christmas gifts Hunter sent to Jill. She also made decisions about Jill\u2019s daycare and living arrangements without notifying or consulting Hunter. Even after a temporary court order issued in February, 2009, allowed Hunter contact with Jill, Rose demanded that Hunter not refer to herself as \u201cmommy.\u201d Rose also deliberately applied for medical rotations and clinical assignments to keep Jill as far away as possible from Hunter. In short, \u201cshe did everything she could to eradicate . . . Hunter from [Jill]\u2019 s life.\u201d In addition, after promising to proceed with Hunter\u2019s adoption of Jill, Rose ultimately refused to allow it. Rose denies that Hunter has a parental bond with Jill and would like any relationship Jill has with Hunter to cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">At the end of November, 2008, Hunter filed a complaint for custody of Jill. In December, 2008, she filed an amended complaint in equity in which she sought sole physical custody of Jill and her unborn child, as well as a complaint for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Hunter gave birth to a daughter, Mia,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in January, 2009. Rose has provided \u201clittle to no\u201d child care to Mia, admits that she does not love Mia, and does not want legal or physical custody of her. In addition, although Rose admitted in an answer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>complaint for custody that Hunter used the same sperm donor as she had, she denies that Jill and Mia are sisters, has actively discouraged any relationship between the girls, and wants Jill\u2019s existing relationship with Mia terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Hunter\u2019s complaint for divorce was dismissed, the two remaining cases were consolidated, and a bench trial took place over several days in November, 2010, and January, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In her written decision, the judge made 726 enumerated findings of fact, further findings of fact, and 152 rulings of law. She dissolved the parties\u2019 RDP, declared that the parties were legal parents of both children, and granted sole legal and physical custody of Mia to Hunter (which Rose does not challenge) and joint legal custody of Jill with primary physical custody to Hunter. The judge set a parenting schedule of visitation between Rose and Jill. In a separate order the judge granted Hunter $180,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Recognition of California domestic partnerships.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Rose argues that the judge erred in determining that her California RDP was the equivalent of marriage in the Commonwealth and should be recognized under principles of comity. We considered the substance of Rose\u2019s arguments in our recent decision in <em>Elia-Warnken </em>v. <em>Elia, ante </em>29, 32-35 (2012). Here, it suffices to say that, as the judge found, California\u2019s domestic partnership law provides virtually identical rights as marriage. See Cal. Fam. Code \u00a7 297.5(a) (\u201cRegistered domestic partners shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law ... as are granted to and imposed upon spouses\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, failing to recognize a domestic partnership here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>would allow Rose to avoid obligations such as child support. <em>Elia-Warnken </em>v. <em>Elia, supra </em>at 34, quoting Singer, Same-Sex Marriage, Full Faith and Credit, and the Evasion of Obligation, 1 Stan. J. C.R. &amp; C.L. 1, 29, 36, 50 (2005) (\u201cthe \u2018needs of the interstate and international systems are better served by having a single clear answer to the validity of marriage,\u2019 because nonrecognition allows parties to avoid their obligations or leads to inconsistent legal obligations\u201d). It also would harm Jill because a child\u2019s welfare is promoted by ensuring that she has two parents to provide, inter alia, financial and emotional support. <em>See Adoption of Mariano, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 656, 661 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In addition, the judge did not err in determining that Hunter and Rose are the legal parents of both children under either Massachusetts or California law. Under Massachusetts law, children bom into a legal spousal relationship are presumed to be the children of both spouses. G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 6. Moreover, any child bom as a result of artificial insemination with spousal consent is considered to be the child of the consenting spouse. G. L. c. 46, \u00a7 4B.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Although Rose does not assert that Hunter did not consent to Jill\u2019s conception, she claims that she did not consent to Mia\u2019s conception. The judge\u2019s conclusion that Rose consented to Mia\u2019s conception is fully supported in the record: in 2007, Rose signed three consent forms for one clinic<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to administer artificial insemination to Hunter, and Rose provided blood for testing; after that attempt failed, Rose, among other things, accompanied Hunter to visits to another clinic and subsequent ultrasound and genetic counselling; she informed \u201cothers\u201d that the plaintiff\u2019s pregnancy was \u201cgreat news\u201d; and she altered her rotation schedule to accommodate the pregnancy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Likewise, under California law, parties to an RDP are treated the same as spouses in determining the rights and obligations with respect to a child of either of them. Cal. Fam. Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>\u00a7 297.5(d). A nonbiological mother is presumed to be a child\u2019s parent if the child is bom during the \u201cmarriage\u201d or if, inter alia, she \u201creceives the child into [her] home and openly holds out the child as [her] natural child.\u201d Cal. Fam. Code \u00a7 7611(a) &amp; (d) (West Supp. 2012). See <em>Elisa B. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>37 Cal. 4th 108, 119-120 (2005), quoting <em>In re Salvador M., </em>111 Cal. App. 4th 1353, 1357 (2003) (marital terms referring to presumed father \u201capply equally to women seeking presumed mother status\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See generally <em>S.Y. </em>v. <em>S.B., </em>201 Cal. App. 4th 1023, 1025-1026 (2011) (although no marriage or registered domestic partnership, under Cal. Fam. Code \u00a7 7611[d], judge did not err in holding that former same-sex partner was presumed parent of adoptive mother\u2019s children). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">2. <em>Primary physical custody of Jill. </em>Parents have an equal right to custody of their children. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beals, </em>405 Mass. 550, 554 (1989). \u201cIn custody matters, the touchstone inquiry [is] . . . what is \u2018best for the child\u2019. . . .\u201d <em>Custody of Kali, </em>439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003). \u201cThe determination of which parent will promote a child\u2019s best interests rests within the discretion of the judge . . . [whose] findings . . . \u2018must stand unless they are plainly wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 845, quoting <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. 182, 191 (1998). However, the judge must weigh \u201call relevant factors in determining the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Custody of Kali, supra, </em>quoting <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, supra. </em>The best interests of the child standard is applied in the context of the particular needs and circumstances of the child in question. See <em>Adoption of Vito, </em>431 Mass. 550, 566 (2000), and cases cited. The judge shall consider \u201cwhether or not the child\u2019s present or past living conditions adversely affect his physical, mental, moral or emotional health.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31. Factors a judge may weigh are whether one parent\u2019s home is more stable in terms of a parent\u2019s work schedule, whether siblings are being raised together, and whether one parent seeks to undermine the relationship a child has with the other parent. See <em>Adoption of Kali, supra </em>at 843, 847 (stability and flexible work schedule); <em>Adoption of Hugo, </em>428 Mass. 219, 230-231 (1998), cert. denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>sub nom. <em>Hugo P. </em>v. <em>George P., </em>526 U.S. 1034 (1999) (sibling relationship); <em>Custody of Zia, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 244 (2000) (custody to parent willing to respect other parent\u2019s role in child\u2019s life); <em>Zatsky </em>v. <em>Zatsky, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 7, 13 (1994) (custody based on parent\u2019s ability to subordinate her needs to those of children); <em>Haas </em>v. <em>Puchalski, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 555, 557 (1980) (denial of custody where home was not \u201csettled\u201d and child would be cared for by multiple providers rather than parent). See generally <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Massa, </em>431 Mass. 619, 623-624 (2000) (probate judge assessing and finding wife\u2019s efforts to disrupt husband\u2019s relationship with their children). The judge has discretion when awarding custody of a child to which we give \u201csubstantial deference.\u201d <em>Adoption of Hugo, supra </em>at 225, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Rose argues that the judge erred in granting primary physical custody of Jill to Hunter because, when the judge considered the best interests of the child, she ignored Rose\u2019s evidence that Jill is a well-adjusted, happy child, did not consider the harm that would befall Jill if the status quo were changed, and placed undue weight on Rose\u2019s conduct. She also alleges that there was an absence of evidence showing that Jill suffered harm by being removed from Hunter\u2019s care. The judge did not abuse her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Here, the judge found that Jill had developed a strong emotional bond with Hunter from Jill\u2019s birth until she was almost fifteen months old, after which Rose moved her to Oregon. Rose wrongfully removed Jill from Hunter when she moved to Oregon because Rose knew that Hunter was Jill\u2019s legal parent and, in doing so, disrupted Jill\u2019s attachment to Hunter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>458 Mass. 540, 546 &amp; n.11 (2010), citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30 (divorced parent may not remove child from other parent without permission or court order). Jill \u201cmore likely than not\u201d was harmed by Rose\u2019s actions, as evidenced by aggressive and \u201cclingy\u201d behaviors. The judge also found that Rose decided to move to Oregon and accepted employment in Michigan, to begin in July, \u201cwith little, if any, regard for [Jill\u2019s] basic and fundamental needs.\u201d Relying on the testimony of Hunter\u2019s expert, the judge listed the ways Rose\u2019s behavior exacerbated the harm to Jill, including failing to have a plan for maintaining Jill\u2019s ties to Hunter and Hunter\u2019s family (with whom Jill had formed attachments), and engaging in behaviors demonstrating an attempt to alienate Jill from Hunter, such as not allowing Jill contact with Hunter until ordered to do so by the court; telling Jill that Hunter was not her parent but a \u201cfriend,\u201d and referring to Hunter as \u201cthe person,\u201d \u201csomeone,\u201d or \u201cAmy\u201d; calling Hunter a \u201cdickwad\u201d in front of Jill; \u201cspecifically requesting] that [Mia] not be present\u201d during Hunter\u2019s Web camera sessions with Jill; and asking the court to order that Hunter not refer to herself as \u201cmommy\u201d during those Web camera sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The judge found that disrupting the attachment a child has to a parent and behaving in ways designed to alienate a child from that parent causes harm that can be long term, and if sole physical custody must be awarded because of geographic distance between parents, \u201cit is in the best interests of a child to be in the sole custody of the parent who can support the involvement of both parents rather than with the parent who alienates the child from the other parent.\u201d Moreover, she found that Hunter was entirely supportive of Jill\u2019s relationship with Rose and respects Rose\u2019s role as Jill\u2019s other parent as demonstrated by the fact that, during her parenting time, she has Jill telephone Rose every night to say good night, refers to Rose as \u201cMommy Miko,\u201d and keeps a photograph of Rose in Jill\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In addition to weighing these factors, the judge also assessed the stability each parent offered Jill, as well as the flexibility of each parent\u2019s job. She found that, after the move to Oregon, Jill lived in four different residences in less than one year and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u201cno less than five different care providers,\u201d and that the only relative Rose had in Oregon, her mother, lived a three-hour drive away. In addition, Rose accepted a residency in Michigan, a State where she has no ties, and where, the judge found, her employment was not \u201ceven [a] bona fide\u201d career choice. The judge found that a move to Michigan would put Jill \u201cin an unfamiliar environment with new caregivers and . . . medical providers\u201d while Rose worked \u201cextraordinary long hours as a medical resident for the next four years,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that Rose had demonstrated that she cannot manage child care without significant support.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">By contrast, the judge found that Hunter \u201chas a stable job as an attorney in Massachusetts [that] provides flexibility by giving her the opportunity to work from home and to work flexible hours,\u201d and therefore would be \u201cfar more accessible\u201d to Jill than would Rose. In addition, the judge found that only Hunter was willing to foster the relationship that Jill has with Mia.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Despite Rose\u2019s assertion to the contrary, the judge\u2019s conclusion that Jill would suffer substantial harm if she were to remain in Rose\u2019s custody \u201c[i]n light of [her] ongoing inability to put [Jill\u2019s] needs above her own and the instability she has created for [Jill] in terms of parentage, living circumstances and child care, wrongful removal, [and] deceitful and alienating behavior\u201d has ample support in the record, and is based on more than Jill\u2019s aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">There is no merit to Rose\u2019s claim that the judge ignored evidence that Jill is happy and well adjusted. The judge explicitly stated that she considered all of the evidence presented at trial and \u201cweighed and assessed [its] credibility.\u201d However, as the finder of fact, she gave no credit to Rose\u2019s testimony that Jill smiled and laughed more when she moved to Oregon, and found that Rose\u2019s testimony \u201cgenerally lacked credibility\u201d because of \u201cnumerous exaggerations, inaccuracies and contradictions.\u201d The judge was entitled to credit Rose\u2019s statement, in electronic mail messages to Hunter dated October 29 and November 1, 2008, describing Jill\u2019s aggressive and \u201cclingy\u201d behavior right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>after the move to Oregon and to infer, based on the testimony of Hunter\u2019s expert, that such behavior continued at least during the time Rose denied Hunter further information about or contact with Jill until February, 2009.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, whether Jill is happy and well adjusted has no bearing on the judge\u2019s decision concerning custody where neither parent asserts that the other is unfit; where the judge found that, unlike Rose, Hunter was able to put Jill\u2019s needs above her own and \u201chas managed to maintain a loving supportive relationship with [Jill] despite the distances\u201d between them; and where the judge was required to grant sole physical custody to one parent because of geographical distance that, in this case, was deliberately created by Rose.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, Rose\u2019s claims that the judge did not take into account the harm arising from separation from her and \u201cdisrupted [Jill\u2019s] attachment to [Rose]\u201d have no merit. The judge\u2019s custody order gave Rose frequent contact with Jill, including parenting time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>one weekend per month in Massachusetts, five weeks in the summer, school vacations, holidays, Web camera sessions three evenings per week, and telephone calls once per week. As discussed, the judge found that Hunter already has Jill telephone Rose every night to say good night. Moreover, the judge stated that, should Rose decide to move back to Massachusetts, the parties must work in good faith to adjust their parenting plan to meet Jill\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">There was no abuse of discretion in determining that primary physical custody of Jill should be with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">3. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees and costs. </em>Rose challenges the judge\u2019s award of $180,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Hunter.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">An award of attorney\u2019s fees is in the sound discretion of the judge, and will not be disturbed unless there is an abuse of discretion. <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>436 Mass. 18, 38-39 (2002), and cases cited. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>361 Mass. 733, 738 (1972), quoting <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Third Universalist Soc\u2019y of Cambridge, </em>285 Mass. 146, 151 (1934) (\u201cthe award . . . may be presumed to be right and ordinarily ought not to be disturbed\u201d). When awarding fees, \u201ca judge may consider[, inter alia,] the amount of time required to prepare the case and pleadings, the complexity of issues involved, the value of the marital property, and the [spouses\u2019] ability to pay.\u201d <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, supra </em>at 39. A fundamental principle governing the issue of awarding attorney\u2019s fees in domestic relations cases is that they are to be \u201cawarded on \u2018strictly conservative principles.\u2019\u201d <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>326 Mass. 587, 596 (1950), quoting <em>Commissioner of Banks, petitioner, in re Prudential Trust Co., </em>240 Mass. 478, 485 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In the judge\u2019s written judgments of custody and dissolution, entered on April 20, 2011, she reserved the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, stating that, if a party requested fees, detailed affidavits would be required and \u201cthe issue [would] be determined on the pleadings, so as to avoid further costs to either party.\u201d Hunter filed an amended motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, together with an affidavit of her attorney in support thereof. Rose filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>an opposition to this motion and requested an evidentiary hearing. The judge declined to hold an evidentiary hearing, stating that she intended to \u201cprevent proceedings on potential cross motions for fees from \u2018deteriorat[ing] into ancillary major litigation.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 543 n.10, 544 (1985), <em>S.C., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1986) (where judge has firsthand knowledge of work performed and of going rates, evi-dentiary hearing may not be necessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In order to provide context to the judge\u2019s written decision on the motion for attorney\u2019s fees, we note that, in March, 2009, a single justice of the Appeals Court affirmed a decision of a judge in the Probate and Family Court (not the trial judge) that concluded that the parties\u2019 RDP was a legal spousal relationship, and that ordered, among other things, visitation between Hunter and Jill. In September, 2009, the trial judge also entered a pretrial ruling dated August 10, 2009, that, under California law, the parties were both legal parents of both children, and that the relationship would be recognized under principles of comity. Nevertheless, a significant part of discovery and the trial was devoted to proving that Hunter and Rose were legal spouses and Jill\u2019s parents under California law. It also is important to note that, in the judge\u2019s earlier written findings of fact and conclusions of law, her recitation of the procedural history in the case constituted 102 numbered paragraphs, seventeen of which had subparagraphs.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The judge entered her written decision on Hunter\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees on May 31, 2011. She credited the affidavit of Hunter\u2019s attorney, stating that the legal work created by Rose\u2019s \u201crefusal to recognize the legal parentage of [Hunter was] detailed thoroughly and accurately in [counsel\u2019s] twelve page affidavit.\u201d Hunter had requested her total fees and costs of over $369,000 or, in the alternative, $245,250 of fees and costs incurred since August of 2009, when the trial judge determined that both parties were legal parents of Jill. The judge ordered that Rose was responsible for $180,000 of Hunter\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs, payable in six annual instalments of $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The judge based her decision on three factors. First, she observed firsthand, for more than two years, the quality of the written submissions of Hunter\u2019s counsel, as well as her motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>practice and trial skills, which the judge found to be \u201chighly competent.\u201d She also determined that the hourly rates, outlined in the affidavit, were \u201cwholly reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Second, the judge found that Hunter was unnecessarily required to generate detailed and time consuming legal work because of Rose\u2019s refusal to recognize Hunter\u2019s legal parentage of Jill, which also led to the necessity of a trial over custody of Jill. For example, during discovery, Rose routinely failed to respond in a timely manner, failed to produce documents in her possession, refused to sign releases so Hunter could obtain evidence from third parties (even though Rose had agreed to give her consent), resisted cooperating, and ignored court orders.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rose destroyed key evidence in anticipation of litigation,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> filed a motion to amend her answer to withdraw her admission that Jill and Mia had been conceived using the same sperm donor, and unilaterally changed the public docket in the case without notice to or agreement from Hunter. The judge\u2019s finding that \u201c[cjlearly [Hunter] was assigned the laboring oar by [Rose]\u201d is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Third, the judge addressed and assessed the financial situation of each party. See <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, supra </em>at 39, citing <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Roderiques, </em>370 Mass. 435, 437 (1976) (in making award of attorney\u2019s fees, \u201cthe basic factors of need and relative economic positions of the spouses\u201d must be considered). The judge found that Hunter had been able to pay only $50,064 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>over two and one-half years toward her total legal fees and was paying $500 each month toward the balance due. She found that, by choosing to forgo the residency position in Michigan, Rose was voluntarily and avoidably unemployed, but was under less financial strain than Hunter, and had the financial support of her family.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Rose argues that the fee award penalizes her for having litigated the novel issue whether Hunter\u2019s status as a registered domestic partner in California gives her legal parental rights in Massachusetts as to Jill, and for having taken the issue of Jill\u2019s custody to trial. She argues that, because the court\u2019s rulings concerning legal parentage were preliminary, interlocutory, and nondispositive, she was not prolonging litigation or making frivolous arguments, but rather properly arguing a previously undecided issue. She also states that it was \u201cegregious\u201d for the court to \u201cpenalize [her] for resisting an effort to wrest her daughter from her custody\u201d by taking the issue to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">We conclude that the trial judge was not penalizing Rose for litigating a novel issue. Rather, she properly was concerned about Rose\u2019s inappropriate and obstructionist behavior, set forth above, from the time the judge ordered that both parties were Jill\u2019s legal parents until the end of the trial over custody. Fee awards are proper given a party\u2019s discovery abuses, obstructionist conduct, and delay tactics. See <em>J.S. </em>v. C.C., 454 Mass. 652, 666 (2009) (\u201ca fee award was justified because the litigation was \u2018unnecessarily complicated and prolonged\u2019 by the actions of [one of the parties, inter alia,] by [that party\u2019s] conduct during discovery\u201d). We understand the judge\u2019s statements concerning Rose\u2019s refusal to concede Hunter\u2019s legal parentage and forcing a trial as a reference to the fact that Rose refused to acknowledge that there was a legal relationship under <em>California </em>law. Rose could have conceded these facts and still preserved her right to appeal the actual \u201cnovel\u201d issue, whether the Commonwealth would recognize California law under principles of comity.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Finally, Rose claims that the judge erred by characterizing her as \u201cvoluntarily unemployed.\u201d She argues that she gave up the residency in Michigan because the judge ordered Jill\u2019s relocation to Massachusetts. The judge\u2019s order did not require Rose to relocate with Jill. Therefore, the judge was within her discretion to determine Rose\u2019s unemployment at the time of the fee assessment was voluntary and avoidable. See <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The judge did not abuse her discretion in awarding $180,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Hunter.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgments of custody and dissolution of the parties\u2019 RDP, as well as the award of attorney\u2019s fees to Hunter.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-9\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-9\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\">We acknowledge receipt of an amicus brief submitted in support of Hunter by eighteen California professors of family law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The fact that, on November 4, 2008, the voters of California voted to approve an initiative measure, Proposition 8, that amended art. 1 of the California Constitution by adding a new section (\u00a7 7.5), stating that \u201cOnly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California,\u201d does not affect the domestic partnership laws in California. See generally <em>Strauss </em>v. Horton, 46 Cal. App. 4th 364, 385, 470 (2009). The ballot initiative was designed to invalidate a decision of the Supreme Court of California holding that the right of same-sex couples to marry was protected by the California Constitution. See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>671 F.3d 1052. 1066 (9th Cir. 2012), quoting <em>In re Marriage Cases, </em>43 Cal. 4th 757, 819, 829 (2008). Proposition 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>was declared unconstitutional under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 1096.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b513-11\">This fertility clinic appears to have been in Rhode Island.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b513-12\">The fact that Hunter testified that Rose\u2019s support for her pregnancy \u201cwaned\u201d in the summer of 2008, i.e., after Hunter conceived Mia, is not relevant to the issue whether Rose consented to Mia\u2019s conception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\">We need not address Rose\u2019s argument that, had Hunter wanted to establish legal parentage of Jill, she could have married Rose after they moved to Massachusetts or could have adopted Jill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\">We agree with the judge that Rose\u2019s reliance on <em>Smith </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>458 Mass. 540 (2010), is not apt. In that case, the mother had a brief relationship with the father that resulted in the child\u2019s birth; there was no legal spousal relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 541. The father discovered that he was not listed on the child\u2019s birth certificate and sought to establish paternity, formalize child support, and establish rights to visitation and involvement in the child\u2019s life. <em>Id. </em>at 542. The mother moved out of the State with the child, which the judge found to be designed to deprive the father of a relationship with the child. <em>Id. </em>at 543. Because the father\u2019s paternity had not been established at the time the mother removed the child, the court held that she did nothing wrong. <em>Id. </em>at 545, 549-550. Here, in contrast, the parties were legally joined as spouses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>some four years before Jill was bom and there was ample documentary evidence that, until the breakdown of the adult relationship, Rose considered Hunter to be Jill\u2019s legal parent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\">In order to move to Oregon, Rose changed her career plan from family practice to internal medicine. Rose did not inform the judge of the nature of her residency in Michigan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We also note that the testimony of one of the witnesses for Rose, a family friend, provided further evidence supporting the judge\u2019s finding that Jill was harmed by the separation from Hunter. The witness stated that when Jill came back from visits with Hunter, she observed that on one occasion Jill had not gone directly to Rose; on two occasions Jill had cried on the way home from a visit; and, after a visit in November, 2009, when Jill was playing \u201cshe would stop and start to hit a doll on the table or . . . another toy[,] . . . had decreased ability to focus[, and] wasn\u2019t doing sustained play as much.\u201d We need not speculate concerning the reason Rose elicited this testimony, but point out that, as the expert stated, and the judge credited, a child can be \u201cupset, angry, sad and aggressive\u201d often at the parent who was left behind when a child was removed and that \u201cparental alienating behaviors\u201d can make a child angry and confused.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We do not agree that the judge gave improper weight to Rose\u2019s behavior. The case on which Rose relies for support, <em>Haas </em>v. <em>Puchalski, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 555 (1980), is not apt. In the <em>Haas </em>case, after an initial determination of custody in favor of the mother, the father sought and was granted custody solely because the mother took the child to Germany and Colorado without the father\u2019s consent. <em>Id. </em>at 555-556. The court stated that the judge made no findings of fact justifying the order changing custody from the mother to the father. <em>Id. </em>at 556-557. The court further stated that it was the welfare of the child that was paramount in determining custody, and custody proceedings were not a vehicle to punish the mother\u2019s behavior. <em>Id. </em>at 557, quoting <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Heard, </em>323 Mass. 357, 377 (1948). Here, the judge\u2019s assessment of Rose\u2019s behavior was in the context of determining with which parent it was in Jill\u2019s best interest to live. See <em>Custody of Zia, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 244 (2000) (custody to parent willing to respect other parent\u2019s role in child\u2019s life). Given the judge\u2019s extensive findings, we also do not agree with Rose\u2019s assertion that the custody award was to punish her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b519-9\">We agree with Hunter that, in asserting that the judge ignored harm to Jill if Hunter is granted custody, Rose misuses the testimony of Hunter\u2019s expert, who addressed a complete severing of parental attachment and alienation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Rose argues only that no fees should have been awarded; she does not contest the amount of fees that were awarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Rose\u2019s refusal to cooperate consisted, in part, of Rose and her attorney sending hostile letters to Hunter, noting that counsel did not care about preserving resources, denying Hunter had any relationship with Jill, and refusing to negotiate on parenting time or issues even after the judge\u2019s August, 2009, ruling on parentage. Rose also refused to alter or increase Hunter\u2019s parenting time with Jill, requiring Hunter to bring motions before the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b521-9\">The judge found that, by August of 2008, when her relationship with Hunter ended, Rose was aware that there could be legal action concerning Jill, other than adoption proceedings. On the night before she left for Oregon, with the help of her best friend, Rose burned all of the journals she had kept that contained writings from the time of her relationship with Hunter. Rose purposefully destroyed these lengthy contemporaneous writings about her eight-year relationship with Hunter, and because Rose knew litigation was likely, she felt threatened with court action and was worried about a court order keeping her in Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Rose withdrew and kept all of the couple\u2019s funds from their joint bank account, totaling $18,000. Rose also sold the couple\u2019s joint home and kept the proceeds. Rose\u2019s legal fees have been paid in part by her mother and her mother\u2019s friend, totaling at least $103,000, and her mother testified that she would help her daughter continue to pay additional legal fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
