Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant argues error in (1) the admission of hearsay; (2) the admission of expert testimony; (3) the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of a witness; (4) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument; and (5) the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction and discern no basis to exercise our authority pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\"><em>Background. </em>Based on the evidence, the jury could have found the following facts. The victim, who was fifty-two years of age at the time of her death, owned a multifamily home in the Roslindale section of Boston. She met the defendant in 2000. At some point the defendant moved into the victim\u2019s second-floor apartment. They lived together for approximately three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In 2003, the victim, accompanied by the defendant, moved to the basement apartment of her building. Although she knew that the defendant had a new girl friend, the victim, in March, 2003, married the defendant as a \u201cfavor\u201d and \u201cto get him out of her life.\u201d They did not have a \u201ctrue marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The victim\u2019s daughter, the daughter\u2019s husband, and their children lived across the street from the victim. The victim and her daughter saw each other every day. Usually the victim, who worked from 2:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. as a school custodian, would take a break to have dinner with her daughter\u2019s family around 7 or 8 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">On Thursday, April 17, 2003, the victim ate dinner at her daughter\u2019s home with her extended family, arriving between 7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>and 7:30 p.m. The daughter observed that the victim was quiet and did not \u201cseem herself.\u201d Before leaving, the victim related that she was going to a restaurant to pick up the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The victim did not have to work the next day because the school was closed for Good Friday. That morning, the daughter repeatedly tried telephoning her mother, on both her mother\u2019s cellular and home telephones, but her mother did not answer. She noticed that her mother\u2019s automobile was parked outside her home, and the daughter\u2019s husband observed it parked there the night before.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On Saturday, April 19, the daughter tried telephoning her mother again. Eventually, she asked her husband to use the key they had to the victim\u2019s apartment \u201cto make sure she was okay.\u201d He went over to the victim\u2019s apartment. The door to the apartment was locked, so he used the key to open it. He opened the door, peered in, and saw the victim\u2019s body on the floor, observing a sheet and part of the victim\u2019s legs. He returned to his wife, who telephoned 911 and various family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Fire fighters arrived first at the apartment, at about 11:46 a.m. Inside they discovered the victim, who was wrapped in a sheet on a bed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The victim had no pulse and was not breathing. There was blood on the sheet, around the bed area, and on the floor. The fire fighters moved some items in the apartment to make space for the victim on the floor so they could attempt life-saving measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">A few minutes later, an emergency medical technician (EMT) arrived. He observed that the victim\u2019s blood was dried, her skin was waxen and milky white, her pupils were fixed, and her body felt cold in the warm basement. In addition, she did not have a carotid pulse. From these observations, the EMT concluded that the victim could not be \u201csave[dj\u201d and that she \u201chad been there for a while.\u201d He instructed the fire fighters to stop and directed them to leave the apartment carefully. Soon thereafter, officers of the Boston police department arrived and secured the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The victim died as a result of multiple stab wounds. She had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>four stab wounds to her neck, one of which perforated her jugular vein and trachea. The victim also had abrasions to her chest and defensive wounds to her hands and arms. The victim was conscious when she was stabbed in the throat, and although she would have eventually lost consciousness due to blood loss, she would have been conscious for some period of time ranging from seconds to minutes. The medical examiner could not provide an opinion concerning the precise time of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Within hours after the discovery of the victim\u2019s body, Sergeant Detective Daniel Coleman asked a Spanish-speaking officer to leave a voice mail message in Spanish for the defendant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on his cellular telephone stating that it was urgent that he contact Sergeant Detective Coleman and providing a cellular telephone number to do so. No other details were left about the reason for the voice mail message, nor was the victim\u2019s name mentioned. The defendant did not return the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">There was evidence that, around the time of the victim\u2019s murder, the defendant had a girl friend who was pregnant with his child, and that he slept at her home in Chelsea on the evenings of April 17 and 18. On Friday, April 18, the defendant was in the vicinity of the victim\u2019s apartment at about 12:53 p.m. to collect payment for some painting work he had done earlier that week. In the late afternoon, and then the following morning, he telephoned a longtime friend, Maria Rivera, and arranged to meet later that day, Saturday, at Rivera\u2019s apartment on Beacon Street in Chelsea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">On Saturday morning, before the victim\u2019s body was found, the defendant was spotted near the victim\u2019s automobile by a man who was nearby borrowing a ladder. At approximately noon, the defendant met with Rivera at the Beacon Street apartment. There, he told her that he had a problem and needed a place to stay. Rivera told the defendant he could stay there and that they would talk more after she finished some errands.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Rivera, accompanied by her son, returned to the apartment between 4 and 7 p.m. Rivera told the defendant that she had received some telephone calls about him having killed a woman. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The defendant replied, \u201c[W]hat\u2019s done is done and you cannot go back.\u201d She pressed the defendant for \u201cthe truth,\u201d and he said that he had been in an argument with his wife. She had learned that he had impregnated another woman, and he \u201clost control of the argument.\u201d Rivera asked the defendant whether he had killed her, and the defendant repeated, \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done, you cannot walk back.\u201d He added that he needed to give the victim \u201ca Christian burial.\u201d He told Rivera that, on the previous day, Friday, he had returned to the apartment to \u201cget the corpse out . . . before the police would find it,\u201d but could not get in because there were people around the building. The defendant said he had killed the victim on Thursday afternoon.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">At the urging of her son, Rivera, on Sunday evening, went to the Chelsea police station. She stayed there until the following morning. After she spoke with Chelsea police Officer Rafael Rijos, Sergeant Detective Coleman was summoned. Rivera gave the officers the key to her apartment and told them that they would find the defendant there.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Sergeant Detective Coleman, together with two other police officers, went to Rivera\u2019s apartment. After announcing their presence and knocking, they used Rivera\u2019s key to gain entry. They found the defendant hiding in an armoire behind pillows and clothing. The defendant agreed to accompany them to the police station to talk.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">At the police station, the defendant was given the Miranda warnings in Spanish. He acknowledged his rights and signed a waiver form. The defendant, through a Spanish-speaking translator who was a police officer, stated that, around noon on Saturday, he had received a voice mail message from a male telling him that his wife was dead. The defendant said he had not been to the victim\u2019s apartment after Wednesday, April 16. He provided inconsistent accounts of his whereabouts on Thursday, April 17. When asked by Sergeant Detective Coleman whether he had ever been in the victim\u2019s apartment while she was injured or bleeding, he replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d and then, \u201cNo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>I wasn\u2019t.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During the interview, the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone rang and he spoke with his girl friend, whom police asked to come to the station. When she arrived, police interviewed her separately. After some time, the defendant and his girl friend left the station together. The defendant stayed the night at her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The next day, Monday, April 21, the defendant telephoned Rivera and asked to meet with her that evening at a nearby cemetery. Rivera went, accompanied by her son and two of his friends. At the cemetery, the defendant told her that the police \u201chad come to look for him,\u201d questioned him, and let him go. He asked Rivera for money so that he could go to the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In the meantime, the police investigation revealed that there had been no signs of forced entry into the victim\u2019s apartment. Also, there was no evidence of a sexual crime. In the victim\u2019s apartment, among some bedding that was strewn near the victim, police recovered a knife. Another knife was found under a couch.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Two doorknobs, one to the downstairs basement door and the other to the door on the first-floor landing of the basement staircase, were seized because there were reddish-brown stains on the interior part of each doorknob. There were no other doors from which to leave the apartment. In the stain on the interior doorknob to the downstairs basement door, Boston police Officer Dennis E. LeBlanc, a latent fingerprint examiner, observed some \u201cridge detail\u201d and placed a protective piece of plastic over it. Subsequently, after conducting an analysis, Officer LeBlanc concluded that the fingerprint retrieved from the interior doorknob to the downstairs basement door matched the defendant\u2019s left thumb print. On Tuesday, April 22, that informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>tion was conveyed to Sergeant Detective Coleman, and he decided to have the defendant arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Later that day, the defendant was apprehended in a closet at his girl friend\u2019s apartment and was arrested. He was taken to the Chelsea police station, then transported to a Boston police station. After being read the Miranda rights through an interpreter, the defendant agreed to speak with police (through an interpreter). Sergeant Detective Coleman asked the defendant whether he had ever had the victim\u2019s blood on his hands, to which the defendant replied that he had not. The defendant stated that he had not been inside the victim\u2019s apartment when she was injured or bleeding. Sergeant Detective Coleman seized some personal items from the defendant, including a watch.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Subsequent forensic testing revealed that the reddish-brown stains from both doorknobs recovered from the victim\u2019s apartment tested positive for human blood. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing revealed that the victim\u2019s DNA profile matched the DNA profiles of blood extracted from both the downstairs basement interior doorknob<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the defendant\u2019s watchband,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> see note 10, <em>infra, </em>and that the defendant was excluded as a possible contributor of the DNA from these profiles. The statistical significance of the DNA testing results was presented to the jury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 20 (1994) (evidence of DNA \u201cmatch\u201d is meaningless without evidence indicating significance of match).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The defendant did not testify or call any witnesses. His trial counsel elicited testimony during the cross-examination of two of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses who conducted various forensic examinations that there are no tests to determine how long blood has been present on an item. He also tried to suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>that the defendant had spent the evening of April 17 with a woman that he had formerly dated. Defense counsel argued that Rivera was not a credible witness (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>that the defendant had no motive to kill the victim because they did not have a true marriage, that the police investigation was inadequate, and that the defendant could not have killed the victim because the automobile he drove did not test positive for the victim\u2019s blood and no one ever saw him with blood on his person. He suggested that the blood found on the door knob and inside the defendant\u2019s watchband could have been deposited long ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Admission of hearsay. </em>The defendant challenges the admission of the testimony of the victim\u2019s daughter that the victim told her that \u201c[s]he was going to a restaurant, supposedly, to pick up [the defendant].\u201d As an initial matter, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the statement amounts to multiple hearsay. The defendant asserts that this statement conveyed the fact that the defendant told the victim that he would meet her at the restaurant, amounting to hearsay within hearsay. The trial transcript, however, does not support this argument. The victim\u2019s daughter\u2019s statement only conveys that the victim expressed an intention to go to a restaurant to pick up the defendant and, significantly, is silent to anything that the defendant may or may not have said. The statement was only that of the victim, not of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Although the statement constitutes hearsay, it was properly admitted as the victim\u2019s statement of a present intent to act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cStatements, not too remote in time, which indicate an intention to engage in particular conduct, are admissible to prove that the conduct was, in fact, put in effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>454 Mass. 744, 767 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>381 Mass. 306, 310 (1980). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(3)(B)(ii) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>(2012). The victim\u2019s statement that she was going to a restaurant to pick up the defendant falls within this exception. Because admission of this statement was not error, there could be no ineffective assistance of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel based on counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of (or failure to move to strike) the statement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>431 Mass. 108, 120, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 864 (2000), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">2. <em>Admission of expert testimony. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in allowing Officer LeBlanc to testify as a fingerprint expert at trial because he was not qualified to testify as he \u201cwas not trusted to tell the truth by either party.\u201d In support of this argument, the defendant points to an independent report generated by Ron Smith &amp; Associates, Inc. (report), that verified that Officer LeBlanc had misidentified fingerprints in a prior criminal case and failed to disclose his error in the trial of that case. The defendant raised this contention below to the trial judge in a motion for a new trial. However, although he framed it in terms of ineffective assistance provided by his trial counsel, the judge discerned that \u201cthe claimed error is [the judge\u2019s] decision allowing [Officer] LeBlanc to testify both as a percipient witness and as an expert.\u201d The judge rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that his trial counsel\u2019s performance had been ineffective in opposing the testimony of Officer LeBlanc, finding that defense counsel had in fact been quite \u201cadamant\u201d in opposing the testimony. The judge\u2019s decision, insofar as subject to plenary review, is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The judge did not commit error by admitting Officer Le-Blanc\u2019s expert testimony. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the Commonwealth and its \u201cown consultants\u201d did not exhibit a lack of \u201ctrust\u201d of Officer LeBlanc. Without providing great detail regarding the specifics of the report, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>impounded, the report did not undermine Officer LeBlanc\u2019s technical ability to examine and analyze fingerprint evidence, and the review team generating the report found that there had been no other erroneous identifications made by Officer Le-Blanc between 1995 and 2003 (which was the only time period examined). The report was not generated at the request of the district attorney, but rather the Boston police department. The Commonwealth had the defendant\u2019s fingerprint independently reexamined in 2004, and although that expert did not testify at trial,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> he also found a \u201cmatch.\u201d The defendant did not produce any evidence to the contrary. The Commonwealth notes that the mistaken fingerprint match in the past case could have resulted from a \u201cmislabeling\u201d mistake. Indeed, at the defendant\u2019s trial the prosecutor argued that defense counsel\u2019s accusation that Officer LeBlanc had committed perjury in connection with the past case was \u201coverstating\u201d what had occurred because other conclusions were possible. For these and other reasons, the record does not support the defendant\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth and its \u201cown consultants\u201d did not \u201ctrust\u201d Officer LeBlanc.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Nor did the admission of Officer LeBlanc\u2019s expert testimony require a determination by the judge that he was trustworthy or credible as a witness. The defendant cites to no cases supporting this proposition. The test for the admissibility of expert testimony is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">\u201cUnder our common-law rules of evidence, the Commonwealth must establish five foundational requirements before expert testimony will be admitted in a criminal case: (1) that the expert testimony will assist the trier of fact, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Little, 453 Mass. 766, 768 (2009); (2) that the witness is qualified as an expert in the relevant area of inquiry, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frangi-pane, </em>433 Mass. 527, 533 (2001); (3) that the expert\u2019s opinion is based on facts or data of a type reasonably relied on by experts to form opinions in the relevant field, see <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531 (1986); (4) that the process or theory underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the opinion is reliable, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 26 (1994); and (5) that the process or theory is applied to the particular facts of the case in a reliable manner, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>445 Mass. 626, 648 (2005). See generally Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 702, at 218-224 (2010).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. 773, 783 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2441 (2011). The trustworthiness of an expert witness is not a foundational requirement, but a matter of credibility to be decided by the jury, subject to challenge, of course, by the defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shanley, </em>455 Mass. 752, 762 (2010) (\u201cOnce admitted, the validity and credibility of the expert testimony is subject to challenge like any other testimony . . . and it is for the jury to determine what aid it might provide to their deliberations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">3. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s direct examination of Rivera. </em>On direct examination, Rivera testified that the defendant essentially confessed to the murder of his wife, although he never expressly stated that he had killed his wife.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rivera\u2019s detailed testimony included information that (1) she had been contacted by \u201cpeople\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>looking for the defendant in connection with a murder; (2) the \u201ctruth\u201d relayed by the defendant was that he admitted that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>had fought with his wife the night of her murder about having impregnated another woman and that he lost control of that fight; (3) in response to Rivera\u2019s explicit question whether he had killed his wife, the defendant hung his head and said \u201cwhat\u2019s done is done\u201d; and (4) the defendant then told her that he needed to give his wife \u201ca Christian burial.\u201d Following this testimony, the prosecutor asked Rivera whether the defendant talked to her \u201cabout going back to the apartment after he killed [his wife],\u201d to which she responded that he relayed that he had tried to go back to the apartment but could not \u201cget in because there were people around the house.\u201d Several questions later, the prosecutor asked Rivera whether the defendant told her \u201cwhat day he killed his wife,\u201d to which she responded \u201c[t]hat it had happened Thursday . . . .\u201d The defendant claims that his trial counsel should have objected when the prosecutor incorrectly placed as the foundation for two of his questions that the defendant told Rivera he had \u201ckilled his wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The prosecutor should not have characterized the defendant\u2019s statements to Rivera as saying that he \u201ckilled his wife.\u201d The error, however, was isolated, occurring only twice, and without any objection. We point out that the judge, in both her preliminary remarks to the jury before opening statements and then again in her final charge, informed the jury that what the lawyers said and asked was not the evidence in the case and that they were to decide the case on the evidence. In addition, in his closing argument, defense counsel emphasized to the jury that Rivera did not actually tell the police that the defendant had \u201cconfess [ed].\u201d Further, in view of the fact that the characterization (that the defendant had \u201ckilled his wife\u201d) could have been reasonably inferred from the defendant\u2019s statements to, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>conduct in the presence of, Rivera, were the jury to find her credible, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s error did not result in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Wright, 411 Mass. 678, 681 (1992). It follows that a claim of ineffectiveness of trial counsel based on defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to these two questions posed by the prosecutor would be unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">4. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly \u201cattack[edj\u201d defense counsel and made statements contradictory to the testimony of his own expert witness. \u201cIn analyzing a claim of improper argument, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks must be viewed in light of the \u2018entire argument, as well as in light of the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury and the evidence at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Raposa, 440 Mass. 684, 694 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>437 Mass. 554, 565 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">a. <em>Alleged \u201cattack\u201d on defense counsel. </em>On appeal, the defendant points to several remarks that the prosecutor made during his closing argument that he claims unfairly \u201cattack[edj\u201d the qualifications and motives of defense counsel and urged the jury to get angry at defense counsel. The defendant specifically argues that the prosecutor improperly stated that (i) defense counsel had asked questions about illicit sexual relationships \u201cover and over again to every female witness in this case,\u201d painting defense counsel as a \u201csadistic bully\u201d; (ii) it was \u201ceasy\u201d for defense counsel to sit in his office in New Hampshire and criticize a witness\u2019s actions; and (iii) defense counsel made a \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cheinous\u201d accusation against the victim\u2019s son-in-law, which was \u201clawyer talk\u201d and an \u201cact of desperation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">(i) No substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice arose from the portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, to which defense counsel did not object, commenting on defense counsel\u2019s sexually implicit cross-examination of the female witnesses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, </em>456 Mass. 1, 15 (2010). Even though the prosecutor misstated that defense counsel \u201casked [sexually implicit] questions over and over again to <em>every </em>female witness [emphasis added],\u201d when in fact defense counsel had not asked such questions of the victim\u2019s daughter or the female forensic examiners, the comment was isolated and the judge had instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the jury that their memories of the evidence were to control. The jury are presumed to follow the judge\u2019s instructions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>459 Mass. 271, 278 (2011). To the extent that the isolated statement was exaggerated, it was merely \u201cexcusable hyperbole\u201d and is not grounds for reversal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>455 Mass. 503, 515 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, 427 </em>Mass. 336, 350 (1998). Nor did this isolated comment paint defense counsel as a \u201csadistic bully.\u201d Rather, the comment was a fair response to defense counsel\u2019s attack on Rivera\u2019s credibility when during her cross-examination he suggested that she fabricated the defendant\u2019s so-called confession to her because he had ended their sexual relationship.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, 412 </em>Mass. 375, 388 (1992) (not improper for prosecutor to comment on defendant\u2019s attempt to confuse or distract the jury by diverting their attention from strong evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">(ii) We also conclude that there was no merit in the defendant\u2019s argument that, when the prosecutor pointed out that defense counsel worked in New Hampshire, the prosecutor was trying to emphasize that defense counsel was a \u201cforeigner\u201d and that the vision of a \u201cforeign\u201d attorney criticizing everyone on behalf of his \u201cforeign\u201d client was xenophobic. The notion that the prosecutor was attempting to elicit xenophobia is unsupported by the evidence. The victim was an immigrant and several of the prosecutor\u2019s civilian witnesses appeared also to be immigrants. Early in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, he discussed the victim in positive terms, when noting the fact that she worked hard and came to this country as an immigrant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At no point during the trial did the prosecutor try to elicit any sort of irrational dislike or fear of people from other countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Further, the prosecutor was responding to an argument made by defense counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>428 Mass. 455, 463 (1998) (prosecutor may comment on defense tactics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>that jurors have witnessed themselves). In his closing argument, defense counsel suggested that the testimony of Rivera be discredited. When the prosecutor mentioned defense counsel\u2019s New Hampshire office, however, he was only asking the jury to recall that defense counsel had not been present at the time of the murder and had not had a friendship with the defendant similar to that of Rivera\u2019s relationship with the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Szerlong, </em>457 Mass. 858, 870-871 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 1494 (2011) (remarks made during closing arguments are considered in context of whole argument, evidence admitted at trial, and judge\u2019s instructions to jury). The prosecutor properly argued in his closing that defense counsel was in no position to judge the witness for the delay in her testimony against the defendant. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>Although the prosecutor\u2019s isolated reference to \u201cthe office in New Hampshire\u201d was inartful, we conclude that there was no error in the statement and no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">(iii) In his closing, defense counsel remarked: \u201cI don\u2019t want for one minute ... for you to think that I\u2019m accusing anybody of anything.\u201d He then, however, suggested that the victim\u2019s son-in-law had something to do with her murder because he did not actually go inside the apartment physically to check on her himself when he saw her body on opening the door. Following defense counsel\u2019s insinuation of guilt of the victim\u2019s son-in-law, the prosecutor plainly stated that defense counsel\u2019s claim of not \u201caccusing anybody\u201d of the murder was disingenuous \u201clawyer talk.\u201d Moreover, defense counsel\u2019s accusation was not based in evidence, and the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the accusation against the victim\u2019s son-in-law was \u201churtful\u201d was merely a response to defense counsel\u2019s suggestions to the contrary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra. </em>To refocus the jury, the prosecutor argued that all of the evidence in the case pointed to the defendant, not to anybody else, and so the accusation against the victim\u2019s son-in-law was \u201cridiculous and absurd, and ... an act of desperation in light of the overwhelming evidence.\u201d This argument was also a proper response to defense counsel\u2019s accusations in his closing argument. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>429 Mass. 502, 508 &amp; n.4 (1999) (prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>argument that defense counsel\u2019s closing was \u201criddled with smoke screens . . . designed to try to deter [the jury] from [their] mission of finding the truth\u201d was not improper because \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s comments were in response to defense counsel\u2019s attacks on the Commonwealth\u2019s case . . . claiming that it was the witness rather than the defendant that had committed the crimes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">b. <em>Statements allegedly contradicting expert testimony. </em>As previously noted, defense counsel elicited testimony during the cross-examination of two of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses who conducted various forensic examinations that there are no tests to determine how long blood has been deposited on an item. Defense counsel referred to this expert testimony in his closing argument, stating, \u201cThere was no telling how long the blood was on the doorknob.\u201d Later, in his closing argument, while referring to the defendant\u2019s bloody thumbprint found on the doorknob, the prosecutor remarked, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell when that got there? Of course, you can. Of course, you can.\u201d The defendant contends that these remarks contradicted the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s own witnesses and amounted to \u201ca form of misrepresenting the evidence.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The defendant improperly examines the remark in isolation. The statements immediately preceding the allegedly improper statement recount other evidence admitted at trial, including evidence about the voluminous amount of blood found inside the apartment and the limited access to the apartment, intimating a reasonable theory of how and when the defendant\u2019s thumbprint got on the victim\u2019s blood on a doorknob.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, the testimony from the two Commonwealth witnesses did not foreclose the timing of when the fingerprint was left by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>defendant as suggested by the prosecutor. A prosecutor is \u201cpermitted and expected to marshal the evidence and to argue for a decision of the controversy in favor of his client.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, 374 </em>Mass. 453, 459 (1978). The prosecutor suggested that the jury make a permissible inference that was based in the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kater, </em>432 Mass. 404, 422 (2000). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">5. <em>Jury instructions. </em>In her final charge, during her instruction on circumstantial evidence and equally reasonable inferences, the judge stated: \u201cWith respect to any inference which is adverse to the defendant, you may not draw such an inference unless you are persuaded of the truth of that inference beyond a reasonable doubt. If in assessing the evidence there are two reasonable inferences which can be drawn from the same set of facts, one of which is consistent with guilt and one of which is equally consistent with innocence or one of which is equally consistent with guilt, because of the presumption of innocence, you must draw the inference that is consistent with guilt.\u201d Telling the jury that, in the case of an equally consistent inference, they must draw the inference consistent with guilt was erroneous. The defendant argues that this error permitted the Commonwealth to gain an \u201cadvantage\u201d with regard to equally consistent inferences because it required the jury to select the inference consistent with guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u201cError in a charge is determined by reading the charge as a whole, and not by scrutinizing bits and pieces removed from their context.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petetabella, </em>459 Mass. 177, 184 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 153 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981). Because the defendant did not object to the charge on this ground at trial, we review to determine whether the error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sunahara, </em>455 Mass. 832, 836 (2010). \u201cThis determination turns on whether a reasonable juror could have used the instruction incorrectly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Throughout the judge\u2019s lengthy charge she gave extensive instruction on the presumption of innocence and the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge\u2019s slip of the tongue was isolated and could not have created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Earlier in the charge, the judge had instructed the jury that they \u201cmay not draw any inference adverse to the defendant unless [they were] satisfied of that inference beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d This instruction was more than the defendant was entitled to receive. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Edwards, 444 Mass. 526, 543 (2005) (although Commonwealth must prove all elements of crime \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d preliminary questions of fact and subsidiary facts need only be proved by preponderance of evidence). She repeated this beneficial instruction just prior to her slip of the tongue. When viewed in context and in relation to the charge in its entirety, the judge\u2019s isolated misstatement would not have made logical sense to a reasonable juror. Further, any confusion following the erroneous slip of the tongue would have been resolved when the judge later instructed that \u201c[a]ll of the presumptions of law and of evidence are in favor of innocence and every person is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">6. <em>Cumulative effect of errors. </em>The defendant argues that we should consider the cumulative effect of errors in his case. In so doing, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Guy, 441 Mass. 96, 109 (2004), we conclude that there was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">7. <em>Review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Although the defendant does not advance an argument pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we have examined the record and discern no basis to exercise our authority to set aside or reduce the verdict of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The defendant\u2019s direct appeal was entered in this court on August 12, 2008; on November 23, 2010, the court granted a stay of his appeal to allow the defendant to file a motion for a new trial. On March 29, 2011, the trial judge denied the motion in a memorandum of decision. The defendant\u2019s appeals from his conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial have been consolidated. The defendant makes no separate argument concerning the propriety of the denial of the latter motion for a new trial. Thus, the judge\u2019s action on that motion is subject only to plenary review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-10\">This testimony varied from that of the victim\u2019s son-in-law, who stated that he had found the victim on the floor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\">The defendant spoke and understood Spanish.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b425-10\">At trial, Rivera testified on behalf of the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Rivera admitted that she did not initially relay to police what the defendant had told her.

The interviews took place in 2003 before the release of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. DiGiambattista, 442 Mass. 423, 447 (2004), which concerned the significance of the failure to preserve an interrogation conducted at a place of detention by means of an electronic recording. However, we note that because the case was tried after the <em>DiGiambattista </em>case, the judge properly instructed the jury in accordance with the <em>DiGiambattista </em>decision. See <em>id. </em>at 449 (stating no \u201cneed to postpone the implementation of our decision\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b427-8\">No forensic evidence from the knives was recovered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\">It appears that only one doorknob was subjected to DNA testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\">There were no visible stains on the watchband.

L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, this statement is not testimonial in nature and its admission does not violate the confrontation clause to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 59 (2004). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>445 Mass. 1, 12-13 (2005), cert. denied, 548 U.S. 926 (2006) (explaining that in determining whether hearsay is testimonial in fact \u201cproper inquiry is whether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would anticipate the statement\u2019s being used against the accused in investigating and prosecuting a crime\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The absence of a limiting instruction at the time of the admission of the statement did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in view of the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Even apart from the defendant\u2019s statements to Rivera, the defendant\u2019s fingerprint was found in the victim\u2019s blood at the apartment and the victim\u2019s blood was found in the wristband of the defendant\u2019s watch. Thus, the challenged testimony of the victim\u2019s daughter was not needed for the jury to draw a reasonable inference that the defendant had been with the victim before she died from her wounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Defense counsel obtained a ruling at trial excluding this witness\u2019s testimony because the prosecutor neglected to place his name on the witness list.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">The prosecutor: \u201cWhen you spoke to the defendant, can you tell us what you said to him, the beginning of the conversation?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">The witness: \u201cAt the beginning of the conversation, I had gone to the apartment to speak to him regarding the phone calls I had received and I wanted to speak to him about the phone calls I had received.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-11\">The prosecutor: \u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-12\">The witness: \u201cI had told him that the phone calls I had received were about a woman having been killed in Jamaica Plain and that several people were thinking and looking for him saying that he was the one who had killed the woman, and so that I wanted to hear it from him because when he had called me to ask me for a place to stay and he had told me that he had a problem, he hadn\u2019t told me specifically what the problem was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-14\">The prosecutor: \u201cWhen you said that to the defendant, what did the defendant say to you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-15\">The witness: \u201cHe got very nervous and he said . . . \u2018What\u2019s done is done and you cannot go back.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The prosecutor: \u201cWhat did you say to the defendant?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">The witness: \u201cI told him to tell me the truth, that I needed to hear it from his mouth what he said he had done, what he said he had done and \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd when you said that to him, when you said that to the defendant you wanted to hear the truth about what he had done, how did the defendant respond?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">The witness: \u201cHe told me he had had an argument with his wife and he started to tell me how the argument really happened, of what the argument \u2014 how the argument happened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">The prosecutor: \u201cWhat did the defendant say about the argument between himself and his wife?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">The witness: \u201cHe told me they had been arguing about because he had been \u2014 she had found out that he had made another woman pregnant, and they had been arguing so hard that he had lost control of the argument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-14\">The prosecutor: \u201cDid the defendant say what he did?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-15\">The witness: \u201cAnd I told him ... \u2018Is it true that you killed this woman?\u2019 And he lowered his head and I saw when he let out two tears.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-17\">The prosecutor: \u201cDid the defendant say what he did next?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-18\">The witness: \u201cAfter that day?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-19\">The prosecutor: \u201cLet me back up.
