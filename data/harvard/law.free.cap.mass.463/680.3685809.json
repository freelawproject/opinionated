The department has, on three occasions, extended conditional offers of appointment to Kavaleski, each of which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>contingent upon her successful completion of a psychological screening process. On each occasion, department psychiatrists found Kavaleski psychologically unqualified for the job, and the department \u201cbypassed\u201d her for appointment as a police officer. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 27. This case arises from the third such bypass, which Kavaleski appealed to the Civil Service Commission (commission). See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 (b). After an evidentiary hearing, the commission concluded that the department had failed to meet its burden of establishing a reasonable justification for bypassing Kavaleski, and ordered that her name be restored to the department\u2019s list of individuals certified for appointment. The department filed an appeal in the Superior Court, see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44, arguing that, in reaching its decision, the commission had erroneously relied on expert testimony from an unrelated proceeding. A Superior Court judge ruled that the commission had erred and vacated the commission\u2019s order. We granted Kavaleski\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">We agree that the commission erred in the manner in which it considered expert testimony from another proceeding. Because the commission\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence independent of this extraneous evidence, however, we conclude that the error did not prejudice the department. Accordingly, we reverse the Superior Court judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\"><em>Background.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Kavaleski is a lifelong resident of Boston. She has received two graduate degrees from a local university, and has for many years been employed by the city of Boston\u2019s veterans\u2019 services department.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She has never been diagnosed as having, and has never received treatment for, any psychiatric or psychological disorder or condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">In 2002, Kavaleski applied to be a police officer in New York. She passed that State\u2019s civil service examination, a background investigation, and psychological screening, and was offered a position with the New York City police department. She declined that offer. In 2005, she applied for a position as a police officer with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>As is required of all applicants, Kavaleski completed the department\u2019s lengthy application packet, which requires extensive disclosures about many aspects of an applicant\u2019s life. She also submitted the required letters of reference, cooperated with a background investigation, and took a civil service examination administered by the Commonwealth\u2019s human resources division (HRD). Kavaleski passed the examination, and according to the commission, her references were \u201cof the highest order.\u201d The commission summarized Kavaleski\u2019s references as describing \u201ca dedicated and passionate person committed to public or community service, who exercises responsibility, good judgment and common sense in the completion of her tasks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">In 2006, Kavaleski twice received a conditional offer of appointment from the department, but on each occasion was \u201cbypassed\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> after being deemed psychologically unqualified by department psychiatrists. In early 2007, the department extended a third conditional offer of appointment to Kavaleski.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The sole condition of the third offer was, again, that Kavaleski successfully complete the department\u2019s psychological screening process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The department\u2019s psychological screening process has three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>\u201cphases.\u201d In \u201cPhase I,\u201d candidates for employment must take two standardized tests: the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In \u201cPhase II,\u201d candidates meet with one of the department\u2019s psychiatrists for a thirty-minute clinical interview (first-level interview). Before the interview, the psychiatrist reviews the candidate\u2019s MMPI-2 and PAI test results as well as material from the department\u2019s background investigation, the candidate\u2019s medical history, and information provided by the candidate in a biographical questionnaire. During the interview, the psychiatrist conducts a \u201cmental status examination,\u201d explores any areas of concern raised by the testing and biographical data, and evaluates possible areas of \u201cpsychological vulnerability as it pertains to the essential functions of the police officer position. \u201d If this process raises no \u201csuitability issues,\u201d the psychiatrist will report to the department in writing that the candidate is psychologically suitable for appointment as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">If the psychiatrist identifies areas requiring further inquiry, he or she will prepare a written report outlining the specific concerns and refer the candidate to \u201cPhase IH\u201d of the screening process, a \u201csecond opinion psychiatric interview\u201d (second-level interview). A different psychiatrist conducts the second-level interview. The second psychiatrist reviews the report from the first-level interview, as well as the test results and background material reviewed initially by the first psychiatrist. The second psychiatrist then conducts an \u201cin-depth clinical interview\u201d and makes a final written recommendation to the department regarding any \u201cpsychological/behavioral issues that would interfere with the applicant\u2019s performance of the essential job functions\u201d of being a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The entire screening process operates in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>rules promulgated by HRD. Those rules define the medical standards that a municipal police officer in the Commonwealth must meet, and sort disqualifying medical or psychiatric<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> conditions into two categories. A \u201cCategory A\u201d condition is one \u201cthat would preclude an individual from performing the essential job functions of a municipal police officer or present a significant risk to the safety and health of that individual or others.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A \u201cCategory B\u201d condition is one that, \u201cbased on its severity or degree, may or may not preclude an individual from performing the essential job functions of a municipal police officer, or present a significant risk to the safety and health of that individual or others.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">As noted, at the time of her appeal, Kavaleski had undergone the department\u2019s psychological screening process three times, and had completed the MMPI-2 and PAI during each round of screening. Both tests were scored automatically, using Kavales-ki\u2019s responses to create a computer-generated report of her psychological \u201cprofile.\u201d According to the MMPI-2 reports from Kavaleski\u2019s first two rounds of testing, she produced \u201cinvalid\u201d profiles because her responses were \u201ctoo defensive to permit an adequate assessment of her psychological adjustment.\u201d In both rounds of screening, the first and second psychiatrists who evaluated Kavaleski after reviewing these \u201cinvalid\u201d profiles reported that Kavaleski was defensive, guarded, or \u201cinterpersonally stiff.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The psychiatrists also took note of Kavaleski\u2019s ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>pearance, describing her as thin, with hair that was \u201cmessy\u201d or \u201cunkempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In the third round of testing, Kavaleski\u2019s responses produced a \u201cvalid\u201d MMPI-2 profile. The computer-generated profile indicated that Kavaleski had \u201c[ijndorsed\u201d certain test questions, known as \u201ccritical items,\u201d in the areas of acute anxiety, somatic symptoms, anxiety and tension, and deviant beliefs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A similar computer-generated report based on Kavaleski\u2019s responses to the PAI noted that Kavaleski presented a \u201c[l]ow risk\u201d in the \u201c[pjsychological rating risk factor\u201d category, and that she had indorsed critical items relating to drug problems, anxiety, persecution, and aggressive attitude.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Dr. Marcia Scott, who had interviewed Kavaleski in a previous round of screening, conducted Kavaleski\u2019s first-level interview on March 20, 2007. Scott reported that Kavaleski was \u201cless guarded\u201d than she had been in previous interviews, and was \u201cable to respond appropriately to relevant personal questions.\u201d Scott also made various observations about Kavaleski\u2019s weight and appearance, noting Kavaleski\u2019s \u201calmost cache[c]tic body\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and \u201cmessy\u201d hair. Scott concluded her report by stating that Kavaleski \u201cis a steady controlled person but has very limited self-awareness, little understanding of her motivations or emotional limitations and inflexible approaches to both internal and external stresses.\u201d Scott stated that Kavaleski\u2019s \u201ccapacity to evaluate situations and make effective judgments\u201d would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>impair her ability to work as a police officer, and referred Kavaleski for a second-level interview with Dr. Julia M. Reade.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Reade, who conducted each of Kavaleski\u2019s three second-level interviews, met with Kavaleski approximately three months later, on June 30, 2007. She described Kavaleski as \u201cthin, but not unhealthy looking,\u201d and again noted that \u201cher hair was messy.\u201d Reade stated that she had reviewed materials from Kavaleski\u2019s two previous rounds of psychological screening, and included in her report the critical items that Kavaleski had indorsed during the latest round of MMPI-2 and PAI testing. Reade described Kavaleski\u2019s demeanor during the interview as \u201cimpassive\u201d and concluded her report as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201cIn summary, despite her continued effort to be more open and flexible, Ms. Kavaleski continues to present as a psychologically inflexible, interpersonally stiff woman whose extreme defensiveness limits her capacity to reflect on her own decision-making, responses, actions or impact on others. Her concrete cognitive style is equally limiting and is likely related to what appears to be a charactero-logic rigidity. These limitations would interfere with Ms. Kavaleski\u2019s ability to manage the duties of a Boston [p]olice officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Based on Reade\u2019s report, the department notified HRD that it intended to bypass Kavaleski because she had failed to meet the psychological criteria for employment as a police officer. HRD accepted the department\u2019s stated reasons, and on August 31, 2007, Kavaleski appealed to the commission pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">A hearing was held before the commission on April 3, 2008, at which Kavaleski represented herself. The commission accepted numerous exhibits in evidence and heard testimony from Reade and Kavaleski. By a divided vote, the commission ruled that the department had not met its burden of establishing a reasonable justification for bypassing Kavaleski. The commission noted that a disqualifying psychiatric condition has not \u201cbeen found to exist in [Kavaleski], nor has the [department] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>specifically asserted any such condition.\u201d The commission ordered the department to place Kavaleski\u2019s name \u201cat the top of the eligibility list for original appointment to the position of [pjolice [o]fficer ... so that she shall receive at least one opportunity for consideration from the next certification for appointment as a [department] police officer.\u201d The commission also ordered that, should the department choose to require Kavaleski to submit to further psychological screening, it must use psychiatrists other than those who had previously been involved in screening or evaluating her.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In reaching its decision, the commission quoted several written findings of fact that it had made in deciding the case of Roberts vs. Boston Police Dep\u2019t, Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, No. G1-06-321 (Sept. 25, 2008) <em>(Roberts).</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Like the present case, <em>Roberts </em>involved a psychological bypass by the department based on the candidate\u2019s interviews with Scott and Reade. The candidate in that case had called psychologists Dr. Mark S. Schaeffer and Dr. James C. Beck<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to testify as expert witnesses, and the <em>Roberts </em>commission quoted extensively from their testimony in its written decision.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Schaeffer testified in <em>Roberts </em>that interpreting MMPI-2 and PAI results \u201cfall[s] within the professional discipline of psychology, as opposed to medicine and psychiatry.\u201d In discussing the psychiatrists\u2019 evaluations of Kavaleski in the present case, the commission quoted Schaeffer\u2019s testimony from <em>Roberts </em>as well as the <em>Roberts </em>commission\u2019s finding in that case that \u201call the expert witnesses who testified in [Roberts] agree that a <em>qualified psychologist </em>is the recommended professional with the necessary expertise to which a psychiatrist generally defers when it comes to the subject of psychological testing\u201d (emphasis in original). The commission then noted that none of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>psychiatrists involved in interviewing Kavaleski had consulted a specially-trained psychologist to interpret her test results.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Based in part on these findings, the commission determined that Reade\u2019s conclusions about Kavaleski\u2019s psychological fitness for employment as a police officer were not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The department filed an appeal in the Superior Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44, arguing that the commission had improperly relied on <em>Roberts. </em>Concluding that the commission had erroneously relied on testimony introduced in the <em>Roberts </em>case in reaching its decision in the present case, a Superior Court judge allowed the department\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and vacated the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\"><em>Standard of review. </em>When a candidate for appointment appeals from a bypass, the commission\u2019s role is not to determine whether that candidate should have been bypassed. Rather, the commission determines, \u201con the basis of the evidence before it, whether the appointing authority [has] sustained its burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there was reasonable justification\u201d for the decision to bypass the candidate. <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 Mass. 233, 241 (2006), citing G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2 (b). \u201cReasonable justification in this context means \u2018done upon adequate reasons sufficiently supported by credible evidence, when weighed by an unprejudiced mind, guided by common sense and by correct rules of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>quoting <em>Selectmen of Wakefield </em>v. <em>Judge of First Dist. Court of E. Middlesex, </em>262 Mass. 477, 482 (1928). In determining whether the department has shown a reasonable justification for a bypass, the commission\u2019s primary concern is to ensure that the department\u2019s action comports with \u201c[b]asic merit principles,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, </em>434 Mass. 256, 259 (2001). The com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>mission \u201cfinds the facts afresh\u201d in conducting this inquiry and is not limited to the evidence that was before the department. <em>Beverly </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 182, 187 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44, we review the commission\u2019s decision to determine whether it was in conformity with the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, supra </em>at 263. We may set aside or modify the commission\u2019s decision if we conclude that \u201cthe substantial rights of any party may have been prejudiced\u201d by a decision that is based on an error of law, unsupported by substantial evidence, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). Because it is the department that appealed from the commission\u2019s decision, the department bears the burden of establishing that the decision is invalid. <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Service Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 242. That is a \u201cheavy burden,\u201d <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, supra </em>at 263-264, since we give \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge\u201d of the commission in deciding these matters. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). \u201cThis standard of review is highly deferential to the agency on questions of fact and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Service Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>quoting <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>412 Mass. 416, 420 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The department advances two related arguments to support its claim that the commission\u2019s decision should be reversed. As stated, it contends that the commission erred as a matter of law in relying on testimony from <em>Roberts </em>to attack Reade\u2019s credibility. As a corollary, the department maintains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>that there was no properly admitted expert evidence to contradict Reade\u2019s testimony and that, therefore, the commission erred in substituting its own assessment of Kavaleski\u2019s psychological fitness for employment as a police officer. We agree that the commission should not have considered the expert testimony that was introduced in <em>Roberts, </em>but not for the reasons advanced by the department. In addition, we conclude that the commission was entitled to discredit Reade\u2019s testimony without hearing testimony from an opposing expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">General Laws c. 30A, which governs proceedings before the commission, sets forth the extent to which an agency may rely on, and take notice of, materials other than those supplied by the parties. General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (4), provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">\u201cAll evidence, including any records, investigation reports, and documents in the possession of the agency of which it desires to avail itself as evidence in making a decision, shall be offered and made a part of the record in the proceeding, and no other factual information or evidence shall be considered . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">A related provision, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (5), authorizes agencies to \u201ctake notice of any fact which may be judicially noticed by the courts,\u201d as well as any \u201cgeneral, technical or scientific facts within their specialized knowledge.\u201d However, \u201c[pjarties shall be notified of the material so noticed, and they shall be afforded an opportunity to contest the facts so noticed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., </em>398 Mass. 604, 605-606 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The critical component of these statutory provisions is that parties be afforded notice of and an opportunity to respond to the evidence on which an agency relies in rendering a decision. See, e.g., <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 89230 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>452 Mass. 764, 782 (2008) (agency erred in relying on psychiatric manual where petitioner not notified or afforded opportunity to refute that evidence); <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>354 Mass. 332, 336 (1968) (facts not properly before department where petitioner did not have opportunity to contest them). Thus, our concern with the commission\u2019s decision is not that the commission considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>testimony from a different commission proceeding, which it permissibly may do. See <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Medford, </em>425 Mass. 130, 140 (1997) (upholding State agency\u2019s reliance on transcripts from Federal criminal proceedings where transcripts bore \u201creasonable indicia of reliability\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., supra </em>at 606 (agency could not permissibly rely on determination of property values made in prior proceeding involving same party where prior decision was not supported by contemporaneous findings). Rather, the commission erred in failing to alert the department that it would be looking to Schaeffer\u2019s and Beck\u2019s testimony in <em>Roberts, </em>and considering it as evidence in the present case, thus depriving the department (and Kavaleski) of an opportunity to contest and respond to that evidence. Contrast <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Medford, supra </em>(agency introduced portions of transcript of prior criminal trial during hearing; defense counsel permitted to respond and to introduce other portions of transcript to question witness\u2019s credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Although we conclude that the commission erred by considering testimony from <em>Roberts </em>without notice to the parties and an opportunity to respond, that does not end our inquiry. Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), we also determine whether, as a result of that error, \u201cthe substantial rights of any party may have been prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">We are satisfied that the department was not prejudiced by the commission\u2019s reliance on expert testimony from <em>Roberts, </em>because the commission\u2019s decision did not depend on that testimony. Although, as the Superior Court judge noted, the extraneous evidence \u201cfactored into\u201d the commission\u2019s decision to discredit Reade\u2019s testimony regarding Kavaleski, the commission did not decide Kavaleski\u2019s appeal on that basis alone, and there was other substantial and reliable evidence in the record, independent of the testimony from <em>Roberts, </em>to support the commission\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., supra </em>at 607-608 (even if expert witness\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>testimony not credited, other \u201creliable evidence\u201d was sufficient to uphold agency\u2019s decision). The commission concluded that Reade\u2019s opinion was the result of arbitrary predispositions against Kavaleski, and that Reade (and, thus, the department) had based her determination on \u201cunsubstantiated and subjective\u201d criteria that lacked adequate factual support. This conclusion is supported by substantial evidence in the record. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See also <em>Embers of Salisbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 526, 528 (1988) (agency\u2019s decision must be supported by substantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\u201c \u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 means such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). \u201cThe standard is more stringent than abuse of discretion, and less than preponderance of the evidence; \u2018an agency\u2019s conclusion will fail judicial scrutiny if \u201cthe evidence points to no felt or appreciable probability of the conclusion or points to an overwhelming probability of the contrary.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Nursing, </em>456 Mass. 666, 674 (2010), quoting <em>Cobble </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>430 Mass. 385, 390-391 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The commission concluded that the department had bypassed Kavaleski based on mere conjecture, and that the evidence did not show that a disqualifying psychiatric condition \u201chas been found to exist in [Kavaleski].\u201d The commission emphasized the \u201cindefiniteness and inconclusiveness\u201d of the language employed by all the psychiatrists involved in Kavaleski\u2019s screenings. It observed that, in each of her interviews with Kavaleski, Reade had relied heavily on the earlier assessments of the first-level psychiatrists, repeating the \u201cdescriptive phrases\u201d and \u201calleged observations or determinations\u201d that had been made in prior reports. These earlier reports did not affirmatively state that Kavaleski suffered from any psychiatric disorder or condition but, rather, offered vague assessments that Kavaleski\u2019s profile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>was \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d with the presence of certain traits, that an eating disorder \u201cmay be present,\u201d and that it was \u201cnot possible to rule out\u201d other emotional problems. The commission found that Reade\u2019s \u201ctestimonial tenor, tone and content indicated that she entirely adopted and affirmed\u201d these earlier assessments, \u201cattribut[ing] great weight and reliability to them,\u201d and that, by doing so, Reade had evidenced a predisposition to finding Kavaleski psychologically unsuitable. These findings and conclusions were based on substantial evidence other than that derived from <em>Roberts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Further, the commission expressed concern regarding Reade\u2019s repeated references to Kavaleski\u2019s physical appearance and \u201cmessy hair,\u201d as well as Scott\u2019s use of \u201cextreme language\u201d in referring to Kavaleski\u2019s appearance as cachectic. See note 13, <em>supra. </em>The commission found, based on Kavaleski\u2019s appearance at the hearing, that those descriptions were \u201cclear misrepresentation[s]\u201d and an \u201cindication of some bias or some other improper consideration\u201d by the department.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Observing that neither Reade nor the department asserted that Kavaleski would be unable to perform the essential functions of the job of a police officer, the commission determined that no disqualifying condition \u201chas been found to exist in [Kavaleski], nor has the [department] specifically asserted\u201d that one exists. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">\u201cInstead of determining the existence of a specific disqualifying condition, according to specified standards and proscribed process, Dr. Reade looks for her own subjectively determined qualifying traits. Dr. Reade\u2019s screening process is arbitrary and capricious, in contradiction of the basic merit principles of [G. L. c. 31]. The accuracy and reliability of the psychological screening process, as applied to [Kavaleski], is incapable of substantiation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">\u201cAfter considering all the credible and reliable evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>in the record, I conclude that the Boston [p]olice [department did not have sound and sufficient reasons for bypassing [Kavaleski] for selection as a police officer in the [c]ity of Boston.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The department argues that, in making these findings, the commission impermissibly \u201csubstituted its own lay person opinion of Kavaleski\u201d for that of Reade and the other experts who had examined Kavaleski. This argument misstates the commission\u2019s role as fact finder. \u201cThe commission, and not the court, is the sole judge of the credibility and weight of the evidence before it.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>423 Mass. 7, 15 (1996). See <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 688, 695 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The commission was entitled to discredit Reade\u2019s assessment of Kavaleski even though Kavaleski offered no expert testimony of her own. See, e.g., <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>418 Mass. 380, 392 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMi-nico, </em>408 Mass. 230, 235 (1990) (\u201c[t]he law should not, and does not, give the opinions of experts on either side of . . . [a]n issue the benefit of conclusiveness, even if there are no contrary opinions introduced at the trial\u201d). See also <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>334 Mass. 549, 579 (1956) (\u201cThat a person qualifies as an expert does not endow his testimony with magic qualities\u201d). The commission properly explained on the record its reasons for rejecting portions of Reade\u2019s testimony. Contrast <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 634, 639-640 (1985), citing <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 470 (1981) (where there is uncontradicted expert testimony on subject beyond common knowledge and experience of fact finder, agency may not reject that testimony without providing basis for rejection in record).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Similarly, the commission was entitled to reject the department\u2019s assertion that Reade\u2019s evaluation was sufficient to disqualify Kavaleski. The commission appropriately recognized that Reade\u2019s function in the psychological screening process was narrowly circumscribed. Her sole task was to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>whether Kavaleski had a psychiatric condition that would prevent her from performing, even with reasonable accommodation, the essential functions of the job.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16). The record supports the commission\u2019s conclusions that Reade\u2019s opinions were \u201csubstantially subjective determinations\u201d that were \u201cinsufficiently factually supported,\u201d and that Reade did not provide a single \u201cconvincing situational example\u201d to support her conclusion that Kavaleski\u2019s \u201cdefensiveness\u201d and \u201cchar-acterologic rigidity\u201d would interfere with police work in an \u201cobjective real-world context.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Because the commission\u2019s conclusions were independent of its improper reliance on <em>Roberts </em>and are supported by substantial evidence in the record, the department has failed to meet its burden of establishing that the commission\u2019s decision was invalid pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order allowing the department\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings is reversed, and the judgment is set aside. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of an order affirming the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The facts are drawn from the findings of the Civil Service Commission (commission) and other documents of record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-9\">At oral argument, counsel for Kavaleski stated that Kavaleski is now commissioned as an ensign in the United States Navy Reserve.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In the context of civil service hiring and promotions, a \u201cbypass\u201d refers to a decision by the appointing authority (here, the Boston police department [department]) to hire someone other than the highest-ranking available candidate.

Rather, the department uses an eligibility list generated from a single administration of the civil service examination for multiple hiring cycles.
