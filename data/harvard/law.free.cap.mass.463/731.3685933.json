On appeal, the defendant claims error in a number of respects. Because we conclude that certain pivotal evidentiary rulings implicating identification were erroneous and not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\"><em>Introduction. </em>The essential facts surrounding the shooting death of Herman Taylor are not in dispute. Around 5:30 p.m. on July 12, 2006, minutes after eighteen year old Taylor left his home in the Roxbury section of Boston, he was approached by a man wearing a hooded \u201cChampion\u201d sweatshirt (hoodie). They engaged in what appeared to bystanders to be an animated conversation, until the hooded figure, whose face was partially obscured, pulled out a gun and shot Taylor multiple times, chasing him and shooting as Taylor ran from him in a futile attempt to escape. The hooded figure then fled, and Christopher Jami-son, who had been in an automobile driving past, ran to the victim\u2019s aid. Later that evening, without having identified his assailant, Taylor died of his wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Bystanders provided little by way of description of the shooter, no useable forensic evidence was discovered, and the murder weapon was never found. Video surveillance cameras in the area showed the hooded figure, whose face was not visible, arriving a block away from the scene of the shooting in a white Nissan Maxima automobile with a missing hubcap, which dropped him off and drove away. The vehicle\u2019s registration plates could not be discerned. Little progress was made in learning who murdered Taylor until, in March, 2007, police were provided information by Jamison, whom they were questioning in connection with a different matter. Jamison disclosed that he and several women had been driving past the shooting as it unfolded.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Approximately five months later, a grand jury were convened and heard testimony from, among others, Jamison; the women <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>who had been with him in the vehicle \u2014 his then girl friend Shagara Williams, who was driving, and her Mends Shumane Garvin and Danielle Canty; and the cousin of the owner of a white Nissan Maxima. The defendant was arrested on October 26, 2007. On December 5, 2007, the grand jury handed down indictments charging him with murder in the first degree, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1; possession of a firearm without a license, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a); </em>and possession of a loaded firearm, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (n).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The defendant grew up in the Bromley-Heath housing development, an area of Boston that the Heath Street gang claimed as its temtory. The location of the shooting, on Humboldt Avenue in the Roxbury section of Boston, was known as temtory belonging to the rival H-Block gang. During the year before the shooting, there had been fifty to sixty firearm \u201cincidents,\u201d including several homicides, in the combined H-Block and Heath Street areas. The Commonwealth\u2019s theory at trial was that the defendant, as a member of the more than two-hundred-person Heath Street gang, mistakenly took Taylor to be a member of the approximately fifty-person H-Block gang and, as part of an ongoing feud between the two gangs, shot and killed him. To prove that this was the defendant\u2019s motive for shooting Taylor, the Commonwealth introduced over objection extensive testimony about both gangs, prior incidents of violence in the vicinity of the shooting, the defendant\u2019s purported membership in the Heath Street gang, and also evidence that Roosevelt Wilkins, the owner of a Nissan Maxima resembling that which transported the shooter, was a Heath Street member, a Mend of the defendant, and not at work on the day of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">To prove that it was the defendant and not another Heath Street gang member who shot Taylor, the Commonwealth relied on the identification of the shooter made by occupants of Williams\u2019s vehicle while they were driving past. In addition to Williams\u2019s statement that she recognized the defendant, there was testimony that Jamison, a member of H-Block, had identified the defendant as the shooter. Jamison himself was not available to testify at Mal, and his identification of the shooter was put before the jury through Williams\u2019s testimony. Such testimony, however, was materially at odds with what Jamison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>had said before the grand jury. The defendant was not permitted to introduce any portion of Jamison\u2019s contrary grand jury testimony, including Jamison\u2019s failure to select the defendant\u2019s photograph from a photographic array shown to him before the grand jury. No other witnesses identified the defendant as the shooter. The defense was misidentification.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree on a theory of deliberate premeditation, and of both firearms offenses. On appeal, he claims error chiefly in five respects, challenging (1) key evidentiary rulings concerning identification and related testimony; (2) the admission of a rap music video (rap video) in which the defendant appeared; (3) the admission of police expert testimony on gangs and the expert\u2019s description of the defendant as a gang member; (4) an adverse ruling during the defendant\u2019s closing argument that precluded him from calling into question Jamison\u2019s credibility and reliability; and (5) assorted improprieties in the Commonwealth\u2019s use of grand jury and opinion testimony, as well as in its closing. He also requests that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the murder conviction to a lesser degree of guilt or, in the alternative, to grant him a new trial. Because we conclude that it was error to preclude the defendant from impeaching Williams\u2019s testimony as to Jamison by introducing Jamison\u2019s contrary grand jury testimony, to permit irrelevant and prejudicial identification testimony concerning certain photographs, and to allow admission of the prejudicial rap video, the convictions must be reversed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>The grand jury proceedings. </em>Because of its importance to the issues on appeal, we summarize relevant portions of the testimony given in connection with a grand jury investigation that began in September, 2007.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\"><em>Shagara Williams. </em>Williams, then eighteen years old, was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>first percipient witness to testify. During her testimony on September 7, she said she was unable to identify either the victim or the shooter. As they were driving on Humboldt Avenue, with her behind the wheel, Jamison saw someone he recognized, seemed surprised, and said, \u201cYo. Let me out the car. There goes that nigger Lawz.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She replied, \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d and Jami-son answered, \u201cThat nigger from Heath Street,\u201d whom he also identified as \u201cLamory.\u201d Although she had never seen him, she knew the name \u201cLamory\u201d as someone from Heath Street. Williams did not see the shooting. As Jamison was getting out of the vehicle, the back seat passengers, Canty and Garvin, were \u201ctalking about the boy falling down or getting shot or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\"><em>Christopher Jamison. </em>Jamison, then twenty-two years old, first testified before the grand jury on September 13, 2007. He telephoned Williams late in the afternoon of July 12, 2006, to pick him up and take him to the store. They were driving on Humboldt Avenue and he was in the front passenger seat, preparing marijuana for smoking, when Williams said, \u201c[Tjhere go your mans right there.\u201d He looked up, recognized Taylor, and saw the hooded figure, whom he did not recognize, standing on the sidewalk. Taylor walked past the hooded figure and then turned around and started talking to him. Because the two men were just talking, Jamison returned his attention to preparing his marijuana. He heard shots fired, Williams and Garvin started screaming, and then both said, \u201c[Ojh, my God, he shot him.\u201d Jamison saw Taylor running, with the \u201cguy with the hoodie\u201d a few feet behind, chasing him. He heard several more shots and saw Taylor fall at the corner of Ruthven Street and Humboldt Avenue. He demanded that Williams pull over and then leaped from the vehicle and ran to help Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Later that day, Williams and Garvin again picked Jamison up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>in Williams\u2019s vehicle, and Williams said that she thought the shooter had looked like \u201cLawz.\u201d Jamison knew the name \u201cLawz\u201d as being someone from Heath Street, but had not \u201cseen the face\u201d before that day. He was \u201ckind of shock[ed]\u201d that Williams, whom he was dating, would have been able to recognize Lawz. After that day, Jamison stopped speaking to Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Subsequently, Jamison saw a man referred to as \u201cLawz\u201d when they were both incarcerated in separate wings of the Suffolk County house of correction; the person was pointed out to him as \u201cone of those Heat kids.\u201d The individual had \u201cbrown\u201d skin and \u201ca small Afro.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the units were kept apart, he only saw the individual \u201ca couple times\u201d through a connecting glass door to the medical unit. A few days before his grand jury appearance, Jamison saw the man on the court house steps, when they were both reporting to their parole officers. They shook hands; Jamison said that he had never had a \u201cproblem\u201d with him, and they agreed that they wanted to put all the trouble between the Heath Street and H-Block gangs behind them.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">At that point, having been advised of it by the prosecutor, Jamison invoked his right to an attorney. Jamison returned to testify before the grand jury again on October 5. He identified a photograph that he had selected from a police photographic array containing the defendant\u2019s photograph as the person identified to him as \u201cLawz\u201d; the photograph he selected was not the defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\"><em>Danielle Canty and Shumane Garvin. </em>Canty, then nineteen years old, and Garvin, who had just turned eighteen, appeared before the grand jury on October 10, five days after Jamison\u2019s second appearance, and each stated that she was unable to identify the shooter. Canty testified that she had seen two teenaged males about seventeen or eighteen years old facing each other. She had turned to face forward because \u201cit didn\u2019t look like anything was happening,\u201d when the man in the front seat said, \u201cOh, shit.\u201d She turned around and saw the man in the hoodie, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>holding a gun, shooting and chasing the other man. Garvin heard arguing and saw \u201ctwo dudes yelling, face to face,\u201d after which it appeared that they had resolved the argument because they seemed ready to shake hands. She heard a gunshot as \u201cShagara and Chris said, \u2018That looks like Law[z].\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After Jamison jumped out, Williams drove away, \u201cscared, panicking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\"><em>Shagara Williams (second appearance). </em>Two days after Canty and Garvin testified, and more than a month after her first appearance, Williams appeared again before the grand jury and testified that she had not been entirely \u201caccurate\u201d at her first appearance. This time, she said that when Jamison exclaimed, \u201cYo, there goes Lawz,\u201d she \u201cglanced\u201d over and saw two men facing each other on the sidewalk, seeing their faces from \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>side.\u201d She recognized Lawz, but said, \u201cWho?\u201d because she was \u201cshocked\u201d that \u201cLawz was on Humboldt\u201d since he was from Heath Street. Williams kept driving, not looking further at the sidewalk, and \u201cpeople in the back were telling [her] that one of the boys was falling down.\u201d Contrary to her earlier testimony that she only knew the name \u201cLawz\u201d as being someone from Heath Street, she said that she had seen Lawz \u201cregularly\u201d several years before, when she was dating someone else from Heath Street. She identified a photograph of the defendant on which she had written \u201cknown to me as Lawz and arguing with another boy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><em>Bystanders unloading groceries. </em>Jeisy Guerrero, seventeen, a bystander who had been unloading groceries within a car length of the shooter, appeared on September 14. Guerrero saw the man in the hoodie arguing with Taylor for several minutes and then saw him shooting. She described the shooter as approximately twenty years old, with a mustache and hair that \u201cwasn\u2019t like a clean cut... it wasn\u2019t an Afro, but it was like it was growing. He cut it but it was growing in.\u201d Guerrero identified a photograph from a photographic array as one that \u201ckind of looked like\u201d the shooter, and she wrote on the back, \u201cHe looks like the person who killed Herman.\u201d The photograph she selected was not the defendant\u2019s. Three other bystanders who were unloading groceries with Guerrero were able to identify the shooter as \u201cblack\u201d but otherwise could describe only his clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">2. <em>Voir dire of gang expert. </em>The prosecutor moved in limine to have Boston police department Detective James Sheehan qualified as a gang expert, in order to opine both that a feud existed between H-Block and Heath Street and that the defendant was a member of the Heath Street gang. The prosecutor sought also to introduce a rap video, in which the defendant appeared, as evidence of his gang membership. The defendant moved to exclude all gang evidence. On the day before trial, to determine the bases of Sheehan\u2019s knowledge, whether he was qualified to offer the expert opinions, and the relevance of the video, the judge conducted an extensive voir dire of Sheehan; among other evidence, more than fifty police reports, fourteen \u201cfield interrogation, observation, frisk and/or search\u201d (FIO) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>reports,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a number of jail incident reports, a copy of the Boston police department gang database, and a copy of the rap video were introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Sheehan testified to the existence of an ongoing feud between H-Block and Heath Street from April, 2004, through July, 2006, based in large part on police incident reports prepared by others concerning investigations in which he had not participated, and also on his own interactions with unnamed H-Block and Heath Street members from 2005 to 2006. The judge concluded that Sheehan was qualified to give expert testimony on the existence of the feud because he had interviewed Heath Street and H-Block members who acknowledged it and had direct knowledge of a truce between the two groups, and because the \u201cpatterns of shooting incidents\u201d in the police reports \u201cdemonstrate[d] the longstanding dispute.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">As to his opinion that the defendant was a member of Heath Street, Sheehan presented the Boston police department\u2019s definition of a gang and the criteria police rely on to establish gang membership.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sheehan concluded that the defendant was a Heath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Street gang member based on his observation of the defendant in the company of known gang members, the fact that the defendant \u201clived in or frequented\u201d an area known to be a gang territory, the fact that the defendant\u2019s name was in the gang database, unspecified information from a confidential informant, and the observations of other police officers as documented in their FIO reports.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge ruled that Sheehan was qualified to offer an expert opinion on the defendant\u2019s membership in Heath Street because he had \u201cobserved the defendant numerous times with other Heath Street gang members,\u201d because there were \u201ca number\u201d of FIO reports, and because the judge took \u201cnote of the defendant\u2019s appearance in this gang rap video, professing his membership in Heath Street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The prosecutor sought also to introduce a rap video entitled \u201cHeat Life, Nothing But a P Thang,\u201d in which the defendant appeared, as evidence of the defendant\u2019s membership in Heath Street. He argued that the video, downloaded by police from an Internet site, was the defendant\u2019s statement \u201cpledging allegiance\u201d to the Heath Street gang. Sheehan did not know who wrote or produced the video, the names of the main performers, or which officer had downloaded it. He \u201cbelieved\u201d that the video was made in either 2005 or 2006. Although Sheehan recognized only \u201ca few\u201d people in the video, and could not state if any of the others were involved in Heath Street, he said that the video \u201cconsists of discussing being a Heath Street gang member and what takes place or what\u2019s done or conducted by individuals who are Heath Street gang members,\u2019\u2019and that \u201cHeat Life\u201d was a \u201creference to Heath Street gang members.\u201d He was not asked any questions about his knowledge of rap music. The video was ordered excluded as being more prejudicial than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>probative, unless the defendant disputed his membership in Heath Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">3. <em>Trial, </em>a. <em>Identification evidence. </em>Jamison was unavailable at trial because he asserted his privilege against self-incrimination pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, Jamison\u2019s reported identification of the defendant as the shooter (\u201cthere goes Lamory\u201d) was introduced through the testimony of Williams and Garvin. The defendant\u2019s repeated motions to introduce Jamison\u2019s nonidentification of the defendant before the grand jury were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Garvin said that she heard, then saw, the man in the hoodie arguing with another man; Williams made a statement; and then she and Williams heard gunshots. Garvin testified, contrary to her grand jury testimony, that she and Canty ducked down when the shots were fired and sat up as Williams was pulling over to let Jamison out. Consistent with the judge\u2019s ruling at an earlier voir dire,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> virtually all of Garvin\u2019s grand jury testimony about the events immediately surrounding the shooting was then introduced substantively by the prosecutor and another assistant district attorney reading the grand jury minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The prosecutor was permitted also to admit various statements of identification by Garvin. Garvin testified that, on her birthday in September, 2006, her brother introduced her to one of his friends who was known as \u201cLawz\u201d; she did not recognize the man. Garvin identified the defendant in the court room as the person to whom she had been introduced as \u201cLawz,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>also identified three photographs, one of them the defendant\u2019s, that she had selected a year later from a group of eight shown to her by police shortly before her October 10, 2007, appearance at the grand jury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Over repeated objection and following several sidebar conferences, Garvin responded to the prosecutor\u2019s questions concerning what \u201cwas going through her head\u201d when she was introduced to \u201cLawz\u201d by saying that she recognized the name \u201cLawz\u201d as having been used in William\u2019s vehicle on the day of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Canty, the other back seat passenger, testified that she had little memory of the events of July 12, 2006, almost three years earlier. She testified, inconsistent with her grand jury testimony, that her attention was drawn to a group of people standing on the sidewalk when \u201csomeone\u201d in Williams\u2019s vehicle recognized \u201csomeone on, like, the street.\u201d She only looked over because \u201cthey said \u2018there goes,\u2019 \u201d and could not remember that anything else had happened outside the vehicle until after the man got out. Although no voir dire of Canty was conducted, and no ruling made as to her memory, most of her testimony about the shooting consisted of having Canty read aloud her grand jury minutes in response to the prosecutor reading aloud the questions he had put to her at the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Williams testified at trial, as she had at her second appearance before the grand jury, that she heard Jamison exclaim, \u201cThere goes Lawz\u201d or \u201cThere goes Lamory,\u201d glanced over briefly, and recognized the man in the hoodie as \u201cLamory.\u201d Although Williams was not impeached with any of her grand jury testimony, significant portions of that testimony were read into evidence and then rephrased by the prosecutor, after Williams\u2019s review of the minutes did not refresh her recollection of particular details of her statements before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">An automobile damage appraiser testified that, at the time of the shooting, Wilkins (whom Sheehan had identified as a Heath Street gang member and friend of the defendant) had owned a white Nissan Maxima with a missing rear passenger\u2019s-side hubcap; the vehicle was sold approximately six months later. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>The owner of a restaurant on Cape Cod where Wilkins worked testified, based on employee timecards, that Wilkins had not worked on the day of the shooting. Video recordings from security cameras on nearby buildings were described by Boston police Sergeant Detective William Duggan, the lead homicide investigator, entered in evidence, and played for the jury. Duggan pointed out the similarities between the vehicle circling the area and dropping off the shooter and Wilkins\u2019s Nissan Maxima, particularly its missing hubcap.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Duggan also testified regarding the defendant\u2019s statement to police immediately after his October 26, 2007, arrest, which was not recorded. Initially, the defendant asserted that, following his release from incarceration on July 6, 2006, six days before the shooting, he had spent time with a former girl friend in Rhode Island. When questioned further after he was unable to provide the girl friend\u2019s current address or telephone number, the defendant said that he had lost touch with her while he was incarcerated, had spent the days following his release from prison \u201cdrunk and high\u201d with two of his childhood friends, and could not remember much about that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">b. <em>Gang evidence. </em>Sheehan testified as an expert on the Boston police department criteria for gang membership, the existence of the feud between Heath Street and H-Block, and the defendant\u2019s gang membership. He also introduced a copy of the gang database and identified photographs of the defendant\u2019s friends from that database, among them Wilkins, as known Heath Street members. Although the defendant denied being a member of Heath Street, and no parent or guardian had identified him as such, the defendant otherwise met all the criteria for gang membership. Based on the judge\u2019s ruling that the rap video would be excluded if the defendant did not challenge gang membership, counsel did not cross-examine Sheehan on the bases of his opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">c. <em>Rap video. </em>The judge again declined to allow admission of the rap video after the prosecutor solicited testimony from Dug-gan that, following his arrest, the defendant denied being a gang member but said that others thought he was one because of where he lived. Subsequently, however, the judge allowed the prosecutor\u2019s motion to admit both the video and a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>still photographs of the defendant derived from the video<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as rebuttal evidence because the defendant had \u201copened the door\u201d and challenged gang membership in his cross-examination of Duggan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The video was identified and introduced by Duggan, who testified that it was posted on the Internet in 2005. He did not know who wrote or produced it, and could not identify the lead performers. The only thing he knew about rap music was hearing it \u201cwhen my kids are in the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The video depicts approximately ten to twelve people, generally in a group rapping in the background, with one or two rappers in the foreground. The defendant appears in the background in a number of scenes, and in the foreground in a few others. The individuals in the video are not wearing the colors or insignia of the Miami Heat basketball team (which Sheehan described as Heath Street clothing), and the lyrics do not mention the Miami Heat or Heath Street. However, in a number of scenes, performers are wearing typical \u201cgangsta\u201d clothing,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and in a few scenes, some rappers, including the defendant, wear bandanas tied over the lower part of their faces. While the video does not show the defendant pledging his \u201callegiance\u201d to the Heath Street gang, it is replete with words and images that appear to glorify violence (\u201cwe have pills, perps, pistols and powder. It\u2019s a P-Thang\u201d), and the main rapper at times holds his hand as though it were a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">d. <em>Closing argument. </em>In his closing, the prosecutor relied heavily on Jamison\u2019s reported statement identifying the defendant. He suggested repeatedly, and contrary to the judge\u2019s explicit restrictions, that Garvin and other witnesses had recognized the defendant as the shooter.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He argued that the video showed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>defendant pledging allegiance to Heath Street, and that anyone who was a member of Heath Street had a motive to kill Taylor:<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">\u201cAnd you know the defendant was part of Heath Street because he did admit it. He admitted it when you saw him on that \u2018Heat Life\u2019 video, ladies and gentlemen. And you have those stills here before you. When there\u2019s nobody around, there\u2019s no court, there\u2019s no police officers and you see the defendant, you saw him pledging his allegiance to Heath Street. Detective Sheehan told you that one of the nicknames for Heath Street is \u2018Heat Life.\u2019 And that\u2019s all that he pledges on that video, \u2018Heat Life.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">\u201cAnd, as a Heath Street gang member, ladies and gentlemen, this defendant had the motive to kill Herman Taylor because this was about where the shooting occurred, not who the victim is. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Grand jury identification testimony by unavailable witness. </em>The judge denied the defendant\u2019s repeated motions, both before and during trial, to admit Jamison\u2019s identification testimony before the grand jury in which, when asked to identify Lawz, he selected a photograph other than the defendant\u2019s. The judge concluded that substantive admission of Jami-son\u2019s nonidentification would be an impermissible extension of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Duc Le, </em>444 Mass. 431, 435-442 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The defendant maintains that the evidence was admissible substantively, was exculpatory, and went to the heart of the central issue at trial \u2014 identification of the shooter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. 782, 796 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>423 Mass. 99, 109 (1996). He argues in the alternative that Jamison\u2019s nonidentification was in any event admissible for impeachment purposes. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 806 (2012).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>430 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Mass. 643, 649 (2000). He contends that his inability to challenge Jamison\u2019s purported identification deprived him of a critical ground of defense and violated his constitutional rights to due process, a fair trial, and confrontation of the witnesses against him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 796-797 &amp; n.20 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>447 Mass. 274, 293 &amp; n.4 (2006) (Cordy, J., dissenting) (\u201cThere is no longer any doubt that mistaken eyewitness identification is the primary cause of erroneous convictions, outstripping all other causes combined\u201d; seventy-seven per cent of wrongful convictions where defendant was exonerated through use of deoxyri-bonucleic acid [DNA] evidence were \u201cproduct of mistaken eyewitness identifications\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">We need not reach the question whether, in these circumstances, Jamison\u2019s testimony was also admissible substantively,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> because it was clear error to preclude the defendant\u2019s use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Jamison\u2019s grand jury testimony, as requested, for impeachment purposes. Notwithstanding the Commonwealth\u2019s contentions to the contrary,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we agree that the evidence was plainly admissible for this purpose, and that the defendant preserved his objection to its exclusion. The identification of the defendant by Jamison was pivotal to establishing the identity of the shooter. Yet, Jamison did not testify at trial, and his purported identification of the defendant was admitted at trial through statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>by Williams, in part by introduction of her own testimony before the grand jury.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">\u201cWhen a hearsay statement has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked ... by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if the declarant had testified as a witness.\u201d Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 806 (2012). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>430 Mass. 643, 649 (2000). When Jamison\u2019s hearsay statement was admitted at trial, its credibility could properly have been attacked by his grand jury testimony to the contrary. Had Jamison been available to testify at trial, he could have testified, consistent with such grand jury testimony, that he did not recognize the shooter, that he had not met the defendant before the shooting, and that, when asked to identify \u201cLamory Gray, also known as Lawz,\u201d he selected a photograph other than the defendant\u2019s. Such testimony would have countered Williams\u2019s version of what Jamison said while in her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Moreover, given the critical nature of a defendant\u2019s ability to impeach an identification witness, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vardinski, </em>438 Mass 444, 450 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>420 Mass. 458, 465 (1995) (\u201c \u2018whenever eyewitness testimony is introduced against an accused,\u2019 we \u2018require the utmost protection against mistaken identification\u2019 \u201d), the exclusion of this evidence raises significant due process concerns. Where \u201cidentification was an important issue, the defendant undoubtedly had the right to show that [the] identification of him was unreliable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>392 Mass. 558, 563 (1984), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>366 Mass. 284, 290 (1974). \u201cThe ability to cross-examine the witness [who made a prior out-of-court identification but now denies or does not remember it] might be undermined to the point of a denial of confrontation rights ... by such things as the judge\u2019s limiting the scope of cross-examination, or the witness\u2019s assertion of a privilege.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Duc Le, supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>438, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 561-562 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">We turn to whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Identification of the shooter was the key issue at trial, and misidentification was the theory of the defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 465 (\u201cdanger of mistaken identification by a victim or a witness poses a real threat to the truth-finding process of criminal trials. . . . Compounding this problem is the tendency of juries to be unduly receptive to eyewitness evidence\u201d). \u201cIt is crucial to the fact finder\u2019s assessment of the truth to allow the defendant to probe fully on cross-examination the infirmities of the identification.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vardinski, supra </em>at 450-451.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Williams\u2019s identification of the shooter at trial was somewhat uncertain, and none of the other trial witnesses was able to identify the defendant as being the shooter. On cross-examination, Williams testified that she was influenced in her recognition of the defendant by Jamison\u2019s statement, \u201cThere goes Lawz,\u201d that she only glanced briefly over her shoulder at the side view of the hooded man\u2019s face, and that she might have been mistaken in her identification. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>460 Mass. 590, 604 n.16 (2011) (eyewitness testimony is \u201cgreatest source of wrongful convictions\u201d). Guerrero, who was standing only one car-length away from the shooter for up to several minutes, was unable to identify the defendant from a photographic array and selected another individual. Canty could not identify anyone, and Garvin was able to identify the defendant not as the shooter but only as someone she had met through her brother well after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">In his closing, defense counsel attempted to point out that, because Jamison was not available to testify at trial, the defense was unable to cross-examine him as to his ability to observe the shooter, whether his observations were impaired by drugs (given that Jamison was \u201crolling weed\u201d), and whether he had any bias toward the defendant. The prosecutor objected, and the judge sustained the objection, thereby exacerbating the prejudice to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jewett, supra </em>at 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Throughout his questioning of witnesses and in particular in his closing, the prosecutor relied heavily on Jamison\u2019s reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>statement, made while in Williams\u2019s vehicle, identifying the defendant. He emphasized the name \u201cLawz\u201d in questioning Williams and Garvin, reiterating it himself and soliciting repeated testimony on Jamison\u2019s use of the name. He elicited from Duggan, the lead homicide investigator, that there were no leads in the case until March 15, 2007, when Jamison \u201cc[a]me forward,\u201d thus emphasizing the importance of Jamison\u2019s testimony in the eyes of the investigating officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The impact on the jury of Jamison\u2019s reported statement was likely significant. That the statement was important in the jury\u2019s deliberations is reflected in one of their questions to the judge.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The nonidentification evidence was particularly critical in this case, given that Jamison did not testify at the grand jury to having made the statement of identification attributed to him at trial, and indeed testified that it was Williams, and not he, who identified the shooter, whom he had never seen before. Moreover, when asked at the grand jury to identify a photograph of \u201cLam-ory,\u201d Jamison did not select a photograph of the defendant. This could well have had heightened significance, since the nearby witness to the shooting, Guerrero, also failed to select a photograph of the defendant when asked to identify the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">We cannot say that the error precluding the defendant from using Jamison\u2019s grand jury testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. It deprived the defendant of the ability to impeach a critical witness and, thus, deprived him of a fair trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90, 94 (1978), <em>S.C., </em>385 Mass. 733 (1982), citing <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284 (1973) (\u201cWhen evidence concerning a critical issue is excluded and when that evidence might have had a significant impact on the result of the trial, the right to present a full defense has been denied\u201d). A new trial is required on this basis alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">2. <em>Hearsay identification of photographs by Garvin. </em>By the time of her grand jury appearance, on October 10, 2007, Garvin was able to identify the defendant as \u201cLawz,\u201d based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>introduction made by her brother in September, 2006, months after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The prosecutor introduced, over objection and following a voir dire hearing, three photographs with Garvin\u2019s writing on the back of each. Around the time of her grand jury appearance, police showed her a series of photographs, including the defendant\u2019s, and asked if she recognized anyone; she was not asked to identify the shooter. She wrote on the back of one of the photographs, \u201cWent to school with. From Geneva. Nothing to do with it\u201d; on another, \u201cI saw him around Mattapan, and he had nothing to do with this\u201d; and on the defendant\u2019s photograph, \u201cMy brother\u2019s friend Lawz.\u201d After her voir dire, at which Garvin testified that she did not write \u201cnothing to do with it\u201d on the back of the defendant\u2019s photograph because she remembered the name \u201cLawz\u201d as being used in Williams\u2019s vehicle on the day of the shooting, the annotated photographs were ruled admissible as prior acts of identification. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801(d)(1)(c) (2012). Garvin\u2019s identification of the defendant\u2019s photograph was also ruled admissible. The judge, however, cautioned the prosecutor that he was not to imply by this evidence that Garvin had recognized the defendant as the shooter. Nonetheless, over repeated objection, the prosecutor did precisely that, in both his questioning and his closing argument, when he repeatedly emphasized that Garvin wrote \u201cnothing to do with it\u201d on the two photographs but did not write \u201cnothing to do with it\u201d on the defendant\u2019s photograph, implying that Garvin had recognized the defendant as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The defendant maintains that the statements and the photographs were inadmissible under Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801(d)(1)(c). To be admissible, evidence must, first, be relevant \u201cto prove an issue in the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCorte, </em>373 Mass. 700, 702 (1977). Once having met this threshold inquiry, however, relevant evidence is inadmissible if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvia, </em>456 Mass 182, 192 (2010). \u201cWhether evidence ... is relevant, and whether the probative value of such evidence is outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice, are determinations committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed by a reviewing court absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u2018palpable error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>460 Mass. 181, 192-193 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCowen, </em>458 Mass. 461, 478 (2010). The defendant bears the burden of establishing both an abuse of discretion and the resulting prejudice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, supra, </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>382 Mass. 119, 125 (1980), <em>S.C., </em>400 Mass. 516, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 935 (1987). Here, the defendant has met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Regardless of whether the statements and the photographs were properly admissible as a hearsay exception, see Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801(d)(1)(c), a question we need not decide, they were not relevant to establish any fact at trial. The photographs and Garvin\u2019s statements of recognition as to someone she knew from her high school, and someone else she recognized as a resident of Mattapan, neither of whom had any involvement in or witnessed any of the events, served merely to confuse the jury and should not have been admitted. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Garvin\u2019s testimony concerning her introduction to the defendant months after the shooting, and her resulting ability to identify the defendant at trial and in a photograph, was of marginal relevance at best. Likewise, her testimony that, when introduced to her brother\u2019s friend, \u201cLawz,\u201d she recalled that name as having been used in Williams\u2019s vehicle, was, if relevant to a recounting of events on the day of the shooting, certainly cumulative of her testimony as to what she heard while in the automobile. Such testimony was far more prejudicial than probative in any event, in a case where the identity of the shooter was the central issue. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 403 (evidence not admissible if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues [or] misleading the jury\u201d). Admission of the photographs in such circumstances was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">3. <em>Rap video. </em>The defendant challenges the introduction of the rap video as evidence of his gang membership. In the circumstances of an apparently random shooting on a public sidewalk, evidence of the feud between H-Block and Heath Street, and of the defendant\u2019s membership in Heath Street, was relevant to provide a reason for an otherwise inexplicable killing. \u201cWe repeatedly have held that evidence of gang affiliation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>admissible to show motive or joint venture . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, supra </em>at 193, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swafford, </em>441 Mass. 329, 332 (2004). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>450 Mass. 395, 399, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 893 (2008) (evidence of defendant\u2019s gang membership and turf war over use of park for drug sales properly admitted to show motive for shooting where police officer testified to defendant\u2019s gang membership and ongoing territorial dispute based on personal knowledge, and even where evidence also included improper opinion evidence, it was harmless error because cumulative of gang membership evidence offered by multiple other witnesses); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>443 Mass 824, 834 (2005) (evidence victim \u201cflashed\u201d gang colors admissible to explain defendant\u2019s state of mind). Nevertheless, relevance is only the threshold inquiry, and the proffered evidence must also be more probative than prejudicial. The rap video was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">As stated, after viewing the video that the prosecutor sought to introduce as evidence of the defendant\u2019s membership in Heath Street and his \u201cpledging allegiance\u201d to the Heath Street gang, the judge ruled that its admission would be \u201cmore prejudicial than probative\u201d and ordered it excluded unless the defendant challenged evidence of his gang membership. The judge allowed the video to be played for the jury, over vehement objection and offers by the defendant to stipulate to gang membership, following cross-examination of Duggan about the defendant\u2019s photograph in the gang database.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">A determination whether to permit the Commonwealth to rehabilitate its witness is within the discretion of the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, supra. </em>Even if we accept the judge\u2019s conclusion that rehabilitation of Duggan was necessary to rebut any possible inference that the defendant contested gang membership, however, the rap video should not have been admitted. It was minimally if at all probative, and highly prejudicial. \u201c[Ejvidence that poses a risk of unfair prejudice need not always be admitted simply because a defendant has opened the door to its admission; the judge still needs to weigh the probative value of the evidence and the risk of unfair prejudice, and determine whether the balance favors admission.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCowen, </em>458 Mass. 461, 479 n. 15 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>By the time the rap video was introduced, the defendant had not otherwise contested that he was a gang member; indeed, he had offered to stipulate to that effect. Sheehan had testified as an expert as to the defendant\u2019s gang membership, and the Boston police gang database, containing the defendant\u2019s photograph, had also been admitted in evidence. Given the result of the voir dire, the defendant had refrained from cross-examining Sheehan precisely to avoid having the jury view the rap video.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The video was produced at an unknown point in or before 2005, and was available on a commercial Web site promoting rap artists. The defendant did not write or perform the lyrics or produce the video,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and it was not found in his possession. The lyrics show no connection to the defendant that would suggest they were biographical or otherwise indicative of his own motive or intent at the time of the shooting. Contrast, e.g., <em>Jones </em>v. <em>State, </em>347 Ark. 409, 417-421 (2002). Yet, the video was admitted specifically as an asserted statement of gang allegiance by the defendant, based on Sheehan\u2019s voir dire testimony as to its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Even if the video had contained direct statements of the defendant\u2019s gang allegiance, we are not persuaded by the opinions of courts in other jurisdictions that view rap music lyrics \u201cnot as art but as ordinary speech\u201d and have allowed their admission in evidence as literal statements of fact or intent \u201cwithout contextual information vital to a complete understanding of the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Dennis, Poetic (Injustice? Rap Music Lyrics as Art, Life, and Criminal Evidence, 31 Colum. J.L. &amp; Arts 1, 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>38 &amp; n.224 (2007) (Dennis) (collecting cases); <em>id. </em>at 1, citing Lyddane, Understanding Gangs and Gang Mentality: Acquiring Evidence of the Gang Conspiracy, 54 U.S. Attorney\u2019s Bull., no. 3, 2006, at 8 (advising prosecutors to seek out rap lyrics as evidence for trial). In contrast to such treatment of rap music, \u201c[cjourts do not treat lyricists of other mainstream musical genres similarly, even those who live an outlaw lifestyle or promote an outlaw image... are not presumed to be making statements about their beliefs, intent or their conduct. . . . [W]ith respect to country music, we do not likely believe that Johnny Cash shot a man simply to watch him die. With respect to reggae, we do not generally take to heart Bob Marley\u2019s proclamation: \u2018I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Footnotes omitted.) Dennis, <em>supra </em>at 15. We discern no reason why rap music lyrics, unlike any other musical form, should be singled out and viewed sui generis as literal statements of fact or intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Although Sheehan asserted during the voir dire that the video \u201cconsists of discussing being a Heath Street gang member and what takes place or what\u2019s done or conducted by individuals who are Heath Street gang members,\u201d there was no evidence that Sheehan was an expert on music video recordings or rap music. A police officer who has been qualified as a \u201cgang expert\u201d cannot, without more, be deemed an expert qualified to interpret the meaning of rap music lyrics.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In any event, Shee-han did not mention the rap video in his trial testimony. Duggan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>who testified regarding the video at trial, did not do so as an expert and stated explicitly that he knew nothing about rap music. The only statements he made concerning the content of the rap video were to describe the defendant\u2019s location in various still photographs derived from it. Therefore, there was no basis on which either witness properly could offer an expert opinion on the meaning of the video as a pledge of gang allegiance, the reason for which it was ostensibly admitted. The jury heard no other expert testimony as to the video\u2019s meaning. Compounding the error, in closing argument the prosecutor relied heavily on Sheehan\u2019s voir dire explanation of the meaning of the video as the defendant\u2019s \u201cpledging his allegiance\u201d to Heath Street, statements for which the jury heard no basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Balanced against the minimal probative value of the video, its prejudicial effect was overwhelming. Although the defendant is neither of the two featured rappers, lyrics such as \u201cforty-four by my side,\u201d accompanied by images of stereotypical \u201cgangsta thugs,\u201d some of whose faces are covered by bandanas, could not but have had a prejudicial impact on the jury.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The impact of the video was evident even on the trial judge, who stated that he relied on it in reaching a conclusion concerning the defendant\u2019s gang membership. Even if defense counsel\u2019s question about the defendant\u2019s photograph in the gang database is viewed as having challenged his status as a Heath Street gang member, other corrective measures, such as the defendant\u2019s offered stipulation, would have been sufficient to rebut any perceived challenge. We agree with the initial determination of the judge: the prejudicial effect of the rap video far outweighed its probative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>value. Admission of the rap video was, in the circumstances, prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">4. <em>Other claims of error. </em>Given the result we reach, we do not address the defendant\u2019s remaining claims of error, confident that matters such as the Commonwealth\u2019s too frequent reliance on grand jury testimony, where trial testimony was not inconsistent and no finding of feigned memory loss was made, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 388-389 &amp; n.6 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 729 (2008); and the admission of opinion testimony from a police witness assessing the demeanor of grand jury witnesses, see <em>WBZ-TV4 </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>408 Mass. 595, 599-601 (1990), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>64 Mass.

The defendant was never seen wearing Heath Street clothing, had no gang tattoos, and told police that others believed he was a Heath Street member because of where he lived. He did not identify himself, nor had any parent or guardian identified him as being, a gang member. However, there were eleven FIO reports indicating that other officers had seen the defendant in the Heath Street area with members of three different gangs, and his name appeared in the Boston police department gang database.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\">The prosecutor moved to admit all of Garvin\u2019s grand jury testimony and three photographs she had identified in September, 2007. On the second day of trial, a hearing was conducted to determine her present memory of the shooting and whether she was able to identify the defendant as the shooter. She testified at the voir dire, contrary to her grand jury testimony, that she ducked when the shots rang out. The judge concluded that if she testified similarly at trial, her grand jury testimony could be introduced substantively since she asserted no memory of certain events to which she had testified previously, but that it would have to be done \u201cquestion by question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">The judge determined also that Garvin had been unable to identify the shooter. Although the prosecutor agreed that Garvin did not recognize either the victim or the shooter on the day of the shooting, he argued, \u201c[I]n response to my questioning, she begins to use the name \u2018Lawz.\u2019 And then \u2014 and she continues to do that.\u201d The judge ruled that Garvin was merely adopting the prosecutor\u2019s words, and if her grand jury testimony were admitted, her use of \u201cLawz\u201d when referring to the shooter would be replaced by \u201cthe shooter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The three photographs, annotated on the back with Garvin\u2019s handwritten comments, were introduced in evidence over objection.

G. Evid. \u00a7 804(b)(1) (2012). A determination whether there was opportunity and similar motive is fact specific and dependent on the particular circumstances. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>McFall, </em>558 F.3d 951, 961 (9th Cir. 2009), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>505 U.S. 317, 325 (1992) (under Fed. R. Evid. 804[b][1], \u201c[pjrosecutors need not have pursued every opportunity to question [the witness] before the grand jury; the exception requires only that they possessed the motive to do so\u201d). While we have observed that \u201c[i]t is likely to be very difficult for defendants offering grand jury testimony to satisfy the \u2018opportunity and similar motive\u2019 test,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemente, supra </em>at 315, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Omar, </em>104 F.3d 519, 523 (1st Cir. 1997), the circumstances here may well satisfy that requirement. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sineiro, </em>432 Mass. 735, 743 n.9 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Jamison appears to have been the Commonwealth\u2019s key witness before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>grand jury. His description of the events was corroborated by third-party witnesses, including police officers, and physical evidence such as security video recordings. At the time of his non-identification of the defendant\u2019s photograph, Jamison\u2019s identification of the shooter was critical. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 162 (1982). Williams had testified at that point that she did not recognize the shooter, that Jamison recognized the shooter and \u2022 called out the name \u201cLamory,\u201d and that she only knew the name \u201cLamory\u201d as being someone from Heath Street. Guerrero, who stood near the shooter for several minutes, identified a photograph of the person she thought \u201clooked like\u201d the shooter; that photograph was not the defendant\u2019s. The other three witnesses unloading groceries had been unable to identify anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Thus, at the time Jamison identified someone else as \u201cLamory,\u201d the Commonwealth had offered no other identification of the defendant. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the prosecutor had \u201cno motive to examine Jamison further\u201d after he failed to identify the defendant\u2019s photograph because of the \u201cobvious falsity of Jamison\u2019s misidentification,\u201d the prosecutor, lacking any other identification witness, would appear to have had a motive to prove the falsity of the Commonwealth\u2019s key witness\u2019s identification of someone other than the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The Commonwealth asserts that there was no abuse of discretion in declining to admit the evidence for impeachment purposes because the judge never faced this question. According to the Commonwealth, the defendant sought only to introduce the evidence substantively, and this decision was likely strategic, since counsel would not have wanted the Commonwealth to introduce other portions of Jamison\u2019s grand jury testimony. Having reviewed the defendant\u2019s motion to \u201cchallenge\u201d the identification, the hearing transcripts, and other documents in the record, we are satisfied that the defendant sought to introduce the evidence for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The Commonwealth argues also that the nonidentification evidence was properly excluded because the prosecutor would have been able to rebut it with other grand jury testimony of Jamison. Had the nonidentification evidence been introduced, the prosecutor would certainly have been free to offer such evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seng, </em>456 Mass. 490, 498-499 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tennison, </em>440 Mass. 553, 563 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carmona, </em>428 Mass. 268, 272 (1998). However, the transcript of the grand jury proceedings also contains other evidence that supports Jamison\u2019s non-identification of the defendant, including his statement that he did not recognize the shooter at the time and that he had never seen the person named \u201cLawz\u201d until months after the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\">We need not address whether Jamison\u2019s purported statements of identification made while in Williams\u2019s vehicle were properly admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule, given the defendant\u2019s agreement that they could be admitted substantively. Had the defendant not so agreed, the record permits some doubt whether Jamison\u2019s statements met the requirements for that exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">\u201cQuestion No. 1. \u2018Is [Williams\u2019s] testimony that she heard stated \u201cLawz\u201d and/or \u201cLamory\u201d in the car direct evidence, something that she \u201cclaims to have heard with her own senses?\u201d \u2019 And it references page 11 of my instructions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The rap video \u201cHeat Life, Nothing But a P Thang\u201d evidently draws from both the music and lyrics of the rap song \u201cNuthin\u2019 But a \u2018G\u2019 Thang,\u201d written by \u201cgangsta rapper\u201d Dr. Dre and performed by rapper Snoop Dogg, on the 1992 platinum-selling album \u201cThe Chronic.\u201d See Johnson, Silencing Gangsta Rap: Class and Race Agendas in the Campaign Against Hardcore Rap Lyrics, 3 Temp.
