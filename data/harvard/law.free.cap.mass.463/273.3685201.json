On appeal, the defendant claims error in the admission in evidence of statements he made to police following his arrest on unrelated charges; statements made by his codefendant admitted through testimony of the codefendant\u2019s sister; grand jury testimony by the codefendant\u2019s sister, admitted substantively; and testimony of a witness who saw the defendant near the scene of the shooting that he had served time in prison with the defendant. The defendant contends also that we should exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to grant him a new trial. Because errors in the admission of certain evidence created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, we reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\"><em>Background. </em>We recite the facts the jury could have found, reserving some details for later discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">1. <em>The shooting. </em>On July 26, 2005, the victim was shot in the chest across the street from the Pawtucket Pharmacy (pharmacy) in Lowell, ran through traffic with a group of other young men, and collapsed in a pool of blood in the doorway to the pharmacy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The shooting took place at approximately 5:36 p.m. at one of the busiest intersections in Lowell. Many witnesses, including drivers waiting for the traffic signals to change, pedestrians, and residents of nearby apartments, described the event to police, but none was able to identify any of the participants. All of the witnesses reported that the participants were young, Hispanic males.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The evidence concerning the planning of the robbery by the defendant and the codefendant, Jose Luis Claudio Benitez (Claudio),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the flight from the scene of the shooting, was introduced through the Commonwealth\u2019s key witness, Jesus Antonio Marquez,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the driver of the getaway vehicle. The defendant and Claudio knew the victim and knew that he was a heroin dealer; the defendant had purchased heroin from the victim on a number of occasions. On July 26, 2005, Claudio telephoned the victim\u2019s cellular telephone number and arranged to purchase eighty dollars\u2019 worth of heroin. The transaction was to take place at a grocery store near the victim\u2019s home. Claudio drove the defendant and Marquez to the planned meeting location in a white Honda automobile owned by Marquez.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">When they arrived at the grocery store, the victim was not present; Claudio telephoned the victim again and arranged to meet in the parking lot of a Red Cross building next door to the victim\u2019s apartment building on Pawtucket Street. Claudio then suggested that they rob the victim, and the defendant, saying that the victim owed him money, agreed to participate in the robbery. En route, with Marquez driving, Claudio handed the defendant a pistol, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t go shooting [the victim], you know; just rob him. Don\u2019t go shooting him if he don\u2019t got nothing.\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cI\u2019m going to get my money, but I ain\u2019t stupid. I\u2019m not going to shoot him.\u201d Marquez parked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>on School Street a few houses from the intersection with Paw-tucket Street; as the defendant and Claudio were heading down School Street, Claudio told Marquez not to leave. Shortly thereafter, Marquez heard a gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Approximately six minutes after Marquez heard the gunshot, he saw the defendant running toward him up School Street from the direction of Pawtucket Street, turned the vehicle around, and picked up the defendant. The defendant urged Marquez to leave, but Marquez refused. Claudio then ran around the comer and was able to get into the back seat of the vehicle. He turned to the defendant and asked, \u201cWhy did you shoot him, you know? I told you not to shoot him. I told you not to smoke him. Why did you shoot him?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Claudio directed Marquez to drive to the apartment of Claudio\u2019s sister, Olga Gonzalez, overriding the defendant\u2019s request to be driven to the apartment where he was staying. Marquez drove to Gonzalez\u2019s apartment and parked in the back. Because Gonzalez did not know Marquez or the defendant, she would not permit them to enter her apartment; they remained in back of the apartment building while Claudio went inside the apartment. Claudio asked for a towel and a change of clothes; he told Gonzalez that \u201c[h]e told him not to do it\u201d and that \u201cthe other guy shot someone\u201d even though Claudio had told him not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Claudio made several calls from Gonzalez\u2019s home telephone. Gonzalez then went outside with Claudio for a few minutes. The defendant offered Gonzalez a distinctive gold necklace with a jeweled crucifix; saying she \u201chad a man,\u201d Gonzalez refused to accept it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Marquez and the defendant waited in the back yard, Claudio walked down the street to talk to one of Gonzalez\u2019s neighbors, Migdalia Fontanez, a good friend and former girl friend of Claudio and the godmother of Gonzalez\u2019s daughter. The defendant and Marquez left together; Marquez drove the defendant to the address he requested, near the home of someone named \u201cHumble,\u201d whom Marquez identified as a friend of Claudio and an acquaintance of Marquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">A tall, light-skinned Puerto Rican man known as \u201cT,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>later identified as Thomas Louis Clermont, arrived in a small, white Honda Civic automobile. Marquez returned from dropping off the defendant to pick up Claudio, and Claudio, Marquez, and Clermont talked for a while. Clermont told Claudio, \u201cIt\u2019s my biscuit. I\u2019ll take it,\u201d and Claudio handed him a gun wrapped in a towel. Marquez testified that Claudio decided not to accept a ride with Marquez and that Clermont and Claudio left together in Clermont\u2019s white vehicle while Marquez drove to his girl friend\u2019s house. Fontanez testified that Claudio and Clermont drove off together in the small white vehicle that Clermont had been driving. Clermont was called to testify at trial. Outside the presence of the jury, he asserted his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">2. <em>The investigation. </em>At the time of the shooting, Francis Kelly, Sr., an off-duty Chelmsford police officer, and his son, Francis Kelly, Jr., an off-duty Lowell fire fighter, were in a pickup truck on Pawtucket Street, stopped for a traffic light a few vehicles away from the intersection with School Street. They saw four young, Hispanic males<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> run from the parking lot of the Red Cross building, cross the street through heavy traffic on Pawtucket Street, and head toward School Street. At the entrance to the pharmacy, one of the men stumbled and fell. Two stopped and appeared to be trying to help the man who had fallen, then continued running up School Street; the fourth stayed over the man for a few seconds, then ran up School Street as well.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Kellys pulled into the pharmacy parking lot and went to assist the victim. He was lying face down, moaning but unresponsive. The Kellys telephoned police, then turned the victim over and saw that he had been shot. Emergency medical personnel arrived immediately thereafter and transported the victim to a hospital, where he died as a result of a single gunshot wound to the chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Shortly before the shooting, the victim, who was a frequent customer, had purchased a bottle of soda at the pharmacy. He was wearing a distinctive jeweled crucifix on a gold chain that he was known to wear habitually. Police found sandals and several packages of heroin in the parking lot of the Red Cross building.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A blood trail led from these items to the doorway of the pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Two pedestrians (twelve and fourteen year old siblings) reported seeing a darker-skinned Hispanic male running toward them, up the hill on School Street in the direction leading away from Pawtucket Street. Another witness, who was in a car waiting at the traffic light on School Street, saw four males, one African-American and the others Caucasian or Hispanic, running along Pawtucket Street away from the pharmacy. A witness who was unloading groceries from a taxicab saw a \u201cgroup\u201d of \u201clike four or five boys\u201d she described as \u201clight skinned\u201d in the parking lot of the Red Cross building; they were standing in the lot talking and then started heading up the street when the witness heard a gunshot and saw the victim crossing the street toward the pharmacy. One of the boys snatched something from the victim, the boys \u201csplit up,\u201d and they all \u201cstarted running.\u201d A resident of School Street, who was driving past her house, saw an older white automobile, which she identified as a Honda, parked in her driveway. The vehicle had one male occupant, wearing a blue and white \u201cdo-rag\u201d; he turned and looked directly at her. The resident continued around the block and parked in back of her house. When she entered her house, the white vehicle was no longer in her driveway. The resident was unable to identify the driver from a photographic array. Another witness, driving on <em>School Street, </em>saw two Hispanic males, in their \u201clate teens or early twenties,\u201d run around the corner from Pawtucket Street. One, wearing white, was running ahead of the other, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>got into a white Honda that was pulling out of a driveway and partially blocking traffic. The vehicle started driving up School Street. The second man, wearing a numbered sports jersey, was holding a dark object that the witness thought might have been a gun tucked in his waistband; because the traffic light changed, the witness did not see whether the second individual reached the Honda.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Police investigated the telephone numbers recorded in the victim\u2019s cellular telephone that were called during the last hours of his life. One of these callers was Daniel Pacheco, a heroin user well known to police. Pacheco previously had purchased heroin from the defendant,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and had also been incarcerated in the Department of Correction\u2019s classification center at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Concord (MCI-Concord) at the same time as the defendant. He testified that the defendant was \u201ca good friend of mine.\u201d The defendant had introduced Pacheco to the victim as another potential source of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">After initially denying any knowledge of the events on the day of the shooting, Pacheco admitted that he had purchased ten packages of heroin from the victim, in front of the pharmacy, just before the shooting. He stated further that he had seen the defendant standing on the corner near the pharmacy shortly after he made the purchase, wearing a white sleeveless shirt. The defendant seemed to be waiting for a dark-skinned Hispanic man who was talking on a cellular telephone as he was coming out of the pharmacy. Pacheco identified the defendant from prison photographs obtained by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">3. <em>Arrest and interview of the defendant. </em>Based on Pacheco\u2019s statement, police decided to interview the defendant as a potential witness. They learned that he had two outstanding default warrants, for a probation violation and a drug offense, and sought to arrest him on those warrants. While police were driving near an apartment building where they believed the defendant was living part time, they saw him on the sidewalk in front of the building. He appeared to be trying to enter the passenger side of a small, white Honda Civic automobile. As they approached, the defendant turned and ran through the building and into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>back yard. He was seized following a foot chase. As he was being taken into custody, the defendant asked, \u201cWhat am I arrested for?\u201d The arresting officer replied, \u201c[D]rug warrants,\u201d and the defendant responded, \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">At the police station, the defendant agreed to speak with police about the shooting. Throughout the interview, which lasted several hours, the defendant denied any knowledge of the crime or the pharmacy. He admitted that he was a heroin addict and stated that he was withdrawing from heroin at the time of the interview. He also admitted that he had been in prison on drug charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">4. <em>Arrest of Marquez. </em>Police investigated a cellular telephone number being used by Claudio that showed two calls to the victim shortly before his death. They went to the apartment where Claudio, Michelle Johnson (Claudio\u2019s girl friend), the defendant, and his wife were living. Johnson, who was there with Marquez, allowed them to enter and agreed to speak with them at the police station. An older white Honda Civic automobile, matching witness descriptions of the getaway vehicle, was parked outside the apartment building. Marquez admitted that the automobile was his; he gave police permission to search the vehicle and also agreed to go to the police station to speak with police. During his first interview, Marquez told police that he had loaned the vehicle to \u201cLou\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> between 5 and 6 p.m. on the previous evening, Marquez\u2019s cellular telephone had been left charging in the vehicle, and he had not seen the cellular telephone since that time. Marquez and the defendant\u2019s wife left the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Subsequently, police learned that calls had been placed from Claudio\u2019s cellular telephone to Gonzalez\u2019s home telephone number in the minutes after the shooting. They interviewed Gonzalez, who recounted the codefendants\u2019 visit to her home on the evening of the shooting. Police then reinterviewed Marquez. After initially repeating his earlier denials, Marquez gave police a detailed description of the planned robbery and subsequent events.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">5. <em>Prior proceedings. </em>The defendant filed a motion in limine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>seeking to suppress statements he made to police while he was being detained on the default warrants. This motion was denied. Claudio\u2019s motion to sever was denied by a different Superior Court judge. On April 14, 2008, during empanelment proceedings, both the defendant and Claudio requested that the trial judge reconsider the motion to sever; this motion was denied after a hearing on April 15. Trial began the following day. The jury found the defendant guilty of murder on a theory of felony-murder and not guilty on a theory of deliberate premeditation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Admission of the defendant\u2019s statements. </em>As stated, after the defendant was identified by Pacheco as having been at the intersection near the pharmacy shortly before the murder, the police learned that he had several default warrants, and officers arrested him on those warrants. On arriving at the police station after his arrest, the defendant was given Miranda warnings and agreed to speak with police. After being detained in a holding cell for several hours, the defendant was brought to an interview room where, following a second set of Miranda warnings, he again agreed to speak with police and signed a Miranda waiver form. See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966) <em>(Miranda). </em>The interview was conducted by Detective Corey Erickson, the lead investigator for the Lowell police department, and State police Trooper Kevin Baker, neither of whom had participated in the defendant\u2019s arrest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At the outset of the interview, Erickson informed the defendant that he was not a suspect,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but that the detective believed the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>been at the pharmacy at the time of the shooting and might have seen something that could assist with the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">After responding to questions for approximately forty-five minutes, generally focused on the white automobile owned by Marquez that police had towed from the street in front of Johnson\u2019s apartment and whether \u201cLou\u201d borrowed or drove it, the defendant stated, \u201cYou ask Lou that. I\u2019m not going on with this conversation. I want a lawyer, because you keep \u2014 ask Lou that.\u201d The officers continued the interrogation for approximately three minutes,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> then left the room in response to a knock on the door by one of the individuals observing the interview.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">When Erickson returned to the interview room, he said to the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\u201cIt\u2019s 9:43 p.m. . . . [EJarlier in the conversation you had said that you wanted a lawyer when the trooper was asking you about the car, and I\u2019m not sure if I recall correctly. It was that you said if you keep talking about the car, it\u2019s the car that was bothering you and you were getting confused with the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The defendant replied, \u201cNo, because I\u2019m willing to talk to you guys, but you keep pushing this on me. I keep telling you I don\u2019t know. . . .\u201d Erickson responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">\u201cRight. That\u2019s okay. But, I mean, what I want to do is I want to clarify right now. Okay. You can stop the tape. You do not have to talk to us, okay. I don\u2019t know if it was a situation where you just got confused and you were upset with that line of questioning. But you have to understand, okay, we are going to ask questions here that you might not like, okay, because we think one thing, and you\u2019re saying another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The defendant then agreed to answer questions on other topics without an attorney; he was given Miranda warnings for a third time and signed another waiver form. There was no further questioning about the car until near the end of the two-hour and fifteen-minute interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u201cIn reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress evidence, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error and leave to the judge the responsibility of determining the weight and credibility to be given oral testimony presented at the motion hearing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Contos, </em>435 Mass. 19, 32 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eckert, </em>431 Mass. 591, 592-593 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">A suspect subject to custodial interrogation must \u201cbe warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d <em>Miranda, supra </em>at 479. In order for a statement made during custodial interrogation to be admitted against a defendant at trial, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived these rights before making the statement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>420 Mass. 666, 669-671 (1995), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The defendant argued in his motion to suppress that his waiver was not knowing and voluntary because he was undergoing heroin withdrawal at the time the statements were made. The motion judge, who was not the trial judge, did not credit this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>statement. The defendant contended also that he had invoked his right to remain silent and his right to counsel when he stated, \u201cI\u2019m not going on with this conversation,\u201d and \u201cI want a lawyer because you keep . . . .\u2019\u2019On appeal, the defendant maintains that, although he invoked his rights to counsel and to remain silent approximately forty-five minutes after the interview had begun, the interview continued for another ninety minutes, and the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The fact of incarceration alone does not always constitute \u201ccustody\u201d for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Shatzer, </em>130 S. Ct. 1213, 1224 (2010), citing <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>496 U.S. 292, 299 (1990). Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, 429 </em>Mass. 426, 432-436 (1999), the Commonwealth argued during the hearing on the motion to suppress that the defendant had not been in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>when he made the statements. The motion judge determined that the defendant had indeed requested an attorney, but that, because the defendant had not been in custody, Miranda warnings were not needed, and the statement was admissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra </em>at 434 (test is not whether inmate is free to leave facility, but rather whether inmate \u201cis subject to some restraint in addition to those normally imposed on him by virtue of his status as an inmate\u201d). The judge\u2019s decision did not address the question whether the defendant had invoked his right to silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Before us, the Commonwealth does not press its argument that the defendant was not in custody, conceding properly that he was subject to custodial interrogation for purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>and that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra </em>at 432-436, is inapplicable, because the defendant was arrested specifically so that police could talk to him. Rather, the Commonwealth contends that the defendant stated only that he did not want to answer questions about the use of the white automobile, but did not unequivocally invoke his right to an attorney. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Girouard, </em>436 Mass. 657, 666 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 450 (1995) (\u201cif a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the cessation of questioning\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">During a custodial interrogation, \u201c[i]f the accused indicates that he wishes to remain silent, \u2018the interrogation must cease.\u2019 If he requests counsel, \u2018the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 481 (1981), quoting <em>Miranda, supra </em>at 474. However, before making the statements, \u201cI\u2019m not going on with this conversation,\u201d and \u201cI want a lawyer because you keep . . . ,\u201d the defendant had twice agreed to speak with police and signed Miranda waiver forms. \u201c[A]fter a knowing and voluntary waiver of the Miranda rights, law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests an attorney.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 461 (1994). Moreover, a suspect\u2019s unwillingness to answer questions on a particular topic does not unambiguously indicate that the suspect is unwilling to continue speaking with police or obligate them to inquire whether the suspect would \u201clike to reassert his right to silence.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robidoux, </em>450 Mass. 144, 161 n.7 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">We do not agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cI\u2019m not going on with this conversation,\u201d was other than a clear invocation of his right to remain silent, or that the words, \u201cI want a lawyer because,\u201d were \u201cequivocal.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Contos, supra </em>at 28 (request unequivocal where defendant said, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to stop, and I think I\u2019m going to get a lawyer. If this is the way that this is going, you\u2019re either accusing me or charging me\u201d). Unlike the circumstances in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Girouard, supra </em>at 662-663, where the defendant stated, \u201cIf I am under arrest, I want an attorney,\u201d the defendant\u2019s request for an attorney was not musing out loud or wondering if he should speak to one, and was not conditioned on police intentions with regard to his arrest. As the Commonwealth conceded at oral argument, the defendant\u2019s statement of the reason why he wanted an attorney does not render the request ambiguous. Indeed, the assistant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>district attorney viewing the interrogation believed that the defendant had requested an attorney and asked the officers to pause the interrogation for that reason. In addition, the motion judge concluded, based on her review of the audiotape, that the defendant had requested counsel. That the defendant ultimately ended the interview by again requesting an attorney does not render his earlier invocation of his right to counsel ambiguous.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Nonetheless, while his request for an attorney was unambiguous on its face, the defendant then continued speaking, without any intervening comment or question by police. Immediately after the defendant made the statement requesting an attorney, he said, \u201c[A]sk Lou that. Don\u2019t ask me if he borrows. Don\u2019t ask me. How do you know he borrows it? I don\u2019t know that.\u201d We agree with the Commonwealth that, in the unusual circumstances presented here \u2022\u2014 where, following the defendant\u2019s initial Miranda waiver, his invocation of the right to counsel was unambiguous, but he then appeared immediately and without police interruption to qualify the request, and to indicate that he only wanted an attorney if the officers continued questioning about the car \u2014 a reasonable interrogating officer could have been uncertain whether the defendant had invoked his Miranda rights, as the officers\u2019 interactions with the observing officers demonstrates.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The fact of reasonable police uncertainty concerning the nature and scope of the defendant\u2019s invocation, however, does not end the matter. In such circumstances, an interrogating officer must cease the interrogation, but is entitled to ask a question to clarify the defendant\u2019s intent. The question \u2014 for example, in a form such as, \u201cI just want to be sure \u2014 do you want an attorney?\u201d \u2014 should be brief, worded only to elicit an affirmative or negative response concerning whether the suspect wants an attorney, and should not be designed to keep the suspect talking. After such an inquiry to clarify whether a suspect has indeed requested an attorney, nothing further should be asked unless the suspect responds to the question in the negative. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>suspect need not give any reason for requesting an attorney, and police may not inquire, as they did here, why a suspect is requesting one. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sarourt Nom, </em>426 Mass. 152, 158 (1997) (\u201cin ordinary circumstances there would be no proper basis for an interrogator\u2019s asking a suspect his reason for requesting an attorney\u201d). This is so even when, as here, the defendant first volunteered such an explanation. Moreover, in seeking clarification, police may not \u201cignore[] the long-standing principle that \u2018postrequest responses to further interrogation may not be used to cast retrospective doubt on the clarity of the initial request itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>461 Mass. 143, 152 (2011), quoting <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 100 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In the present case, the questions posed by Erickson when he initially reentered the room were not clarifying. To the contrary, they appeared designed to elicit further statements by the defendant if the officers agreed not to ask about the white automobile, and that is what happened. Because the officers\u2019 questioning exceeded the narrow scope that was permitted, and intruded into the defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to counsel, we are constrained to conclude that the defendant\u2019s statements following his statement that he wanted a lawyer should have been suppressed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoyt, supra, </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In determining whether the erroneous admission of the defendant\u2019s statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we consider \u201cthe importance of the evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case; the relationship between the evidence and the premise of the defense; who introduced the issue at trial; the frequency of the reference; whether the erroneously admitted evidence was merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence; the availability or effect of curative instructions; and the weight or quantum of evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagraca, </em>447 Mass. 546, 553 (2006), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 696-697 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The defendant never admitted to any involvement in the crime, to being present near the pharmacy, or to any knowledge of the events surrounding the shooting. Indeed, the Commonwealth maintains that the defendant\u2019s statement denying his involvement could be viewed as exculpatory. Nonetheless, we conclude that admission of the audiotape, which the jury heard virtually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>in its entirety,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> was not harmless. Admission of the statement allowed the prosecution to challenge the nontestifying defendant\u2019s credibility by showcasing Erickson\u2019s and Baker\u2019s repeated statements that they did not believe the defendant, and impinged on the jury\u2019s fact finding through numerous repetitions of the officers\u2019 belief that the defendant was guilty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>398 Mass. 561, 567 (1986), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>394 Mass. 702, 706 (1985) (fundamental principle that witness cannot be asked to assess credibility of his testimony or that of other witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Admission of the statement also allowed the prosecutor to introduce, contrary to the judge\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion in limine, multiple references to prior bad acts of the defendant and additional evidence of his previous convictions. Unlike the codefendant\u2019s statement, the defendant\u2019s statement was not redacted to exclude mention of his time in prison, his refusal to \u201csnitch,\u201d or his drug use; admission of these portions of the statement served to highlight improper evidence of the defendant\u2019s bad character, while giving the inaccurate impression that the codefendant had no similar previous history. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montez, </em>450 Mass. 736, 744 (2008) (evidence of prior bad acts not admissible to show bad character or propensity to commit crime); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, supra </em>at 563, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>132 Mass. 16, 20-21 (1882) (evidence of prior bad acts served to \u201cdivert[] the attention of the jury from the [offense] immediately before it; and, by showing the defendant to have been a knave on other occasions, create[] a prejudice which may cause injustice to be done him\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">During the course of the interrogation, police stated at least thirty-nine times that the defendant was \u201clying,\u201d and more than fifty times that they, and an unspecified number of other witnesses, \u201cknew\u201d that the defendant had been at the pharmacy at the time of the shooting, or, toward the end of the interrogation, \u201cknew\u201d that the defendant had been the shooter. Erickson, who was not the arresting officer and was not present at the scene of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the crime, stated more than fifteen times his personal knowledge of the defendant\u2019s presence at the scene of the shooting and his personal belief in the defendant\u2019s guilt. Although no bystander witness identified the defendant as the shooter or as fleeing from the scene, Erickson\u2019s questions implied also that numerous individuals saw the defendant shoot the victim.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Womack, </em>457 Mass. 268, 272 (2010), and cases cited (\u201cExtrajudicial accusatory statements made in the presence of a defendant, which he has unequivocally denied, are hearsay and inadmissible as evidence of guilt in the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In her decision on the defendant\u2019s motion in limine to suppress the statement (joined by the codefendant), the judge stated that \u201ccourtroom opinions on credibility of witnesses are excluded.\u201d She ruled also that evidence of the defendant\u2019s alleged involvement in \u201ca prison gang that doesn\u2019t trust police and will not \u2018snitch\u2019 \u201d was excluded because its probative value was \u201cgreatly outweighed by . . . prejudice,\u201d and that the only evidence of the defendant\u2019s \u201cincarceration or arrests\u201d that would be admitted was through Pacheco\u2019s testimony of having been incarcerated with the defendant at MCI-Concord, admitted for identification purposes. Moreover, the judge ruled that the codefendant\u2019s admissions that he had been incarcerated and that he would serve more time rather than \u201crat\u201d were not admissible because they were \u201cnot probative of any material issue in the case.\u201d On these grounds alone, many portions of the defendant\u2019s statement should not have been admitted. We conclude that admission of the statement was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">2. Bruton <em>issues. </em>The trial judge concluded properly that there was sufficient evidence of joint venture and that, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>out-of-court statements of the joint venturers made during the course of the \u201ccooperative effort and in furtherance of its goal\u201d could be introduced against the other joint venturers. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>445 Mass. 195, 211 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 543 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Following a pretrial hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude statements made by the codefendant, Claudio, to his sister, Gonzalez, shortly after the shooting, introduced through Gonzalez, the judge determined that the statements, with one exception, were admissible as having been made during the concealment phase of the joint venture. The judge ruled that Claudio\u2019s statement, \u201cSmokey was the shooter,\u201d would be excluded because, \u201c[ujnlike the statement that \u2018one of [the men] shot someone,\u2019 these words cannot be argued as advancing the purpose of the joint venture. They are self-serving and exculpatory to Claudio, are not protective of the threesome, point unequivocally to [the defendant, whose nickname is Smokey], and will run afoul of the <em>Bruton </em>rule.\u201d The defendant alleges error in the judge\u2019s decision that the remaining statements were admissible. Because the defendant did not object when the statements were introduced at trial, we review for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Gonzalez testified that, while the defendant and Marquez waited in her back yard because she would not permit them to enter her house, Claudio came into her house, used her telephone, and requested a change of clothes and a towel. Gonzalez testified that Claudio said he \u201ctold him not to do it\u201d but \u201che shot that kid even though.\u201d On cross-examination by both defense counsel, there were numerous repetitions, in some form, of Claudio\u2019s statement that he \u201ctold him not to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u201c[0]ut-of-court statements by joint criminal participants are admissible against the others if the statements are made both during the pendency of the cooperative effort and in furtherance of its goal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>454 Mass. 527, 534 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>434 Mass. 670, 675 (2001). The statements are considered reliable and are not deemed to be hearsay, because the statements of each joint venturer are \u201cequivalent to a statement by the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>370 Mass. 703, 708 (1976). This exception does not apply after the criminal enterprise has ended, but does apply during the period when \u201cthe joint venturers are acting to conceal the crime that formed the basis of the enterprise.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 211, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>415 Mass. 502, 519 (1993). The inquiry to determine if a statement is made during the pendency of the joint venture \u201cfocuses not on whether the crime has been completed, but on whether a joint venture was continuing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra </em>at 537, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braley, </em>449 Mass. 316, 322 (2007). \u201cThe mutual \u2018agency,\u2019 conceived to underlie a joint criminal venture, that justifies exposing one coventurer to the risk of being incriminated by the utterances of another . . . loses all reality when the venture collapses, and the justification disappears with it. . . . The community of activities and interests which exists among the coventurers during the enterprise tends in some degree to assure that their statements about one another will be minimally reliable .... When the enterprise fails, there is a dispersion of interests, and motives of self-preservation, not to speak of malice or spite, may take over.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We conclude that, like Claudio\u2019s statement that \u201cSmokey\u201d was the shooter, Claudio\u2019s statements that he \u201ctold him not to do it\u201d but that \u201che shot that kid\u201d similarly were not made in furtherance of a common interest, but rather to exculpate Claudio and distance himself from the acts of the other joint venturers. Unlike the statements in the car, when all three coventurers were together fleeing the scene and discussing the failed plan to rob but not shoot the victim, cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braley, supra </em>at 320-321, the statement was not made to advance a common purpose, pointed to the defendant as the shooter while exculpating Claudio, and should not have been admitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra </em>at 537 (coventurer\u2019s statement to one of his associates \u201cwas not an effort to conceal the crime; indeed, it was just the opposite. It revealed the crime to someone who was not a member of the joint venture\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 706, 710-711 (where victim was cut with knife during armed robbery, statement by coventurer cornered by victim and friends while fleeing scene, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>did it,\u201d should have been excluded because not made in furtherance of common goal, but rather to exculpate coventurer). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 545 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Introduction of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s extrajudicial statement that is \u201cpowerfully incriminating\u201d as to another codefendant violates a defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 135-136 (1968). Such \u201cpowerfully incriminating\u201d statements include not only direct mention of a named codefendant, but also substitutions such as use of the word \u201cdeleted\u201d or some other symbol in place of the codefendant\u2019s name, where the jury will realize that the statement obviously refers to and implicates a specific codefendant. See <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>523 U.S. 185, 194-197 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacigalupo, </em>455 Mass. 485, 492-495 (2009) (jury would have inferred that reference to what \u201cfriend\u201d of codefendant did was reference to defendant). Testimony that the defendant, rather than Claudio, shot the victim, despite Claudio\u2019s urging that the defendant not shoot anyone, was introduced through Marquez\u2019s description of Claudio\u2019s statements made as the three were in the white Honda fleeing the scene. Considered in light of Marquez\u2019s testimony, even though Claudio\u2019s reference to \u201cSmokey\u201d was excluded, it would have been obvious to the jury that the \u201che\u201d Claudio was describing to Gonzalez was the defendant. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>462 Mass. 427, 843-844 (2012) (statement by one of six coventurers that \u201cother members\u201d were involved in decision to kill victim did not point directly to defendant). Thus, the statement was \u201cpowerfully incriminating\u201d and, in these circumstances, created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Gonzalez\u2019s testimony that Claudio said the defendant was the shooter was critical to the prosecution\u2019s case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The importance of Gonzalez\u2019s testimony was emphasized by the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>reference to Claudio\u2019s reported statements both in opening and closing arguments. In addition, the statements were emphasized, by Claudio\u2019s counsel in his closing argument. Counsel relied on Gonzalez\u2019s statements that Claudio \u201ctold him not to\u201d shoot anyone to maintain that Claudio attempted repeatedly to disengage from the joint venture, that Claudio was merely a \u201clookout,\u201d and that there was only one guilty party.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">We conclude that the erroneous admission of the defendant\u2019s statement and of Claudio\u2019s statements to Gonzalez require that the defendant be granted a new trial. Nonetheless, we consider other issues to the extent that they might arise at any new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">3. <em>Issues on retrial, </em>a. <em>Codefendant\u2019s statement to police. </em>Claudio was arrested four days after the victim was killed. On the day after his arrest, Claudio made a statement to police, but declined to have the statement recorded. The trial judge ruled that Claudio\u2019s statement was made in the course of the concealment phase of the conspiracy and therefore was admissible substantively against both Claudio and the defendant. At trial, one of the interrogating officers testified to the content of Claudio\u2019s statement. The jury were instructed that, if they found a joint venture had existed, the coventurers\u2019 statements were admissible for all purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">When Claudio made his statement, both Marquez and the defendant had been arrested for their involvement in the killing. Claudio\u2019s statement that \u201c[e]ven if he had only been involved in a robbery,\u201d he knew he was going to jail for a \u201clong time,\u201d did not further the common interests of the joint venturers, but, rather, tended to point to others as responsible for the shooting.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Based on the contents of the statement alone, it would appear that, by the time Claudio spoke to police, the joint venture had ended. Moreover, we have said that, once a joint venturer has been apprehended, the criminal enterprise has ended. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, supra </em>at 543, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>397 Mass. 65, 71 (1986). Therefore, the judge erred in concluding that Claudio\u2019s statement was admissible against the defendant because it was made during the pendency of the joint enterprise. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326, 340 &amp; n.11 (1983), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 708-712 (\u201cConfessions or admissions of conspirators or joint venturers, made after the termination of the conspiracy or joint venture, are not admissible ... as vicarious statements of the members of the conspiracy or joint venture\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">b. <em>Substantive admission of grand jury testimony. </em>The defendant maintains, accurately, that grand jury testimony by Gonzalez that the defendant had a gun tucked in his waistband when he, Claudio, and Marquez arrived at her house was admitted substantively after Gonzalez testified that she could not remember seeing the defendant with a gun, and still could not remember seeing the defendant with a gun after the prosecutor attempted to refresh her recollection with her grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Grand jury testimony is admissible as substantive evidence at trial in limited circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>454 Mass. 527, 533 (2009). When a trial witness offers testimony that is directly inconsistent with that witness\u2019s testimony before the grand jury, the inconsistent grand jury testimony may be introduced substantively if certain foundational requirements, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 73-74 (1984), are met. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Duc Le, </em>444 Mass. 431, 435-442 (2005). Absence of memory when testifying at trial, where the witness had a prior recorded memory, is not, however, evidence of an inconsistent statement. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>417 Mass. 187, 197 (1994). Here, Gonzalez\u2019s statement, which was admitted substantively and without limitation, might have been admissible as a prior inconsistent statement had the judge found that Gonzalez\u2019s lack of memory was feigned. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sineiro, </em>432 Mass. 735, 742 (2000). The judge made no such finding. Thus, after the efforts at refreshing her memory were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>unsuccessful, Gonzalez\u2019s statement about the gun should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">c. <em>Prior bad acts. </em>i. <em>Pacheco\u2019s testimony on prior convictions. </em>The Commonwealth moved in limine to introduce evidence that Pacheco knew the defendant when they were both incarcerated at MCI-Concord.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> After a hearing at which the prosecutor rejected the defendant\u2019s offer to stipulate that the two were in prison together, the judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion. Pacheco testified that he knew the defendant \u201cup in Concord\u201d in 2001, and that they were there for a brief time together. The Commonwealth then sought to introduce the defendant\u2019s prison records to show that the defendant was indeed incarcerated at Concord during the relevant period. Defense counsel offered a more detailed stipulation than he had previously, that the defendant and Pacheco were in prison together, in the same prison but not the same unit, for approximately one month. The prosecutor rejected the offer and the judge allowed the evidence, over the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Pacheco\u2019s identification of the defendant was not contested. Pacheco testified that he had purchased heroin from the defendant \u201cthree or four times\u201d in the months prior to the shooting and that the defendant had introduced him to the victim when the defendant did not have any heroin to sell. He also described the defendant as \u201ca good friend.\u201d The evidence of drug purchases was four years closer in time to the events of the July, 2005, shooting than the period of incarceration in 2001. Thus, Pacheco\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s prior convictions was cumulative of other evidence and had little probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Pacheco\u2019s testimony that he knew the defendant in prison was emphasized by the prosecutor in both her opening and closing arguments; the thrust of her arguments included not only the defendant\u2019s incarceration, but that the defendant was a drug user and drug dealer. Additionally, the prosecutor\u2019s opening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>statement described police efforts, testified to by police officers, to produce a photographic array for Pacheco based on prison records. None of this testimony should have been admitted. On retrial, a stipulation such as offered by the defendant should suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">ii. <em>Altercation with Johnson\u2019s former boy friend. </em>The jury heard testimony that, on the day before the shooting, Claudio and the defendant went to visit Johnson\u2019s former boy friend, because the boy friend had \u201cdisrespected\u201d Claudio, and, when an argument between the boy friend and Claudio became heated, the defendant punched the boy friend in the stomach. On the day of the shooting, Claudio, the defendant, and Marquez returned to the boy friend\u2019s house, at Claudio\u2019s request, to \u201cmake peace.\u201d None of this testimony was relevant to the events of the shooting, a motive for the shooting, or the credibility of a witness. It served merely to paint the defendant as a violent person of bad character, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>418 Mass. 788, 793 (1994), and should not be admitted on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">d. <em>Third-party culprit evidence. </em>The trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion in limine to allow a third-party culprit argument with respect to Thomas Clermont. The judge concluded that there was no \u201cdirect\u201d evidence against Clermont, and the circumstantial evidence was \u201cattenuated.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. 782, 800-801 (2009) (\u201cfeeble third-party culprit evidence poses a risk of unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">A defendant \u201chas a constitutional right to present evidence that another may have committed the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>444 Mass. 563, 570 (2005), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>392 Mass. 558, 562 (1984). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckman, </em>461 Mass. 24, 30-32 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 2781 (2012). Where \u201cthe defense offers its own theory of the case (beyond merely putting the government to its proof), its evidence must have a rational tendency to prove the issue . . . raise[d], and the evidence cannot be too remote or speculative.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keohane, supra </em>at 571, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 22 (1996). If, \u201cin the judge\u2019s discretion, \u2018the evidence is otherwise relevant, will not tend to prejudice or confuse the jury, and there are other \u201csubstantial connecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>links\u201d to the crime,\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>441 Mass. 291, 305 (2004), \u201c[a] defendant may introduce evidence that tends to show that another person committed the crime or had the motive, intent, and opportunity to commit it,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>461 Mass. 438, 445 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Here, two witnesses identified Clermont, said by Marquez to be a \u201cfriend\u201d of Claudio\u2019s, as being at Gonzalez\u2019s house shortly after the shooting, and as leaving with the towel-wrapped gun that Clermont described as \u201cmy biscuit.\u201d A number of witnesses testified that four people, not three, were seen running near the location where the victim fell, at the same time that Marquez was seen by another witness in a car parked in her driveway, and some witnesses testified that Hispanic individuals fled the scene in two different automobiles. Clermont owned a 1990 white Honda Civic, similar to the one witnesses saw fleeing the scene; Claudio and Clermont left Gonzalez\u2019s house in that vehicle after the defendant left with Marquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Clermont was questioned by police shortly after the shooting; he invoked his right to counsel and his right to remain silent, and did not make any statement. During the same period, police also went to Clermont\u2019s apartment, in an attempt to locate the gun; they left without searching the apartment. Police later stated that they did not search for the gun because, in such a small apartment, and given the young children also living there, Clermont would not have hidden a gun in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The evidence of Clermont\u2019s involvement was not speculative, attenuated, or remote. There was sufficient evidence for the defendant to have offered a third-party culprit defense that Cler-mont was the third party. \u201cIn general... the standards [applicable to closing arguments] are the same for prosecutor and defense counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murchison, </em>418 Mass. 58, 69 (1994). \u201cCounsel may argue from the evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Earltop, </em>372 Mass. 199, 205 (1977) (Hennessey, C.J., concurring), and \u201c[c]ounsel has the right to argue inferences from the evidence favorable to his case . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palmariello, </em>392 Mass. 126, 132 (1984), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nordstrom, </em>364 Mass. 310, 315 (1973). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that the Commonwealth \u201ctake steps to assure that the defendant has a fair opportunity to present his defense.\u201d <em>Ake </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 76 (1985). On retrial, the defendant should be permitted to make this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgments are reversed and the verdicts set aside. The case is remanded to the Superior Court where the defendant is to receive a new trial in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Although he was indicted under the name Jose Benitez, we refer to the codefendant by the name used at trial, Jose Luis Claudio.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Jesus Antonio Marquez testified under a plea agreement that specified that a sentence had not been determined; however, the agreement provided that Marquez would be charged only with being an accessory before the fact to armed robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Marquez was a friend of Claudio. Claudio introduced Marquez to the defendant a few weeks before the shooting; they had seen each other two or three times prior to the day of the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Marquez testified that Gonzalez neither saw nor was offered a necklace.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The defendant was forty-one years old in 2005 and had prominent tattoos the length of both arms. He was described by Detective Corey Erickson and Marquez as \u201cbald\u201d or \u201cbalding.\u201d On the day of the shooting, witnesses testified that the defendant was wearing a white tank top that left his arms exposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Both Francis Kelly, Sr., and Francis Kelly, Jr., estimated the men to be in their late teens or early twenties; none appeared to be carrying anything. They were not able to identify the individuals, but stated that they did not remember seeing a forty to forty-two year old male with tattoos covering both arms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The victim\u2019s girl friend testified that she and her daughter, who had planned to go to the beach with the victim, waited in the vehicle in the parking lot behind the Red Cross building across the street from the pharmacy. The victim, after receiving several telephone calls on his cellular telephone, said that he would get a soda for her daughter and would be right back. She spent approximately thirty minutes trying unsuccessfully to reach the victim on his cellular telephone or at his apartment, at which point police came by and asked her what she was doing waiting in the car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The defendant was known to Pacheco and others, and referred to at trial, as \u201cSmokey.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Claudio was known to many of the witnesses, and to the defendant, as \u201cLou\u201d or \u201cBrooklyn.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Claudio was found guilty on a theory of felony-murder as a coventurer; the defendant was found guilty as a principal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The jury heard almost the entire audiotape of the interview. A few portions of the interview, including the defendant\u2019s statement that a sample of his deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) had been taken in prison, his statements about an earlier, unrelated crime, and his discussion of the numerous prisons in which he had been incarcerated, were redacted, as were some comments by a detective shortly before the defendant ended the interview by requesting an attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Police custody logs, the defendant\u2019s booking sheet, and statements by the defendant during the interview to the effect that the police had taken his shoes show that the defendant\u2019s shoes were taken at 6:40 p.m., several hours before the interview. The custody log for the shoes states that the reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the defendant\u2019s arrest was \u201chomicide\u201d rather than \u201cdefault warrants.\u201d Erickson testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress that the defendant was booked at 6:37 p.m. and placed in custody at 6:45 p.m., but that he did not seize the shoes until 11:16 p.m., after the defendant had become a murder suspect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Among other statements, State police Trooper Kevin Baker said, \u201c[T]he person that owns this car says they lend it to Lou. And the part we don\u2019t understand is coincidentally it happens to be the same car that a police officer thought he saw you getting into. I\u2019m not saying anything about trying to have you talk for Lou or say what car Lou drives.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Unbeknownst to the defendant, an assistant district attorney (who was the trial prosecutor), two Lowell police officers, and a State police supervisor monitored the interview from a nearby room via cameras linked to an internal video connection. Baker testified at a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress that one of the observers initially knocked on the door because the observer believed that the defendant had requested an attorney, and had Baker ask Erickson to step out. Baker said he had not heard the defendant say anything about an attorney, a statement the observers challenged. Erickson testified at an earlier hearing on the same motion that he had heard the defendant mention an attorney, but had not understood the defendant to mean that he wanted to end all questioning. A Lowell police officer suggested to Erickson that he should clarify whether the defendant had requested an attorney; the State police supervisor instructed Baker to do so as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The defendant and the Commonwealth do not agree as to the grounds on which the defendant sought to suppress his statement. However, the transcript of the hearing on the motion to suppress, as well as the defendant\u2019s written motion, clearly indicate that he argued the statement was made after invocation of his right to silence and his request for counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Both interrogators testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress that the defendant\u2019s second invocation of his right to remain silent and his request for counsel had been far more emphatic. The defendant leaned forward, clapped his hands, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s end this conversation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Immediately prior to the playing of the audiotape, every juror was given a copy of a transcript of the statement, on which the juror was permitted to take notes, and which, in addition to a copy of the audiotape, was with the juror during deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In addition, the audiotape included at least fifteen references to the fact that the defendant had been incarcerated previously, twelve questions on why the defendant had run from police at the time of his arrest, thirteen references by police to \u201cchecking\u201d the defendant\u2019s alibi with his then-boss, Eddie, and later mention that Eddie\u2019s statement did not agree with the defendant\u2019s, multiple references to the defendant\u2019s assertion that he was not a \u201csnitch,\u201d and six suggestions by police that the defendant should neither \u201cput it on some old guy\u201d to provide him an alibi nor harm Eddie in any way for not having corroborated his statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Marquez\u2019s credibility was impeached at trial on a number of grounds. Marquez testified that he was a long-time friend of Claudio, that Claudio had introduced him to the defendant a few weeks before the shooting, that he had seen the defendant two or three times prior to the shooting, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>defendant was not his friend. He testified that during his first interview with police he had talked freely, that Claudio had threatened him after his first interview, and that he then gave police another statement that \u201cwas a lie.\u201d He stated further that he had lied \u201crepeatedly throughout the investigation.\u201d Marquez testified also that, while he had not been given any specific promises in terms of a sentence on the charge of accessory before the fact to armed robbery, he was hoping for mercy, and he believed his sentence would be reduced depending on how he testified. In these circumstances, Gonzalez\u2019s testimony, supporting Marquez\u2019s description of the events in the car, was critical to the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Likewise, Marquez\u2019s statements to police were also apparent efforts to exculpate himself and to cast blame on his coventurers rather than to pursue a common goal of concealing the joint venture from police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\">As with certain portions of the trial transcript, multiple days of which are missing some sections, the transcript of that hearing is not available, although there is a transcript of a sidebar discussion and the judge\u2019s ruling immediately before the testimony. Additionally, some of the transcript volumes are numbered and dated incorrectly. See Mass. R. A. P. 8 (b) (2), as amended, 437 Mass. 1602 (2002); Mass R. A. P. 8 (b) (4), as appearing in 397 Mass. 1229 (1986). See also <em>Charpentier </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>376 Mass. 80, 86-87 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
