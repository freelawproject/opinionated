L. c. 31, brought suit in the Superior Court on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated individuals against the defendants, the Commonwealth and the division of human resources (division). The plaintiffs alleged that the division engaged in racial discrimination through the creation, design, and administration of a multiple-choice examination for candidates seeking promotion to the position of police sergeant. According to the complaint, the plaintiffs\u2019 employing municipalities (which are not named defendants in this action) relied on a ranked list of candidates who had passed this examination in making promotional decisions. The plaintiffs maintained that, because of the examination\u2019s adverse, discriminatory impact on African-American and Hispanic candidates, they were ranked lower on the list than their nonminority counterparts, despite being equally qualified. As a result of not being included at the top of the list from which promotions were made, they were denied promotional opportunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">A Superior Court judge granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground that the Commonwealth had not waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>its sovereign immunity from suit and, in the alternative, that the plaintiffs had failed to state any claim on which relief could be granted. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review. We conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4A), should not have been dismissed because it alleges adequately that the defendants interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 enjoyment of rights protected by G. L. c. 151B, specifically the plaintiffs\u2019 right to be free of racial discrimination in opportunities for promotion, but that the other claims were dismissed properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Prior proceedings. </em>In 2007, the plaintiffs sued the division and the plaintiffs\u2019 municipal employers in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging disparate impact race discrimination in violation of a provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i) (2006) (Title VII).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>State, </em>588 F.3d 69, 72-73 (1st Cir. 2009) <em>(Lopez). </em>The State defendants moved to dismiss on the ground of immunity from suit, arguing that Title VII abrogates immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution only when a State functions as an employer, and that the division is not the plaintiffs\u2019 employer. <em>Id. </em>at 73. The District Court judge denied the motion, but the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, holding that the division is not the plaintiffs\u2019 employer within the meaning of Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 89. On remand, the case proceeded to trial against the municipal employers. In 2009, the instant action was commenced in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">b. <em>Factual allegations. </em>The plaintiffs filed the present suit in their individual capacities and as representatives of a class of similarly situated individuals, defined as \u201c[a]ll Black and Hispanic police officers within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts who are employed in cities and towns covered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>[S]tate civil service law, [G. L. c.] 31, and who have taken the 2005,2006, 2007 and 2008 police sergeant promotional examination administered by [the division] but have not been reached for promotion.\u201d We recite those facts alleged in the complaint<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that plausibly suggest entitlement to relief, taking them as true for purposes of our review of the judge\u2019s ruling on the motion to dismiss. See <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 635-636 (2008) <em>(Iannacchino).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The division, an agency of the Commonwealth, creates, designs, and administers promotional examinations to candidates for promotion to police sergeant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The examinations are comprised of one hundred multiple choice questions taken from \u201claw enforcement and related textbooks.\u201d To achieve a passing score, candidates must score at least seventy points; the maximum possible score is one hundred points. The examinations \u201chave, over the last [twenty] years, been shown to have a significant adverse impact upon . . . (Black and Hispanic) test takers while not having been shown to be valid predictors of job performance for a police sergeant.\u201d Despite the fact that the division is aware of the test\u2019s flaws, assert the plaintiffs, it has \u201ctaken no action to design a less discriminatory and more job-related examination procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Municipalities that opt to use the division\u2019s examination select candidates for promotion from those at the top of a list prepared by the division, on which passing candidates are ranked by the scores they achieved on the examination. Alternatively, municipalities may choose to conduct their own promotional examinations. However, in \u201cvirtually\u201d all municipalities at issue in this action, the division\u2019s examination was used without modification in some or all of the four relevant years.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">A majority of the plaintiffs passed the examination but did not receive scores high enough to be considered for promotion. According to the complaint, as a result of the use of the division\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>examination, African-American and Hispanic police officers have been ranked significantly lower than their nonminority counterparts, although they are otherwise equally qualified to be police sergeants, and \u201cfew, if any, minorities have been promoted to the position of sergeant ... in civil service municipalities throughout the Commonwealth.\u201d As a result, there is a significant disparity between the number of African-American and Hispanic police sergeants in the Commonwealth \u201cand their corresponding numbers in entry-level police officer ranks.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The complaint asserts that the division engaged in discriminatory promotion practices in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1), (4A), and (5) (hereinafter \u00a7 4 [1], \u00a7 4 [4A], and \u00a7 4 [5], respectively). The complaint also alleges that the division violated G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102, which provides in relevant part that all persons shall have the same rights to make and enforce contracts as those enjoyed by \u201cwhite male citizens.\u201d The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), on the basis of sovereign immunity; or, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). By a margin indorsement, the judge allowed the motion to dismiss for the reasons stated in the division\u2019s memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cWe review the allowance of a motion to dismiss de novo,\u201d <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Herb Chambers I-95, Inc., </em>458 Mass. 674, 676 (2011), accepting as true \u201cthe factual allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, as well as any favorable inferences reasonably drawn from them.\u201d <em>Ginther </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 319, 322 (1998). In determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>ing whether the factual allegations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under rule 12 (b) (6), we consider whether the allegations \u201c \u2018plausibly suggest[] [and are] (not merely consistent with)\u2019 an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Iannacchino, supra </em>at 636, quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007) <em>(Twombly). </em>Although detailed factual allegations are not required, a complaint must set forth \u201cmore than labels and conclusions .... Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. . . [based] on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact). . . .\u201d <em>Iannacchino, supra, </em>quoting <em>Twombly, supra </em>at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">b. <em>Sovereign immunity. </em>Before addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 theories of liability under G. L. c. 151B, we evaluate whether, as asserted by the plaintiffs, the Commonwealth has waived its sovereign immunity under G. L. c. 151B. As a general matter, \u201cthe Commonwealth or any of its instrumentalities \u2018cannot be impleaded in its own courts except with its consent, and, when that consent is granted, it can be impleaded only in the manner and to the extent expressed [by] statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>DeRoche </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>447 Mass. 1, 12 (2006) <em>(DeRoche), </em>quoting <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>329 Mass. 661, 664 (1953). See <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>442 Mass. 170, 175 (2004) (\u201cSovereign immunity bars a private action against a State in its own courts absent consent by the Legislature . . .\u201d). Waiver of sovereign immunity will not be lightly inferred; \u201c[c]onsent to suit must be expressed by the terms of a statute, or appear by necessary implication from them.\u201d <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 38, 42 (1981). In asserting that the Commonwealth has not consented to suit and therefore retains sovereign immunity, the division argues that express statutory waiver must authorize suit for each of the plaintiffs\u2019 particular claims under \u00a7 4 (1), (4A), and (5), in the manner and to the extent expressed in those subsections. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 9, permits \u201c[a]ny person claiming to be aggrieved by a practice made unlawful under this chapter\u201d to bring a civil action for damages or injunctive relief. Section 4 then delineates various practices \u2014 including alleged practices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that form the bases of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u2014 that, when undertaken by \u201cperson[s]\u201d or \u201cemployer[s],\u201d are \u201cunlawful.\u201d Section 1 (1) and (5) of G. L. c. 151B, respectively, define \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cemployer\u201d to include \u201cthe [C]ommonwealth and all political subdivisions,\u201d including boards, departments, and commissions. In previous cases considering waiver of sovereign immunity under G. L. c. 15IB, we concluded that \u201c[t]he Legislature has expressly waived sovereign immunity of the Commonwealth \u2018and all political subdivisions . . . thereof\u2019 by including them in the statutory definition of persons and employers subject to [G. L. c. 151B].\u201d <em>DeRoche, supra </em>at 12. See <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>424 Mass. 758, 763 (1997) (\u201cno doubt\u201d that G. L. c. 151B waives sovereign immunity). Here, the Commonwealth has consented to suit under \u00a7 4 (4A) and (5) by including the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities in the statutory definition of \u201cperson,\u201d and under \u00a7 4 (1) by including the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities in the statutory definition of \u201cemployer.\u201d See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9. The division\u2019s arguments concerning whether it can be subject to liability under these particular subsections ultimately go to whether the plaintiffs have stated a claim on which relief can be granted under rule 12 (b) (6), discussed <em>infra, </em>not whether the division, as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, retains sovereign immunity. Moreover, the division has not identified any provision of G. L. c. 151B explicitly indicating that the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities may be sued only in a particular manner or to a particular extent. Consequently, we conclude that the Commonwealth \u2014 and the division, as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth \u2014 has consented to suit under G. L. c. 151B.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">c. <em>Theories under G. L. c. 151B. </em>We now consider whether the plaintiffs have stated claims for which relief can be granted on their three theories of liability under \u00a7 4. We conclude that the plaintiffs may not proceed on their claims under \u00a7 4 (1) and (5), but that they may proceed with their claim under \u00a7 4 (4A).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">i. <em>Section 4 (1). </em>The plaintiffs allege that the division violated \u00a7 4 (1), which makes it unlawful for an employer \u201cbecause of the race [or] color ... of any individual ... to discriminate against such individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment, unless based upon a bona fide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>occupational qualification.\u201d Although they were not directly employed by the division,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the plaintiffs argue that the division, as an \u201cemployer,\u201d may nevertheless be subject to liability on an indirect employment theory, and rely on Federal case law interpreting Title VII to support their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The indirect employment theory was first indorsed in the context of Title VII<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in <em>Sibley Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>488 F.2d 1338 (D.C. Cir. 1973) <em>(Sibley).</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The plaintiff in <em>Sibley </em>alleged that the defendant hospital violated Title VII, which proscribes employers from engaging in certain forms of discrimination based on sex. <em>Id. </em>at 1339-1340.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Reasoning that Title VII was intended to prohibit employers \u201cfrom exerting any power [they] may have to foreclose, on invidious grounds, access by any individual to employment opportunities otherwise available to him,\u201d the court concluded that the statute did not contemplate providing protections only in those situations where there was a direct employment relationship between the plaintiff and defendant, i.e., that of \u201can employee of an employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341. The court held that, although the defendant was not the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cactual [or] potential direct employer[],\u201d the complaint alleged sufficient facts to state a claim against one \u201cwho controls] access to . . . employment and who den[ies] ... access by reference to invidious criteria.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Other circuit courts of the United States Court of Appeals have held similarly that a plaintiff bringing a claim under Title VII need not be in a direct employer-employee relationship with the defendant, so long as the defendant is an employer that \u201cinterferes with an individual\u2019s employment opportunities with another employer.\u201d <em>Association of Mexican-Am. Educators </em>v. <em>State, </em>231 F.3d 572, 580 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) <em>(AMAE), </em>quoting <em>Gomez </em>v. <em>Alexian Bros. Hosp. of San Jose, </em>698 F.2d 1019, 1021 (9th Cir. 1983).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Zaklama </em>v. <em>Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr., </em>842 F.2d 291, 294 (11th Cir. 1988). But see <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 89 (declining to adopt indirect employer interference theory for Title VII claims); <em>Gulino </em>v. <em>New York State Educ. Dep\u2019t, </em>460 F3d 361, 373-376 (2d Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 554 U.S. 917 (2008) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">No Massachusetts appellate decision has addressed squarely the issue whether a plaintiff can sustain a claim under \u00a7 4 (1) on an interference theory, see <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 549, 555-556 (2008), and we need not do so here. Even if, as a general matter, we were to conclude that \u00a7 4 (1) provides a basis for liability on an indirect employment theory, such a theory is not supported by the facts pleaded in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The plaintiffs have not alleged that the division exercised the type of direct control over access to employment opportunities that was present in other cases, see <em>Sibley, supra, </em>and <em>AMAE, supra, </em>where liability under Title VII has been predicated on an interference theory by an indirect employer. Thus, the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under \u00a7 4 (1) on which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>In <em>Sibley, supra, </em>the plaintiff, a male private-duty nurse, alleged that the defendant hospital, through its supervisory nurses, prevented the plaintiff from reporting to female patients who had requested a private nurse. Although the patients, who would be paying for the private nursing services, could reject the nurse, the hospital controlled the premises on which those services were to be provided as well as the plaintiff\u2019s access to patients who would initiate employment, thereby directly denying the plaintiff access to employment opportunities because of his sex. <em>Id. </em>at 1339-1342. In <em>AMAE, supra, </em>California was deemed to be one of the employers of municipal school teachers for purposes of Title VII. In reaching this determination, the court noted the \u201cpeculiar degree of control that the State of California exercise[d] over local school districts,\u201d which affected \u201cday-today operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581. \u201c[B]y requiring, formulating, and administering the [mandatory credentialing examination],\u201d California effectively \u201cdictate[d] whom the districts may and may not hire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582. Based on this pervasive and direct control over hiring,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the court concluded that California was hable under Title VE on an indirect employment theory. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The relationship between the division and the plaintiffs here is considerably more attenuated. Although the plaintiffs allege that the promotional examination, administered by the division and ultimately used by the municipalities, has \u201cbeen shown to have a significant adverse [discriminatory] impact upon minority (Black and Hispanic) test takers,\u201d they concede that the employing municipalities had the option, under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 11, to create and administer an alternative promotional examination, and to rest promotional decisions on factors other than the examination.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because the plaintiffs\u2019 factual allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tions as to the degree of control the division exercised over the plaintiffs\u2019 employment opportunities do not assert the level of control that would be necessary to establish an indirect employment relationship under <em>Sibley, supra, </em>and <em>AMAE, supra, </em>even if we were to adopt such a doctrine, the \u00a7 4 (1) claim was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">ii. <em>Section 4 (4A). </em>Unlike \u00a7 4 (1), which by its terms prohibits discrimination by employers, the division need not be an employer to be subject to an interference claim under \u00a7 4 (4A). Under \u00a7 4 (4A), it is unlawful for \u201cany person to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with another person in the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted or protected by [G. L. c. 151B], or to coerce, intimidate, threaten or interfere with such other person for having aided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of any such right granted or protected by [G. L. c. 151B].\u201d That provision \u201cindependently and explicitly provides for an interference claim, not merely against employers, but against all \u2018person[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 564 (Rubin, J., concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The complaint alleges that the division violated \u00a7 4 (4A) because it interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 enjoyment of their right, pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, to be free from discrimination in the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. The plaintiffs assert that the interference consisted of the division\u2019s repeated administration of a multiple-choice examination despite knowledge of its Statewide, adverse disparate impact on promotional opportunities for African-American and Hispanic candidates, and knowledge that the examination is not a valid predictor of job performance. The plaintiffs do not contend that the division created, designed, or administered the examination with the intent to interfere with their employment opportunities. Rather, they maintain that the division knowingly created, designed, and administered examinations on which African-American and Hispanic police officers performed disproportionately poorly compared to their nonminority counterparts in the pool of potential candidates Statewide, with the result that \u201cfew, if any minorities have been promoted\u201d from police officer ranks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>to sergeant, and the division thereby unlawfully interfered with the promotional opportunities of minority officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The division argues that, even accepting all of the allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as true, their claim under \u00a7 4 (4A) fails as a matter of law: first, because that subsection only prohibits retaliation against persons who exercise their rights under G. L. c. 151B, and the plaintiffs do not allege that the division has retaliated against them; and second, because the word \u201cinterfere\u201d in \u00a7 4 (4A) must be defined to require conduct undertaken with the \u201cintent to deprive someone of a protected right,\u201d which the plaintiffs do not allege.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">We turn first to the assertion that \u00a7 4 (4A) only prohibits acts of retaliation. To assess this argument, we consider the plain language of the statute, mindful that G. L. c. 151B \u201cshall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9. \u201c[W]e interpret the statutory language \u2018according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Hingham, </em>462 Mass. 779, 785 (2012), quoting <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>435 Mass. 718, 719-720 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The language of the statute does not support the division\u2019s claim that \u00a7 4 (4A) provides protection only against retaliation. Section 4 (4A) has two clauses, only one of which (the second) provides protection against retaliation. The second clause provides that it is an unlawful practice \u201c[f]or any person . . . to coerce, intimidate, threaten or interfere with [another] person for having aided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of any . . . right granted or protected by [c. 151B].\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4A). The first clause of \u00a7 4 (4A) prohibits \u201cinterfere[nce] with ... the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted or protected by this chapter.\u201d Among the rights protected by G. L. c. 151B is the right to be free from discrimination in the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, which includes the right to equal opportunities for promotion without discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1); <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>WalMart Stores, Inc. (No. 1), </em>455 Mass. 91, 108 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The cases on which the division relies, <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>424 Mass. 758, 765 (1997), and <em>King </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 460, 472-473 (2008), do not assist it. Those cases cite both G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4) and (4A), in their discussion of \u201cretaliation\u201d claims because the plaintiffs therein alleged that the defendants interfered with their right to complain of discrimination through conduct that was also retaliatory. In those factual circumstances, the \u00a7 4 (4A) claims were described properly as retaliation claims. But, notwithstanding the fact that retaliation may also constitute interference under the second clause of \u00a7 4 (4A), retaliation is not required to establish a claim of interference under the first clause of \u00a7 4 (4A). See <em>Pontremoli </em>v. <em>Spaulding Rehabilitation Hosp., </em>51 Mass.

We agree that the word \u201cinterfere\u201d in \u00a7 4 (4A) is appropriately considered with, and interpreted in light of, the words \u201ccoerce,\u201d \u201cintimidate,\u201d and \u201cthreaten\u201d that precede it, and that each implies some form of intentional conduct.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, it is not necessary that a plaintiff allege that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>interference not only was intentional, but was undertaken with a specific intent to discriminate. As was recognized in <em>School Comm. of Braintree </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, 377 </em>Mass. 424, 429 n.10 (1979) (Braintree), quoting <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971) <em>(Griggs), </em>G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, like Title VII, \u201cproscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">A violation of a plaintiff\u2019s right to be free from discrimination in opportunities for promotion may be established by proof of the disparate impact of an employment practice on promotional opportunities for employees of a particular race, color, or national origin. Discrimination that is based on proof of disparate impact \u201cinvolve[s] employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups, but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another.\u201d <em>Braintree, supra </em>at 429.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We recognized in the <em>Braintree </em>case that, unlike disparate treatment claims, \u201cdiscriminatory motive is not a required element of proof\u201d in disparate impact cases. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Griggs, supra </em>at 432 (\u201cgood intent or absence of discriminatory intent does not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as \u2018built-in headwinds\u2019 for minority groups and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>unrelated to measuring job capability\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This is because \u201cthe necessary premise of the disparate impact approach is that some employment practices, adopted without a deliberately discriminatory motive, may in operation be functionally equivalent to intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust, </em>487 U.S. 977, 987-988 (1988) (extending application of disparate impact analysis to subjective and discretionary hiring and promotion decisions, which previously had been applied only to hiring and promotion decisions based on standardized tests).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In the context of Title VII claims, the principle that facially neutral employment practices may violate Title VII, even in the absence of demonstrated discriminatory intent, has frequently been applied where standardized employment tests or other standardized criteria have had an adverse impact on hiring and promotion of minority candidates. See <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust, supra </em>at 988, and cases cited. \u201cNothing in the Act precludes the use of testing or measuring procedures; obviously they are useful. What Congress has forbidden is giving these devices and mechanisms controlling force unless they are demonstrably a reasonable measure of job performance.\u201d <em>Griggs, supra </em>at 436.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We decide today that, like a claim under \u00a7 4 (1), see note 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>supra, an interference claim under \u00a7 4 (4A) may be established by evidence of disparate impact. Because discrimination based on proof of disparate impact does not require proof of discriminatory intent, the element of intentionality is satisfied where it is shown that a defendant knowingly interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 right to be free from discrimination in the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment on the basis of a protected category such as race, color, or national origin. Thus, to make out a prima facie claim under \u00a7 4 (4A) based on a disparate impact theory of liability, a plaintiff must allege facts that, if proved, would establish that (1) a defendant utilized specific employment practices or selection criteria knowing that the practices or criteria were not reasonably related to job performance; and (2) a defendant knew that the practices or criteria had a significant disparate impact on a protected class or group.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Here, the facts alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom would, if true, establish that the division knowingly created and administered an examination on which African-American and Hispanic police officers perform more poorly than their nonminority counterparts; was aware that the examination is not reasonably related to job performance; and knew that utilization of the promotional examination caused a significant disparity in the ratio of African-American and Hispanic police officers promoted to the rank of sergeant as compared to the ratio of nonminority police officers so promoted. The plaintiffs assert that African-American and Hispanic candidates who were \u201cequally as qualified\u201d as nonmi-nority test takers regularly take the promotional examination; based on examination results, African-American and Hispanic candidates consistently score lower than nonminorities, and thus are placed too low on the ranked eligibility lists to be hired, despite their being as qualified as nonminorities (who are hired). Based on these allegations, the complaint sets forth a plausible claim that the division\u2019s examination has a disparate impact on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>African-American and Hispanic police officers. See <em>Ashcroft </em>v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009) (plausibility standard requires \u201ccontext-specific\u201d inquiry that asks court to \u201cdraw on its judicial experience and common sense\u201d); <em>Twombly, supra </em>at 554-556 (\u201cAsking for plausible grounds to infer an agreement does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">It was not necessary that the plaintiffs allege that use of the division\u2019s examination led to a disparate impact on promotions in any particular, identified, employing municipality in order to state an interference claim under \u00a7 4 (4A). An allegation that a Statewide examination has been shown to disproportionately disadvantage African-American and Hispanic candidates, and is not a predictor of job performance, implies that use of the examination will have a disparate impact on the employment opportunities of at least some African-American and Hispanic police officers within the Commonwealth, by limiting the number of qualified African-American and Hispanic candidates among whom individual municipalities using the examination might seek to make promotions. Cf. <em>AMAE, supra </em>at 578, 582 (although there was no allegation that any individual school district had statistically significant racial disparities in hiring, Title YII applied to plaintiff teachers\u2019 claim against State of California where minority candidates disproportionately received failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>scores on Statewide examination for public school teachers, and through use of examination, State \u201ccreated a limited list of candidates from which local public school districts may hire\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">iii. <em>Section 4 (5). </em>The plaintiffs contend also that the division violated \u00a7 4 (5), which makes it unlawful for \u201cany person, whether an employer or an employee or not, to aid [or] abet ... the doing of any of the acts forbidden under [G. L. c. 15 IB] or to attempt to do so.\u201d The division maintains that this claim was dismissed properly because the plaintiffs failed to allege that the division engaged in intentional discrimination, and because the plaintiffs did not name their municipal employers as defendants. We conclude that dismissal was appropriate, although not for the reasons advanced by the division.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In order to prevail on an aiding and abetting claim under \u00a7 4 (5), a plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant committed \u201ca wholly individual and distinct wrong . . . separate and distinct from the claim in main\u201d; (2) \u201cthat the aider or abetter shared an intent to discriminate not unlike that of the alleged principal offender\u201d; and (3) that \u201cthe aider or abetter knew of his or her supporting role in an enterprise designed to deprive [the plaintiff] of a right guaranteed him or her under G. L. c. 151B.\u201d <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Malden Hosp., </em>19 Mass. Discrimination L. Rep. 157, 158 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">An aiding and abetting claim under \u00a7 4 (5), however, is also \u201centirely derivative of the discrimination claim.\u201d <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107, 122 (2000). As a consequence, in addition to the \u201cindividual and distinct wrong\u201d that the defendant must be alleged to have committed, the complaint must allege the commission of an underlying act of discrimination under G. L. c. 151B (the \u201cmain claim\u201d) by the principal offender. See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc., </em>437 Mass. 443, 458 n.7 (2002).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In this case, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails to allege that any of the employing municipali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>ties, as the proposed principal offenders, committed a distinct, underlying act of employment discrimination from which the aiding and abetting claim may be said to derive.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In particular, the plaintiffs have not alleged that, because of the use of the division\u2019s examination, there is a significant disparity in the ratio of African-American and Hispanic police sergeants and their corresponding numbers in entry-level police officer ranks, compared to the ratio of nonminority police sergeants and the corresponding number of nonminority entry-level officers within the police division of any particular municipality.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Because the plaintiffs have not alleged that a specific practice or act was undertaken by one or more particular municipalities that could form the basis of a derivative aiding and abetting claim, they have not met the first of the three elements of a claim under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (5), and the claim properly was dismissed on this basis.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>d. <em>Claim under MERA. </em>We address briefly the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.

Where remedies under G.

The \u00a7 4 (4A) interference claim in that case was premised on alleged retaliation by the defendant that consisted of the filing of a lawsuit against the plaintiff.

Although in those cases both the alleged principal offender and the alleged aider and abettor were parties to the actions, the cases do not stand for the proposition that a claim of aiding and abetting under \u00a7 4 (5) necessarily fails where the principal offender is not named as a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">An interference claim under \u00a7 4 (4A) does not require such a specific allegation against a particular employer because a defendant (who is not the plaintiff\u2019s direct employer) may independently commit an act of discrimination by \u201cinterfering\u201d with the plaintiff\u2019s employment opportunities with that employer, based on statistical data supporting the disparate impact of the defendant\u2019s conduct on all employers within that category of employers. By contrast, an aiding and abetting claim under \u00a7 4 (5) requires the defendant to act in concert with one or more specific employers to \u201caid\u201d or \u201cabet\u201d a primary and independent act of discrimination by those employers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Allegations that the division \u201cassisted with, and knowingly contributed to, the discriminatory conduct of the various municipalities\u201d and \u201cknowingly allowed municipalities to administer the . . . exam despite its discriminatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>impact on hiring\u201d are also insufficient to state an aiding and abetting claim under \u00a7 4 (5). These conclusory assertions of discriminatory conduct by \u201cvarious municipalities\u201d fail to allege a particular practice or act by any identified municipality from which an aiding and abetting claim could derive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b735-7\">Cordy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqL\">(dissenting in part). I agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the Commonwealth\u2019s human resources division (division) is not the employer of the plaintiff police officers in this case, and the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action against it or its personnel administrator under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1), (4), or (5), or G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102. The employers of the police officers are the municipalities that hire and promote them. Those municipalities may elect to use the written examinations prepared by the division to assist in the promotional process, or they may conduct their own alternative promotional examinations, including supplementing the division\u2019s examinations with performance assessments. Although the plaintiffs may have a cause of action under these and other statutory provisions against their employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ers (which they are pursuing in Federal court), they do not have one against the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">I disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion that an interference claim under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4A) (\u00a7 4 [4A]), can be established against a third-party nonemployer without some showing of discriminatory intent. Such a conclusion is contrary to the statute\u2019s purpose and intent as determined through the application of accepted principles of statutory construction. Consequently, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">In the context of employment, it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual because of race. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1). There are two accepted manners by which such employment discrimination can be demonstrated in litigation: either by way of disparate treatment (which requires a showing of discriminatory intent) or by way of disparate impact (which does not require a showing of discriminatory intent). The availability of each is dependent on the statutory language creating the cause of action. Compare <em>Currier </em>v. <em>National Bd. of Med. Examiners, </em>462 Mass. 1, 16 (2012) (\u201cdiscrimination claims set forth under the cognate Federal provisions to the equal rights act require intentional discrimination and do not permit a plaintiff to proceed under a \u2018disparate impact\u2019 analysis\u201d), with <em>School Comm. of Braintree </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>377 Mass. 424, 429 n.10 (1979) (noting \u00a7 4 is susceptible to both disparate impact and disparate treatment claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">In addition to barring employment discrimination by employers, \u00a7 4 (4A) also makes it unlawful \u201c[f]or any person to coerce, intimidate, threaten or interfere with another person in the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted or protected\u201d by G. L. c. 151B. The question we must answer in this case is whether a claim under \u00a7 4 (4A) can be maintained without an allegation or evidence that the \u201cperson\u201d at issue, here the Commonwealth through its division, promulgated the promotional examinations taken by the plaintiffs with the intent and purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>of discriminating against them on account of their race. The answer to the question is dependent on the statutory language creating the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">There is no dispute that the words \u201ccoerce,\u201d \u201cintimidate,\u201d and \u201cthreaten\u201d that precede the word \u201cinterfere\u201d in \u00a7 4 (4A) are each imbued with an element of purposefulness or intent. See <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>417 Mass. 467, 474, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 868 (1994) (construing language of Massachusetts Civil Rights Act [G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H]). Specifically, coercion is \u201cthe active domination of another\u2019s will\u201d; intimidation involves \u201cputting in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct\u201d; and threatening \u201cinvolves the intentional exertion of pressure to make another fearful or apprehensive of injury or harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Their presence in \u00a7 4 (4A) suggests that a cause of action brought thereunder requires such a showing. Consequently, the plaintiffs understandably seek to exploit the only ambiguity in the provision: the word \u201cinterfere.\u201d However, their argument for a broad reading that would shoehorn their claim into a provision which, for all other purposes, requires a showing of discriminatory purpose or intent is unpersuasive in light of our well-established canons of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">It is fundamental that \u201cstatutory language should be given effect consistent with its plain meaning and in light of the aim of the Legislature unless to do so would achieve an illogical result.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001). Where, as here, the plain meaning of \u201cinterfere\u201d is open to competing interpretations,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we have relied on the doctrine of ejusdem gen-eris in discerning legislative intent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zubiel, </em>456 Mass. 27, 31 (2010); <em>Banushi </em>v. <em>Dorfman, </em>438 Mass. 242, 244 (2002); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Danvers, </em>176 Mass. 413, 414 (1900). \u201cThis principle . . . \u2018allow[s] the specific words to identify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>class and [restricts] the meaning of general words to things within the class.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zubiel, supra, </em>quoting 2A N.J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.17, at 379 (7th ed. 2007). Application of ejusdem generis is particularly \u201cappropriate when a series of several terms is listed that concludes with the disputed language.\u201d <em>Banushi </em>v. <em>Dorfman, supra. </em>In such a statutory enumeration, \u201cthe general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting 2A N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.17, at 273-274 (6th ed. rev. 2000)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In light of this applicable principle of statutory construction, I would conclude that an interference claim under \u00a7 4 (4A) requires a showing of the same type of purposeful or discriminatory intent as is plainly required by acts that would constitute coercion, threats, or intimidation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The guiding principle for analyzing the present case was articulated in <em>Sahli </em>v. <em>Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc., </em>437 Mass. 696, 700 (2002), where an employer brought a declaratory judgment action against a former employee who, after signing a release of liability, had brought an age discrimination claim against the employer. The employee responded by filing a second discrimination claim, alleging that the filing of the declaratory judgment action was retaliation under \u00a7 4 (4) and threats, intimidation, coercion, and interference under \u00a7 4 (4A). In rejecting both claims, which we clarified constituted \u201cseparate and independent causes of action,\u201d <em>id., </em>we held that an \u201cemployer does not violate the provisions of either \u00a7 4 (4) or \u00a7 4 (4A), absent evidence that the employer\u2019s <em>purpose </em>is other than to stop conduct it reasonably believes violates the terms of the contract\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Sahli </em>v. <em>Bull HN Info. Sys, Inc., supra </em>at 705, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>707. The only logical inference to be drawn from the <em>Sahli </em>decision is that a cause of action under \u00a7 4 (4A) requires some type of unlawful purpose on the part of a defendant. In this light, the court\u2019s newfound recognition of disparate impact liability under \u00a7 4 (4A) significantly undercuts our own precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Today\u2019s decision is also inconsistent with other interpretations of the statute. For instance, in <em>Woodason </em>v. <em>Norton Sch. Comm., </em>25 Mass. Discrimination L. Rep. 62 (2003),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (commission) rejected a discrimination claim under \u00a7 4 (4A) because the evidence failed to \u201cestablish the requisite <em>'intent to discriminate\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 64. There, and in sharp contrast to the commission\u2019s present position as amicus, the commission criticized a commissioner in a previous case involving \u00a7 4 (4A) for asserting that \u201c \u2018interfere\u2019 stands on its own\u201d and must be construed liberally in light of G. L. c. 152B, \u00a7 9. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Bendell </em>v. <em>Lemax Inc., </em>22 Mass. Discrimination L. Rep. 259, 262 (2000). To the contrary, the commission held, \u201cIn construing the word \u2018interfere\u2019 to give no import to the strong language surrounding it would be misguided,\u201d and therefore to be held liable, a person must have, \u201cat the very least, \u2018interfered\u2019 with another\u2019s rights in a manner that was in deliberate disregard of those rights.\u201d <em>Woodason </em>v. <em>Norton Sch. Comm., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Similarly, in <em>Canfield </em>v. <em>Con-Way Freight, Inc., </em>578 F. Supp. 2d 235, 242 (D. Mass. 2008), the court, applying Massachusetts law, adopted the <em>Woodason </em>interpretation of \u201cinterference.\u201d In denying a \u00a7 4 (4A) claim, the District Court judge noted that, because there was no evidence of \u201cdeliberate disregard,\u201d which \u201crequires an \u2018intent to discriminate,\u2019 \u201d the defendants could not be held liable for interference discrimination. <em>Canfield </em>v. <em>Con-Way Freight, Inc., supra </em>at 242, 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">While language creating a cause of action may often be broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>enough to pave the way either for a disparate impact or disparate treatment path to discrimination liability, that is not the case here. If the Legislature had sought to create a broader spectrum of liability, especially against persons who are not employers, it could have employed in \u00a7 4 (4A) the type of broad language it employed in \u00a7 4 (1). It did not, and absent a clear expression of such a purpose, I would not judicially graft a theory of liability onto the statute, particularly when doing so would be abrasive to our precedent and long-standing principles of statutory interpretation on which the Legislature should properly be able to rely. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zubiel, supra </em>at 31; <em>Sahli </em>v. <em>Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc., supra </em>at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\">As the court correctly notes, <em>ante </em>at 701-702, the Commonwealth is considered a \u201cperson\u201d under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4A), and has thus waived sovereign immunity for purposes of claims under that subsection. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4 (4A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The American Heritage Dictionary defines \u201cinterfere\u201d as \u201c[t]o be or create a hindrance or obstacle\u201d and \u201c[t]o intervene or intrude in the affairs of others; meddle.\u201d \u201cInterfere\u201d is listed as synonymous with \u201ctamper,\u201d which means \u201cto tinker with rashly or foolishly\u201d and \u201cto engage in improper or secret dealings, as an effort to influence.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 913, 1766 (4th ed. 2006). Although on one hand, the words \u201ctamper,\u201d \u201cmeddle,\u201d and \u201csecret dealings\u201d suggest an element of intent, on the other, the words \u201c[t]o be or create a hindrance or obstacle\u201d do not of necessity suggest the same. See <em>id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Other statutes using this series of words have also been interpreted to carry an element of intent.

Consequently, to state a cause of action under this section, a plaintiff must allege (and show) that \u201cthe defendants\u2019 conduct was at least partially motivated by intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>South Middlesex Opportunity Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>752 F.
