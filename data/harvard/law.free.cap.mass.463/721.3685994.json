They found a firearm, as well as significant quantities of heroin and cocaine. On this basis, the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>charged with various drug and firearm offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She moved to suppress the contraband as the fruit of an unlawful search of her apartment. As relevant here, the defendant claimed that the affidavit supporting the search warrant was insufficient to establish probable cause to believe that drugs would be found in her residence because the information in the affidavit did not prove an adequate \u201cnexus\u201d between her drug sales and her residence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Escalera, 462 Mass. 636, 642-643 (2012). A Superior Court judge agreed and allowed the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the affidavit supporting the search warrant set out sufficient facts to establish probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s apartment. We therefore reverse the order allowing the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">1. <em>Facts and prior proceedings. </em>On March 28, 2008, Officer Gary R. Mercurio of the Brockton police department sought a search warrant for \u201c957 Warren Ave. Apt. # 3 (3rd Floor) Brockton.\u201d In support of this warrant, Mercurio filed a twelve-page affidavit. Because the sole issue is the sufficiency of that affidavit, we recite in detail the facts it sets forth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>430 Mass. 710, 712 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">In March, 2008, the affiant, Mercurio, along with other Brock-ton officers, began a drug investigation based on a tip from a confidential informant. According to the informant \u2014 who had \u201cproven [his<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] reliability in the past by providing information and conducting controlled purchases of narcotics, which led to arrests and seizures of narcotics\u201d \u2014 he could purchase heroin from a Hispanic female known to him as \u201cNana\u201d by calling a designated telephone number. By the informant\u2019s description, Nana was tall with a thin build, and \u201calways\u201d delivered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>drugs in a \u201cnewer black car that appeared] to be very clean and shiny\u201d and would direct him to a location somewhere on the south side of Brockton. The informant also told police that \u201c \u2018Nana\u2019 sometimes states that she has to go home to retrieve the heroin prior to their meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In March, 2008, police observed three controlled purchases of heroin by the informant from the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During each purchase, the informant placed a telephone call to the number he associated with Nana, responded to the arranged meeting location under \u201cconstant surveillance\u201d by Brockton police officers, and purchased a quantity of heroin<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from the defendant, who arrived in the same black 2005 Honda Accord automobile on each occasion. After the first two controlled purchases, police followed the defendant from the site of the transaction; she drove directly to 957 Warren Avenue. Before the third controlled purchase, officers stationed outside that address observed the same black Honda Accord, operated by the defendant, leave the driveway and head in the direction of the prearranged meeting location. Communication from the officers at the location of the purchase confirmed that the same car arrived moments later. After that purchase, the officers who remained at the residence observed the Honda Accord returning to the apartment \u201c[wjithin two minutes of the transaction taking place,\u201d and moments after its arrival, they \u201cobserved a light turn on in the third floor apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Using their police computer records, the officers identified Nana as the defendant. The registered owner of the Honda Accord was listed as the defendant\u2019s mother, but the defendant\u2019s name was in the record of a motor vehicle stop initiated by the Brockton police department. The defendant\u2019s address in the records was listed as \u201c957 Warren Ave Apt. #3 Brockton, Massachusetts.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further investigation revealed a booking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>photograph and booking sheet for the defendant from April, 2004, which listed her alias as \u201cNana\u201d and included a description of her that was \u201cvery similar\u201d to that which the informant had provided. Based on this booking photograph, the informant later identified Nana as the defendant with \u201cone hundred percent\u201d certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In addition, between the second and third controlled purchases, the officers conducted three days of sporadic surveillance at 957 Warren Avenue. Officers noticed that the Honda Accord remained parked in the driveway during this time period and that, while it was in the driveway, the lights in the third-floor apartment were on. During their surveillance, the officers did not see either the defendant or any other individual enter or leave the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">On March 27, 2008, Mercurio investigated the computer access records of the electricity company providing service to the apartment. The electricity statement for 957 Warren Avenue, apartment no. 3, was in the defendant\u2019s name, and the accompanying telephone number was identical to the one that the informant had called during the three controlled purchases. The same day, two officers responded to 957 Warren Avenue for identification purposes, and spoke with a Hispanic female who identified herself as the defendant. She told the officers that she lived at that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The next day, March 28, 2008 (two days after the third controlled purchase), Mercurio filed an affidavit in support of a search warrant for 957 Warren Avenue, apartment no. 3, in Brockton.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The search warrant was issued, and the search conducted, on that same day. The search of the apartment revealed all the contraband (a firearm, heroin, and cocaine) that formed the basis of the charges against the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The defendant moved, under both the Fourth Amendment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, to suppress all items seized pursuant to execution of the warrant, arguing that \u201cthe affidavit failed to establish the requisite nexus between alleged drug distribution and the location of the search.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After a nonevidentiary hearing, a Superior Court judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion. A single justice of this court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal, and in an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tapia, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 1113 (2011). We allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>The facts contained in the affidavit, and the reasonable inferences therefrom, must \u201cdemonstrate probable cause to believe that evidence of the crime will be found in the place to be searched.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jean-Charles, </em>398 Mass. 752, 757 (1986), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 370 (1985). Because this is a question of law, \u201cwe review the motion judge\u2019s probable cause determination de novo.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em>454 Mass. 542, 555 (2009), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>482 F.3d 1047, 1051 (9th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1104 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">b. <em>Nexus. </em>Under both the Fourth Amendment and art. 14, a search warrant may issue only on a showing of probable cause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valerio, </em>449 Mass. 562, 566 (2007). This probable cause inquiry requires a \u201cnexus between the items to be seized and the place to be searched.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 213, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 860 (1983). When the place to be searched is a residence, \u201cthere must be specific information in the affidavit, and reasonable inferences a magistrate may draw, to provide \u2018a sufficient nexus between the defendant\u2019s drug-selling activity and [her] residence to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>probable cause to search the residence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>453 Mass. 438, 440-441 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. 296, 304 (2003). To satisfy this \u201cnexus\u201d requirement, and thus the probable cause standard, the affidavit \u201cmust provide a substantial basis for concluding that evidence connected to the crime will be found on the specified premises.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>430 Mass. 710, 712 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In our recent opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Escalera, </em>462 Mass. 636, 643 (2012), while acknowledging that \u201ceach case presents its own facts,\u201d we sought to provide guidance on the strictures of the \u201cnexus\u201d requirement. As pertinent here, in that case, after a full review of our prior holdings, we clarified that even \u201c[a] single observation of a suspect leaving [her] home for a drug deal may also support an inference that drugs will be found in the home where it is coupled with other information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, supra </em>at 442. In applying this rule, we concluded in that case that police observations of four controlled drug purchases, which confirmed details provided by a confidential informant, as well as additional police surveillance of a suspect\u2019s residence, established probable cause to search the residence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Escalera, supra </em>at 645-646.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Given both the police observations of three drug purchases and the informant\u2019s tip, considered in light of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Escalera, supra, </em>there was a sufficient nexus between the defendant\u2019s drug-selling activities and her residence to establish probable cause to search that residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">i. <em>Direct police observations. </em>The affidavit, on its face, presented sufficient evidence of a single instance where the police observed the defendant leave her home<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to go to the location of a controlled purchase. When the officers saw the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>defendant leave her apartment building minutes after receiving the informant\u2019s telephone call and proceed to a controlled purchase, she either was already in possession of drugs or needed to proceed to a location to obtain them. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Es-calera, supra </em>at 643-646. In any event, the evidence supports an inference that the drugs were at the defendant\u2019s home. <em>Id. </em>at 646 (\u201cThat evidence of the defendant\u2019s drug sales might also have been found [elsewhere] does not detract from the conclusion that there was probable cause to search the apartment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">That officers did not follow the defendant from the moment of her departure from her residence to her arrival at the location of the sale does not alter our conclusion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luthy, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 107 (2007). \u201cWe agree with the Appeals Court that the transaction witnessed by the informant was susceptible of other interpretations [than the presence of drugs in the defendant\u2019s apartment, but] ... the affidavit must only establish probable cause, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Byfield, </em>413 Mass. 426, 430-431 (1992).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The additional observations of the officers, as well as the informant\u2019s tip, provided \u201cother information\u201d for a conclusion that the probable cause standard had been met. In addition to the aforementioned occasion on which the officers observed the defendant leave from her home in the direction of a controlled purchase, the officers twice followed the defendant from the site of a controlled purchase directly to her home. The defendant was the only person in the vehicle on both trips, and made no stops en route on either occasion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Such evidence contributes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>to a finding of probable cause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luthy, supra </em>at 104-106. Police observed the vehicle used in the controlled purchases parked at the apartment during all three surveillances.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 106-107. Also, visual surveillance revealed that the defendant left her residence after a telephone conversation with the informant during which they arranged the third purchase, permitting the inference that the defendant had, on at least that one occasion, conducted the drug delivery business directly from her home. See <em>id. </em>at 107. That the utility bill for the defendant\u2019s apartment listed the same telephone number as that used by the informant in arranging the controlled purchases further tied the telephone used in the drug sales to the location searched.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 300 (2009).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">ii. <em>Informant\u2019s statement. </em>Finally, the statement provided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>the confidential informant, that the defendant \u201csometimes states that she has to go home to retrieve the heroin prior to their meeting,\u201d contributes to the probable cause determination. For statements of confidential informants to be used in the assessment of probable cause under art. 14, the Commonwealth must satisfy the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. See <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969); <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964). \u201c[T]he Commonwealth must demonstrate some of the underlying circumstances from which (a) the informant gleaned his information (the \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 test), and (b) the law enforcement officials could have concluded the informant was credible or reliable (the \u2018veracity\u2019 test).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 896 (1990).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Both prongs \u201cmust be separately considered and satisfied.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parapar, </em>404 Mass. 319, 321 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Here, the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge was apparent on the face of the affidavit: during previous transactions, he directly heard the defendant\u2019s statements concerning her need to go home to procure drugs for sale. Such direct receipt of information satisfies the basis of knowledge test. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>406 Mass. 575, 578 (1990), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parapar, supra </em>at 322 (\u201cFirst-hand receipt of information through personal observation satisfies the basis of knowledge prong of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>As to the informant\u2019s veracity, this prong was satisfied by the police corroboration of the details provided by the informant through observation of three controlled drug purchases. \u201c[A]n informant\u2019s detailed tip, plus independent police corroboration of those details, . . . can compensate for deficiencies in either or both prongs of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>standard, and thus satisfy the art. 14 probable cause requirement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, supra </em>at 896. The informant\u2019s description of the defendant\u2019s method of operation closely matched the practice corroborated by the police in three controlled purchases, thus establishing the informant\u2019s veracity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Escalera, </em>462 Mass. 636, 645 n.8 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>413 Mass. 823, 828-829 (1992). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mubdi, </em>456 Mass. 385, 397 (2010) (corroboration of only \u201cinnocent facts\u201d described by informant do not contribute to veracity).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Because the informant satisfied the two prongs of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>(basis of knowledge and veracity), the informant\u2019s statement that the defendant had described her need to go home to procure drugs for sale may properly be considered in assessing probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Accordingly, the information provided in the affidavit established a sufficient nexus to the defendant\u2019s apartment to support a finding of probable cause that contraband related to drug sales would be found in the location searched. The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the contraband is reversed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The drug charges include trafficking in twenty-eight to one hundred grams of cocaine, G.

We use the male pronoun for convenience. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shaughessy, </em>455 Mass. 346, 348 n.4 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The procedure followed for each of these controlled purchases was consistent with that described by our case law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Desper, </em>419 Mass. 163, 168 (1994), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The field tests conducted on the substance received by the informant during each purchase produced a positive result for heroin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b743-9\">A search of the defendant\u2019s name in board of probation records also showed an address of \u201c957 Warren Ave Brockton, Massachusetts,\u201d with no apartment number provided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\">Mercurio also sought, and was issued, a search warrant for the vehicle used by the defendant in driving to the drug sales. That warrant is not part of the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b744-10\">Specifically, the search resulted in the seizure of 58.5 grams of suspected heroin; twenty-nine grams of suspected \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine; three grams of suspected cocaine; a nine millimeter Luger handgun with an obliterated serial number; ammunition; $2,365 in cash; digital scales and plastic baggies; and paperwork connecting the defendant to that location, among other items.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The defendant also moved to suppress the firearm, ammunition, and money seized during the execution of the warrant because none of this evidence was requested by the police or supported by the affidavit. The defendant further argued that the police entry into her home was illegal because police did not knock and announce their presence. The motion judge resolved only the nexus issue and, because his review was confined to the information in the affidavit, held a nonevidentiary hearing; only the nexus issue was briefed and argued on appeal, both here and before the Appeals Court. We confine our review accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">The information in the affidavit was undoubtedly sufficient to establish that the defendant lived in the apartment searched. Police surveillance, utility records, police department records, probation department records, and the defendant\u2019s own statements indicated that the third-floor apartment, the location searched, was her residence. It is therefore immaterial that police never saw the defendant enter or leave the door of apartment no. 3; it was enough that they observed her leaving from and returning to the apartment building. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>418 Mass. 86, 90 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Alcantara, 53 Mass. App. Ct. 591, 593-594 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The details of the affidavit provide a reasonable basis to infer that the defendant traveled directly from her home to the third controlled purchase. During the telephone call initiating the purchase, the defendant told the informant that she would meet him in five minutes, but did not leave her home until five to seven minutes later. The return trip from the controlled purchase took only two minutes, indicating that the defendant could quickly arrive at the prearranged location and thus wait until just minutes before the arranged meeting time to leave. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vynorius, </em>369 Mass. 17, 19 n.4 (1975) (travel time between location searched and location of sale can support inference that drugs were stored at place searched).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The defendant relies heavily on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (2003) <em>(Smith), </em>where die Appeals Court held that the observation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>three controlled purchases (before one the defendant was observed leaving his house, and after another the defendant was seen returning home) did not establish probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s home. But <em>Smith </em>has since been confined to its facts \u2014\u25a0 according to the Appeals Court, <em>Smith </em>stands for the proposition that police observations of a defendant driving from home to a drug transaction on one occasion, without more, do not suffice to establish probable cause to search the home, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luthy, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 108-109 (2007), citing to our subsequent decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. 296, 304 (2003), a statement much like the rule in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Escalera, </em>462 Mass. 636 (2012). In any event, there is considerably greater evidence of a nexus between the residence and the drug sales in this case than in the <em>Smith </em>case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The evidence also provided probable cause to believe that the police would find records of the defendant\u2019s drug distribution business, which the search warrant permitted the officers to seek. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 665, 669 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luthy, supra </em>at 107. The existence of probable cause to search for such records does not \u201calone support probable cause to search the home for drugs.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Escalera, supra </em>at 644 n.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b748-8\">That police did not see suspicious activity during their three surveillances of the defendant\u2019s residence does not alter our conclusion as to probable cause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 210, 213 (2005) (\u201cThe fact that police never observed short-term visitors or other evidence of drug transactions at the defendant\u2019s residence ... is not fatal to probable cause, because the defendant\u2019s usual method of operation was to deliver drugs away from [her] apartment\u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b748-9\">The affidavit supporting the search warrant, to which we confine our review, did not specify whether the telephone used during the controlled purchases was a \u201clandline\u201d or a cellular telephone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b748-10\">We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that the information in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>the affidavit was stale. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>430 Mass. 838, 843 (2000). The entire investigation occurred over eight days, with the third controlled purchase taking place only two days prior to the issuance and execution of the warrant. Such information is sufficient to establish a timely nexus to the defendant\u2019s apartment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spano, </em>414 Mass. 178, 184-185 (1993) (information timely where continuous drug operation was observed by police, up to within forty-eight hours of making of affidavit).
