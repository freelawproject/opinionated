Schoeller\u2019s licenses to do business in the Commonwealth as a funeral director and embalmer. G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 61, 84. The disciplinary action arose after Schoeller made comments to a newspaper reporter about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>his experiences in the embalming profession and those comments were later published as part of an article about Schoeller. Schoeller did not reveal any confidential or private information about any deceased person or bereaved family members whom he had served. Rather, the board found that Schoeller had violated an ethical regulation prohibiting an embalmer from \u201ccomment[ing] on the condition of any dead human body entrusted to his or her care,\u201d 239 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.13(7) (1998),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that he had used unprofessional language in his descriptions of dead bodies. By doing so, the board concluded, Schoeller had \u201cengaged in gross misconduct and unprofessional conduct which undermines the integrity of the profession.\u201d Schoeller filed a petition in the county court, pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64, seeking review of the board\u2019s order. The single justice reserved and reported the case without decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Schoeller generally raises the same claims on appeal as he did before the board. He contends that 239 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.13(7) cannot be a valid basis for discipline because it is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and impermissibly abridges his freedom of speech in violation of both the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. He argues also that the board\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not supported by substantial evidence. Even if there were grounds for discipline, Schoeller contends, the permanent revocation of his license is grossly disproportionate to the alleged misconduct, in violation of his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">After considering Schoeller\u2019s constitutional claims, the board concluded that the regulation \u201cis reasonably related to the [bjoard\u2019s interest in protecting the public welfare, which includes preserving the integrity of the funeral services profession, by disciplining funeral service professionals who speak in an undignified and salacious manner about the condition of dead bodies.\u201d The board argues before us that the regulation, as con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>strued by the board, reaches only a narrow category of speech that the board has a substantial and legitimate interest in regulating.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We conclude that, even under the board\u2019s limited construction, a regulation prohibiting \u201cunprofessional\u201d or \u201cundignified and salacious\u201d comments is overbroad, and therefore unconstitutional, because it restricts a substantial amount of protected speech. As such, 239 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.13(7) is not a valid basis for the board\u2019s disciplinary action against Schoeller. We conclude also that the board\u2019s asserted interest in maintaining the integrity of the funeral services profession is insufficient to justify the type of restriction on speech at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>Schoeller has been licensed in Massachusetts as an embalmer since 1999, and as a funeral director since 2004. He was also licensed as an embalmer in Florida for several years before moving to the Commonwealth. Schoeller has no prior history of discipline with the board or in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The conduct at issue here occurred in late 2006, when a newspaper reporter sought to interview Schoeller about a retail clothing store Schoeller had opened in the Allston section of Boston. Schoeller agreed to the request and met with the reporter in his store on December 6, 2006. The initial interview was conducted in a formal question-and-answer format. After the interview, the reporter invited Schoeller to dinner to continue their conversation. Schoeller accepted the invitation and, along with his wife, joined the reporter at a local restaurant the following evening. The conversation at the restaurant was friendly and informal. Schoeller understood that the purpose of the meeting was \u201cto further the interview about [his] store.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Among the topics discussed that evening was Schoeller\u2019s work as an embalmer, and Schoeller made statements describing certain of his experiences. Approximately one week later, the newspaper published an article about Schoeller that included his comments about embalming.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The board based its disciplinary action on three passages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the article. In the first, Schoeller describes rebuilding the body of an infant who had been involved in a traumatic accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201c \u2018The medical examiner cut all the bones out of this infant . . .,\u2019 Schoeller recalls, \u2018and they did a calvar\u00edan, which means they cut the top of your head off and take out your brain. So I had a baby that looked like a bear skin rug. I had to rebuild it in nine hours. I used everything: duct tape, masking tape, tissue builder, wound filler. I worked for nine and a half hours. ... I put, like, coat hangers and caulk in there and put him into a little baby outfit. He even weighed enough too, because I packed his head and his chest. He looked awesome.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The second passage contains a comment by Schoeller about embalming obese persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">\u201cLooking over the menu . . . before his wife arrives, Schoeller says he can\u2019t order the chicken satay here because when he got it last time, the skewered meat had fat chunks on it. T can\u2019t eat fat like that,\u2019 he says. \u2018And I really hate embalming fat people, like people who weigh 300 pounds. Because when you cut open a fat person,\u2019 he says matter-of-factly, \u2018butter leaks out. Literally, yellow oil leaks out of the wound and floats on top of the water. If you put butter in the microwave and put it in the water, it turns into little balls \u2014 fat globules \u25a0\u2014 and that\u2019s what comes out of fat dead people. It\u2019s so nasty.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The third passage contains a comment by Schoeller about inhaling gases released by decomposing bodies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">\u201cOn the walk home to the couple\u2019s . . . apartment, Schoeller thinks of something else to tell me. \u2018Here\u2019s something my friends find amusing. Decomposing bodies give off methane. What your body does with methane, it puts it all in the same place, which is your bowels. So you actually fart out dead people rot and it smells like the guy you were working on today. I\u2019ll go home and I\u2019ll fart and [my wife] will be like, \u201cOh my God,\u201d and I\u2019ll be like, \u201cThat was Mr. Rosenberg.\u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>After seeing Schoeller\u2019s statements in the article, the chapel that employed Schoeller as an embalmer terminated his employment and filed a complaint with the board. The board commenced an investigation, then issued an order requiring Schoeller to \u201cshow cause why the [board] should not suspend, revoke or otherwise take action against [his] license.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board alleged that Schoeller\u2019s statements in the article were \u201ccomment[s] on the condition of dead human bodies entrusted to [his] care,\u201d in violation of 239 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.13(7) (\u00a7 3.13[7]),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and constituted \u201cgross immorality\u201d and unprofessional conduct that undermined the public confidence in the integrity of the funeral services profession.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Schoeller did not dispute that he had made the statements attributed to him, but denied that those statements violated any statute, regulation, or rule. He asserted that his statements were factually accurate and thus protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 77 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. He argued that his comments therefore could not be the basis of any disciplinary action. Schoeller also moved to dismiss the order on the grounds that the board\u2019s regulations were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, in violation of his rights to free speech and due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The board denied Schoeller\u2019s motion and held an evidentiary hearing on December 2, 2009. At the hearing, the board presented numerous exhibits and the testimony of two witnesses. John W. Bresnahan, the board\u2019s investigator, testified as an expert on the professional standards of the funeral services industry in Massachusetts. Bresnahan testified that Schoeller\u2019s comments did not conform to professional standards of conduct because Schoeller had commented on the condition of a dead human body entrusted to his care, in violation of \u00a7 3.13(7). When asked to expand on this opinion, Bresnahan asserted that the regulation \u201ccalls for appropriate care to the deceased,\u201d which includes not using any \u201cunprofessional language.\u201d Bresnahan said that Schoeller\u2019s comments amounted to \u201cgross misconduct\u201d because he had violated \u00a7 3.13(7) and had used unprofessional language in discussing the embalming of deceased persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">During cross-examination, Bresnahan acknowledged that he was not aware of any embalmer or funeral director who had been disciplined for commenting on the condition of a deceased person. He also testified that embalmers often discuss the condition of dead bodies in the course of their training and education and in trade journals and other professional publications. When asked to clarify whether \u00a7 3.13(7) prohibits an embalmer from ever commenting on the condition of a dead body, or whether it only prohibits doing so with unprofessional language, Bresna-han testified that, in his opinion, the regulation requires embalmers to use \u201cappropriate, professional language\u201d when commenting about a dead body.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The board found that Schoeller had violated \u00a7 3.13(7) and \u201cthe [o]ath of the [b]oard.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board found also that Schoel-ler\u2019s comments amounted to gross misconduct in violation of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61, and unprofessional conduct that undermined the integrity of the profession. The board determined that Schoel-ler\u2019s statements \u201creflect a cavalier and even callous attitude toward dead bodies,\u201d and voted unanimously to revoke Schoel-ler\u2019s licenses without the possibility of renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 64, \u201cprovides that a person whose [professional license] has been suspended or revoked may petition this court to \u2018enter a decree revising or reversing the decision of the board, in accordance with the standards for review provided\u2019 in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7).\u201d <em>Fisch </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>437 Mass. 128, 131 (2002). Accordingly, we will modify or set aside the board\u2019s decision only if Schoeller demonstrates that the decision was in violation of a constitutional provision; legally erroneous; unsupported by substantial evidence; arbitrary or capricious; or an abuse of discretion. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). See <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>443 Mass. 679, 685 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Schoeller\u2019s principal argument before us is that \u00a7 3.13(7) is facially unconstitutional because it is both vague and overbroad. He maintains that the regulation is impermissibly vague because the board\u2019s newly asserted \u201cprofessional language\u201d rule is not set forth or defined in the board\u2019s written regulations and it therefore invites discriminatory enforcement. He contends also that \u00a7 3.13(7) is overbroad because the regulation prohibits constitutionally protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Vagueness and overbreadth are related concepts, but implicate distinct constitutional rights. The vagueness doctrine is a function of due process, which requires that a law provide fair notice of what it prohibits or requires so that persons of common intelligence may conform their conduct to the law. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008). Over-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>breadth, on the other hand, relates to protections provided by the First Amendment; a law may be declared overbroad, and thus unconstitutional, if it prohibits a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ora, </em>451 Mass. 125, 128 (2008). Where a litigant challenges a law as both facially vague and overbroad, we consider the over-breadth claim first. See <em>Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 494 (1982). We will reach the vagueness claim only if we conclude that the regulation does not prohibit a substantial amount of protected speech. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">\u201cIt has long been recognized that the First Amendment needs breathing space and that statutes attempting to restrict or burden the exercise of First Amendment rights must be narrowly drawn and represent a considered legislative judgment that a particular mode of expression has to give way to other compelling needs of society.\u201d <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 611-612 (1973). To ensure this breathing space, the overbreadth doctrine permits facial challenges to statutes or regulations that, although susceptible of some valid applications, are alleged to prohibit or chill constitutionally protected expression.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Bulldog Investors Gen. Partnership </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>460 Mass. 647, 676 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 2377 (2012). Declaring a statute or regulation overbroad, however, is \u201cstrong medicine,\u201d to be employed \u201csparingly and only as a last resort.\u201d <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra </em>at 613. Application of the doctrine is therefore limited \u201cto instances where a law \u2018prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bulldog Investors Gen. Partnership </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 677, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The first step in examining whether a statute or regulation reaches too far is to identify the conduct or speech that it prohibits. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 293. The board does not appear to dispute that \u00a7 3.13(7), prohibiting embalmers from \u201ccommenting] on the condition of any dead human body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>entrusted to [their] care,\u201d would be overbroad and thus constitutionally deficient if read literally, without regard to the context in which the comment occurs. Bresnahan testified that discussing the condition of dead bodies is part of an embalmer\u2019s education and training; an instructor may need to use specific examples in the course of teaching, and it would be difficult for a student to learn a specialized trade without being able to discuss an essential component of the profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">If interpreted literally, the regulation would not only prohibit funeral directors and embalmers from discussing an essential component of their profession in the course of their personal lives, but would also prevent <em>any </em>comment about a deceased\u2019s condition to bereaved family members or to authorities to whom embalmers and funeral directors are required to report.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See, e.g., 239 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.08(1) (2012) (requiring embalmers and funeral directors to report to medical examiner \u201call deaths believed to have been caused by injury or trauma\u201d). The board has construed \u00a7 3.13(7) more narrowly; it submits that the regulation prohibits only the use of \u201cunprofessional language,\u201d which it defines as comments made \u201cin an undignified and salacious manner about the condition of dead bodies.\u201d As construed by the board, \u00a7 3.13(7) prohibits an embalmer or funeral director from making any undignified comments about dead human bodies that have ever been entrusted to his or her care, including when made in a private capacity and not as a professional and when the speech is uttered outside of the presence of the deceased or the bereaved.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">We must next determine whether \u00a7 3.13(7), even as limited by the board\u2019s narrower construction, nonetheless prohibits a \u201csubstantial amount\u201d of protected speech.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. Williams, <em>supra </em>at 297. \u201cSubstantial overbreadth demands a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>\u2018realistic danger that the [regulation] itself will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bulldog Investors Gen, Partnership </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 677, quoting <em>City Council of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. 789, 800-802 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We have never directly considered the extent to which the speech of professionals subject to regulation under G. L. c. 112 may be regulated consistent with the United States Constitution. We have recognized, in the context of discipline of physicians, that \u201cconduct that undermines public confidence in the integrity of the [medical] profession, is reasonably related to promotion of public health, welfare, and safety,\u201d and, therefore, the Board of Registration in Medicine has broad authority to regulate and sanction such conduct. <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med,. </em>387 Mass. 708, 713 (1982). Moreover, we have stated that, because licensed professionals are subject to regulation, they do not come before us as citizens \u201centitled to the full range of individual rights available to all citizens.\u201d <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>447 Mass. 678, 689 (2005). However, we have not previously addressed the extent to which those individual rights may be limited, see, e.g., <em>id. </em>at 690 (due process, privacy, and First Amendment claims deemed waived); <em>Sugarman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>422 Mass. 338, 347 (1996) (First Amendment claim), and have found no cases that have considered the precise question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Most analogous to the present circumstances are cases involving attorney discipline. As in the case of physicians, attorneys may be subject to restrictions on rights \u201cto which an ordinary citizen would not be,\u201d <em>Matter of Cobb, </em>445 Mass. 452, 467-468 (2005), quoting <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>State Bar of Nev., </em>501 U.S. 1030, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>1071 (1991), and some of those restrictions may relate to speech. See <em>In re Snyder, </em>472 U.S. 634, 644 (1985) (restricting attorney\u2019s freedom of speech in certain instances \u201creflects the burdens inherent in the attorney\u2019s dual obligations to clients and to the system of justice\u201d). We have said that such restrictions on attorney speech are appropriate because of the attorney\u2019s unique role as an \u201cintimate and trusted and essential part of the machinery of justice, an \u2018officer of the court\u2019 in the most compelling sense.\u201d <em>Matter of Cobb, supra </em>at 468, quoting <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>State Bar of Nev., supra </em>at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The extent to which attorney speech may be restricted is largely dependent on the context in which an attorney speaks. An attorney\u2019s comments may not enjoy the full range of First Amendment protections when he or she is \u201cactively participating in a trial,\u201d but the attorney nonetheless retains the \u201cconstitutional freedom of utterance and may exercise it\u201d fully when not acting as an \u201cofficer of the court.\u201d <em>Matter of Cobb, supra, </em>quoting <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>State Bar of Nev., supra. </em>Thus, speech that permissibly subjects an attorney to discipline falls generally into two categories: (1) speech made during the conduct of a court room proceeding, see <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>State Bar of Nev., supra, </em>and (2) speech outside of a court room that creates a \u201csubstantial likelihood of material prejudice\u201d to a pending adjudicatory proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In the context of these two categories, when an attorney is representing a client in a pending case, the attorney\u2019s speech is regulated under a less demanding standard than that ordinarily applied to First Amendment speech rights. See <em>Matter of Cobb, supra. </em>Where an attorney has spoken outside the context of an adjudicatory proceeding, however, the standard under which the attorney may be disciplined is more demanding than if the attorney were involved in direct representation, and requires a showing that the speech has created a \u201csubstantial likelihood of material prejudice\u201d in a pending adjudicatory proceeding. <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>State Bar of Nev., supra </em>at 1075. See <em>In re Sawyer, </em>360 U.S. 622, 636 (1959). Thus, whether an attorney\u2019s speech outside the court room is subject to discipline will depend on the content of the speech and the context in which it occurs; any limitation on an attorney\u2019s speech must be narrow and directed at comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>likely to influence the trial or judicial determination. <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>State Bar of Nev., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">While the analogy is imperfect, the regulation governing the speech of funeral services professionals, like regulations governing that of attorneys, seeks to restrict speech both when embalmers and funeral directors are acting directly in the performance of their professional capacities and when they are not providing funeral services and are not speaking in the presence of the deceased or bereaved. The board found that Schoeller\u2019s speech, which occurred while he was not rendering professional services, violated \u00a7 3.13(7) and \u201cconstituted misconduct that undermined the integrity of the profession.\u201d Whether the board may permissibly regulate speech in this context \u2014 where the speaker is not acting in his or her professional capacity \u2014 turns on whether the restriction is narrowly drawn and whether the board\u2019s interest is sufficient to require that the First Amendment interests at stake must \u201cgive way to other compelling needs of society.\u201d <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 611-612 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Here, the board has proposed that the compelling societal need to which speech rights must give way is the integrity of the funeral services profession. However, the board\u2019s power to regulate derives from the Legislature, and any regulation that seeks to protect the integrity of the profession must be grounded in or tethered to a legislative purpose that the board is charged with carrying out.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Looking to the statutory framework for regulating the funeral services profession, we discern three general interests that the Legislature sought to protect: (1) the health, welfare, and safety of the public, see, e.g., G. L. c. 112, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\u00a7 83 (requiring familiarity with precautions necessary to prevent spread of communicable diseases; conversance with laws for sanitary handling of dead human bodies; and proof that applicant will maintain establishment at fixed location, constructed and equipped so as to permit sanitary handling of dead human bodies); (2) honesty and fairness in business dealings with those seeking funeral services, see, e.g., G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 84 (a) and <em>(b) </em>(permitting suspension or revocation of license for misrepresentation or fraud in conduct of profession and for false or misleading advertising); and (3) the treatment of dead human bodies with dignity and the bereaved with respect, see G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 84 (g) (permitting suspension or revocation of license for use of \u201cprofane, indecent or obscene language in the presence of a dead human body, or within the immediate hearing of the family or relatives of a deceased, whose body has not yet been interred or otherwise disposed of\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Relevant here is the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in the treatment of the deceased with dignity. As noted, the Legislature has provided that embalmers and funeral directors may be required to abstain from using \u201cprofane, indecent or obscene language\u201d while acting in a professional capacity, see <em>id., </em>and we agree that violation of such a restriction on speech could undermine the integrity of the funeral services profession. We have recognized in other contexts that there is a \u201cspecial sensitivity\u201d required in the processing and handling of a deceased human body, <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Brigham &amp; Women\u2019s Hosp., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 297, 308 (2001), quoting <em>Jobin </em>v. <em>McQuillen, </em>158 Vt. 322, 328 (1992), and that funeral services \u201care always rendered and most often contracted for under emotional circumstances.\u201d <em>Blue Hills Cemetery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Embalming &amp; Funeral Directing, </em>379 Mass. 368, 374 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The board proposes that these interests require the broadening of limitations on the speech of embalmers and funeral directors to include comments made outside of funeral homes, and would extend the prohibition to comments made by embalmers and funeral directors in any context. The board suggests that, in order to maintain public confidence in the profession, as that interest has been defined by the Legislature, \u00a7 3.13(7) permissibly may be construed to proscribe any undignified comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>by embalmers and funeral directors about any dead bodies that have ever been entrusted to their care. As we have described, however, regulations that attempt to limit the speech of licensed professionals when acting outside of their professional capacity must be narrow, and applied with precision to the type of speech that the board has a legitimate interest in regulating. Cf. <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>State Bar of Nev., </em>501 U.S. 1030, 1075 (1995). Further, the board\u2019s asserted interest must be balanced against the First Amendment rights at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Under this standard, we conclude that the board\u2019s generalized interest in maintaining the integrity of the profession cannot outweigh the First Amendment rights of embalmers and funeral directors when acting outside of their professional capacity; and, even if the board\u2019s interest could outweigh those First Amendment rights, \u00a7 3.13(7) is not sufficiently narrow to achieve that end.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The record contains numerous examples of circumstances in which the board\u2019s regulation could reach constitutionally protected speech and potentially expose embalmers and funeral directors to discipline given the board\u2019s prohibition of \u201cunprofessional\u201d or \u201cundignified\u201d comments. Among these examples are articles in professional publications in which the authors, who are funeral service professionals, comment on the condition of deceased bodies in graphic terms that some might subjectively view as undignified.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Under the board\u2019s reading of \u00a7 3.13(7), such statements could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>potentially subject the authors to discipline if they were licensed in Massachusetts. Like these authors, Schoeller did not identify a particular deceased person or reveal confidential information about any decedent\u2019s family. His comments described in detail the process of embalming the dead, an area recognized by the profession as one about which the public knows little and should be more informed. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>Although Schoeller spoke colloquially, using both graphic and crude terms in his descriptions of the challenges he faced as an embalmer, his comments convey that he took apparent pride in his skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In summary, while there may be circumstances in which the board can appropriately seek to limit the speech rights of licensed funeral directors and embalmers, see note 12, <em>supra, </em>in proscribing all \u201cundignified\u201d comments, the board has \u201ctraveled in the constitutionally unacceptable direction,\u201d <em>Mendoza </em>v. <em>Licensing Bd. of Fall River, </em>444 Mass. 188, 201 (2005), of banning a substantial amount of protected speech. The board cannot apply \u00a7 3.13(7) to restrict such a wide range of speech, nor may it limit that speech by relying on a generalized notion of the integrity of the funeral services profession.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The case is remanded to the county court where an order shall enter allowing Schoeller\u2019s petition and vacating the decision of the Board of Registration of Funeral Directors and Embalmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ALX\">During the pendency of this appeal, the Board of Registration of Funeral Directors and Embalmers (board) amended its \u201cCode of Conduct and Professional Ethics,\u201d 239 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.13 (2012). The amended regulation altered and renumbered several of the clauses involved in this case, but the pertinent provisions remain intact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The reporter used an audio recording device to record the discussion at the restaurant. Schoeller testified that he thought that the device was a cellular telephone and was unaware until the end of the meal that he was being recorded. The board appears to have credited this testimony in its discussion of mitigating circumstances, but concluded that, nevertheless, \u201clicensees [shall] conduct themselves in a manner that reflects well on the profession.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Schoeller testified that his reference to \u201cMr. Rosenberg\u201d was \u201ca completely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>fictitious name that [he] had made up on the spot.\u201d As noted, there is no claim that Schoeller\u2019s statements revealed the identity of a deceased person or otherwise disclosed any confidential or private information. See note 6, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">An order to show cause consists of a statement of allegations promulgated by a licensing board. Consistent with the requirements of due process, it provides a licensee with notice of the allegations against him and an opportunity to be heard in his defense. See <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>396 Mass. 374, 376-377 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\">The version of 239 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.13(7) (1998) (\u00a7 3.13[7]) in effect at the time of the board\u2019s final order provided, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">\u201cA person who is registered with the Board, or who holds an ownership interest in or is employed by any funeral establishment licensed by the Board, shall not disclose confidential or private information about any member of any household or family which he or she serves, or comment on the condition of any dead human body entrusted to his or her care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">The amended version of the regulation, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>contains several additional clauses, such as a prohibition against \u201cengaging] in any other conduct adverse to the interests of that client based on information obtained in confidence.\u201d The amended regulation also provides that \u201c[notwithstanding 239 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 3.13(1) through (6), 239 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 3.13(7) shall not be interpreted to bar cooperation with a board investigation or from making other disclosures as required by law or for purposes of insurance and debt collection activities.\u201d 239 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.13(7) (2012). None of these changes is pertinent to our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b629-12\">Initially, the board also alleged that Schoeller had disclosed confidential information and breached the confidence of a client. The parties agreed at a preliminary conference, however, that Schoeller\u2019s statements had revealed no confidential information, and those allegations were dismissed. The board also amended its order to show cause to consider whether Schoeller had provided false information on an application to renew his license, but ultimately found no such violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Upon receiving his licenses, Schoeller took an oath required by the board of all new licensees. In pertinent part, he swore \u201cnot to . . . comment on the peculiarities or conditions of any dead human bodies entrusted to [his] care.\u201d Because this provision is substantively identical to \u00a7 3.13(7), we address Schoeller\u2019s argument in the context of the regulation. We note, however, that our reasoning applies with equal force to the oath.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Thus, overbreadth is an exception to traditional rules of standing that permit litigants to assert their own rights but not the rights of others. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ora, </em>451 Mass. 125, 128-129 (2008). The board does not contest Schoeller\u2019s standing to make an overbreadth claim, but does raise standing as a bar to his vagueness claim. Because we do not reach Schoeller\u2019s vagueness argument, we do not address the board\u2019s position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Such a reading also would be inconsistent with the Funeral Ethics Association\u2019s \u201cManual of Professional Practice,\u201d which is cited in the board\u2019s brief and included in the administrative record. That publication sets forth model guidelines of \u201cUndertaking Ethics\u201d and provides, in a section entitled \u201cResponsibility to the Press and Public,\u201d that \u201cFuneral Directors should be available to discuss with anyone all matters relative to the conduct of a funeral. Whenever possible, the funeral director should assume active leadership in seminars or discussion which will bring a deeper understanding to all concerned about death, the funeral and bereavement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Although we generally defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>regulations, see <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976), the board\u2019s position in this case is not an attempt to interpret the terms of \u00a7 3.13(7). Rather, it has endeavored to rewrite the regulation\u2019s scope without regard to the regulation\u2019s plain terms in an attempt to avoid constitutional infirmity. While we owe no deference to the board\u2019s view in these circumstances, see <em>id., </em>we nevertheless consider the board\u2019s limiting construction because it appears to reflect the policy that the board intends to apply in the future, and because the board relied on this limited view in finding that Schoeller\u2019s comments amounted to gross misconduct and conduct undermining the integrity of the profession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\">We do not mean to suggest that the Legislature must specifically identify integrity of the profession as a legislative goal before a board or agency may adopt a regulation designed to protect it. Licensing boards have broad authority in this area, and their view of the integrity of the profession need only be \u201creasonably related\u201d to the legislative purpose. <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>387 Mass. 708, 711 (1982). Thus, for example, we do not question the board\u2019s authority to prohibit an embalmer from disclosing confidential information. See 239 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.13(7) (2012). Cf. <em>Sugarman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>422 Mass. 338, 343 (1996) (medical board permitted to conclude that disclosure of confidential information undermined integrity of profession). The integrity of a licensed profession is not, however, a limitless concept that can be invoked without regard to the statutory scheme in which a licensing board operates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\">We do not foreclose the possibility that the board may regulate the speech of embalmers and funeral directors, even when acting outside of their professional capacity, in a constitutionally permissible manner. To do so, however, (he board would need to identify with precision a more specific and compelling interest than a vague, generalized notion of integrity in the funeral services profession, and promulgate a regulation narrowly tailored to achieve (hat end.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\">One such article describes in detail the \u201cskin slip\u201d that occurred as a consequence of bodies having been exposed to high heat in the fire that caused their deaths.
