The defendant poured the gasoline in such a manner that it landed on himself, Diana, and Nguyen Trinh, the children\u2019s caretaker, as well as on the floor; he then ignited it. The resulting fire engulfed the upper portion of Diana\u2019s body, causing permanent disfiguring injuries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">The defendant was indicted for a number of offenses relating to the fire, including armed assault with intent to murder, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18 <em>(b); </em>aggravated assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A (c) (i); assault and bat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>tery by means of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A (b); arson of a dwelling, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 1; and armed home invasion, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The defendant testified at trial that he had intended only to commit, suicide and not to cause injury to anyone else, nor to set fire to the apartment, and that the injuries to others were accidental. He made no claim that he had suffered from a mental or emotional condition that prevented him from forming the requisite intent to commit the offenses, or that he was not criminally responsible for his acts because of mental or emotional impairment. The defendant was convicted by a Superior Court jury of all of the charges before them, and he filed an appeal in the Appeals Court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The defendant argues that the judge erred in admitting evidence of prior bad acts, and in admitting privileged statements the defendant made to a psychiatrist. He claims also that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support his convictions and that his motion for a required finding of not guilty on all charges should have been allowed. For the reasons that follow, we set aside the defendant\u2019s two convictions of armed assault with intent to murder Diana and Trinh, and we remand those indictments for a new trial. We affirm his remaining convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\"><em>Trial. </em>Based on the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, the jury could have found the following facts. We reserve certain details for later discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The defendant and Lam were married in Vietnam in 1998. For approximately five years, the defendant lived primarily in Boston while Lam remained in Vietnam, during which period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the couple\u2019s son, Manh, was born. In 2003, Lam and Manh joined the defendant in the United States; Diana was born in November, 2005. From the time the family was united, the defendant verbally and physically abused Lam and Manh. His behavior twice led to police intervention, although criminal charges were not pursued, and in September, 2006, Lam filed for divorce. She moved with Manh and Diana into an apartment that was occupied by Trinh and her two adult sons. Trinh rented a room in her apartment to Lam and provided child care for the children while Lam was at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The defendant regularly visited his children at the apartment, under Trinh\u2019s supervision when Lam was not present. While there, he would speak primarily to Manh, although, during one visit, the defendant said to Trinh that Lam \u201cshouldn\u2019t force me to do things. I will turn violent.\u201d He also sometimes made small talk with Trinh\u2019s adult son, Thanh Quach, but they had no extended conversation until three weeks before the fire, when the defendant asked Quach to meet him at a restaurant. There, the defendant told Quach that he loved his wife, that she could not leave him, and that if she had a boy friend he would not forgive her.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The defendant sought repeatedly to reconcile with Lam, sometimes by pleading and sometimes by making threats. Shortly before the fire, the defendant threatened to kill Lam and the children if she did not return to live with him, after which Lam notified the police and obtained a temporary protective order. The defendant called Lam and urged her not to appear in court to extend the order, promising to change his behavior. Lam did not seek an extension of the order, which expired after ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. on January 8, 2007, while Lam was at work and Trinh was watching the children, the defendant telephoned the apartment and spoke briefly with Manh, and almost immediately afterward, the defendant knocked at the back door leading into the kitchen. Manh opened the door while Trinh stood at the sink, and the defendant entered, carrying a bag of food for the children. Diana was sleeping in the living room in a hammock. The defendant took Manh into Lam\u2019s bedroom and closed the door. They were in the room only a short time before the defendant emerged and left through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>back door, leaving it open as he departed. Trinh thought he was not returning and told Manh to shut the door. However, as Manh was closing the door, the defendant returned and pushed his way in, hiding something behind his back as he walked through the kitchen and into the living room where Trinh had begun tending to Diana.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Standing in the middle of the room, close to Trinh and Diana, the defendant raised the can to the height of his shoulder, tipped it, and poured gasoline onto the floor, splattering some on himself, Trinh, and Diana.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He then ignited the gasoline with a cigarette lighter, setting all three people ablaze.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Trinh picked up Diana and brought her into the hallway, but set her down when she realized she was herself on fire. She cried out to Quach, who had been resting in a bedroom off the hallway when the fire started, and ran outside to the front yard, where she removed her burning clothes. Emerging from his room, Quach saw Diana, who was burning from her stomach to the top of her head, sitting on the floor in the hallway, near a bathroom door. He also noticed the defendant standing in the kitchen doorway, looking down the hall and saying that he was so sad because \u201c[he] burned [his] kid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Quach immediately picked up Diana, brought her into the bathroom, and put her in the bathtub; he turned on the cold water and attempted to put her under the faucet, but she was too tall, so he filled a container with water from the tap in the sink, which he poured over her, extinguishing the flames. After carrying her out to the front porch, Quach ran back inside to search for others still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>in the building. The defendant also went out onto the front porch; he took Diana from Quach and was holding her when emergency personnel arrived. While standing on the porch holding Diana, he was heard saying aloud, \u201cThis is what you get for cheating on me,\u201d and \u201cI know I\u2019ll be punished for this for a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Paramedics who placed the defendant and Diana in an ambulance noticed an odor of gasoline coming from Diana\u2019s clothes, and subsequent chemical testing by the Boston fire department revealed significant amounts of gasoline residue on both Trinh\u2019s and Diana\u2019s clothing. En route to the hospital, the defendant snatched a pair of scissors and cut his intravenous tube; he then stated repeatedly, \u201cI did this.\u201d Asked by the paramedics what he had done, the defendant said that he had lit himself on fire and burned the baby. While receiving treatment for his injuries at a Boston hospital, the defendant made additional inculpatory statements, discussed in detail below, to a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\"><em>The defendant\u2019s case. </em>The defendant testified on his own behalf. He said that he was not angry at his wife for leaving him, only sad, and that he had decided to kill himself and \u201cwanted [his] wife to remember [him].\u201d The gasoline was in his car when he drove to the apartment, and he brought it into the living room of the apartment intending to commit suicide by using it to set himself on fire. Trinh was in the living room, holding Diana. The defendant told Trinh and the children to leave, and they did so. Trinh and Diana \u201chad already gone into the kitchen\u201d when he poured the gasoline on himself. He did not pour gasoline on them, nor around the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Asked on direct examination what he remembered happening immediately after he was burned, the defendant first said, \u201cI felt that I was holding my daughter because I was very upset about the accident, about what had happened outside of my intention.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He then said that he picked up his daughter after seeing that Trinh had put her down near the bathroom and after Quach had taken her into the bathroom to put out the fire. According to the defendant, when Quach left the bathroom, he put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Diana down in the hallway, and the defendant picked her up and brought her outside to wait for the ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The defendant denied ever having threatened his wife if she and the children did not return to him. He recalled his restaurant meal with Quach but denied telling Quach that Lam could not leave him and that if she had a boy friend he would not forgive her. He knew that Lam had not gone to court to seek an extension of the protective order, but he denied telling her not to go and that he would change his ways. He testified that he could not recall whether he had said, \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for cheating on me,\u201d while he was on the porch; nor did he know whether he had said, \u201cI\u2019ve done a terrible thing. I\u2019m going to be punished for this.\u201d Finally, the defendant testified that he had no recollection of cutting his intravenous tube in the ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\"><em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Prior bad act evidence. </em>The Commonwealth moved before trial to admit evidence that the defendant was verbally and physically abusive toward Lam and Manh while the family lived together and that, both before and after they separated, he used threats of violence to coerce Lam into acceding to various demands, including that she borrow money on his behalf to finance his reported use of drugs. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the judge found that, in light of \u201cthe seemingly inexplicable nature of the assault,\u201d the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 404(b) (2012). The defendant maintains that the prejudicial nature of Lam\u2019s testimony substantially outweighed its probative value, and that its admission at trial constituted an abuse of the judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u201c \u2018It is well settled that the prosecution may not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved ... for the purposes of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged . . . .\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986). \u2018Such evidence may be admissible, however, if relevant for some other probative purpose, including to show intent, motive, state of mind, or some other relevant issue at trial.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robidoux, </em>450 Mass. 144, 158 (2007), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelValle, </em>443 Mass. 782, 790 (2005). \u2018Determinations of the relevance, probative value, and prejudice of such evidence are left to the sound discretion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>judge, whose decision to admit such evidence will be upheld absent clear error.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robidoux, supra, </em>and cases cited.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>460 Mass. 277, 289 (2011). We conclude that it was not error to admit Lam\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">After hearing argument from both sides, the judge found that the challenged evidence was relevant to establish the defendant\u2019s motive and intent. Lam\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s abusive behavior while they were living together, in conjunction with her testimony that he threatened to kill her and the children within weeks of the fire, tended to show the defendant\u2019s longstanding and persistent anger and hostility toward her. It spoke also to a possible rationale for the defendant\u2019s setting fire to himself inside the apartment, namely, to exact revenge on Lam for what he perceived as her betrayal in attempting to leave the marriage. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. 773, 794 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2441 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>441 Mass. 459, 464-465 (2004) (\u201cEvidence of the hostile relationship between the defendant and his wife was not offered as improper propensity evidence . . . [but] as evidence of his motive to kill her\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 269 (1982) (\u201cWithout the challenged evidence the killing could have appeared to the jury as an essentially inexplicable act of violence\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Furthermore, the judge instructed the jury when Lam testified, and again in his charge, that evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts was to be considered only for the purpose of proving the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship with Lam, as it related to his motive and intent in setting the fire. On this record, we cannot say that the judge abused his discretion in admitting Lam\u2019s testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>450 Mass. 794, 816, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Mooltrey </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>555 U.S. 947 (2008) (\u201cGiven the probative value of the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>and the [limiting] instruction, the judge did not abuse her discretion in admitting it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">b. <em>Psychotherapist-patient privilege. </em>The Commonwealth introduced, over the defendant\u2019s objection, incriminating statements that the defendant made to a psychiatrist a few weeks after the fire. The defendant contends that these statements were subject to the psychotherapist-patient privilege codified at G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that their erroneous admission was prejudicial and requires the reversal of his convictions. The Commonwealth concedes that the defendant\u2019s statements were made during a communication with his psychotherapist that would otherwise render them privileged, but claims that, because the defendant placed his \u201cmental or emotional condition\u201d at issue as an element of his defense of lack of intent, the defendant waived that privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">As provided by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (c), a patient waives this statutory privilege</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">\u201c[i]n any proceeding ... in which the patient introduces his mental or emotional condition as an element of his claim or defense, and the judge or presiding officer finds that it is more important to the interests of justice that the communication be disclosed than that the relationship between patient and psychotherapist be protected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Interpretation of the psychotherapist-patient privilege is a question of law that we review de novo. See <em>Board of Registration in Med. </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>457 Mass. 738, 742 (2010). Because the defendant objected to the admission of the statements, we review for prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. 589, 591 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">During his stay in the bum and trauma unit of a Boston hospital after the fire, the defendant was interviewed by a psychiatrist, Dr. John Findley, who was among the doctors on his treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>team.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant made statements to Findley about his state of mind at the time of the fire, which Findley included in his medical report. The hospital subsequently released the defendant\u2019s medical records, including Findley\u2019s report, to the Commonwealth pursuant to a subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The Commonwealth called Findley as a witness. Shortly after direct examination began, the judge, sua sponte, raised the question whether the patient-psychotherapist privilege was applicable. The prosecutor argued that the communication between the defendant and Findley was not subject to the privilege because the defendant had placed his mental state in issue through his defense that he had not intended to harm anyone else but, rather, to commit suicide.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge did not permit Findley to testify to the defendant\u2019s statements, finding that the defendant had not yet placed his mental or emotional condition in issue. The judge did, however, leave open the possibility that Findley might be called as a rebuttal witness in response to the defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">On direct examination, the defendant was asked to explain his intent in lighting the fire. He replied, \u201cI wanted to kill myself.\u201d When asked whether he intended \u201cto hurt anyone else in [the] house,\u201d he answered, \u201cNo.\u201d The prosecutor argued at sidebar that this exchange had introduced \u201ca direct conflict about what was in [the defendant\u2019s] mind\u201d on the day of the fire, entitling him to call Findley in rebuttal. The judge again rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, noting that the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ant had not mounted a defense of diminished capacity or lack of criminal responsibility and concluding that his answers still had not put his mental or emotional condition at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">During cross-examination, the prosecutor pursued a line of questioning that sought to probe the defendant\u2019s state of mind in the moments leading up to the fire. The defendant continued to maintain that his sole intent was to die and that he had not intended to hurt anyone else or to set fire to the house.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth renewed its request to call Findley as a rebuttal witness, arguing that the defendant had essentially testified that he was \u201cnot thinking rationally at the time\u201d due to a \u201csuicidal ideation.\u201d The judge agreed, stating that the defendant \u201csaid a number of times that he had no plan, that he wasn\u2019t thinking clearly\u201d; the judge held explicitly that it was more important to the interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>of justice that the communication be disclosed than that the relationship between psychiatrist and patient be preserved and protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The Commonwealth recalled Findley, who testified that the defendant told him that his intention on the day of the fire was \u201cto take [Diana] with him,\u201d and that the defendant followed that comment by saying, \u201cI could get in big trouble for that.\u201d Findley clarified on redirect that the defendant had answered \u201cyes\u201d when Findley asked him \u201cif he tried to take his daughter with him, did he want her to die, did he want to kill his daughter.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">A defendant who raises the defense of lack of criminal responsibility may render admissible otherwise privileged statements made to a psychotherapist. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seabrooks, </em>433 Mass. 439, 448-450 (2001) (privilege did not apply where defendant elicited testimony from his own expert witnesses regarding his acute stress disorder and dissociative disorder not otherwise specified). We must determine whether the defendant\u2019s responses, given during cross-examination, \u201cintroduce^] his mental or emotional condition as an element of his . . . defense,\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (c), such that he waived the privilege that otherwise protected his statements to Findley.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The defendant did not state in advance of trial that he would assert a defense based on lack of criminal responsibility. See <em>Blaisdell </em>v. Commonwealth, 372 Mass. 753, 767 (1977). See also Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (b) (2) (A), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1518 (2004) (defendant shall notify prosecutor in writing if he \u201cintends to rely upon the defense of lack of criminal responsibility because of mental disease or defect at the time of the alleged crime\u201d). Nor did he give advance notice of,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or put before the jury, a defense that relied on a claim of mental or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>emotional defect or impairment. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>431 Mass. 822, 828-830 (2000).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant also did not request, and the judge did not give, an instruction that the jury consider the defendant\u2019s mental or emotional condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The defense theory was one of excuse, namely, that injury to anyone other than the defendant was purely accidental. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 506, 514 n.7 (2000). The defendant made no claim during any stage of the proceedings \u2014 nor did he suggest, either through argument, conduct of the trial, or request for instructions \u2014 that at the time he tried to commit suicide by setting himself on fire, he suffered from a mental or emotional condition that disabled him from forming the intent required for the crimes with which he was charged.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defense was not that the defendant was incapable of forming the intent necessary to support conviction but, rather, that he lacked the requisite intent to harm another. Contrast <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 765 (listing examples of ways defendant seeking to assert defense of insanity may do so without testifying, including, e.g., that defendant with prior history of mental disorders and treatment \u201cmay offer evidence of the same through medical records with or without expert witnesses\u201d and that lay witnesses may testify to \u201cobservations of the defendant prior to, during or subsequent to the time of the alleged crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">We conclude that the claim of a lack of intent does not, without more, suffice to put in issue a defendant\u2019s mental or emotional condition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>defendant\u2019s testimony that he did not intend to set fire to the house or to others in it, but intended only to kill himself, was tantamount to the assertion of a defense based on a mental condition described by the Commonwealth as despondency and suicidal ideation. The Commonwealth may not introduce against a defendant statements protected by the psychotherapist-patient privilege on the ground that the defendant himself placed his mental or emotional condition in issue, unless the defendant has at some point in the proceedings asserted a defense based on his mental or emotional condition, defect, or impairment. Because the defendant did not put his mental condition at issue in the manner contemplated by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (c), it was error to admit in evidence the statements he made to Findley.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Having concluded that the challenged confession should not have been admitted, we must decide whether the error \u201cdid not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect\u201d; we ask whether it can be said \u201cwith fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983). If \u201cthe error itself had substantial influence . . . or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, supra </em>at 446, quoting <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765 (1946).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The evidence of the defendant\u2019s statement to Findley bore directly on the defendant\u2019s intent in setting the fire, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the central issue at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sliech-Brodeur, </em>457 Mass. 300, 321-324 (2010) (prejudicial error to compel pretrial production of defense psychiatrist\u2019s materials to Commonwealth\u2019s expert; material included defendant\u2019s statements reflecting her state of mind and supported Commonwealth expert\u2019s opinion of criminal responsibility, which was central issue at trial). See also <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 466 (1966), quoting <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 685 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (confession by defendant constitutes \u201cthe most compelling possible evidence\u201d of defendant\u2019s guilt). Without the defendant\u2019s unequivocal statement of his intent, the jury might have believed the defendant\u2019s testimony that he told Trinh to take the children out of the living room before he poured and ignited the gasoline because he did not want to hurt them. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 228 (2009) (judgment reversed where erroneously admitted evidence bolstered alleged victim\u2019s credibility, central issue in case). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>366 Mass. 705, 711 (1975) (no prejudice where erroneously admitted evidence did not contradict defense theory). The jury might also have drawn inferences more favorable to the defendant from statements he was heard making in the aftermath of the fire, such as, \u201cI know I\u2019ll be punished for this for a long time,\u201d which could have been viewed as consistent with the claim that he intended only to set fire to himself because he was so upset by Lam\u2019s supposed infidelity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent without the statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>made to Findley was strong, but it was not so overwhelming as to negate the impact on the jury\u2019s judgment of the erroneously admitted confession contained in the medical records. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckman, </em>461 Mass. 24, 38-39 (2011) (although prosecutor\u2019s argument regarding faint results in deoxyri-bonucleic acid [DNA] test not fair and reasonable, no prejudice arose where guilt was \u201coverwhelmingly established\u201d from independent sources of expert forensic evidence, fingerprint, and DNA analysis; erroneous argument \u201cadded nothing with comparable heft\u201d). This was the last evidence the jury heard, and the prosecutor relied heavily on evidence of the statements to Findley to argue that the defendant intended to set fire to Diana. Contrast <em>id. </em>at 39 (erroneous argument was \u201cafterthought\u201d in structure of closing, and prosecutor acknowledged that evidence was problematic).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The Commonwealth \u201cbears the risk of doubt when any exists as to\u201d whether an error at trial was prejudicial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 23 (1999) (Greaney, J., concurring). We cannot say that Findley\u2019s erroneously admitted testimony did not influence the jury. We therefore conclude that the error was prejudicial as to the charges of armed assault with intent to murder Diana and Trinh, as those convictions relied on proof of the defendant\u2019s specific intent to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">c. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>We next address, without taking into consideration Findley\u2019s improperly admitted testimony, the defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his convictions of armed assault with intent to murder Diana and Trinh; assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon causing serious bodily injury to Diana and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Trinh; assault and battery on Quach by means of a dangerous weapon; armed home invasion; and arson. Reviewing the case under the familiar <em>Latimore </em>standard, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support each of these convictions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979) (claim of insufficient evidence reviewed to determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">First, the defendant claims that the Commonwealth did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt the intent element of armed assault with intent to murder and of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As to his convictions of armed assault with intent to murder Diana and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon causing serious bodily injury to Diana, the Commonwealth presented ample evidence that the defendant applied force against Diana by means of gasoline and fire with the intention of killing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">As previously set forth, there was evidence from which the jury could have found that the defendant was angry that his wife had left him and had threatened to kill her and the children if she did not return; that the defendant arrived at Lam\u2019s apartment with a can of gasoline, which he concealed as he entered the living room where Diana was asleep; and that the defendant stood near Diana and Trinh as he poured the gasoline in such a manner as to splash onto Diana\u2019s clothing, which was immediately set ablaze when the defendant ignited the gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Further, there was evidence that, soon after he had ignited the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>fire, the defendant made no attempt to aid Diana, nor did he alert other residents that a fire was burning in the house. The defendant\u2019s failure to do so undercut his defense that he did not intend to injure Diana and could have been considered by the jury as evidence of consciousness of guilt. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>391 Mass. 97, 108 n.6, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 840 (1984) (murder defendant\u2019s failure to call for help after shooting victim was relevant to finding malice).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Finally, evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent came from the properly admitted inculpatory statements he made immediately after the fire. In combination, the above provided sufficient evidence that the defendant assaulted Diana with the intention of killing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The charges of armed assault with intent to murder Trinh and of assault and battery on Trinh and Quach by means of a dangerous weapon were premised on a theory of transferred intent, as to which the jury were properly instructed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The doctrine of transferred intent is applicable \u201cin situations where the defendant\u2019s conduct harms a person other than the intended victim.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melton, </em>436 Mass. 291, 296 (2002). \u201c[The] defendant\u2019s intent is deemed to extend to\u201d other injured individuals; his intent \u201cencompasses completely unintended victims (including victims of whom the defendant was unaware) who happen to suffer along with the intended victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297-298. Based on the evidence supporting an inference that the defendant intended to assault Diana with the gasoline and fire, thereby to kill her, the jury also could have found the intent elements of the alleged crimes against Trinh and Quach, pursuant to the transferred intent doctrine.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>With respect to the charge of armed home invasion, the Commonwealth was required to prove either that the defendant used force or threatened the imminent use of force against a person inside the apartment, or that he intentionally injured someone therein. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C. The defendant contends that the prosecution proceeded solely on a theory of intentional injury; however, this contention is unsupported by the record. As discussed, <em>supra, </em>the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence that the defendant used force against Diana and Trinh by splashing them with gasoline and subsequently setting them afire.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Finally, the defendant argues that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to support his conviction of arson of a dwelling. The Commonwealth was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cwilfully and maliciously set[] fire to, bum[ed], or cause[d] to be burned ... a dwelling house.\u201d G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 1. \u201c[M]alice in arson comprises only three components .... \u2018The wilful doing of an unlawful act without excuse is ordinarily sufficient to support the allegation that it was done maliciously and with criminal intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 506, 513 n.6 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>122 Mass. 19, 35 (1877). \u201c[T]he modern definition [of wilfulness] is that \u2018wilful means intentional\u2019 without making reference to any evil intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luna, </em>418 Mass. 749, 753 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 397 (1944). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Armand, </em>411 Mass. 167, 170 (1991) (wilful conduct is intentional rather than accidental); <em>Adoption of a Minor, </em>343 Mass. 292, 297 (1961) (term \u201cwilfully\u201d only requires actor to intend conduct; no ill will or malevolence required).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The defendant argues that the evidence could support only a finding of intent to bum himself and that the damage to Trinh\u2019s apartment was accidental. See J.R. Nolan &amp; L.J. Sartorio, Criminal Law \u00a7 424 (3d ed. 2001) (\u201caccidental and negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>burning\u201d not considered arson). We disagree. The jury could have found, consistent with the judge\u2019s supplemental instruction on this point, that the defendant intended not only his conduct, i.e., lighting the fire, but also the \u201cresulting harm, which in this case\u201d was the burning of the apartment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence against the defendant, though circumstantial, supported an inference of his intent to burn the apartment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). \u201cAn inference drawn from circumstantial evidence \u2018need only be reasonable and possible; it need not be necessary or inescapable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 533 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>373 Mass. 329, 341 (1977). There was evidence that the defendant carried a can of gasoline into the living room of the apartment, poured gasoline onto the floor, and then used his lighter to ignite it. An investigator for the Boston fire department testified that the deepest bum was in the middle of the living room floor where the defendant was standing when he ignited the fire, and that the bum was consistent with a \u201cpour pattern,\u201d that is, a pattern generated \u201cfrom splash\u201d by a flammable liquid being poured onto the ground and then moving openly. Items in the living room also caught on fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">A reasonable jury could infer from this evidence that the defendant was aware that by igniting the gasoline he would light not only himself on fire, but other people and things. Further, by his failure to take action to put out the fire, or to sound an alarm, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>defendant intended that the fire bum the apartment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavedon, </em>301 Mass. 307, 314-315 (1938) (no evidence that defendants made any effort to extinguish fire; this and fact that they failed to give any alarm might have been found by jury to be indicative of guilt); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vellucci, </em>284 Mass. 443, 445 (1933) (defendant, with knowledge that there had been fire in house, left without notifying authorities); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cali, </em>247 Mass. 20, 24 (1923) (notwithstanding defendant\u2019s claim that fire\u2019s origin was accidental, jury could find after reviewing all circumstances either that he set it or that after fire was under way he purposely refrained from any attempt to extinguish it). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 440, 444 (1987) (error where instruction failed to make clear that either setting of fire or \u201cfailure to extinguish or report it had to be intentional and not merely negligent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the defendant\u2019s two convictions of armed assault with intent to murder are set aside, and the case is remanded for a new trial on those indictments. The remaining convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-13\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b29-14\">Nguyen Trinh and one of her adult sons, Thanh Quach, were both burned during their efforts to rescue the baby. Trinh suffered permanent and disabling burn injuries to her upper body and legs, and Quach suffered burns to his hands. The defendant also suffered serious bum injuries, primarily to his face, arms, hands, and legs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b30-9\">The defendant was sentenced to forty to fifty years in State prison on the indictment charging armed home invasion. Concurrent with that sentence, he received prison sentences of eight to ten years for arson of a dwelling, nine to ten years for aggravated assault and battery on Diana Tran by means of a dangerous weapon, and four to ten years for aggravated assault and battery on Nguyen Trinh by means of a dangerous weapon, as well as concurrent sentences of nineteen to twenty years for armed assault with intent to kill Diana and Trinh. He also was sentenced to ten years\u2019 probation at the conclusion of his prison sentences for the assault and battery on Quach by means of a dangerous weapon. The Commonwealth entered a nolle prosequi on four additional charges relating to other individuals who had been in the building when the fire started.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s eyewitnesses, Manh and Trinh, is not consistent in every detail. Manh testified that Trinh and Diana were in the living room when the defendant entered it carrying the gas canister. This testimony was consistent with forensic evidence presented through expert witnesses that significant gasoline residue was found on the clothing that Diana and Trinh had been wearing at the time of their injuries. It is also consistent with the defendant\u2019s own testimony that Trinh and Diana were in the living room when he first went there to set himself on fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Trinh testified that she was in the kitchen and Diana was sleeping in the hammock when the defendant reentered the apartment and walked past her, hiding something behind his back. She saw him standing in the living room right next to the hammock where Diana was sleeping as he raised a can up to shoulder level and tipped it; a fire ignited, and she ran into the living room to save the baby.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The defendant testified on cross-examination that Trinh and Diana were five to six feet away from him in the kitchen, both on fire, soon after he lit the gasoline, but he did not know how they came to be on fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b35-7\">It does not change our analysis that Diana was not the victim of the defendant\u2019s earlier abusive acts, where the Commonwealth\u2019s theory was that the defendant\u2019s hostility and anger toward Lien Lam provided the motive to injure Diana. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>456 Mass. 741, 748-751 (2010) (evidence of defendant\u2019s \u201cvolatile relationship\u201d with victim\u2019s stepdaughter, who was defendant\u2019s former girl friend, was admissible to establish defendant\u2019s motive and intent to murder victim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b36-10\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20B, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-11\">\u201cExcept as hereinafter provided, in any court proceeding ... a patient shall have the privilege of refusing to disclose, and of preventing a witness from disclosing, any communication, wherever made, between said patient and a psychotherapist relative to the diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s mental or emotional condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Dr. John Findley interviewed the defendant to assess his capacity to undergo an arraignment, and the incriminating statements were made during this assessment.

The prosecutor stated that he had made defense counsel aware, as early as the defendant\u2019s arraignment, that the Commonwealth possessed the defendant\u2019s privileged statement to Findley, and he indicated that defense counsel had not disputed that the statements could be admitted pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (c). In addition to notifying defense counsel of his intention to introduce the privileged statements, the prosecutor ought to have moved for their admission prior to Findley\u2019s taking the stand.
