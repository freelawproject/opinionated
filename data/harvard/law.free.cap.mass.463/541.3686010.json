They claim first that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7C, which authorizes the senior judge (senior judge) of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) to suspend the right of an attorney to \u201cpractice or appear before the department,\u201d violates the separation of powers explicitly provided for under art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. They claim also that 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19 (3) (2008), which precludes recovery of an employee\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees if the employee does not accept an insurer\u2019s offer to pay the full amount of the compensation claim, when made at least five days before the date of the hearing before an administrative judge of the department, conflicts with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (5), which, according to the petitioners, provides that the attorney will be entitled to a fee \u201c[wjhenever\u201d an insurer contests a claim for benefits and the employee prevails at a hearing on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The disciplinary proceedings against the petitioners arise from two separate matters before the department. James N. Ellis, Sr., Charles E. Berg, and Teresa Brooks Benoit represented Nancy Packard, and Ellis and Berg represented Pedro Ferreira, in claims for compensation for work-related injuries. In each case, an insurer\u2019s settlement offer that fully satisfied the employee\u2019s underlying claim for benefits was rejected, because the offer did not include the payment of costs and attorney\u2019s fees. Each case then proceeded to a hearing, where the claims for costs and fees were rejected. In addition, the petitioners were referred to the senior judge for discipline; in Ferreira\u2019s case, Ellis and Berg received temporary suspensions of the right \u201cto practice or appear before the department.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 <em>1C.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The petitioners filed a petition in the county court seeking various forms of relief pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64; G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3; and G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 1, including injunctions against disciplinary suspensions by the department, injunctions against the imposition of any sanctions for making a claim for expenses and attorney\u2019s fees, and a judgment declaring that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 <em>1C, </em>and 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(3) are void. On a joint motion of the parties, the single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court without decision. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 <em>1C, </em>impermissibly assigns a judicial function to a department of the executive branch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>in violation of art. 30, and that 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(3) is a valid interpretation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We set forth relevant details of the underlying proceedings, drawn primarily from the parties\u2019 agreed-on statement of facts submitted to the single justice, supplemented by reference to the related decisions rendered in these matters by the administrative judge, the department\u2019s reviewing board (reviewing board), and the senior judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">a. <em>Nancy Packard\u2019s case. </em>The petitioners represented Packard in her claims for disability payments based on compensable injuries to her right arm that led to loss of function and disfigurement. In August, 2005, Ellis filed the claim, which the insurer denied. After two unsuccessful conciliations, an administrative judge at the conference level ordered payment of $1,768.92 for disfigurement and $4,183.50 for eleven per cent loss of function of Packard\u2019s right arm suffered in the course of her employment. The employee appealed and, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, was examined by an impartial medical examiner, who offered the opinion that, to a reasonable medical certainty, Packard suffered from a fifteen per cent loss of function. On May 2, 2006, the insurer submitted a written offer to pay the additional $1,521.27 that was based on a fifteen per cent loss of function, but did not offer to pay attorney\u2019s fees and expenses. The employee did not accept the insurer\u2019s offer, and the case proceeded to a hearing in October, 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">After a hearing, the administrative judge adopted as a finding the opinion of the impartial medical examiner and ordered the insurer to compensate the employee for a fifteen per cent loss of function. He denied the employee\u2019s request for fees and costs on the ground that such fees and costs were precluded by 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The administrative judge further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>found that the petitioners had not conveyed the insurer\u2019s settlement offer to the employee, in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.4, 426 Mass. 1314 (1998),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and had made strategic decisions based on their own interests that conflicted with those of their client, in violation of Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.7, as amended, 430 Mass. 1301 (1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He rejected the petitioners\u2019 claim that Packard was entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses, that such an award would constitute compensation in excess of what was offered by the insurer for the purposes of the regulation, and that she therefore would have been entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the statute. The administrative judge sua sponte assessed the full cost of the proceeding against the petitioners pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14 (1), based on their decision to proceed to a hearing, despite having been offered the full satisfaction of the employee\u2019s compensation claim five months before the hearing date. The reviewing board upheld all aspects of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>judge\u2019s decision and referred the matter to the senior judge for disciplinary proceedings under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7C, which remained pending as of the time of this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">b. <em>Pedro Ferreira\u2019s case. </em>Ferreira was injured after falling at work in August, 2004, and began receiving temporary total incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34. In 2005, represented by Ellis and Berg, Ferreira filed a claim for compensation based on a psychiatric injury as a \u201csequela\u201d to his physical injury, which was rejected by the insurer and denied at the initial conference. The employee appealed and on July 12, 2006, was examined by an impartial medical examiner. Eleven days before the scheduled hearing date, the insurer submitted a written offer to accept the claim for psychiatric benefits; the offer did not include payment of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred in the course of representing Ferreira, and was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The case proceeded to a hearing in September, 2006, whereupon the employee\u2019s claim was denied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge further concluded that the conduct of Ellis and Berg leading up to the hearing supported a finding that they had acted in their own interest to their client\u2019s detriment, citing rule 1.7(b) and comment 6.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The employee appealed, and the reviewing board affirmed the denial of his claim. Additionally, the panel found that Ellis and Berg had pursued the appeal \u201cwithout reasonable grounds,\u201d and assessed the cost of the proceeding as a sanction; it also referred the matter to the senior judge for further discipline. Thereafter, proceedings commenced before the senior judge, who exercised his power under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7C, to suspend the right of Ellis and Berg \u201cto practice or appear before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>department,\u201d for a minimum period of fifty days and twenty-five days, respectively.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Statutory scheme. </em>Workers\u2019 compensation in the Commonwealth is governed by G. L. c. 152 (act), a statutory scheme that was enacted in response to the inadequacy of remedies available to injured workers through common-law tort claims and prior employers\u2019 liability statutes. See generally L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 1.1 (3d ed. 2003 &amp; Supp. 2011). Today, the act functions as one component in a comprehensive system of publicly and privately administered programs designed to provide financial security for workers and their families in the event of work-related injury or death. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 1.2-1.4. Specifically, the act sets forth exclusive procedures by which an employee may be awarded compensation for injuries \u201carising out of and in the course of\u201d employment. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 1 (7A), 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">A workers\u2019 compensation case for initial liability begins when an injured employee files a claim for benefits with an insurer (or self-insured employer). See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10 (1).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the claim is contested by the insurer, it advances through as many as four procedural stages within the department\u2019s division of dispute resolution en route to a final determination. In the first stage, conciliation, a conciliator attempts to guide the parties toward a resolution through a nonadversary process. <em>Id. </em>Failing agreement by conciliation, the claim proceeds to a conference before an administrative judge, who will consider a recommendation from the conciliator, along with evidence produced by the parties. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 10 (4), 10A (1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">A party may appeal from the conference order and obtain a hearing before the administrative judge. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 10A (3), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>11. In anticipation of the hearing, where a claim involves a dispute over medical issues, an employee must be examined by an impartial medical examiner, whose examination report is admitted in evidence at the hearing and \u201cshall constitute prima facie evidence of the matters contained therein.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A (2). A party dissatisfied with the outcome of a hearing can appeal to the reviewing board. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A more detailed summary of this process is set forth in <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., </em>415 Mass. 218, 223-225 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Throughout the proceedings at the division of dispute resolution, a party may be represented by any person, including a licensed attorney. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7C. Only an attorney can be compensated for representing a claimant. <em>Id. </em>The award of attorney\u2019s fees and \u201cnecessary expenses\u201d incurred in the course of representation of injured employees is governed exclusively by \u00a7 13A of the act; that is to say, the fees provided by \u00a7 13A are \u201cthe only fees payable for any services provided to employees\u201d seeking workers\u2019 compensation through the department\u2019s claims resolution process.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In addition to regulating the payment of attorney\u2019s fees, the statute authorizes the department to discipline any person, including an attorney, who represents a party in proceedings before the department. Section 7C of G. L. c. 152 provides, in relevant part: \u201cThe senior judge may, for cause, deny or suspend the right of any person to practice or appear before the department.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A person so disciplined may appeal to the Commissioner of Industrial Accidents, who, \u201c[ujpon receipt of such appeal, . . . shall refer the matter to the division of administrative law appeals . . . which shall have the authority to reverse, uphold or modify the removal or suspension after a hearing held pursuant to [G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>c. 30A, \u00a7 13].\u201d <em>Id. A </em>party may appeal from that decision to the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7C.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">b. <em>Power to discipline attorneys. </em>We address first the petitioners\u2019 claim that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7C, violates art. 30 by permitting a member of the executive branch, the department\u2019s senior judge, to deny or suspend the right \u201cof any person,\u201d including an attorney,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to \u201cpractice or appear before the department.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We conclude that, by authorizing the department to discipline a member of the bar by permanently or temporarily suspending the right of the attorney to practice, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7C, infringes on a core judicial function in derogation of art. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u201cWhat art. 30 forbids \u2014 \u2018the essence of what cannot be tolerated\u2019 \u2014\u2022 is legislative interference with the judiciary\u2019s core functions.\u201d <em>First Justice of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t v. Clerk-Magistrate of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, </em>438 Mass. 387, 396 (2003) <em>(First </em>Justice), citing <em>Chief Admin. Justice of the Trial Court v. Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>404 Mass. 53, 56 (1989). Among these core functions is the power to admit and remove officers of the court, and to regulate their professional conduct. See, e.g., <em>Collins v. Godfrey, </em>324 Mass. 574, 576 (1949); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>279 Mass. 607, 610-611 (1932). \u201cThere is nothing in the Constitution, either in terms or by implication, to indicate an intent that the power of the judiciary over the admission of persons to become attorneys is subject to legislative control,\u201d and \u201c[n]o <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>sound distinction can be drawn with respect to attorneys at law between the power to admit and the power to remove under the terms of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610. See <em>Berkwitz, petitioner, 323 </em>Mass. 41, 46 (1948) (\u201cIt is fully established that the control of membership in the bar is vested exclusively in the judicial department of our government\u201d). See also <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Godfrey, supra, Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass. 176, 180 (1943); <em>Matter of Keenan, </em>313 Mass. 186, 196-197 (1943); <em>Keenan, petitioner, </em>310 Mass. 166, 168, 171-172 (1941); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>289 Mass. 607, 612 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We have recognized a limited role for the Legislature in enacting statutes that assist the judiciary in regulating the legal profession. Such enactments respecting the admission or removal of attorneys from practice can be \u201cconvenient, if not essential, to enable the judicial department properly to perform this duty.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>279 Mass, at 611 (noting as an example the establishment, in 1897, of a State Board of Bar Examiners). But the judicial power to admit or remove members of the bar is \u201cinherent and exists without a statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610. See <em>First Justice, supra </em>at 397. And where a legislative enactment relative to attorney admission or discipline conflicts with this court\u2019s jurisprudence, it is the statute that must yield. See <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Godfrey, supra. </em>\u201cOnly the court can determine whether any member of the bar is guilty of improper conduct, and only the court can decide what consequences shall be visited upon him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578. Legislative enactments relating to the professional discipline of attorneys serve only as \u201can expression of policy for the guidance of the judicial department in exercising its constitutional prerogative of controlling the practice of law in the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>DiLuzio </em>v. <em>United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers, Local 274, </em>391 Mass. 211, 215 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The statute before us allocates to an agency of the executive branch the power to deny to an attorney, admitted to practice in the Commonwealth, the right to practice law, a power that, under our Constitution, is held only by the judicial branch. That the statute limits the exercise of this power to practice or appearance before the department, and does not purport to deprive attorneys of their right to practice before courts, does not save it.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>289 Mass, at 614 (\u201cNo valid distinction . . . can be drawn between that part of the work of the lawyer which involves appearance in court,\u201d and that part which involves out-of-court advice, drafting, and representation).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Nor does it matter that the department\u2019s rules are largely congruent with those adopted by this court. A parallel disciplinary system such as that created by the statute could lead to the interpretation and application of disciplinary rules in the context of workers\u2019 compensation cases that is inconsistent with the rules of professional conduct promulgated by this court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, S.J.C. Rule 3:07, as appearing in 426 Mass. 1303 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">It is similarly unavailing that the department\u2019s disciplinary decisions would be subject to judicial review before the Superior Court. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. That court is without jurisdiction to hear attorney discipline cases. See S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 1, as amended, 430 Mass. 1319 (2000). Further, appeals under the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 14, require that substantial deference be granted to the agency\u2019s factual determinations and its interpretations of its own rules. See part 2.c, <em>infra. </em>Such \u201cattenuated\u201d review does not suffice to save the statute. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>365 Mass. 639, 647 (1974) (bill that creates an agency with power to exert control over all branches of government is antithetical \u201cto the notion of separation of powers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In sum, the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights does not afford the executive branch of government the power to impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>professional discipline on attorneys. For that reason, we conclude that the provision of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7C, authorizing the senior judge to discipline attorneys by denying or suspending their right to appear or practice before the department, violates art. 30 and is therefore invalid.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">c. <em>Regulation of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses. </em>In both Packard\u2019s case and Ferreira\u2019s case, the administrative judge concluded that the award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses was precluded by 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(3). See note 3, <em>supra. </em>The petitioners claim that the regulation conflicts with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (5), which governs the award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses where a claim proceeds beyond conference to the hearing stage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u201cWhenever an insurer . . . contests a claim for benefits and then either (i) accepts the employee\u2019s claim . . . within five days of the date set for a hearing pursuant to section 111 or (ii) the employee prevails at such hearing the insurer shall pay a fee to the employee\u2019s attorney in an amount equal to three thousand five hundred dollars plus necessary expenses. An administrative judge may increase or decrease such fee based on the complexity of the dispute or the effort expended by the attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">According to the petitioners, the regulation is inconsistent with what they view as the statute\u2019s stated requirement that attorney\u2019s fees and expenses be awarded in all cases in which the employee \u201cprevails at [a] hearing,\u201d so long as an offer made by the insurer (even in the full amount of the compensation claim) is rejected by the employee.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Because the Legislature has expressly delegated to the department authority over the administration of the workers\u2019 compensation system, see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 5, our review is \u201cguided by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>established principle that [the department\u2019s] \u2018[regulations are not to be declared void unless their provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>451 Mass. 399, 408 (2008), quoting <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>431 Mass. 638, 646 (2000). Thus, \u201c[o]nly an \u2018agency regulation that is contrary to the plain language of the statute and its underlying purpose may be rejected by the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra, </em>quoting <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, supra. </em>See <em>Biogen IDEC MA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>454 Mass. 174, 186 n.22 (2009) (court will consider plain meaning, history, and purpose of statute to determine whether regulation reflects permissible reading).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Consistent with these principles, our review proceeds in two stages. \u201cFirst, we determine, using conventional tools of statutory interpretation, whether the Legislature has spoken with certainty on the topic in question, and if we conclude that the statute is unambiguous, we give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 632-633 (2005). If, however, \u201cthe Legislature has not addressed directly the pertinent issue, we determine whether the agency\u2019s resolution of that issue may \u2018be reconciled with the governing legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, quoting <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low Level Radioactive Waste Mgt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The statute at issue addresses specifically the circumstances in which an employee is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees on resolution of a claim. Section 13A calibrates the award of fees based on when in the life of a case pending before the department the claim is resolved, either by agreement or order. Whether an employee will be awarded fees, and in what amount, relates directly to the stage at which proceedings terminate; with exceptions not here relevant, the only fees payable are attorney\u2019s fees \u201cspecified in\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">At the beginning of a claim proceeding, a $700 fee will be awarded where an insurer contests an initial liability claim \u201cby failing to commence the compensation requested within twenty-one days\u201d of receiving the claim, but then \u201cagrees to pay,\u201d the claimed compensation at any time prior to a conference. G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>c. 152, \u00a7 13A (1).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> By necessary implication, an insurer may avoid imposition of a fee award only by commencing payment of the compensation requested within the twenty-one day period. An insurer who \u201cagrees to pay\u201d the claim after the twenty-one day period but prior to a conference will be liable to the employee for an attorney\u2019s fee of $700. If the insurer continues to contest the claim, however, and the employee is awarded a benefit at conference, the employee is entitled to a fee award of $1,000, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 13A (5), the statutory provision at issue here, entitles an employee to an attorney\u2019s fee, presumptively in the amount of $3,500,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> if the insurer \u201cfiles a complaint or contests a claim for benefits and then either (i) accepts the employee\u2019s claim or withdraws its own complaint within five days of the date set for hearing pursuant to section eleven; or (ii) the employee prevails at such hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Conspicuously absent is any requirement of a settlement or agreement between the parties; the triggering event is simply the insurer\u2019s acceptance of the claim for benefits. Thus, if an insurer accepts a claim after conference, but sooner than five days before the date set for the hearing, the insurer will avoid imposition of a fee award; if the insurer does not accept the claim until after the five-day period (that is, within five days of the date set for hearing), a fee will be awarded. To be sure, as we have said, the avoidance of fees is by implication. But the statute is constructed so that only attorney\u2019s fees specified in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A, shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>payable; where the statute makes no provision for an attorney\u2019s fee, none may be paid.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">This construction is supported by the statute\u2019s legislative history. The modern workers\u2019 compensation act, St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 28A (1985 act), added the new G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A, in part to encourage early voluntary resolution of claims and eliminate incentives to prolong litigation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cIn broad and general terms, [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A,] can be read to reflect two legislative goals: to ensure adequate legal representation of the injured worker or his dependents, and to discourage protracted litigation.\u201d <em>Spaniol\u2019s Case, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 440, further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>appellate review granted, 462 Mass. 1101 (2012), citing <em>Green\u2019s Case, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 144 (2001), and L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 24.1 (3d ed. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Under the 1985 act, inserted by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 28A, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A, made specific provision for an award of fees in increasing amounts, correlating with the length of time that an insurer fails to act as the case progressed through various stages of the dispute resolution process.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A fee would be awarded whenever the insurer accepted liability for the claim or withdrew its complaint after the claim was referred to the division of dispute resolution but prior to conference, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (1); if, after a conference, benefits were ordered or an insurer accepted a claim, but prior to the fifth day before a date set for hearing, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (2); and if the insurer accepted the claim within five days of the hearing, or the employee prevailed at the hearing, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (3). There was no provision for payment of a fee at any time prior to referral to the division of dispute resolution, and the statute specifically provided: \u201cNo attorney\u2019s fee shall be paid unless a claim . . . has at some time been referred to the division of dispute resolution.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">This structure \u2014 in which the statute made specific provision for when an attorney\u2019s fee would, and would not, be paid \u2014 was altered when G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A, was rewritten in 1987. See St. 1987, c. 691, \u00a7 8. Section 13A(7) was eliminated. The current provision provides that \u201c[t]he attorneys\u2019 fees specified in this section shall be the only fees payable for any services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>provided to employees under this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (10). See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (8), as appearing in St. 1987, c. 691, \u00a7 8. Also added were two new provisions specifying when in the context of initial claims an insurer would be required to pay an attorney\u2019s fee on behalf of the employee, including one providing for an award of attorney\u2019s fees at any time prior to five days before a hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">\u201cWhenever an insurer contests a written claim for benefits, . . . and then, at any time prior to five days before a hearing pursuant to section eleven, the insurer agrees to pay with or without prejudice ... the compensation due, said insurer shall pay an attorney\u2019s fee sufficient to defray the reasonable costs of counsel retained by the employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (1), as appearing in St. 1987, c. 691, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The language of this provision specifically provided for an attorney\u2019s fee award in the circumstances of this case, where benefits were ordered to be paid to the employee after conference and the insurer\u2019s agreement thereafter to pay the employee\u2019s claim for compensation was made \u201cfive days before a hearing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The Legislature again made comprehensive changes to the act in 1991. See St. 1991, c. 398. It eliminated from \u00a7 13A the very language cited above that would have provided for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>award of fees in the circumstances presented in this case, and that the petitioners argue must be read into G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (5).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u201cWhere the Legislature has deleted such language, apparently purposefully, the current version of the statute cannot be interpreted to include the rejected requirement.\u201d <em>Kenniston </em>v. <em>Department of Youth Servs., </em>453 Mass. 179, 185 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the W. Roxbury Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>439 Mass. 352, 355 (2003). Moreover, it is apparent from the debate over the pending legislation that occurred at the time, see note 24, <em>supra, </em>that the Legislature wanted to create incentives within the structure of the act that would encourage attorneys representing employees to resolve claims no later than conference, in this way securing some compensation for such attorneys while avoiding a time-consuming and costly hearing. Because the regulation achieves this purpose, we do not consider it in conflict with the provisions of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The petitioners raise a further concern that merits comment. They note that 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(3) eliminates attorney\u2019s fees altogether in cases where an insurer successfully disputes a claim through the conference stage, and then makes a timely settlement offer prior to a hearing. Indeed, the administrative judge, in his written decision in Packard\u2019s case, acknowledged that the proceedings in that matter exemplified the \u201cunfortunate,\u201d though \u201cnot uncommon,\u201d scenario in which a claim for benefits is denied at the conference stage and appealed by the employee; and then, more than five days before the scheduled hearing date, the insurer offers to satisfy the claim in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>full. In this scenario, the insurer avoids any payment of the employee\u2019s costs or attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The petitioners argue that the prospect of escaping entirely the payment of attorney\u2019s fees may provide insurers an incentive to contest any claim through conference, even one with apparent merit, and thereafter make a prompt settlement offer for the full amount of the claim, excluding attorney\u2019s fees. So long as the insurer meets with success through the conference stage, the insurer will have avoided the $1,000 attorney\u2019s fee owed where an employee succeeds at conference, while also escaping the $3,500 fee that would be assessed at a hearing. Conversely, employee\u2019s counsel will go entirely uncompensated. They claim that, if such a dynamic were repeated in a sufficient number of cases, the result would be to drive private attorneys out of the workers\u2019 compensation business.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Although the incentives described by the petitioners may well manifest themselves in some number of cases,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> it is far from clear that the regulation will result in the sort of systematic abuse contemplated by them. The petitioners\u2019 concerns are mitigated by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14 (1) (a) and (b), which provide that the entire cost of the proceedings may be assessed against an insurer (or employee or attorney acting behalf of an employee) if an administrative judge \u201cdetermines that any proceedings have been brought, prosecuted, or defended . . . without reasonable grounds.\u201d The act requires prompt and full disclosure of the employee\u2019s basis for, or insurer\u2019s medical documentation of, a claim of injury under the act. See, e.g., G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 10, 14, 30A. And it provides for the imposition of penalties if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>determined that, in any proceeding within the division of dispute resolution, a party, including an attorney, has \u201cconcealed or knowingly failed to disclose that which is required to be disclosed.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14 (2). Additionally, when the act was revised in 1991, the Legislature expanded G. L. c. 23E, \u00a7 3, authorizing the department\u2019s division of administration to investigate \u201cpatterns of unreasonably controverting claims by insurers, employers or other entities.\u201d St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The department could reasonably have concluded that any residual risk of abuse was outweighed by the regulation\u2019s potential benefits: the regulation may reasonably be thought to further the prompt and efficient resolution of workers\u2019 compensation disputes. For example, the regulation places a strong incentive on counsel to collect and present persuasive and credible medical evidence at the conference stage rather than relying upon the postconference report of the independent medical examiner. Similarly, the regulation undermines the incentive that an employee\u2019s counsel might otherwise have to advise the employee to prolong litigation through the hearing stage in order to obtain the heightened fees associated with the hearing. In these and other ways the regulation can reasonably be thought to reflect the Legislature\u2019s strong preference that workers\u2019 compensation claims be processed efficiently and that parties not engage in protracted litigation.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Alliy </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. </em>Co., 39 Mass. App. Ct. 688, 690-691 (1996) (\u201cThe legislative purpose in the statutory scheme is not elusive. . . . [T]he Legislature has chosen to discourage dilatory handling of injury claims arising out of industrial accidents and conversely encourages efficient handling of those claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The question whether the regulation\u2019s potential salutary effects will predominate over its risks is best answered in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>experience. It is proper, therefore, that we grant deference to the department, which daily processes workers\u2019 compensation claims. Because the challenged portion of the department\u2019s regulation reflects a permissible interpretation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A, as reflected in the history of the statute, and because it is rationally related to that statute\u2019s goals, the petitioners\u2019 challenge to the regulation must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7C, is invalid as a violation of art. 30, insofar as it authorizes the senior judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents to suspend attorneys from appearing before the department. We conclude also that 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(3) is a valid interpretation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A. The matter is remanded to the county court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The petitioners do not argue that, apart from the costs of litigation and attorney\u2019s fees, the insurer failed to offer the full amount of compensation claimed by Packard.

The day before the hearing, the petitioners sought to continue the hearing without explanation, and the request was denied the following morning.

Since the statute was amended in 1991, the fee to be paid is no longer based on an average weekly wage, but is a flat fee that increases in proportion to the length of time that the insurer fails to act. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A, as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 35. See also note 20, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">In addition, the 1987 act amended G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A, by adding the provision that a fee would be awarded whenever an insurer \u201cfiles a complaint or contests a claim for benefits and then (i) accepts the employee\u2019s claim or withdraws its own complaint within five days of the date set for a hearing pursuant to section eleven; or (ii) the employee prevails at such hearing.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (3), as appearing in St. 1987, c. 691. The 1987 act eliminated the provision that previously had provided for a fee if an insurer accepted a claim after a conference has been held, but prior to the fifth day before the date set for hearing. Compare G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (2), inserted by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 28A, with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (2), as appearing in St. 1987, c. 691, \u00a7 8. Read in conjunction with the statutory admonition that the only fees that would be awarded were those specified in \u00a7 13A, two things are noteworthy: first, no fees were specified, and thus none would be awarded, if an insurer commenced compensation within fourteen days of receipt of a claim. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A. See also G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7, as appearing in St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 18. This was consistent with the Legislature\u2019s goal of eliminating financial incentives that would encourage litigation. See note 24, <em>supra. </em>Second, the provision for a fee after conference was eliminated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The Legislature, by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 35, also increased to twenty-one days (from fourteen) die window within which an insurer could commence payment of a claim without incurring liability for the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee. It added two tiers to the graduated system of fee awards: first, by providing for a fee award ($700) whenever an insurer agreed to pay a claim at any time prior to conference, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (1), as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398; and second, by providing for a fee award ($1,000) whenever an insurer contests an initial liability claim for benefits and then is ordered to pay such benefits pursuant to a conference order, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (2), as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The regulation at issue, 452 Code Mass.
