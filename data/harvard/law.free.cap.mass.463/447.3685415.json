The plaintiffs filed timely notices of appeal, and on the parties\u2019 joint motion the appeals were consolidated in the Appeals Court. We transferred the cases to this court on our own motion, and now affirm the decisions denying the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><em>General background. </em>The plaintiffs in the first action are the Boston Medical Center Corporation (BMC) and the Boston Medical Center Health Plan, Inc. (Health Plan). According to the amended complaint, BMC is the largest provider of medical care to \u201cunderserved, low-income, and vulnerable populations in Massachusetts\u201d; only nineteen per cent of its patients are covered by private insurers. The Health Plan is a managed care organization that provides health care services to approximately 240,700 members, of whom approximately 170,000 are enrolled in MassHealth. The plaintiffs in the second action are Holyoke Medical Center, Inc., and two other hospitals (collectively, the Holyoke plaintiffs).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant in both actions is the Secretary, who administers MassHealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The judge allowed the Secretary\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the complaint brought by BMC and the Health Plan in a carefully reasoned memorandum of decision and order. She allowed the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss as to the complaint brought by the Holyoke plaintiffs, stating that her legal analysis in the first case \u201capplies here in nearly all respects\u201d and addressing in her memorandum and order only the differences between the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In reviewing the judge\u2019s two orders, \u201cwe examine the same pleadings as the motion judge and therefore proceed de novo.\u201d <em>Dartmouth </em>v. <em>Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Tech. High Sch. Dist., </em>461 Mass. 366, 373 (2012) (Dartmouth) (motion to dismiss). See <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>456 Mass. 594, 600-601 (2010) (judgment on pleadings). Those pleadings include contracts and public documents that are referenced in the complaints and that were provided to the motion judge. See <em>Marram </em>v. <em>Kobrick Offshore Fund, Ltd., </em>442 Mass. 43, 45 n.4 (2004), citing Mass. R. Civ. P. 10 (c), 365 Mass. 752 (1974). We accept as true the allegations in the complaints and draw every reasonable inference in favor of the plaintiffs. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Herb Chambers I-95, Inc., </em>458 Mass. 674, 676 (2011), citing <em>Warner Lambert Co. </em>v. <em>Execuquest Corp., </em>427 Mass. 46, 47 (1998). \u201cWe consider whether the factual allegations in the complaint are sufficient, as a matter of law, to state a recognized cause of action or claim, and whether such allegations plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Dartmouth, supra </em>at 374, citing <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 636 (2008). Because issues relevant to the plaintiff hospitals are distinct from issues raised by the Health Plan, we consider first the claims relevant only to the hospitals and then consider the additional claims raised by the Health Plan. We conclude by examining the remaining claims that are asserted by all plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\"><em>The hospitals\u2019 claims. </em>1. <em>Background. </em>The rates paid by Mass-Health for medical services provided by hospitals generally are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>established by contract between the hospital and the Secretary. G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 11. Since 1991, the Secretary has established payment rates for hospitals through an annual rate setting process. The Secretary publishes a Request for Applications (RFA) that informs each hospital of the payment rates for each MassHealth-eligible patient that the hospital may treat, as well as the methodology used to calculate each hospital\u2019s payment rates. The RFA, at least for rate year 2009,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is an approximately one hundred page document that primarily focuses on describing the types of hospital services that will be \u201creimbursed\u201d by MassHealth, and the methodology used by the Secretary to calculate various reimbursement rates to be paid for different types of care. Under G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 36, and the terms of the REA, a hospital that enters into a contract to accept MassHealth patients must agree to accept, \u201cas payment in full,\u201d the amounts paid under these rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">One rate at issue in this lawsuit and defined in the RFA is the \u201cStandard Payment Amount Per Discharge\u201d (SPAD). A SPAD payment is a flat-fee paid by the Secretary for the first twenty days of inpatient care, regardless of the reason for the hospitalization or the actual cost incurred by the hospital to care for the admitted patient, and regardless whether the patient actually remains in the hospital for twenty days. A second rate at issue is the \u201cPayment Amount Per Episode\u201d (PAPE), which similarly is a flat-fee paid by the Secretary for outpatient care. The rate of the SPAD or PAPE payment determines whether a hospital makes a profit or takes a loss on the care of MassHealth patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The SPAD and the PAPE rates differ for each hospital, because the rates adjust the Statewide average costs of providing service with a complicated algorithm based in part on a hospital\u2019s particular \u201ccasemix.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A hospital\u2019s \u201ccasemix index\u201d is defined in the RFA as a \u201ccategorization of a hospital\u2019s patient population according to criteria approved by [the Secretary] including, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>but not limited to, primary and secondary diagnoses, primary and secondary procedures, illness severity, patient age and source of payment.\u201d The index is intended to take into account the differences among hospitals in the types of medical problems they treat and the patient populations they serve that will affect their average costs, so that a hospital that treats more serious or complex medical problems requiring expensive procedures or longer hospitalizations or that treats patient populations in poorer health or with special needs will have SPAD and PAPE rates above the Statewide average.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">An appendix to the REA is a document titled \u201cMassHealth Hospital Contract\u201d (contract), which is a ten-page form contract. If a particular hospital accepts the REA, including the detailed description of payment rates, the hospital executes and returns the REA and contract indicating its acceptance. Either party is allowed to terminate the contract with at least thirty days\u2019 prior written notice for any reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">According to the terms of the contract, the Secretary \u201cmay revise payment rates, methodology [and] may amend any term of this [c]ontract, as it determines necessary\u201d and with few exceptions not relevant to this appeal, \u201cshall provide the [hospital] with [thirty] days\u2019 written notice prior to implementing any amendment to the terms of the contract.\u201d If the hospital does not respond to a proposed amendment, the Secretary \u201cmay exercise [her] discretion either to terminate for cause ... or continue the [hospital\u2019s] participation,\u201d in which case the Secretary \u201cshall notify the [hospital] whether pre- or post-amendment methodology, rates, and [c]ontract provisions shall apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">BMC and the Holyoke plaintiffs are disproportionate share hospitals, which means that at least sixty-three per cent of their \u201cgross patient service revenue\u201d comes from Medicare, Medicaid, free care, or other government payors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Under G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 11 <em>(a), </em>\u201c[f]or disproportionate share hospitals, the [Secretary] shall establish rates that equal the financial requirements of providing care to recipients of medical assistance.\u201d \u201cFinancial requirements\u201d is defined as \u201ca hospital\u2019s requirement for revenue which shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable operating, capital and working capital costs, the reasonable costs of depreciation of plant and equipment and the reasonable costs associated with changes in medical practice and technology.\u201d G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"At8\">As alleged by the plaintiffs, the Secretary issued the rate year 2009 RFA in August, 2008, but amended the RFA on September 19, raising payment rates. On October 1, the Secretary issued a \u201cNotice of Final Agency Action,\u201d lowering payment rates and stating that the calculation of payment rates would be \u201cderived from the statewide average hospital cost per admission in rate year 2006, standardized for casemix differences and wage area variation\u201d and that the Secretary would adopt a minimum efficiency standard to cap reasonable hospital costs used in calculating MassHealth payments. In an amendment on December 7, the Secretary again lowered payment rates. All of the Holyoke plaintiffs signed the amended RFA contracts, but the BMC did not. The BMC, however, along with the other plaintiff hospitals, continued to participate in MassHealth, treated MassHealth enrollees, and accepted payments from the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The plaintiff hospitals have brought four claims challenging this reduction in rate payments, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">2. <em>Violation ofG. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 11. </em>The four plaintiff hospitals assert that the Secretary\u2019s methodology and rate payments for rate year 2009 violated G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 11, because the MassHealth rate payments yielded by that methodology did not \u201cequal the financial requirements of providing care to recipients of medical assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 11 (a) imposes a statutory duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>on the Secretary to set MassHealth payment rates for disproportionate share hospitals that equal the financial requirements of providing care to those patients. The statute does not, however, expressly waive sovereign immunity and create a private right of action for a hospital to claim that the Secretary committed a breach of this duty by imposing unreasonably low payment rates in the RFA. The plaintiff hospitals ask us to imply such a waiver and a private right of action, arguing such implication is necessary because otherwise the statute would be ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In general, we have \u201cbeen reluctant to infer a private cause of action from a statute in the absence of some indication from the Legislature supporting such an inference.\u201d <em>Loffredo </em>v. <em>Center for Addictive Behaviors, </em>426 Mass. 541, 544 (1998) <em>(Loffredo). </em>Where a private right of action inferred from a statute would permit a claim against the Commonwealth, the Legislature must also waive sovereign immunity. See <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>442 Mass. 170, 175 (2004) <em>(Lopes) </em>(\u201cSovereign immunity bars a private action against a State in its own courts absent consent by the Legislature or abrogation of sovereignty by Congress acting under its Fourteenth Amendment powers\u201d). See also <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>527 U.S. 706, 745, 754-756 (1999). \u201cThe rules of construction governing statutory waivers of sovereign immunity are stringent.\u201d <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>409 Mass. 89, 91 (1991), quoting <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 38, 42 (1981) <em>(Woodbridge). </em>We have found a waiver of sovereign immunity only where consent to suit is \u201cexpressed by the terms of a statute, or appear[s] by necessary implication from them.\u201d <em>Lopes, supra </em>at 175-176, quoting <em>Woodbridge, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Here, the statutory scheme strongly suggests that the Legislature did <em>not </em>intend to waive sovereign immunity and provide hospitals with a private right of action to challenge the reasonableness of MassHealth payment rates. In G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the Legislature allowed medical providers administratively to challenge before an impartial hearing officer MassHealth payment rates set by the Secretary that the provider contends were unreasonable, with judicial review available under G. L. c. 30A. However, the Legislature explicitly excluded hospital rates established under \u00a7 11 from this appeal process. See G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 9 (appeal of rate setting to hearings officer \u201c[ejxcept for rates established pursuant to [\u00a7 ll]\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It \u201cweighs heavily against recognizing a private right of action,\u201d <em>Salvas </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>452 Mass. 337, 373 (2008) <em>(Salvas), </em>that the Legislature has expressly provided medical providers aggrieved by unreasonable MassHealth payment rates with an avenue of administrative appeal, along with judicial review, but has expressly excluded from this remedy the MassHealth rates set for hospitals pursuant to \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Nor are we persuaded that a private right of action and waiver of sovereign immunity is a \u201cnecessary implication\u201d of a statutory duty under \u00a7 11 (a) to establish rates for disproportionate care hospitals that equal the \u201cfinancial requirements\u201d of providing care to MassHealth patients. A statutory duty by itself does not necessarily imply a judicial remedy to challenge the executive branch\u2019s compliance with that duty. See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Redemption Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Envtl. Affairs, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 67, 68-70 (2007) <em>(Mass. Redemption) </em>(statute mandating that \u201csecretary [of environmental affairs] shall promulgate . . . regulations\u201d creates \u201cpurely political question . . . best left to the executive branch\u201d and does not create private right to challenge compliance in court). The Legislature often imposes obligations on officials in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>executive branch to act in accordance with specified standards, but it does not always create a private right of action and waive sovereign immunity to allow private parties to enforce compliance with those standards in a judicial or administrative adjudication against the Commonwealth. See, e.g., <em>Salvas, supra </em>at 372-373 (Attorney General has duty to enforce statute; no private right of action); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of the Trial Court, </em>448 Mass. 15, 38 (2006) (\u201cwe discern no legislative intent to create a private cause of action to enforce environmental laws that the plaintiffs seek to have recognized\u201d); <em>Woodbridge, supra </em>(\u201ctenor of G. L. c. 123 [which declares the rights of patients receiving treatment through Department of Mental Health] is one of aspiration and encouragement, rather than of the creation of a formal system of actionable guaranties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Finally, in determining whether a private right of action and waiver of sovereign immunity are a \u201cnecessary implication\u201d of a statutory duty, we consider whether it would be reasonable as a matter of public policy for the Legislature to have intended a statutory duty without a judicial remedy. See <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Director of Office of Campaign &amp; Political Fin., </em>436 Mass. 144, 174 (2002) (considering whether \u201creasons of \u2018justice and public policy\u2019 argue for the application of sovereign immunity\u201d); <em>Morash &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 612, 623 (1973) (same). Judicial review of a hospital\u2019s payment rates set by the Secretary would be complex and difficult. The Legislature imposed on the Secretary a duty to establish rates \u201cthat equal the financial requirements of providing care to recipients of medical assistance,\u201d G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 11 (a). General Laws c. 118G defines \u201c[financial requirements\u201d as \u201ca hospital\u2019s requirement for revenue\u201d to reimburse its \u201creasonable\u201d costs, which include not only \u201creasonable\u201d operating costs, but also \u201creasonable\u201d capital costs, depreciation, and \u201creasonable costs associated with changes in medical practice and technology.\u201d G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 1. That same statute also defines a hospital\u2019s \u201c[a]ctual costs\u201d as \u201call direct and indirect costs incurred by a hospital ... in providing medically necessary care and treatment to its patients, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where a hospital\u2019s \u201cactual costs\u201d are not reasonable, \u201cfinancial requirements\u201d need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>equal \u201cactual costs.\u201d See <em>Cliff House Nursing Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 304 (1983) (\u201creasonable costs are distinguishable from and may be less than actual costs\u201d). Therefore, any review of a hospital\u2019s payment rates must consider not only the hospital\u2019s actual costs, but also whether its actual costs are reasonable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Judges have decided issues of comparable difficulty and complexity, but not without substantial time, effort, and expense. As the motion judge found, the \u201cSecretary\u2019s performance of the task assigned to her necessarily calls for the application of technical expertise that the [cjourt lacks, and the exercise of judgment and discretion that the [Ljegislature has not entrusted to the [c]ourt.\u201d It would be reasonable for the Legislature to conclude that the fair and cost-effective provision of hospital services to MassHealth patients would not be furthered by judicial review. See <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>402 Mass. 611, 617 (1988) (\u201cA policy that places final determination as to the necessity of an [environment impact report] in the hands of a disinterested public official with expertise in environmental matters, shared by his or her staff but not ordinarily shared by judges, cannot be characterized as unsound\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>For these reasons, the judge did not err in concluding that the plaintiff hospitals\u2019 claims that the Secretary violated her statutory duty under \u00a7 11 must be denied because the Legislature neither created a private right of action to enforce this statutory duty nor waived sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">3. <em>Breach of contract. </em>The plaintiff hospitals do not allege that the Secretary failed to make payments as required by the hospital provider RFA and contract. What they do allege is that the Secretary is contractually required to comply with applicable statutes in determining reimbursement rates, including the statutory obligation in \u00a7 11 (a) to \u201cestablish rates that equal the financial requirements of providing care to recipients of medical assistance,\u201d and that the Secretary committed a breach of this contractual obligation. \u201c[A] contractual claim does not arise under a statute unless the Legislature has explicitly expressed the intent to waive sovereign immunity and create a contractual remedy.\u201d <em>Lopes, supra </em>at 178, quoting <em>Hollstein </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 109, 114 (1999). Our conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to waive sovereign immunity therefore defeats the plaintiffs\u2019 contractual claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The Holyoke plaintiffs additionally allege that the Secretary violated the \u201cimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing\u201d in her actions. But the basis for this claim is the alleged statutory violation that the Secretary did not \u201cset reimbursement rates . . . based on the <em>actual </em>financial requirements\u201d of the plaintiff hospitals (emphasis added). To the extent that this claim rests on an alleged statutory violation, we have already concluded that it must fail on grounds of sovereign immunity. To the extent that it rests on the claim that the hospitals were entitled under \u00a7 11 (a) to reimbursement of their actual costs, we have already noted that the statutory scheme distinguishes between actual and reasonable costs, and only requires the Secretary to reimburse reasonable costs. To the extent that it rests on more traditional grounds of bad faith or unfair dealing, it also must fail because, where the Holyoke plaintiffs agreed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the contract to accept the rates of payment in their RFA, the Secretary cannot be found to have acted in bad faith or to have dealt unfairly by failing to provide reimbursement at higher rates. \u201c[T]he implied covenant [of good faith and fair dealing] does not create rights or duties beyond those the parties agreed to when they entered into the contract.\u201d <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Herb Chambers I-95, Inc., </em>458 Mass. 674, 680 (2011), and cases cited. The judge did not err in denying the claims of breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">4. <em>Preemption under the supremacy clause. </em>Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A) (Supp. IV 2010) of the Federal Medicaid Act (\u00a7 1396a[a][30][a]), a State Medicaid plan, such as MassHealth, must \u201cprovide such methods and procedures relating to . . . the payment[] for care and services available under the plan ... as may be necessary ... to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.\u201d The hospital plaintiffs allege that the Secretary\u2019s \u201cimproper rate-setting process\u201d and her reduction in payments \u201cbased solely on the Commonwealth\u2019s budgetary concerns\u201d were contrary to the requirements of \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A) because the Secretary did not consider whether the payments were \u201cconsistent with efficiency, economy, quality of care, and access to care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The hospital plaintiffs concede that, under Federal law, providers do not have a private right of action under \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A). See <em>Long Term Care Pharmacy Alliance </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>362 F.3d 50, 56-57, 59 (1st Cir. 2004) (\u201cnothing in [\u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A)] expressly provides that those who furnish Medicaid services have any enforcement rights or, indeed, have any specific rights to procedural (e.g., notice and comment) or substantive (e.g., just and reasonable rates) protections\u201d; \u201cif [providers] think that state reimbursement is inadequate \u2014 and cannot persuade the Secretary [of the United States Department of Health and Human Services] to act \u2014 they must vote with their feet\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The hospital plaintiffs attempt to sidestep this obstacle by claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>ing that the Secretary\u2019s rate setting process and rate payments \u201care preempted under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d We conclude that, where the plaintiffs have no private right of action directly to claim a violation of \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A), they cannot accomplish the same result by claiming a violation of the supremacy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u201cThe purpose of the Supremacy Clause is . . .to ensure that, in a conflict with state law, whatever Congress says goes.\u201d <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Independent Living Ctr. of S. Cal., Inc., </em>132 S. Ct. 1204, 1212 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) <em>(Douglas). </em>The supremacy clause is \u201c \u2018not a source of any federal rights;\u2019 rather, it \u2018 \u201csecure[s]\u201d federal rights by according them priority whenever they come in conflict with state law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>498 U.S. 439, 450 (1991), quoting <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Houston Welfare Rights Org., </em>441 U.S. 600, 613 (1979). The plaintiffs, however, essentially attempt to make the supremacy clause a source of Federal rights by claiming that it provides a private right of action that is not available under \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A).

We recognize that, where a property owner is legally compelled to engage in a price-regulated activity, the inadequacy of the regulated price may give rise to a constitutional claim of a regulatory taking. See <em>Bluefield Water Works &amp; Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of W.

Utils., </em>368 Mass. 780, 789 (1975) (\u201cUnder the Federal and State Constitutions, the company is entitled to earn a fair and reasonable return on its investment\u201d). But \u201cwhere a service provider voluntarily participates in a price-regulated program or activity, there is no legal compulsion to provide service and thus there can be no taking.\u201d <em>Garelick </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>987 F.2d 913, 916 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 821 (1993) <em>(Garelick), </em>and cases cited. See <em>Franklin Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>575 F.3d 121, 129 (1st Cir. 2009). A hospital\u2019s participation in the MassHealth program is voluntary in that no hospital is required to execute the contract set forth in the RFA and participate in MassHealth. See G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 36 (\u201cParticipation in the medical assistance programs established under this chapter shall be limited to providers of services who . . . indicate their intention to the division to so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>participate\u201d); <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>403 Mass. 648, 650 (1988) (\u201cparticipation by health care providers in Medicaid is voluntary\u201d under Federal and State law).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The hospital plaintiffs argue that their participation in MassHealth was voluntary in theory but not in reality. BMC claims that it is compelled by a \u201cstatutory mandate\u201d to participate in MassHealth, because the enabling statute that authorized its creation from the merger of Boston City Hospital and Boston University Medical Center Hospital declared that \u201cthe mission of the new medical center . . . shall be to consistently provide excellent and accessible health care services to all in need of care, regardless of status or ability to pay.\u201d St. 1995, c. 147, \u00a7 1 <em>(b). </em>The Holyoke plaintiffs similarly claim that, as nonprofit, tax-exempt public charities, they are \u201clegally required to provide health care services to all in need of care, regardless of status or ability to pay.\u201d All the hospital plaintiffs argue that they would be unable to provide medical care to those in need without participating in MassHealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We acknowledge that it would be difficult, perhaps impossible, for these disproportionate share hospitals to survive financially if they were to refuse to participate in MassHealth, and that such a refusal would burden their MassHealth patients who would have to go elsewhere to seek nonemergency care.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A painful choice, however, is nonetheless a choice; a disproportionate share hospital retains the option, difficult as it may be, to refuse to participate in MassHealth, even if doing so may put its continued existence as a financially viable hospital at risk and endanger the quality of health care available to its MassHealth patients. As a matter of law, despite the \u201cbusiness realities\u201d and \u201cthe strong financial inducement to participate\u201d in MassHealth, a hospital\u2019s decision to participate is voluntary and its voluntariness deprives the hospital of any claim of a regulatory taking. <em>Minnesota Ass\u2019n of Health Care Facilities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Minnesota Dep\u2019t of Pub.

See St. 2006, c. 58 (\u201cAn Act providing access to affordable, quality, accountable Health Care\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>[Act]). Under \u00a7 122 of the Act, the Secretary was required in fiscal years 2007, 2008, and 2009 to reimburse BMC and hospitals operated by the Cambridge public health commission \u201cat levels consistent with their net supplemental payments of $287,000,000 in fiscal year 2006.\u201d In addition, \u00a7 122 provided, \u201cFor fiscal year 2009, subject to appropriation, the [Secretary] shall hold harmless said amount of $287,000,000 in funding by allocating $160,000,000 in net supplemental payments from the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund and by increasing actuarially sound rates to the maximum extent allowable and eligible for financial participation, including the balance from other financing mechanisms . . . .\u201d BMC and the Health Plan were entitled to two-thirds of the $287 million, or approximately $191.3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The Legislature authorized a lump-sum payment of $106.7 million to BMC, and there is no dispute that the Secretary made this payment in fiscal year 2009. The health Plan alleges that, under \u00a7 122, the Secretary was required to pay the remaining $84.6 million by increasing \u201cto the maximum extent allowable\u201d the monthly amount that the Secretary paid for each MassHealth member who was enrolled in its managed care health organization, known as the monthly \u201ccapitation rate.\u201d Instead, the Secretary reduced the capitation rates she had initially set, which were already allegedly inadequate because those rates were based on data from calendar years 2005 and 2006, and held the capitation rates at the levels established for fiscal year 2008. On November 10, 2008, the Health Plan executed the Secretary\u2019s amendment to its managed care organization contract with the reduced capitation rates, albeit under a reservation of rights, \u201cbecause failure to do so would have resulted in the [Secretary\u2019s] immediate transfer of enrollees out of [the Health Plan].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">2. <em>Violation of St. 2006, c. 58, \u00a7 122. </em>The Health Plan alleges that the Secretary disregarded the requirement in \u00a7 122 to increase the capitation rate in fiscal year 2009 \u201cto the maximum extent allowable\u201d in order to generate the $84.6 million balance that it was due. The Secretary argues that, under \u00a7 122, she need not have increased the capitation rate \u201cto the maximum extent allowable\u201d so long as the total funding level, consisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>of the total capitation payment, the fixed supplemental payment of $106.7 million to the BMC, and any additional payments from \u201cother financing mechanisms,\u201d was at least equal to what was paid to the BMC in 2006, which she contends it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We conclude, as did the judge below, that the Health Plan\u2019s claims under \u00a7 122 of the Act cannot prevail for the same reasons that the plaintiff hospitals cannot prevail on their claims under G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 11: the Legislature did not provide a private right of action to enforce the \u201chold harmless\u201d provisions of \u00a7 122, or waive sovereign immunity, and waiver is not a \u201cnecessary implication\u201d of this statutory duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\"><em>Claims applicable to all plaintiffs. </em>We now turn to claims asserted by all the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">1. <em>Quantum meruit. </em>The plaintiffs allege that they may recover for services provided to MassHealth patients on a theory of quantum meruit. The plaintiffs, however, provided these services pursuant to contracts entered into with the Secretary, at rates set under those contracts. A plaintiff is not entitled to recovery on a theory of quantum meruit where there is a valid contract that defines the obligations of the parties. See <em>York </em>v. <em>Zurich Scudder Invs., Inc., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 610, 620 (2006); Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 2 (2011) (\u201cA valid contract defines the obligations of the parties as to matters within its scope, displacing to that extent any inquiry into unjust enrichment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The BMC claims that it never entered into a contract for 2009 because it refused to sign the December amendment to the rate year 2009 REA that established the new payment rates. This contention is incorrect as a matter of law. The BMC had in 1998 executed a \u201cprovider agreement\u201d with the Department of Public Welfare (department) that \u201ccontinue[d] in effect until terminated by either party\u201d where the department would \u201creimburse the Provider at rates . . . contained in the applicable [department fee schedules.\u201d The BMC does not allege that it terminated that provider agreement. After being given full notice of the terms of the proposed contract in the rate year 2009 REA, including notice of the rates it would receive under the amended contract, BMC did not terminate the agreement but instead continued to provide services with knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>payment rates. There is no dispute that the Secretary exercised her discretion under the contract to \u201ccontinue [BMC]\u2019s participation,\u201d at the rates set forth in the RFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The Holyoke plaintiffs argue that they had no legally valid rate year 2009 contract with the Secretary because the payment rates provided in the contract did not equal the financial requirements of providing care to recipients of medical assistance and therefore the contract was illegal and in violation of public policy. Where providers have no private right of action to claim a violation of G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 11 <em>(a), </em>or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30), we will not provide them with this \u201cback door\u201d means of accomplishing the equivalent through a quantum meruit claim that would provide judicial review of the reasonableness of the Secretary\u2019s rates for disproportionate share hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The Health Plan claims that its contract is void because it was entered into and performed under duress. We note at the outset that this argument is incorrect in that economic duress renders a contract voidable, not void. See <em>Cabot Corp. </em>v. <em>AVX Corp., </em>448 Mass. 629, 637 (2007) <em>(Cabot), </em>and cases cited. We treat the Health Plan\u2019s claim as seeking to void retroactively its allegedly voidable contract with the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">When the Health Plan executed the agreement on November 10, 2008, with the Secretary that lowered its capitation rate, it attached a document that it called a \u201creservation of rights\u201d that declared that the Health Plan \u201csigns the Amendment <em>under </em>duress\u201d (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cThe assertion of duress must be proved by evidence that the duress resulted from defendant\u2019s wrongful and oppressive conduct and not by plaintiff\u2019s necessities.\u201d <em>Cabot, supra </em>at 638, quoting <em>International Underwater Contrs., Inc. </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 340, 342 (1979). All that the Secretary is alleged to have done here was to set unreasonably low capitation rates, and inform the Health Plan that it was free to reject these rates and not renew its managed care operator contract. This conduct falls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>well short of the requisite \u201cwrongful and oppressive conduct\u201d intended to coerce the Health Plan to accept the contract. See <em>Cabot, supra </em>at 639 (\u201cAbsent any legally cognizable restraint, [a party is] free to drive whatever bargain the market would bear\u201d). The judge did not err in denying the quantum meruit claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">2. <em>Certiorari, mandamus, and declaratory judgment. </em>The plaintiffs sought certiorari review of the Secretary\u2019s actions under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cCertiorari is a limited procedure which may be used to correct substantial errors of law committed by a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal (but not administrative, political, or legislative decisions).\u201d <em>St. Botolph Citizens Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Auth., </em>429 Mass. 1, 7 (1999). \u201cIf the proceeding or hearing involves \u2018unsworn statements by interested persons advocating or disapproving the proposed new policy\u2019 rather than \u2018sworn testimony by witnesses subject to cross-examination in a hearing preceded by specific charges,\u2019 the hearing is more likely to be legislative or regulatory, rather than quasi-judicial, in nature.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Hudson </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>448 Mass. 565, 576 (2007). The judge was correct to deny this review where the Secretary was exercising her regulatory power granted by the statute, and the rate setting process bore none of the indicia of judicial or quasi judicial decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The plaintiffs similarly also sought relief in the nature of mandamus, pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cA complaint in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>nature of mandamus is \u2018a call to a government official to perform a clear cut duty,\u2019 and the remedy is limited to requiring action on the part of the government official.\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Boston Div. of the Hous. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>448 Mass. 57, 59-60 (2006), quoting <em>Doe </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Plymouth Dist., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 671, 675 (1991). Here, as the motion judge found in denying the mandamus claim, the Secretary\u2019s statutory duty is to set rates of reimbursement for services provided under MassHealth and to enter into contracts with providers who agree to accept the rates set. The Secretary did exactly that. \u201cMandamus is not an appropriate remedy to obtain a review of the decision of public officers who have acted and to command them to act in a new and different manner.\u201d <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>352 Mass. 478, 480 (1967). See <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Medford, </em>425 Mass. 130, 134 (1997), quoting <em>Reading </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>362 Mass. 266, 269 (1972) (\u201cmandamus is a remedy for [administrative] inaction and [is] not available where action has already been taken\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The plaintiffs also sought, under G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1, a judgment declaring that the Secretary\u2019s reimbursement rates and capitation rates, and her methodology for determining these rates, are unreasonable, and in violation of G. L. c. 118G, \u00a7 11 (a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30); and St. 2006, c. 58, \u00a7 122.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Where a provider has a private right of action to challenge the Secretary\u2019s rate determination, a claim for declaratory judgment would be appropriate if the Secretary had promulgated regulations and the plaintiffs were challenging the validity of those regulations, claiming them to be illegal, arbitrary, or capricious. See <em>Salisbury Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation Ctr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Division of Admin. Law Appeals, </em>448 Mass. 365, 371 (2007), and cases cited. But here the Legislature has declined to give the plaintiff providers any private right of action and what is at issue is the reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>of the payment rates established by the Secretary and the methodology used to calculate those rates, not the validity of any regulation. If the plaintiffs could seek declaratory judgment here, they would for all practical purposes have a private right of action to challenge the reasonableness of payment rates. A declaratory judgment cannot be used to circumvent a legislative judgment denying a provider the opportunity to seek administrative or judicial review of the reasonableness of payment rates. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Mansour, </em>474 U.S. 64, 73 (1985) (declaratory judgment not available where result \u201cwould be a partial \u2018end run\u2019 \u201d around prohibition in Eleventh Amendment to United States Constitution).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u201c[T]he superior court . . . may on appropriate proceedings make binding declarations of right, duty, status and other legal relations sought thereby, either before or after a breach or violation thereof has occurred in any case in which an actual controversy has arisen and is specifically set forth in the pleadings and whether any consequential judgment or relief is or could be claimed at law or in equity or not. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the motion judge\u2019s allowance of the Secretary\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the claims brought by BMC and the Health Plan, and of the motion to dismiss as to the claims brought by the Holyoke plaintiffs. We honor the legislative judgment that the plaintiffs\u2019 redress for claims that the Secretary committed a breach of her statutory duties in calculating the reimbursement and capitation rates paid for the provision of medical care to MassHealth patients rests in the political arena, not in the courts.

As noted in <em>Doe </em>[v. <em>HCA Health Servs. of Term., Inc., </em>46 S.W.3d 191, 194 (Tenn. 2001)], hospitals commonly use an internal document called a \u2018charge master.\u2019 It lists the hospital\u2019s official billing charges for thousands of goods and services. Charge masters are usually kept confidential, even from most of the hospital\u2019s employees, and typically are adjusted from week to week. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201c[A] charge master [is] not necessarily based on any analysis of the costs of providing various goods and services.

For instance, internal cost-shifting is widespread, in which prices for some common items are set high, to generate extra revenue to cover some of the costliest goods and services. For this and other reasons, determining the actual cost of providing a given service will ordinarily require considerable resources to track down its myriad sub-costs. There is little incentive to undertake such an effort, given that payors reimburse care according to actual or negotiated charges, not hospitals\u2019 actual costs. The net result is little, if any, correlation between a charge master price and the price that the same service or product might have if purchased in a direct, supply- and-demand economy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Morreim, High-Deductible Heath Plans: New Twists on Old Challenges from Tort and Contract, 59 Vand.
