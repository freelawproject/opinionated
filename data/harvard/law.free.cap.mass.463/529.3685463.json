L. c. 274, \u00a7 2 (\u00a7 2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on an indictment alleging that he, \u201cbefore the said felony was committed, did incite, procure, aid, counsel, hire or command that\u201d four named men murder George R. Carpenter. Although the evidence at trial was sufficient to establish that the defendant had participated in the murderous assault, we reversed his conviction in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rod</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>riguez, </em>457 Mass. 461, 482-488 (2010) (Rodriguez), because the evidence did not establish that he had done any act before the assault to counsel, hire, or otherwise procure it.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Thereafter, the Commonwealth sought and the grand jury returned an indictment charging the defendant with murder for his involvement in the killing. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1. The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that, because \u201cmurder is a form or a \u2018species\u2019 of lesser included offense to accessory before the fact to murder,\u201d a second prosecution was barred by double jeopardy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A judge (who was not the trial judge) denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, the defendant sought relief from this order from a single justice of the county court, who reserved and reported the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\u201c(1) [Whether] where the evidence is insufficient to warrant a finding of guilt on an indictment charging a defendant with being an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree, see G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 [2], and the defendant\u2019s conviction was vacated,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] a subsequent prosecution for murder in the first degree under that statute would violate the prohibition against double jeopardy; and (2) [Whether] in the circumstances of this case, given the erroneous jury instructions and the erroneously admitted evidence, prosecution of this defendant for murder in the first degree is barred on grounds of double jeopardy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">We answer both questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Evidence at trial. </em>We summarize the facts from the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 463-466. In the early morning hours of February 16, 2001, the victim was drinking and socializing with friends at the home of Donna Me-deiros, the defendant\u2019s mother. The defendant, his girl friend, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>and three friends, Robert Tirado, Jonathan Torres, and Heather Lawrence, arrived at the home shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">At some point, an argument ensued between the victim, the defendant, and Tirado. The confrontation between the victim and Tirado continued down the street from Medeiros\u2019s home, where Tirado slashed the tire of the victim\u2019s automobile as the victim attempted to leave the gathering. The violence escalated when the defendant, Torres, and three more of the defendant\u2019s friends, Lionel Rodriguez, Orlando Badillo, and Dennis Smith, arrived at the scene. With the exception of Torres, Tirado and these men attacked the victim. One man struck the victim with a tire iron. The defendant kicked him twice and attempted to throw a trash barrel on him. The victim was rendered unconscious by the beating, and he died later that day as a result of acute massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage due to blunt force trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">2. <em>Prior proceedings. </em>For his involvement in the killing, the defendant was indicted as an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree and was tried with Rodriguez, who had been indicted for murder in the first degree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At trial, the Commonwealth proceeded on the theory that the defendant did \u201caid\u201d Tirado, Badillo, Smith, and Rodriguez in committing the murder, the prosecutor having conceded that there was no evidence the defendant had counselled, hired, or otherwise procured the felony. The judge, concluding that \u201c[accessory before the fact to felony is largely identical to the joint venture doctrine,\u201d accepted this theory. Consequently, at the close of evidence, he told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">\u201cTo prove the defendant guilty of being an accessory before the fact to murder, the Commonwealth must prove the following three things beyond a reasonable doubt. Element number one, that someone other than the defendant committed a felony; namely, murder. Element number two, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>that [the defendant] aided in the commission of the felony. And element number three, that [the defendant] had knowledge that another intended to commit the crime and shared the mental state required for the commission of the particular felony being questioned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">With regard to the second element, the judge told the jury that \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove that [the defendant] did assist in the commission of the felony,\u201d meaning that the defendant \u201cintentionally participated in some meaningful and significant way by agreeing to stand by, at or near the scene, to render aid, assistance, or encouragement if such became necessary.\u201d Aside from a brief statement at the start of the instruction, the judge did not elaborate on the temporal element inherent in the offense of being an accessory <em>before </em>the fact to murder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury found the defendant guilty on the indictment of being an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree on a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We reviewed the defendant\u2019s conviction in <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 482-487, and concluded that the language of the indictment, although prescribed by statute, see G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> improperly conflated the offense of being an accessory before the fact to a felony with that of aiding and abetting a felony, an offense also included within \u00a7 2 (see note 1, <em>supra). Rodriguez, supra </em>at 482-485. That is, we construed \u00a7 2 as articulating two \u201cseparate and distinct offenses\u201d \u2014 aiding a felony and being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>an accessory before the fact to a felony<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 and faulted the Commonwealth for \u201cimproperly defin[ing] the offense on which [the defendant] was tried.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 486. We noted that, although this error in the wording of the indictment \u201cmay have been excusable on account of adherence to the statutory form . . . , the judge [also] submitted the case to the jury with improper instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-487. As detailed above, the judge had instructed the jury that they could convict the defendant \u201cas an accessory before the fact if he \u2018aided in the commission of the murder of [the victim].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487. That instruction did not comport with the form of the indictment, which alleged that the defendant acted <em>before </em>the commission of the felony, even though it tracked the evidence at trial, which had established his \u201cactive participation in, and presence during, the commission of the felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, we determined that the defendant\u2019s conviction of being an accessory before the fact to murder could not stand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendant argues, as he did before the motion judge, that the indictment that charges him with murder in the first degree<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> violates the prohibition against double jeopardy. Specifically, he contends that murder is akin to a lesser included offense of accessory before the fact to murder<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and, therefore, the new proceeding against him runs afoul of the familiar maxim that \u201ca prosecution for a greater offense precludes subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>prosecution for all its lesser included crimes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, </em>428 Mass. 725, 748 (1999), quoting <em>Costarelli </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. 677, 683 (1978). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">At its core, the prohibition against double jeopardy, which flows from the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as the statutory and common law of Massachusetts, provides that \u201ca person cannot twice be put in jeopardy for the same offence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>342 Mass. 144, 145 (1961), and cases cited. See <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794 (1969) (applying Federal constitutional guarantees against double jeopardy to States through Fourteenth Amendment to United States Constitution); <em>Choy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>456 Mass. 146, 147 n.2, cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 425 (2010); G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 7. This principle, however, \u201cis not one rule but several, each applying to a different situation; and each . . . marooned in a sea of exceptions.\u201d Note, Twice in Jeopardy, 75 Yale L.J. 262, 263 (1965). Thus, the bar protects against three specific evils \u2022\u2014 \u201ca second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and multiple punishments for the same offense,\u201d <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 278, 283 (1993), citing <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, <em>717 </em>(1969) \u2014 while tolerating certain conduct from the State. See, e.g., <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante </em>1, 3 (2012), quoting <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 505 (1978), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steward, </em>396 Mass. 76, 78 (1995) (\u201cState and Federal double jeopardy protections bar, \u2018as a general rule,\u2019 retrial of a defendant whose initial trial ends over his objection and without a conviction. . . . However, an exception to the general rule applies where a mistrial is declared as a matter of \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 \u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">From this web of jurisprudence, the defendant has plucked a single strand \u2014 that pertaining to greater and lesser included offenses. He recites the governing principle accurately (the State generally <em>is </em>prohibited from successive prosecutions for a greater and lesser offense, see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 168-169 [1977]; <em>Edge </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>451 Mass. 74, 75-76 [2008]), and applies it creatively. But his presentation is ultimately unpersuasive. Murder, prosecuted on a theory of aiding and abetting, is not a lesser included offense of accessory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>before the fact to murder. Rather, the two are different species of the same crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">To elucidate this point, we revisit the <em>Rodriguez </em>case, where we concluded that the actions of one who \u201caids\u201d are different from the actions of \u201caccessories before the fact,\u201d and that the different acts constitute \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 484-486 &amp; n.31. Although grounded in the language and structure of the statute, this construction of \u00a7 2 goes too far, and is an outlier among our recent decisions regarding the scope of accomplice (or joint venture) liability. That is, although we drove a theoretical wedge between two forms of accomplice liability in Rodriguez, we have renounced elsewhere such \u201cfalse distinction[s]\u201d that long complicated the doctrine, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. 449, 464 (2009) <em>(Zanetti), </em>and put forth instead a practical framework grounded in its \u201cessential elements\u201d of knowing participation and shared criminal intent. <em>Id. </em>at 467. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>424 Mass. 853, 856-857 (1997) <em>(Ortiz). </em>We affirm these prior holdings, and reconsider the relationship between the charge of murder and that of being an accessory before the fact to murder in light of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We turn to our decision in <em>Ortiz, </em>where we reviewed the common-law origins of accomplice liability, as well as the statutory interventions brought by \u00a7 2 and its counterpart, G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 3 (\u00a7 3).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We explained that, at common law, the parties to a felony fell into one of four classifications \u2014 principals in the first or second degree, and accessories before and after the fact. <em>Ortiz, supra. </em>These classifications, however, proved untenable, as they \u201cled to numerous procedural difficulties that tended to shield an accessory before the fact from punishment even though the accessory\u2019s active criminal involvement in the felony was clearly established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 857 &amp; n.5. To remedy these infirmities, the Legislature enacted \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, which, respectively, made \u201ca joint participant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the commission of a felony liable to the same extent as the principal felon\u201d and removed certain jurisdictional impediments to prosecuting an accessory without the principal. <em>Ortiz, supra </em>at 857, 858 &amp; n.6. Although both provisions \u201ccontinue[d] to use the term \u2018before the fact,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 857, the phrase now appears to be a vestige of history, as the statutory changes \u201cabrogate[d] the distinction between principals and accessories before the fact.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The import of this statement comes into sharper focus when viewed alongside our 2009 decision in the <em>Zanetti </em>case. There, we reformulated the jury instructions governing accomplice liability, formally dispensing with the vocabulary of \u201cjoint venture\u201d (which adhered to the classifications described above) in favor of the language of \u201caiding and abetting\u201d (which focused on the essence of the joint venture allegation, knowing participation in the criminal offense). <em>Id. </em>at 467-468. As a result, we crafted a statement of law that hewed more closely to the framework described in the <em>Ortiz </em>case: whether cast as a principal or accessory in the past, a defendant may be held liable for a crime if \u201cthe Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged, alone or with others, with the intent required for that offense.\u201d <em>Zanetti, supra </em>at 468. Drawing from the substantive law of accomplice liability, we further clarified the scope of this intentional participation in \u201c[a]n appropriate jury instruction\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">\u201cSuch participation may take any of several forms. It may take the form of personally committing the acts that constitute the crime, or of aiding or assisting another in those acts. It may take the form of asking or encouraging another person to commit the crime, or helping to plan the commission of the crime. Alternatively, it may take the form of agreeing to stand by at, or near, the scene of the crime to act as a lookout, or to provide aid or assistance in committing the crime, or in escaping, if such help becomes necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 470 (Appendix). Thus, as this instruction recognizes, with \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 in place, a wide range of conduct underlying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>person\u2019s liability for a criminal offense, including that which had historically been described as accessory before the fact to a felony or aiding and abetting a felony, plainly falls under the rubric of accomplice liability, and, consequently, may be charged as the substantive offense.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Moure, 428 Mass. 313, 316-318 (1998) (discussing prosecutor\u2019s decision to proceed against defendant as accessory before fact to murder under \u00a7 2 rather than directly on substantive felony under \u00a7 3 of statute). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caramanica, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 376, 381 (2000) (noting that \u201cstatutory accessory crimes [i.e., \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3] ... are often available to prosecutors, but apparently rarely used as a basis for indictment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">It is this last point that controls the case before us. Whether the defendant engages in conduct before the commission of the victim\u2019s murder to ensure its accomplishment, aids in its commission by others, or commits the murderous assault himself, he is liable for murder and, if convicted, will be so punished. We cannot say, then, that each is a wholly independent theory of criminal liability. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>440 Mass. 281, 290 (2003), overruled on other grounds, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>461 Mass. 616, 633-634 (2012) (\u201cWhile we sometimes use the term \u2018theory\u2019 of principal liability or \u2018theory\u2019 of joint venture, those are not alternate, differing \u2018theories\u2019 of the crime that are to be subjected to the specific unanimity and verdict slip requirements . . .\u201d). Rather, we recognize the interrelationship among them, and conceptualize them as different routes to the same end: criminal liability as a knowing participant in a crime (here, murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">With this framework in mind, we return to the potential double jeopardy implications of the second indictment brought against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the defendant. As noted above, the prohibition against double jeopardy generally forbids a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction or acquittal. See <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Com</em>monwealth, 415 Mass. 278, 283 (1993), citing <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, <em>717 </em>(1969). It does not, however, necessarily bar a retrial where a conviction has been set aside on appeal. See <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>345 Mass. 89, 91 (1962), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 839 (1963), and cases cited (\u201cIt has been held repeatedly by this court and by the Supreme Court of the United States that a defendant can be tried a second time for an offence when his prior conviction for that offence has been set aside on his appeal\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>163 U.S. 662, 672 (1896) (\u201ca defendant, who procures a judgment against him upon an indictment to be set aside, may be tried anew upon the same indictment, or upon another indictment, for the same offence on which he had been convicted\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">This \u201cexception\u201d to the double jeopardy bar is not without its own exceptions. The State, for example, generally cannot retry a defendant \u201cwhen an appellate court overturns a conviction because of insufficient evidence.\u201d K.B. Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 24.57, at 393 (3d ed. 2007). But, it may do so where other theories (supported by evidence at a first trial) would support a defendant\u2019s conviction in the second, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fickett, </em>403 Mass. 194, 199 n.4 (1988), or where a conviction is reversed on appeal because of a variance between the indictment and the proof established at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ohanian, </em>373 Mass. 839, 844 (1977), citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 8 (noting that, although judgments were reversed, verdicts were set aside, and indictments were dismissed due to fatal variance, such disposition did \u201cnot bar conviction for the same crimes on new indictments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We are of the view that the present case falls within the boundaries of these latter two categories. \u201cIn general, a crime must be proved as charged and must be charged as proved.\u201d K.B. Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 15.40, at 872. Here, however, the indictment specifically charged the defendant with engaging in conduct <em>\u201cbefore </em>the said [murder] was committed\u201d (emphasis added), while the proof at trial established that he joined in the attack by kicking the victim, and the judge\u2019s instructions directed the jury to convict the defendant if they found that he had \u201cintentionally participated\u201d in the murderous assault. Although the proof of liability at trial, and the jury instructions that accompanied it, would have sufficed if the defendant had been indicted simply for the murder itself, they were at variance with the wording of the indictment. Although we did not employ this term specifically, we essentially concluded in <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 487, that such a variance was fatal: the defendant was convicted of a crime for which he had not been indicted. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ohanian, supra </em>at 843; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 95, 101-102 (2010). Our ruling on the defendant\u2019s appeal in the <em>Rodriguez </em>case, then, did not erect a double jeopardy bar to subsequent prosecution for the crime proved at the first trial, and the Commonwealth is entitled to try him again under an appropriate charging instrument. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ball, supra; Hicks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Although the preceding discussion suffices to address the first reported question, we briefly touch on the second. The single justice asks whether, \u201cin the circumstances of this case, given the erroneous jury instructions and the erroneously admitted evidence [and testimony of the medical examiner], prosecution of this defendant for murder in the first degree is barred on grounds of double jeopardy.\u201d The defendant argues that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>framing the question as she does, the single justice flags for our consideration the possibility that Massachusetts common and statutory law may provide greater double jeopardy protections than does the Federal Constitution. Although we may have intimated as much on select occasions, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vick, </em>454 Mass. 418, 433-435 (2009), we never have \u201cintended to erode . . . our well-established and historic scheme for analyzing double jeopardy principles,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niels N., </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 689, 710 (2009) (Cypher, J., dissenting in part), nor do we find cause to depart from them now. As detailed above, we reversed the defendant\u2019s first conviction because he was tried and convicted of a crime for which he was not charged. The subsequent indictment, then, does not constitute harassment by way of \u201cmultiple and successive prosecutions,\u201d compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallarelli, </em>392 Mass. 573, 574 (1977), nor does it amount to an overzealous attempt to obtain \u201ctactical advantage\u201d over the defendant. <em>Glawson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth (No. 1), </em>445 Mass. 1019, 1021 (2005). Rather, it serves as an attempt by the Commonwealth to repeat its initial and successful case under an appropriate charging instrument, an outcome that the guarantees against double jeopardy surely tolerate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fickett, supra. </em>See also G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons discussed, we answer both of the reported questions in the negative. The matter is remanded to the single justice for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-15\">General Laws c. 274, \u00a7 2, provides: \u201cWhoever aids in the commission of a felony, or is accessory thereto before the fact by counselling, hiring or otherwise procuring such felony to be committed, shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of the principal felon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-10\">The defendant also alleged that the successive and multiple prosecutions constituted harassment by the Commonwealth because the original charge of accessory before the fact was sought to eliminate the possibility that he would receive a lesser manslaughter verdict on a murder indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-11\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>457 Mass. 461, 487-488 &amp; n.34 (2010) <em>(Rodriguez), </em>we reversed, rather than vacated, the defendant\u2019s conviction because he could not be retried as an accessory before the fact.

The cases were paired for trial: \u201cTirado and Torres were tried first; Tirado was convicted of murder in the second degree, and Torres was acquitted. After being tried together, both Badillo and Smith were convicted of murder in the second degree.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The judge told the jury: \u201cThe phrase \u2018before the fact\u2019 refers to time.

On appeal, we reduced this conviction to murder in the second degree because, although other properly admitted evidence established that Rodriguez had committed an unlawful killing, certain medical evidence and testimony pertinent to the theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty was erroneously admitted. <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 475-482.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b552-11\">General Laws c. 277, \u00a7 79, provides in relevant part that the annexed form of an indictment alleging \u201cthat A.B., before the said felony was committed, did incite, procure, aid, counsel, hire or command the said (principal) the said felony to do and commit,\u201d shall be \u201csufficient\u201d to allege the crime of accessory before the fact. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daughtry, </em>417 Mass. 136, 141-142 n.3 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Under this rubric, the \u201caiding\u201d prong (colloquially, \u201caiding and abetting\u201d) captures conduct that constitutes actual assistance in the commission of the felony, and requires some degree of knowing participation. <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 484. In contrast, the \u201caccessory\u201d prong encompasses participation in an act \u201cthat led up to or in some way contributed to the occurrence of the felony,\u201d but that occurred prior to the commission of the felony (i.e., \u201ccounselling, hiring or otherwise procuring\u201d it). <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\">This indictment alleges that the defendant, \u201con or about February 16, 2001 . . . did assault and beat George Carpenter with intent to murder him, and by such assault and beating did kill and murder the said George Carpenter.\u201d Although this indictment does not state explicitly that the Commonwealth will proceed on an aiding and abetting theory against the defendant, statements made in the Commonwealth\u2019s brief, as well as the approach adopted and the evidence presented in the first trial, plainly support the conclusion that it will.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The defendant reaches this conclusion by arguing that, under the statutory scheme, \u201ceveryone guilty as an accessory before the fact is also guilty of the felony, but not vice versa .... Put another way . . . murder is \u2018necessarily accomplished\u2019 on commission of accessory before the fact to murder.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">General Laws c. 274, \u00a7 3, provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever counsels, hires or otherwise procures a felony to be committed may be indicted and convicted as an accessory before the fact, either with the principal felon or after his conviction; or may be indicted and convicted of the substantive felony, whether the principal felon has or has not been convicted, or is or is not amenable to justice; and in the last mentioned case may be punished in the same manner as if convicted of being an accessory before the fact. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\">This outcome is not surprising, as both prongs of G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2, had long been viewed as a unified theory of joint venture liability. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>424 Mass. 853, 856 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 470, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979) (\u201cThe theory underlying joint enterprise is that one who aids, commands, counsels, or encourages commission of a crime while sharing with the principal the mental state required for the crime is guilty as a principal\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. 449, 468 (2009) (shift to language of aiding and abetting \u201cdoes not enlarge or diminish the scope of existing joint venture liability\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The United States Supreme Court has explained the origins of this rule succinctly: \u201cAt common law a convicted person could not obtain a new trial by appeal except in certain narrow instances. As this harsh rule was discarded courts and legislatures provided that if a defendant obtained the reversal of a conviction by his own appeal he could be tried again for the same offense. Most courts regarded the new trial as a second jeopardy but justified this on the ground that the appellant had \u2018waived\u2019 his plea of former jeopardy by asking that the conviction be set aside. Other courts viewed the second trial as continuing the same jeopardy which had attached at the first trial by reasoning that jeopardy did not come to an end until the accused was acquitted or his conviction became final. But whatever the rationalization, this Court has also held that a defendant can be tried a second time for an offense when his prior conviction for that same offense has been set aside on appeal.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 189 (1957), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>163 U.S. 662 (1896).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\">As G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 3, expressly provides, one charged with accessory before the fact may be \u201cindicted and convicted of the substantive felony,\u201d here, murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
