The defendant alleges error in the judge\u2019s allowance of the peremptory challenge of an African-American juror; the admission of certain evidence concerning his juvenile record; portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument; and the denial of his request for an instruction on defense of another. He asserts error also in the denial of his motion for a new trial, without an evidentiary hearing, in which he maintained that he had received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Last, the defendant asks that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to grant him a new trial or to reduce the degree of guilt of the murder conviction. For the following reasons, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions and decline to grant him a new trial or to reduce the verdict to a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>Background. </em>Based on the evidence at trial, the jury could have found the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Essaid was shot on December 14, 2002, two weeks after he and several of his friends were involved in an altercation with the defendant and his friends. On December 1, the defendant and two of his friends, Andrew and Andre Komegay, had had a confrontation with Essaid, Obbada, and Lebdoui, who claimed that the Komegays had stolen their marijuana. The men were at Downtown Crossing in Boston when the Kornegays and the other three began arguing; the defendant ran over and intervened after he concluded that it was \u201cgetting heavy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">1. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s case. </em>Obbada was the Commonwealth\u2019s key witness to the events surrounding the shooting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At approximately 6 p.m. as the defendant and his then girl friend, Victoria Fernandes, who was pregnant, were leaving a movie theater on Tremont Street in Boston, they saw Essaid, Obbada, and Lebdoui outside the theater.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant told Fernandes to keep walking, which she did. He told the men to \u201c[g]et the fuck out of here,\u201d and the three started to walk up Tremont Street. The defendant followed, giving \u201cthe impression of someone who is looking for a fight.\u201d When he was eight to ten feet from them, the defendant pulled out a nine millimeter Glock pistol (Glock) and fired at Obbada, who hid behind a car; one of the bullets hit his shoe. The defendant then fired at Lebdoui, who ran away, and, finally, the defendant fired several times at Es-said, who was hit by two bullets and fell to the ground. The defendant ran up Tremont Street toward the Park Street subway station. As he was running, his Red Sox baseball cap flew off his head. He turned around and ran back to pick it up, then continued mnning toward Park Street station.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Two female pedestrians on Tremont Street saw a man approach three teen-aged males outside the theater. One of the three said, \u201cDon\u2019t bring that shit to me,\u201d and another said, \u201cNo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>no, no, that\u2019s between you and him.\u201d The women kept walking, and, moments later, heard three \u201cloud pops\u201d; a man ran past them, dropped something, picked it up, and ran on. A male pedestrian also saw a man with a Red Sox hat running toward the Park Street station, coming from the location where a man was lying in the street, a few seconds after the pedestrian heard gunshots.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">There were no leads in the shooting until February 6, 2003, when the defendant and two others (one was Andre Kornegay) were observed by undercover Boston police officers standing in front of a restaurant, looking up and down the street; Kornegay and the other man walked a slight distance away from the restaurant and apparently engaged in a drug transaction. The surveillance officers were directed to arrest Kornegay and to obtain identification from the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When officers approached the defendant, he ran, narrowly avoiding being hit by a passing automobile, and officers gave chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Several groups of officers from different divisions of the Boston police department were ultimately involved in the chase. Officer Thomas Rose testified that he became involved in the chase and attempted to tackle the defendant, but the defendant evaded him and Rose fell. While Rose was on the ground, the defendant pulled out his gun and pointed it at Rose, then turned and pointed it at Officer Matthew Clark, who had also joined in the chase. Clark pulled out his own firearm and ordered the defendant to drop his weapon; the defendant instead turned and ran. At some point, Officer Steven Sweeney saw the defendant trying to climb over a stockade fence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When the defendant saw the officer, he turned and shot off one round, hitting nothing, then hid under a tarp, and was temporarily lost from the officer\u2019s sight. Officer Richard Kelley noticed a baseball cap on the ground near the tarp, and commented that \u201che\u2019s gotta be somewhere, his hat is right there.\u201d The defendant, who had heard the comment and did not want police to \u201cplug [him] up,\u201d jumped out from under the tarp, holding a gun to his head and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>yelling, \u201cShoot me, shoot me, shoot me, kill me, kill me, kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">As officers surrounded the defendant, all with weapons drawn, the defendant said that he could not go to jail for a long time and that he would kill himself. As Rose was pointing his own weapon at the defendant\u2019s chest, the defendant was shouting, \u201cKill me, shoot me, I can\u2019t go to jail.\u201d Lieutenant Detective Stephen Meade, commander of the Boston police drug control unit and one of the officers who had been conducting the drug surveillance, testified that the defendant, who was very agitated and upset, said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to prison, I don\u2019t want to go to jail, I\u2019m going to kill myself.\u201d Special operations officers were called to the scene. The defendant continued to point the gun at his head, crying and talking on a cellular telephone, saying that he could not serve a long time in jail, while police told him his sentence would not be longer than one year, because it was only a gun possession charge. Officer Martin O\u2019Malley said that it was only a gun charge and the defendant had a good chance of \u201cbeating it.\u201d Kelley said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do any time in jail,\u201d and \u201cHow many of your friends do you know that have gone to jail for illegal possession of a handgun? None.\u201d The defendant said, \u201c[Njone,\u201d then added, \u201c[Ijt\u2019s been used before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Hostage negotiators were called in. The defendant was agitated, banging his head and repeating that he could not go to jail for a long time; when hostage negotiator Sergeant Matthew Kervin said it was only a year for a firearms charge, the defendant responded that he could not \u201cdo a year,\u201d and also told the officer, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d Lieutenant Detective Robert Memer arrived at the scene and replaced Kervin as negotiator. The defendant was talking on his cellular telephone, sobbing and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s over, this is over, this is it,\u201d while continuing to hold the gun to his head. Memer told the defendant to put down the telephone and the defendant said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, my life is over, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d and \u201cI hear them saying on the radio that I shot at a policeman.\u201d The defendant alternated between being extremely agitated and sobbing, then relaxing his hand on the trigger. At one point, approximately ten minutes into the standoff, the defendant said, \u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d removed the gun from his right temple and pointed it in the air, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>then switched to holding it with his left hand and pointing it at his left temple. When the defendant\u2019s father arrived at the scene, the defendant dropped the gun and surrendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">A receipt for the purchase of the Glock in September, 2002, from a pawn shop in Arizona, was retrieved from the defendant during the booking process; the spent cartridge from the round that the defendant had fired near the fence was also recovered. Ballistics investigation showed that spent cartridge casings recovered from the area where Essaid was shot matched the defendant\u2019s Glock, and were fired from the same weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Police then interviewed Obbada, who selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from a photographic array and said that the defendant had shot at him, Essaid, and Lebdoui. The male pedestrian identified the defendant\u2019s photograph as that of the man he had seen running on Tremont Street on the evening of December 14, 2002. Neither of the female pedestrians was able to identify the man she saw approach the three Middle Eastern men moments before the shots were fired.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s case. </em>Fernandes testified that, as she and the defendant left the theater, they saw three men of Middle Eastern descent leaning against a wall. The men said, \u201cWhat up?\u201d as though they knew the defendant and wanted to start \u201ctrouble,\u201d and then followed close behind the couple as they walked towards the Park Street subway station. The defendant told Fernandes to keep walking, and she did so. She heard three gunshots soon thereafter, and saw the defendant run past her toward the subway station. Fernandes boarded the train at Park Street. A few stops later, the defendant joined her in the subway car, and then returned to his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The defendant testified in his own defense. He said that, as they left the theater, he saw Essaid, Obbada, and another man he did not recognize, standing on a comer. Essaid said, \u201cWhat up? Remember me?\u201d and \u201cWhat up, what up with that shit?\u201d Essaid sounded as though he \u201cwanted to come at\u201d the defendant about Andre Komegay\u2019s theft of their marijuana. The men followed them up Tremont Street, within five feet of him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Fernandes, coming closer as he and Fernandes walked faster. Essaid was saying, \u201cCome here, come here,\u201d and the men were speaking to each other in a language the defendant did not understand. The defendant became worried because Fernandes was pregnant and he \u201cdidn\u2019t want her to get hurt if something happened.\u201d He told Fernandes to \u201cgo home or keep walking,\u201d and she kept walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The defendant turned around with his back to Fernandes, and the three surrounded him, about five feet away. After he turned around, he did not see where Fernandes had gone. Essaid continued to repeat, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that shit, now, what\u2019s up with that shit, now.\u201d He saw Obbada holding his waist, reaching into his waist and \u201cthrowing gang signs.\u201d Thinking Obbada was reaching for a gun, the defendant put his hand on his own waist (the Glock was in a holster at his waist), saying \u201cChill, chill. That\u2019s between you and [Andre Komegay].\u201d Essaid kept coming closer, so the defendant pulled out his own weapon; he wanted \u201cto show them that I had a gun.\u201d Seeing the gun, the other man stopped, but Obbada came closer, reaching into his waist. The defendant thought Obbada was about to pull out a weapon, and pulled the slide to chamber a bullet in his Glock. Obbada was arm\u2019s length and reaching for something in his waist area, and Essaid was closer; the defendant fired a warning shot into the ground. Then Essaid, who was at his side, lunged at the defendant, as though Essaid were going to grab his arm; the defendant squeezed the trigger, then turned and ran. He did not know at the time how many shots he fired, \u201c[i]t just happened so quick,\u201d and only found out the next day, through news reports, that someone had been killed. The defendant said he was focused both on Obbada, whom he believed had a weapon, and on his fear that Essaid would grab the Glock from his hand and shoot \u201cmy baby\u2019s mother.\u201d He wanted to make sure Fernandes got away \u201cbefore anything happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The defendant ran toward Park Street, not seeing Fernandes. He knew where Fernandes was going, and, wanting to catch up with her, he went to a closer subway station and got on a Red Line train there.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He found Fernandes at Andrew Station, where they boarded another train in order to get to Ashmont Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The defendant testified also that he was with the Komegays on the night of February 6, 2003, drinking in the restaurant bar. He came out of the bar and was standing outside the restaurant when police approached saying, \u201cYou come here,\u201d and he began to walk away. An officer followed, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t make me chase you,\u201d and then began running toward the defendant, who \u201cjust took off.\u201d The officer tripped and fell. The defendant kept running, then tried to hide. A police cruiser came by, shining its light in his direction, and he started running again. The defendant, who always carried the Glock with him, eventually pulled the Glock out of his pocket and was holding it in his hand, not pointed at anyone, while he was running. The gun went off accidentally, when he landed on his back after he jumped over a fence; the shot went into the air.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The defendant did not shoot at any officers; if he had, he said, \u201cI would be dead right now.\u201d He hid under a tarp, but abandoned his efforts to hide when he heard police radio reports that the suspect had fired at an officer, and he thought that the officer who had seen his hat and was coming closer might have seen him. He put the gun to his head and came out from under the tarp \u201cbefore they could plug me up\u201d; his father, with whom he had been speaking on his cellular telephone, had told him not to throw the gun out from under the tarp, to point the gun toward himself so that police would not shoot, and that his father was on his way there. He did not remember making any statements to the officers except that he could not go to jail; if he said anything else, he did not remember it. The defendant dropped the gun when his father arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Peremptory challenge of African-American juror. </em>The defendant, who is African-American, maintains that a new trial is required because, in a case involving a victim of Middle Eastern descent, the judge allowed the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenge of an African-American juror, after the prosecutor had challenged several previous jurors of color, without making a determination that the prosecutor had a race-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>neutral reason for his challenge. The defendant maintains that the decision to allow this challenge violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to a fair and impartial jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 480, 486-488, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979) (right to trial by jury drawn from \u201crepresentative cross section of the community,\u201d assuring a \u201cdiffused impartiality,\u201d is critical, and prosecutors may not use peremptory challenges \u201cto exclude prospective jurors solely by virtue of their membership in, or affiliation with, particular, defined groupings in the community\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">On the first day of jury selection, the prosecutor sought to exercise, over objection, a peremptory challenge against juror no. 5-16. The prosecutor indicated his reason for the challenge was that the juror had an upcoming job interview within the next week and was anticipating the birth of his child within the next month. Noting that juror no. 5-16 was \u201cone of the few black males in this room,\u201d the judge ordered the juror be seated.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">On the second day of jury selection, the prosecutor sought to challenge juror no. 10-10. Defense counsel objected, stating that the juror was \u201ca black female\u201d and that \u201cthis is the third or fourth person of color, the fourth person of color the Commonwealth has challenged.\u201d The judge responded: \u201cOne I didn\u2019t allow. The others, there were neutral reasons for them. In this county, they challenge everybody under twenty-five, thirty, whatever.\u201d He then proceeded to ask the prosecutor, \u201cWhat was your reason?\u201d The prosecutor replied that there were a \u201cnumber of women of color\u201d who were not challenged, and who had been seated, and that there was no pattern. The prosecutor acknowledged that he \u201cunderstood\u201d the judge\u2019s ruling the previous day on juror no. 5-16, because he was a male. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge ruled, \u201cAll right, it\u2019s allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The prosecutor then sought to exercise a peremptory challenge against juror no. 11-10, over the defendant\u2019s objection that the juror was \u201ca Hispanic female, member of the minority community.\u201d The prosecutor responded again that \u201cthere is no pattern,\u201d but explained further that the juror was employed at a school where a man that he was prosecuting for murder had previously worked, and that the man had had many friends at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>the school. After questioning by the judge revealed that the juror did not know the man, the prosecutor withdrew his challenge and the juror was seated.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Peremptory challenges are presumed to be proper. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>439 Mass. 460, 463 (2003). That presumption may be rebutted, however, by showing that \u201c(1) there is a pattern of excluding members of a discrete group and (2) it is likely that individuals are being excluded solely on the basis of their membership\u201d in that group. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrey, </em>436 Mass. 422, 428 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">When the question of an improper use of a peremptory challenge is raised, the judge must make an initial finding as to whether the opposing party has made a prima facie showing that the use was improper. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, supra, </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>418 Mass. 769, 771 (1994). If the judge concludes that the opposing party has established a prima facie case that the use was for a discriminatory purpose, the burden shifts to the party seeking to exercise the challenge to provide a \u201cgroup-neutral\u201d explanation for that challenge. The judge must then determine whether the reason provided is \u201cbona fide\u201d or a \u201csham\u201d offered to avoid admitting to group discrimination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, supra </em>at 463-464, and cases cited. A determination whether the explanation offered is adequate to establish a permissible, nondiscriminatory basis for the challenge is within the sound discretion of the judge, and will not be disturbed so long as there is support for the ruling in the record. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeClair, </em>429 Mass. 313, 323 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Because there may be few members of the allegedly targeted group among the venire at the point at which the peremptory challenge is questioned, a challenge to \u201ca single prospective juror within a protected class could, in some circumstances, constitute a prima facie case of impropriety.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fryar, </em>414 Mass. 732, 738 (1993), <em>S.C., </em>425 Mass. 237, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1033 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">As the defendant asserts, in some circumstances, by requiring a prosecutor to provide an explanation for making a peremptory challenge, a judge may have implicitly found that a defendant has made a prima facie showing that the challenge was improper. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>431 Mass. 21, 25-26 (2000). However, \u201c[wjhere a venire contains \u2018a paucity of African Americans\u2019 a judge \u2018has broad discretion to require an explanation without having to make the determination that a pattern of improper exclusion exists.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Van Winkle, </em>443 Mass. 230, 236 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrey, </em>436 Mass. 422, 429 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Here, the defendant argues that, by asking the prosecutor to state his reasons, the judge made an implicit finding that the prosecutor\u2019s challenge to juror no. 10-10 was racially motivated, and then offered, sua sponte and improperly, a race-neutral, but also impermissible, reason for the prosecutor\u2019s challenge. The record, however, is to the contrary. The judge\u2019s comment that \u201cin this county they challenge everybody under twenty-five\u201d was made before he asked the prosecutor for a reason, and after the judge had pointed out that either there had been race-neutral reasons for earlier peremptory challenges, or that, in one instance, he had rejected the challenge and seated the male African-American juror. By not requiring the prosecutor to provide a reason for the challenge after his initial statement that there was no pattern of discrimination, the judge plainly accepted the prosecutor\u2019s assertion, unchallenged by the defendant, that a number of African-American women (as was juror no. 10-10) had been seated without challenge on the previous day, and that there was no pattern of discrimination, thus concluding that the defendant had not met his burden of establishing a prima facie case. Indeed, the judge stated explicitly, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s mention of the already seated African-American jurors, \u201cAll right, it\u2019s allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Because the defendant did not dispute the prosecutor\u2019s assertion, with which the judge apparently agreed, that at least three African-American jurors had been seated when juror no. 10-10 was challenged, we cannot say, on this record, that the judge abused his discretion in allowing the peremptory challenge of juror no. 10-10, or that the jury did not represent a \u201ccross section of the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s juvenile record. </em>The defendant maintains that evidence of his juvenile record was introduced improperly, after the prosecutor had stated, in response to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>motion to exclude his juvenile record, that he did not intend to introduce it, and the defendant did not thereafter pursue argument on the motion. The defendant claims further that the prosecutor solicited testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s juvenile record well aware that he did not have, and had not sought to obtain, a certified copy of the adjudication of delinquency. We conclude that, while the testimony was improper, there was no prejudicial error, because the judge ordered the testimony struck immediately after it was given, once he became aware that the prosecutor did not have the certified copy of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Prior to trial, the defendant had moved to exclude evidence of his juvenile adjudication of rape; the prosecutor asserted that he did not intend to introduce that adjudication and the judge ruled it would be excluded unless the defendant made it an issue at trial. The defendant testified that he had purchased legally a \u201cGlock 23\u201d firearm at a pawn shop when he was living in Arizona. He said that, to do so, he had been required to complete a form indicating that he had no criminal convictions. The judge, sua sponte, interrupted the defendant\u2019s testimony and, at sidebar, noted that he was concerned the defendant had just testified that he did not have a criminal record. Defense counsel stated that the defendant had only a juvenile record, and that the record should not be introduced. The judge reserved ruling on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the defendant, over objection, whether he had disclosed his prior \u201cconvictions\u201d when he completed the application for the gun permit, and whether he had completed the application truthfully. The defendant responded that he had a juvenile case that he believed was continued without a finding, he served a term of probation and the charges were dismissed, and that he did not think that it had to be disclosed in response to the question whether he had any criminal convictions. He stated also that, if he had been convicted of a felony, he would not have received the firearm permit. At sidebar, the prosecutor acknowledged that he had no certified copy of the defendant\u2019s juvenile adjudication, but said that he could try to obtain one; the judge ordered that the discussion of any testimony about the Juvenile Court be struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201cEvidence of prior convictions . . . may be admitted to rebut specific portions of the defendant\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderick, </em>429 Mass. 271, 274 (1999). While the prosecutor had agreed not to introduce the defendant\u2019s juvenile record, the defendant himself opened the door to this evidence by stating, without provocation, and apparently not in response to defense counsel\u2019s question, that he had no criminal convictions. Nonetheless, the prosecutor should not have cross-examined the defendant, repeatedly, and over repeated objection, with questions that evidently would require responses about the defendant\u2019s juvenile record, knowing that he did not have, indeed had not tried to obtain, the necessary certified copies of the record to introduce at trial. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 868-869 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">However, there was no prejudice to the defendant. The judge immediately took corrective action, instructing the jury that any discussion of anything that had happened in the Juvenile Court was struck from the record and they were not to consider it. Additionally, what the jury had heard by the defendant\u2019s statements, before they were struck, was that he had served some time on probation for an unspecified minor crime as a juvenile, that he had not committed any felonies, and had been deemed responsible enough by the State of Arizona to legally purchase a firearm. In the circumstances of the shooting death of one victim and shootings at multiple other people, including several police officers, information that the defendant had been on probation as a juvenile, for an offense that did not warrant incarceration and that was subsequently dismissed, would have had but little impact on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">3. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant maintains that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper in a number of respects. At trial, the defendant objected on each ground, and also sought a mistrial based on these asserted improprieties, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The prosecutor argued in closing that the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cmy life is over,\u201d when holding the gun to his head, was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">\u201cas good as a confession of guilt. That is what he said when confronted by police, those were his words. \u2018My life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>is over.\u2019 His life was over because he knew he had been caught, he knew he had been cornered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The defendant maintains that this argument was impermissible and not a fair inference from the record. We disagree. Although the evidence would have supported a conclusion that the defendant was referring to the statements that he had heard on the police radio alleging that the suspect had shot at a police officer, the jury could reasonably infer from the evidence that the defendant made the statements because he knew that the Glock in his hand was the one used in the shooting of Essaid, and that police would inevitably discover the connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The defendant contends also that the prosecutor made a number of personal attacks on defense counsel. He referred to defense counsel as a \u201cMonday morning quarterback,\u201d emphasizing that counsel did not know anything about the Boston police \u201cCode 99\u201d (a hostage situation) that had been ordered after the defendant pointed the gun to his own head, and did not know anything about how to conduct a homicide investigation: \u201c[f]or all the volume he brings to this argument, [he] has no special knowledge here. He knows no more about how to run a homicide investigation than any of you do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">While a prosecutor is entitled to argue \u201cforcefully for a conviction,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kater, </em>432 Mass. 404, 422-423 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 516 (1987), and while \u201centhusiastic rhetoric . . . and excusable hyperbole\u201d do not require reversal, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, 427 </em>Mass. 336, 350 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 107 (1997), some of the prosecutor\u2019s personal comments about defense counsel went beyond the bounds of proper argument. They were not, as the Commonwealth maintains, appropriate responses to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, in which he questioned the adequacy of the police investigation. Nonetheless, the comments were focused on the defendant\u2019s counsel and not on the character of the defendant or the evidence confronting him, and would have had little, if any, effect on the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>428 Mass. 852, 857 (1999) (jury presumed to recognize that \u201cprosecutor is an advocate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Last, the defendant claims that in describing the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>monwealth\u2019s burden of proof, the prosecutor said, \u201cIt is a burden of proof that I will gladly shoulder, with evidence like this,\u201d thereby shifting the burden of proof to the defendant. The prosecutor\u2019s comment, however, was made at the end of a lengthy and accurate discussion on the heavy burden of proof that the Commonwealth was required to meet. In that context, and given the testimony from an eyewitness to the shooting who was only a few feet away, plus the testimony of a number of police officers as to the defendant\u2019s actions on the evening of February 6, 2003, the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the evidence was strong is well supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The judge repeatedly and emphatically, both before closing argument and in his final charge, explained to the jury that closing arguments are not evidence, that they are only the opinion of the attorneys, and that the jury should, in every instance, rely on their own recollection of the evidence and not on anything the attorneys may have argued. The judge instructed also that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">\u201ccounsels\u2019 role here is to try the case, not to give opinions and not to interject themselves into the process, so if you think anyone has done that or feel anyone has done that, disregard that altogether. It\u2019s only the evidence that you heard or the testimony that you heard from the witnesses on the stand and the items that were admitted as evidence that you must consider in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">We conclude that, although some of the prosecutor\u2019s statements may have exceeded the bounds of permissible argument, they were unlikely to have affected the jury\u2019s verdicts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>425 Mass. 572, 582 (1997). There was no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">4. <em>Instruction on defense of another. </em>The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s denial of his motion for an instruction on defense of another, later renewed, was error. He maintains that he believed he had to shoot Essaid, Obbada, and Lebdoui to protect Fernandes, his \u201cbaby\u2019s mother,\u201d because he feared that they were going to take his gun and shoot her or otherwise harm her, possibly with their own weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The defendant requested, and received, an instruction on self-defense, with the judge instructing that, where a person is under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>a mistaken belief that deadly force is necessary, he may still use deadly force in self-defense if the belief is reasonable in the circumstances. The judge also instructed on the excessive use of force in self-defense, and on reasonable provocation, which negate the element of malice, mitigating murder to manslaughter. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>430 Mass. 746, 755-756 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>412 Mass 368, 373 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>388 Mass. 789, 795 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In declining, over objection, to give the instruction on defense of another, the judge observed, \u201c[Fernandes] is long gone. . . . She was gone and there is no evidence whatsoever they were after her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">An individual is entitled to use force to protect a third person if \u201c(a) a reasonable person in the actor\u2019s position would believe his intervention to be necessary for the protection of the third person, and (b) in the circumstances as that reasonable person would believe them to be, the third person would be justified in using such force to protect himself.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>461 Mass. 198, 208 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>369 Mass. 640, 649 (1976). \u201cThe reasonableness of the belief may depend in part on the relationships among the persons involved.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra. </em>The reasonableness of the belief is from the point of view of the actor and not of the third party, such that whether the third party was actually entitled to use self-defense, or believed the use of force to be necessary, is not at issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, supra </em>at 209. The actor \u201cneed only reasonably believe that the third party is being unlawfully attacked,\u201d even if, in retrospect, that belief was incorrect. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe actor\u2019s justification is lost if he uses excessive force, e.g., aggressive or deadly force unwarranted for the protective purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">There was no error in the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the use of force in defense of another. Nothing in the evidence warrants a conclusion that a reasonable person would have believed Fernandes was actually being attacked when the defendant pulled the trigger. At that point, by his own testimony, Fernandes had walked on, as he told her to do, the defendant could no longer see her, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>he did not know where she had gone. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, the three men were focused on, and surrounding, the defendant, challenging him about Andre Komegay\u2019s theft of their marijuana. The men were not following or threatening Fernandes, who would not have been entitled to use deadly force in her own defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>458 Mass. 766, 775 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In any event, an instruction on defense of another would have been of no assistance to the defendant and would not have affected the verdict. The jury rejected the defendant\u2019s assertions that he acted in self-defense, with the men only a few feet from him; concluding that the defendant did not act to defend himself when he squeezed the trigger, whether reasonably or not, the jury could not have concluded that the defendant acted to defend Fernandes, who was not in sight at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">5. <em>Denial of motion for a new trial. </em>The defendant filed a motion for a new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. He maintained that counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate, prepare, and present an adequate defense, specifically in failing to move to suppress as involuntary the defendant\u2019s statements to officers on February 6, 2003. The defendant contends that the judge, who was also the trial judge, erred in denying his motion for a new trial without conducting an evi-dentiary hearing, and in concluding that counsel was not ineffective for failing to seek to have the defendant\u2019s statements suppressed as involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Whether to grant a motion for a new trial rests within the sound discretion of the judge, and will not be reversed unless \u201cmanifestly unjust\u201d or if the trial was \u201cinfected with prejudicial constitutional error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Espada, </em>450 Mass. 687, 697 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>429 Mass. 763, 770 (1999). Because the motion judge was also the trial judge, he is entitled to particular deference. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>442 Mass. 485, 499 (2004). Since we discern no error in the course of the trial that would have been \u201clikely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>452 Mass. 662, 666 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992), the judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Nothing in the record suggests that the defendant\u2019s statements were not voluntarily made, or that he was so overwrought that they were not the product of a rational intellect or made of his free will. The statements were initiated by the defendant when he jumped out from under the tarp and spontaneously started speaking, and continued almost exclusively in the absence of any questions by police. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braley, </em>449 Mass. 316, 325 (2007). The defendant was not being questioned about any crime. Police were unaware that the defendant had any involvement in an earlier shooting, and asked him nothing about that crime. The questions they did ask \u2014 \u201cHow many of your friends do you know have gone to jail for illegal possession of a handgun?\u201d \u2014 were focused only on getting the defendant to put down his weapon. Moreover, those few questions were rhetorical and answered, in one instance, by the officer who posed the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The defendant\u2019s actions demonstrate a rational intellect and an ability to make reasoned decisions throughout the confrontation with police on February 6, 2003. The defendant himself testified that he pointed the gun to his head after calling his father on his cellular telephone to ask for advice, and being told that he should point the gun at himself to avoid being killed by police. The defendant never pointed the gun at any of the officers surrounding him, and dropped it immediately when his father arrived. In the midst of the standoff, the defendant, saying that he was tired, switched the gun to his other hand, being careful to keep it pointed away from the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress statements that would have been unsuccessful. The expert that the defendant ultimately obtained, in conjunction with his motion for a new trial, concluded only that the defendant might have been in an \u201cexacerbated state of his depression\u201d at the time of the chase. That, alone, would not have rendered his statements involuntary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Auclair, </em>444 Mass. 348, 355 (2005) (\u201cemotional upset alone does not render\u201d statement involuntary \u201cwhere there is no evidence that the defendant was acting irrationally\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stroyny, </em>435 Mass. 635, 646-647 (2002) (\u201cdistress, even profound distress, does not necessarily mean that a defendant is incapable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>withholding any information he conveys\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>433 Mass. 549, 555 (2001), and cases cited (that defendant \u201cmay have been in a disturbed emotional state, or even suicidal, does not automatically make statements involuntary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The record does not support, as the defendant alleges, that his trial counsel failed to pursue a defense. Trial counsel moved to suppress the identification of the defendant from photographic arrays on the ground that they were unnecessarily suggestive, and to suppress all of the firearm evidence \u2014 the gun, ammunition, and spent cartridges \u2014 recovered on February 6, 2003, after the foot chase. A lengthy voir dire examination of the police officers was conducted in conjunction with that motion, which was denied. Counsel cross-examined the officers in detail on what they were able to see of the defendant and whether he had a gun, thereby pointing out to the jury that many of the officers did not see a gun in the defendant\u2019s hand. He argued extensively in closing that the police investigation was inadequate, and that the differing statements by the officers as to whether the defendant had a gun, and what they reported he said, showed both the inadequacy of the investigation and that the officers were not being forthright in their testimony. He emphasized the differences in the testimony about the defendant\u2019s statements to support the argument that the defendant had not made, or did not remember making, most of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">We discern no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s decision to deny the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">6. <em>Review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Having carefully reviewed the entire record pursuant to our duty under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we discern no reason to reduce the murder verdict or to order a new trial. While the defendant\u2019s evidence, if believed, might have supported a determination that the defendant used excessive force in self-defense, resulting in a verdict of manslaughter, the jury were not required to believe this evidence. The testimony that the defendant followed Obbada, Essaid, and Lebdoui, as though he were \u201clooking for a fight,\u201d while the men kept walking, and then pulled out a gun and fired at each unarmed man in turn, as the men tried to flee, is consonant with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>a verdict of murder in the first degree on a theory of deliberate premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The defendant was acquitted of armed assault by means of a dangerous weapon on Boston police Officers Brian Mannetta and Thomas Rose.
