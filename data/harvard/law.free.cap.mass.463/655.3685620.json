Before us are the defendant\u2019s consolidated appeals from both her conviction and the denial of her motion for a new trial. We conclude that, because on multiple occasions, over objection, the trial judge erroneously allowed the Commonwealth to introduce highly prejudicial evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts, and because the judge later declined to provide an instruction as to the excessive use of force in self-defense that was supported by the evidence, the conviction must be reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief. </em>We recite the facts as the jury could have found them, reserving certain details for later discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">On June 26, 2003, the defendant and Petitry lived together in an apartment in Brockton. Goudy Richemond, a friend of Petitry, was at their apartment repairing a broken baby crib. One of Richemond\u2019s friends, Ivens Fouyolle, was also present at the apartment. The defendant\u2019s and Petitry\u2019s infant daughter and the defendant\u2019s son, who was around \u201cfive or six years old,\u201d ordinarily would have been home, but the children had been taken into custody by the Department of Social Services (DSS)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> eight days earlier because of a complaint against the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">About ten to twenty minutes after Fouyolle arrived at the apartment, the defendant said that she was leaving to spend the evening out with friends. Petitry refused to let her go, saying that a DSS investigator would be coming the following day to discuss the removal of the children and that he did not want her to spend the night out with other men smoking marijuana. An argument ensued. The defendant made a telephone call and said that Petitry was treating her like a \u201cslave,\u201d and according to Fouyolle, Petitry\u2019s \u201ctone of voice was like she\u2019s not going out, like, you know, he\u2019s telling his woman that she\u2019s not going out, and he means it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>The three men \u2014\u25a0 Petitry, Richemond, and Fouyolle \u2014 then went downstairs to smoke cigarettes. From where they were smoking, they could still hear the defendant on the telephone, saying she was a \u201cslave\u201d and that Petitry thought he \u201cown[ed]\u201d her. While Richemond and Fouyolle continued smoking, Petitry went back upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">By the time all three men had returned to the apartment, Petitry had threatened to move out and had started packing his belongings. The pair continued to argue, shutting the bedroom door so Fouyolle and Richemond could not overhear. Through the door, Fouyolle could still make out arguing and swearing, including the defendant saying that Petitry was not leaving her. At some point during the argument, Richemond felt the need to open the door, telling Petitry to \u201crelax\u201d because \u201c[t]he people downstairs [are] going to call the cops.\u201d With the door opened, Fouyolle could see that Petitry was positioned on top of the defendant, holding her down on the bed. She was spitting in Petitry\u2019s face, telling him to move. Petitry told the men to \u201cmind [their] fucking business\u201d and Richemond closed the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Soon thereafter, Fouyolle heard a sound of breaking glass. The argument continued. When Petitry later left the bedroom,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant followed \u201c[n]ot even ten seconds\u201d later, holding a sixteen-inch piece of glass. On her way out the door, the defendant said, \u201c[M]other fucker, I\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and proceeded to stab Petitry in the chest. The glass entered Petit-ry\u2019s chest under the left mid-collarbone and penetrated four and one-half inches into his left lung. Once Petitry started to bleed, the defendant appeared shocked, pleading, \u201c[D]on\u2019t die, please don\u2019t die.\u201d Fouyolle immediately called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">When the police arrived at approximately 10:40 p.m., they found the defendant visibly upset, \u201cshaking and crying.\u201d When paramedics stated that they would cease cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the defendant started to thrash uncontrollably; she slammed her head against the wall and headboard of the bed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>and screamed that \u201cif [Petitry] dies, [I] want[] to die.\u201d Petitry\u2019s heart stopped before the paramedics could get him out of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">b. <em>The defendant\u2019s claimed lack of criminal responsibility. </em>The defendant largely conceded the sequence of events but argued that she was not criminally responsible for her actions because, due to a mental disease or defect \u2014 specifically post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from years of physical and emotional abuse \u2014 she lacked the substantial capacity at the time of the stabbing both to appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct and to conform her conduct to the requirements of the law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1967). In support of this claim, the defense offered the testimony of two expert witnesses; the Commonwealth did the same in response.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The evidence admitted at trial indicated that the defendant suffered from a long history of abuse.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bom in Haiti in 1980, she was one year old when her father left her family. During her early childhood, she lived with her mother and stepfather; \u201c[t]here was abuse all through that period.\u201d At the age of ten, she left Haiti to come to the United States. When she arrived, she lived in a number of shelters before her father was located and she was placed with him in Florida. Her father\u2019s wife, with whom she also lived, was physically abusive toward her. At the age of fourteen, someone in the defendant\u2019s neighborhood sexually assaulted her. After her father\u2019s death in 1996, she went to live with her aunt and uncle, where she encountered another abusive household.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">While she was living in Florida, she became involved with a man, Claudel Gellete, who would become the father of her first child, a son. Her relationship with Gellete was marked by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>violence. Police reports from Florida, dated September, 1998, indicate that, on one occasion, officers noticed broken blood vessels in her eyes, as well as swelling and bruising around her face. She told the officers that Gellete had caused the injuries by punching her multiple times. Florida hospital records indicate that, seven months later, in April, 1999, the defendant was hit over the head by a beer bottle so hard that it caused the skin on her scalp to split apart, requiring staples to repair the damage. On that trip to the hospital, she reported that she did not know where she was. She returned to the hospital yet again, complaining of pain in her stomach and reporting that Gellete had hit her. She also reported that she suffered black eyes and migraine headaches from his beatings. According to these reports, he had also threatened to kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">After her relationship with Gellete ended, the defendant moved to Massachusetts. In 2001, the defendant was hospitalized after a suicide attempt and was diagnosed with major depression. While living in Massachusetts, she began a relationship with a man named John Colson. According to the defendant, Colson too was abusive \u2014 the defendant described this relationship as \u201clike being in hell\u201d \u2014 particularly when he was drinking or smoking marijuana. The abuse was so extreme that the defendant and her son moved into a shelter hotel in June, 2002, to get away from him. When Colson tracked her down at the shelter, he attempted to suffocate her with a pillow. During this attack, the defendant suffered swollen temples and cheeks, as well as having a mole bitten off the side of her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">After this incident, from \u201cJune 2002 into July 2002,\u201d the defendant sought counselling at New Bedford Child and Family Services and was diagnosed with major depression and PTSD. She described herself as depressed, irritable, and prone to angry outbursts. The same diagnoses were later made at South Bay Mental Health Center (South Bay), where she was treated for several months beginning in July, 2002. At the time of this diagnosis, the defendant was also reported to have made bizarre statements to mental health professionals, including that she believed she would become president of Haiti before she turned thirty years old, and that she had been baptized by the Pope himself. Clinicians at South Bay continued to treat her, describing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>the defendant as \u201cvery depressed\u201d before the birth of her daughter, \u201ctired and stressed\u201d after the birth, and increasingly stressed by the defiant behavior of her son.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While being treated at South Bay, the defendant was \u201con low doses of antidepressants intermittently,\u201d which she ceased during her pregnancy and did not resume until after the date of the stabbing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">After she began dating Petitry, apparently in mid to late 2002, the defendant described herself as \u201chelpless and powerless\u201d in the relationship. The defendant stated that his abuse was primarily verbal but that he would punch her repeatedly on occasion. She reported that he would become \u201caggressive and verbally abusive\u201d when he was drinking.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A police report stated that, on one occasion, in April, 2003, several months before the stabbing, the defendant had called the police because Petitry had been abusive, and \u201cit took the police to get him out of the house.\u201d Attorney Thomas D. Lawton testified that, in the course of representing the defendant in the Juvenile Court in relation to the complaint filed by DSS, he witnessed an incident on June 23, 2003 (three days before the stabbing), in which Petitry stood over the defendant with his fists clenched, cursing and screaming that he was going to kill her. With Petitry standing over her in an \u201cassaultive position,\u201d the defendant \u201cleaned over with her face ti[lt]ed away from [Petitry] with tears pouring off her nose and her lip.\u201d When Lawton intervened, Petitry told the defendant to \u201ckeep her mouth shut and watch what she said.\u201d The defendant, who was \u201ccrying\u201d and \u201cshaking\u201d even after she had been moved away from Petitry, refused Lawton\u2019s offer to help her obtain a restraining order against Petitry, telling Lawton that if she did so, Petitry would kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">As to the circumstances of the stabbing itself, although the defendant remembered the moments immediately before and after the incident, she claimed to have no memory of inflicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the blow. The next day, the defendant was admitted to Taunton State Hospital, by court order, for a thirty-day evaluation of her competency; she was determined to be competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Dr. Ann Burgess, a registered and advance practice nurse with a doctorate in nursing, testified that, based upon her evaluation of the defendant and her review of the defendant\u2019s history, she believed that the defendant lacked criminal responsibility at the time of the stabbing because of her diagnosed PTSD. Burgess described Petitry as \u201caggressive,\u201d \u201cabusive,\u201d and \u201ccontrolling\u201d in his relationship with the defendant, as evidenced by, among other things, the instances of his physical and verbal abuse, his forcing her to have sexual intercourse soon after the birth of their daughter, and his \u201cinsist[ing]\u201d that she accompany him on a trip to New York when she was \u201cwithin days of her due date.\u201d Burgess also testified that she believed the defendant was suffering from postpartum depression at the time,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in addition to her previously diagnosed depression and PTSD. She opined that, during the stabbing, the defendant was in the midst of a posttraumatic stress reaction to the circumstances of the argument. The fact that the defendant did not remember the stabbing itself was indicative of a PTSD reaction to the circumstances of the argument. According to Burgess, the defendant left the bedroom because of \u201cthe fear and needing to get away from the noxious environment\u201d and to avoid feeling like she was being held \u201ccaptive.\u201d She picked up the piece of glass because \u201cshe thought somebody was going to come after her\u201d so it \u201ccould [have been] an automatic reaction to have that in her hand.\u201d Overall, \u201cher mental level was far below what would be needed to think clearly about [the] situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Dr. Terence Keane, a professor of psychiatry and psychology at Boston University School of Medicine, similarly testified that he believed the defendant lacked criminal responsibility because of her PTSD. Keane testified that, at the time of the stabbing, the defendant was suffering from PTSD \u201caccompanied by a dissociative reaction\u201d and was in a \u201cdissociative state.\u201d According to Keane, when an individual is in a dissociative state, \u201cthere\u2019s a lack of appreciation of the events . . . and there\u2019s a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>real compromise of what is happening in reality.\u201d When Petitry was on top of the defendant, that may have reminded her of the previous attack by Colson, which could have acted as a \u201ckey trigger,\u201d provoking similar emotions from that earlier incident and leading to her dissociative state on this occasion. The defendant\u2019s statements in the immediate aftermath indicated that the stabbing had \u201cshock[ed her] into [an] awakened state . . . reinstating the true reality of what\u2019s just happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In response, the Commonwealth called Dr. Michael Murphy, a psychologist at Taunton State Hospital and director of psychology at the Barnstable County sheriff\u2019s office. According to Murphy, the defendant was criminally responsible for her acts because \u201cshe did not display active symptoms of a major mental illness.\u201d Murphy based this opinion, in part, on her mannerisms during their interviews, which indicated that she was not experiencing either depressive or psychotic symptoms. The defendant was also well oriented during the interviews, in that she knew where she was, the date and time, and the reason why she was there. Murphy stated that, during the defendant\u2019s stay at Taunton State Hospital after the stabbing, she had displayed no signs or symptoms of PTSD.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Dr. Russell Vasile, a staff psychiatrist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, testified that, based on a mental status examination conducted in July and August, 2006, the defendant \u201cwas not suffering from a major thought disorder\u201d or a \u201cmajor active mental illness\u201d at the time of the stabbing. According to Vasile, despite the earlier diagnosis, the defendant did not suffer from PTSD and was not in a dissociative state at the time of the 2003 stabbing. In addition, Vasile testified that the defendant had the substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct and had the capacity to conform her conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">On September 27, 2007, the jury found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree on a theory of deliberate pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>meditation. After her direct appeal was entered before this court in November, 2009, the court granted a stay of the appeal to allow the defendant to file a motion for a new trial. In November, 2010, the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied following a nonevidentiary hearing. The defendant\u2019s appeal from that denial was consolidated with her direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant claims reversible error in four respects. First, she argues that the trial judge erred in admitting, on multiple occasions, prejudicial prior bad act evidence concerning two occasions on which she allegedly had struck her young son. Second, the defendant argues that the judge erred in declining to give a sought instruction as to the excessive use of force in self-defense, which mitigates murder to voluntary manslaughter. Third, the defendant maintains that the judge\u2019s instructions regarding reasonable provocation were insufficient to convey the extent to which the jury could consider the defendant\u2019s history of past abuse. Lastly, she argues that the judge erred in denying her motion for a new trial. In that motion, the defendant claimed both prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel concerning the alleged existence of a second door in the bedroom through which the defendant could have fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">We conclude that the improper admission on multiple occasions of prior bad act evidence, in combination with the refusal to instruct the jury as to the excessive use of force in self-defense, were prejudicial errors requiring a new trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">a. <em>Evidence of prior bad acts. </em>The defendant maintains that she was prejudiced by the repeated admission in evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>certain prior bad acts, namely the details of two occasions on which she allegedly abused her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The facts at trial established that DSS had removed the defendant\u2019s children from their home on June 18, 2003, eight days before the stabbing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Both children had been removed because of an allegation that the defendant had struck her son with a sandal across the face. The defendant \u201cdenied and has always denied\u201d that this incident took place. A DSS investigator was planning to come to their home on what proved to be the day after the killing to discuss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The admissibility of the details of this incident was disputed throughout the trial, from before opening statements to the testimony of the final witness. We address, in turn, the admissibility of this prior bad act evidence at each point at which its admissibility was addressed by the trial judge, as well as that of a second instance of abuse that predated the defendant\u2019s relationship with Petitry and that took place at a shelter in 2002. In each instance, we review the ruling below for \u201cpalpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCowen, </em>458 Mass. 461, 478 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fordham, </em>417 Mass. 10, 23 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">i. <em>Initial admissibility determination. </em>Before opening statements, the Commonwealth moved to admit the full details of the sandal incident forming the basis of the DSS complaint. The judge ruled that he was going to permit the admission in evidence only of the fact of the children\u2019s removal by DSS (i.e., not assign responsibility for their removal to either the defendant or Petitry). The judge considered the likelihood that both sides would be trying to portray the other as responsible, and acknowledged that \u201cthis type of evidence is prejudicial to both sides.\u201d However, after defense counsel, in his opening statement, suggested that Petitry \u201cblamed [the defendant] for the loss of his daughter,\u201d the judge ruled that he would allow only the fact that the complaint was against the defendant to be admitted, but not its underlying details.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The DSS case worker testified that her job was to \u201cinvestigate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>families once [DSS] receives a report, a [G. L. c.] 51A report alleging that a kid has been physically abused or neglected.\u201d The prosecutor then elicited that such an investigation had related specifically to the defendant, asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\"><em>Q: </em>\u201cAnd as part of your investigatory duties, did you have an occasion to become involved in an investigation relating to allegations against [the defendant]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\"><em>A: </em>\u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The prosecution \u201cmay not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indictably or not, for the purposes of showing [her] bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Helfant, 398 Mass. 214, 224-225 (1986), and cases cited. But, \u201cif relevant for some other purpose,\u201d and if the probative value outweighs the risk of unfair prejudice, the judge may, in his discretion, admit evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior bad acts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCowen, supra </em>at 478. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7\u00a7 403, 404(b) (2012). We have long recognized the rationale for this rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">\u201cSuch evidence compels the defendant to meet charges of which the indictment gives him no information, confuses him in his defen[s]e, raises a variety of issues, and thus diverts the attention of the jury from the [crime] immediately before it; and, by showing the defendant to have been a knave on other occasions, creates a prejudice which may cause injustice to be done him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>132 Mass. 16, 20-21 (1882).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">We generally restrict admission of prior bad act evidence to purposes such as \u201ccommon scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent or motive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>434 Mass. 358, 366 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, supra </em>at 224. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>445 Mass. 568, 574 n.6 (2005) (collecting cases). Such evidence may also be admissible if it \u201crebut[s] the defendant\u2019s contentions\u201d made in the course of trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magraw, </em>426 Mass. 589, 595 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">The judge was correct in his initial ruling, made prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>opening statements, that there was no independent basis for the admission of any details pertaining to the DSS complaint, including the sandal incident that precipitated it. To the extent that defense counsel, in his opening statement, thereafter suggested that Petitry had been responsible for the children\u2019s removal, the judge did not abuse his discretion in permitting limited evidence to rebut it, i.e., that the DSS complaint had been brought against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">While the fact that DSS had brought a complaint against the defendant may have had probative value, the details of that complaint nevertheless remained inadmissible as more prejudicial than probative. As to probative value, the details of the sandal incident were not relevant to any of the bases on which prior bad act evidence is considered admissible \u2014 \u201ccommon scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent or motive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, supra </em>at 366, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, supra. </em>The removal of the defendant\u2019s children by DSS was only relevant to shed light on the stress in the relationship between the defendant and Petitry, stress that may have triggered the argument leading to the stabbing. In this regard, once the jury heard that the DSS complaint was against the defendant, rather than Petitry, the details of that complaint would add no probative information and only heighten the risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Allery, </em>101 Wash. 2d 591, 598-599 (1984).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Even were this evidence in some way relevant to one of the specific purposes for which prior bad acts may be admitted, the history and details of the DSS complaint were considerably more prejudicial than probative. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCo-wen, supra </em>at 478-480.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">ii. <em>Admissibility as basis of expert testimony. </em>After the Commonwealth rested, the defendant called Burgess, who testified about the extensive history of abuse the defendant had suffered at many hands during her life, as detailed <em>supra. </em>At the outset, defense counsel requested a sidebar conference to discuss with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the judge how far he could go in examining Burgess without \u201copening the door\u201d to the details of the DSS complaint.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Burgess then testified that Petitry had been \u201caggressive,\u201d \u201cabusive,\u201d and \u201ccontrolling,\u201d and described her diagnosis of PTSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">On cross-examination and over objection, the judge allowed the prosecutor to elicit from Burgess the details of two occasions on which the defendant had allegedly struck her son. First, the prosecutor elicited the details of a 2002 incident, unrelated to the DSS complaint, and occurring before the defendant met Petitry, in which the defendant had been kicked out of a shelter for striking her son. As the basis for the admission of this evidence, the judge stated, during a sidebar conference, \u201c[Burgess] relied on this. I\u2019ll allow it in.\u201d When asked about this instance of abuse, however, Burgess stated that she did not remember the incident but agreed with the prosecutor that it had appeared in the reports that had been provided to her.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Later in his examination of Burgess, the prosecutor, over defense counsel\u2019s continuing objection, was also permitted to elicit the full details of the sandal incident precipitating the DSS complaint. Again, Burgess never testified that she had relied on the DSS complaint or its details in reaching her opinion as to the defendant\u2019s lack of criminal responsibility. In addition, the prosecutor suggested, by way of leading questions, that Petitry may have been concerned for the safety of his daughter because of the defendant\u2019s actions. Burgess indicated that she \u201cdidn\u2019t see any evidence on that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The rationale for allowing the jury to hear the previously excluded prior bad act evidence was, in essence, that this information, about which Burgess had known, arguably formed the basis of her expert opinion and, as such, must be disclosed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>cross-examination. This rationale does not withstand scrutiny. As we discuss <em>infra, </em>the elicitation of information provided to an expert on cross-examination may be limited if the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. Where, as here, the information known to the expert does not form the basis of the expert\u2019s opinion, does nothing to clarify or discredit the expert\u2019s opinion, and serves only to focus on the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts, the balance \u2014 after a weighing of prejudice against probative value \u2014 plainly favors exclusion of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In forming their opinions, experts must rely on facts or data that are independently admissible.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531-532 (1986) <em>(Department of Youth Servs.). </em>\u201cIf a party believes that an expert is basing an opinion on inadmissible facts or data, the party may request a voir dire to determine the basis of the expert opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532. Here, the prosecutor did not request such a voir dire to challenge Burgess\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Instead, the prosecutor used cross-examination to elicit information provided to Burgess about the two alleged incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">\u201cThe expert may testify in terms of opinion or inference and give reasons therefor without prior disclosure of the underlying facts or data, unless the court requires otherwise. The expert may in any event be required to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-examination.\u201d Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 705 (2012). <em>See Department of Youth Servs., supra </em>at 532. Our rule allowing the admission of the bases of expert testimony on cross-examination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>however, \u201cdoes not end the inquiry. In determining whether to allow an expert to testify to the facts underlying an opinion, the court must inquire whether. . .the testimony should be excluded because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gillis, </em>773 F.2d 549, 554 (4th Cir. 1985) (interpreting analogous Federal rule). In other words, just because an expert is aware of, or was provided with, information does not mean that the information must automatically be disclosed to the jury. It remains within the judge\u2019s discretion to limit what information the expert can disclose during his or her testimony, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. 792, 802-804 (1996), and to determine whether the expert can render his or her opinion on the basis of the evidence properly relied upon. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>414 Mass. 235, 237-239 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>400 Mass. 550, 555 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Once the Commonwealth sought to inquire over objection about this prior bad act evidence, it was incumbent on the judge in the sound exercise of his discretion to ascertain whether the evidence was probative and, if so, whether that probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201c[Ejvidence that poses a risk of unfair prejudice need not always be admitted simply because a defendant has opened the door to its admission; the judge still needs to weigh the probative value of the evidence and the risk of unfair prejudice, and determine whether the balance favors admission.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCowen, </em>458 Mass. 461, 479 n.15 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In assessing the probative value of the evidence, particularly given the judge\u2019s clear appreciation of the information\u2019s potential for unfair prejudice, the judge should first have determined whether and to what extent the expert had in fact relied on the incidents in question in forming her opinion, since \u201cthe fact that a witness has been exposed to [inadmissible evidence] does not imply that he has relied on it in the formation of his opinion.\u201d M.S. Brodin &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 7.5.3, at 433-434 (8th ed. 2007). Indeed, the record suggests that Burgess did not rely on these episodes in forming her expert opinion. To the contrary, she scarcely seemed to remember them. Contrast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>434 Mass. 805, 821 (2001) (affirming admission of prior bad act evidence because it was \u201cvery significant\u201d to expert\u2019s evaluation of defendant\u2019s mental state).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Moreover, this was not a situation \u201cwhere the purpose of cross-examination [was] \u2018to shake the foundation of the defense experts\u2019 opinions rather than to focus on the defendant\u2019s prior [bad conduct].\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colleran, </em>452 Mass. 417, 425-426 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Killelea, </em>370 Mass. 638, 650 (1976).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Instead, there appears to have been no purpose for eliciting this testimony other than to prejudice the defendant. Nothing in the details of these incidents undermined Burgess\u2019s diagnosis of PTSD or her opinion that the defendant, as a result thereof, lacked criminal responsibility. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, </em>396 Mass. 202, 207 (1985), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 356, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1045 (1996). At no point during cross-examination did the prosecutor try to use Burgess\u2019s knowledge of these incidents to refute her opinion, or even ask whether these incidents affected her diagnosis.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cAn expert\u2019s testimony explaining the foundation for [her] opinion should not, of course, serve as a channel for the introduction of unnecessary and prejudicial evidence.\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982), citing <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>152 Mass. 168, 171 (1890). The prosecutor simply extracted the details of the incidents from Burgess by use of leading questions, making no effort to use this information to discredit her opinion in the eyes of the jury.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The details of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts were not rendered admissible by Burgess\u2019s testimony, and it was error for those details to be admitted during her cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">iii. <em>Admissibility through other witnesses. </em>Two subsequent witnesses were then permitted to testify, over objection, as to the details of the DSS complaint. During cross-examination of Lawton, the prosecutor asked whether the defendant \u201cwas alleged to have hit her five year old son in the face with a sandal.\u201d Lawton, the defendant\u2019s lawyer in the contested DSS matter, answered in the affirmative. The prosecutor thereafter recalled the DSS case worker, who described \u2014 again, over objection \u2014 in significant, protracted detail the reason that the children were taken away from their home.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In particular, the DSS caseworker testified about the facial injury to the defendant\u2019s son (\u201cvisible bruises on the left side of his face\u201d that looked like \u201cthe sole of a shoe\u201d), the entire process of the DSS investigation, the taking of the child to the hospital, the removal of the child from his home, and his placement in foster care.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Nothing in the record indicates why the prosecutor was allowed to introduce the prior bad act evidence again and in such detail. To the extent that the admission of such evidence was permitted in cross-examining Burgess to explore the basis of her expert opinion, that rationale, albeit flawed, has no application to Lawton or the DSS case worker. Having thus acquired no new probative value, the lengthy \u2014 and considerably more detailed \u2014 recitation of the incident from the DSS case worker only increased the prejudicial effect of this information. These details remained inadmissible through the testimony of these subsequent witnesses.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the repeated admission in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>of the details of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts in allegedly striking her son on two occasions was palpable error.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">iv. <em>Prejudice. </em>Given that the defendant objected in each instance to the erroneous admission of the prior bad acts, we must determine, \u201cafter pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, [whether] the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Vinnie, 428 Mass. 161, 163, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">\u201cIt is implicit in the general rule regarding the inadmissibility of prior bad acts evidence that the admission of such evidence carries with it a high risk of prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Barrett, 418 Mass. 788, 795 (1994). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. 649, 660 n.14 (2005). The likelihood of prejudice from the repeated admission of detailed evidence of two previous occasions when the defendant allegedly struck her young son was quite considerable in these circumstances. The nature of this prior bad act evidence, relating as it did to the alleged physical abuse of a young child by his mother, made it particularly likely to prejudice the jury against the defendant, the child\u2019s mother, on trial for murdering her live-in boy friend. See <em>Valmonte </em>v. <em>Bane, </em>18 F.3d 992, 1004 (2d Cir. 1994), quoting <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 762 (1982) (such evidence is \u201cinherently inflammatory, and \u2018unusually open to the subjective values of\u2019 the fact[]finder\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Furthermore, the details of this incident were repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>introduced, through three separate witnesses, in significant detail. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 696-697 (1983) (\u201cfrequency of the reference\u201d is factor in prejudicial error analysis). Allegations that the defendant slapped her son with a sandal so hard that he had to be taken to the hospital, and that she had struck him on a previous occasion, were very likely to prejudice the jury against the defendant because it was relevant to no other purpose than to show that the \u201cdefendant has a propensity for criminal conduct,\u201d here, a tendency to violence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moure, </em>428 Mass. 313, 319 (1998). The DSS case worker, in particular, described the incident in considerable detail, cementing the prejudicial information in the minds of the jury. During Burgess\u2019s testimony, no limiting instruction was provided to the jury narrowing their consideration of these facts only to an assessment of her opinion. The jury were allowed to consider the testimony for its truth, notwithstanding that it was improper character evidence. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jaime, </em>433 Mass. 575, 578 (2001).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Finally, no other properly admitted evidence served to establish any details of violent episodes on the part of the defendant, such that admission of this evidence might be considered at least somewhat cumulative. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>454 Mass. 135, 144 (2009). Moreover, the DSS case worker, who provided a lengthy recitation of the details of the alleged incident involving a sandal, was the final witness, which ensured that these details were \u201cfresh in the jury\u2019s mind when they began deliberations.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 624, 629 (2012), citing <em>Yeboah Sefah </em>v. <em>Ficco, </em>556 F.3d 53, 78 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 639 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">We need not decide, however, whether the erroneous seriatim admission of prior bad act evidence, standing alone, requires a new trial. As we discuss in part 2.b, <em>infra, </em>it was also error not to have instructed the jury as to the excessive use of force in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>self-defense, which mitigates murder to manslaughter. This alone requires a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>384 Mass. 396, 405 (1981). Certainly, when considered together, we cannot say that these errors had only a \u201cvery slight effect\u201d on the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983). Thus, a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">b. <em>Instruction on excessive use of force in self-defense. </em>The defendant argues that the evidence entitled her to an instruction on excessive use of force in self-defense,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> which may mitigate a killing from murder to manslaughter. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pring-Wilson, </em>448 Mass. 718, 733 n.15 (2007). At trial, the judge, after initially allowing the defendant\u2019s request to give an instruction on excessive use of force in self-defense, ultimately declined to provide such an instruction because it \u201crequires a reasonable apprehension,\u201d and the case \u201cwasn\u2019t tried that way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">\u201cBefore a judge is required to give a requested instruction, there must be some basis in evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the proponent, supporting the requested instruction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>419 Mass. 192, 201 (1994). To receive an instruction on the excessive use of force in self-defense, \u201cthe defendant must be entitled to act in self-defense,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>431 Mass. 326, 335 (2000), but \u201cused more force than was reasonably necessary in all the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glacken, </em>451 Mass. 163, 167 (2008). For a defendant to be entitled to use deadly force, as the defendant did here,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> she must have \u201ca reasonable apprehension of great bodily harm and a reasonable belief that no other means would suffice to prevent such harm.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>332 Mass. 687, 690 (1955). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>443 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Mass. 213, 215-219 (2005) (\u201cIf deadly force were used, then the deadly force standard should be applied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The defendant maintains that, although perhaps not reasonable if experienced by an individual without her history of abuse, the lifelong abuse the defendant has suffered could render reasonable her apprehension of great bodily harm and her belief that no other means would suffice to prevent it, thereby making appropriate an instruction on the excessive use of force in self-defense. The Commonwealth argues in response that the evidence was insufficient to establish the objective reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s fear and, thus, that the instruction was not warranted.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The propriety of such an instruction turns on the application of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 23F (\u00a7 23F).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As relevant here, \u00a7 23F not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>only allows the introduction of evidence of a defendant\u2019s past instances of abuse, including, but not limited to, those involving the victim, but also permits the use of such evidence to establish \u201cthe reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s apprehension that death or serious bodily injury was imminent.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> As \u00a7 23F makes clear, the psychological consequences of a history of abuse are relevant to the consideration whether the defendant was in fear of serious injury or death.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>431 Mass. 212, 222-223 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Consideration of this evidence does not, however, provide a \u201cblanket justification for [the defendant] to use force in resolving disputes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haddock, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 249 n.4 (1999). Instead, using the defendant\u2019s past history of abuse as \u201cone of many factors ... in determining the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s conduct,\u201d <em>id., </em>we engage in a careful assessment of the circumstances of the stabbing, the defendant\u2019s history of abuse, and the expert testimony in deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>whether \u2014 viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant (the proponent of the instruction), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cook, <em>supra </em>at 201 \u2014 the circumstances were sufficient to warrant the instruction sought.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">According to the testimony of the only percipient witness, Fouyolle, the defendant walked out of the bedroom, in which she and Petitry had been arguing, and stabbed Petitry in the chest with a shard of glass.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The witness testified that, during the argument preceding the stabbing, he looked into the bedroom once and saw Petitry positioned on top of the defendant. There was also evidence that Petitry may have held the door closed momentarily after leaving the room, and may have been moving toward the defendant just before the stabbing as she stepped out of the bedroom. In her statements to the police, the defendant said that Petitry, who was a \u201cbig, strong, [and] muscular\u201d man, had \u201chit her and she was afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">According to the defendant\u2019s experts, the defendant, who had multiple diagnoses of PTSD and depression, was unmedicated at the time of the stabbing. These experts testified that \u201cthat glass was likely to be as much for defense, because . . . she was terrified.\u201d Petitry \u2014 who had been \u201caggressive,\u201d \u201cabusive,\u201d and \u201ccontrolling\u201d in the relationship \u2014 had an elevated blood alcohol content; the defendant had stated that \u201che became even more abusive and aggressive\u201d when under the influence of alcohol. On one occasion, three days before the stabbing, the defendant expressed a fear that, if she sought a restraining order against Petitry, he would kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The defendant\u2019s experts also described how the defendant\u2019s history of abuse could affect her assessment of the situation. According to Burgess, that Petitry had forced himself on top of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the defendant \u201ccertainly had enough intensity to trigger the incident that she had with [her previous boy friend who had tried to suffocate her while biting a mole off her cheek].\u201d Keane also viewed this as \u201ca key trigger back to a prior experience that she was again being assaulted by someone on top of her.\u201d Burgess testified that it did not matter whether the earlier abuse was at the hands of Petitry or another individual, because \u201cit still is going after the fear response because it activates the memories, the traumatic memories, because it\u2019s a similar kind of situation.\u201d Even though Petitry had left the room, the defendant remained \u201cfrightened\u201d and, by remaining in the room, was \u201ccaptive, if you will, to further injury in her mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, a jury instruction on the excessive use of force in self-defense was required.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s statements to the police and to the experts were sufficient to establish, for purposes of the requested instruction, that she was actually in fear of serious bodily injury, if not also in a dissociative state, at the time of the stabbing. Although the percipient witness testified that Petitry had left the room, expert testimony established that the argument in the bedroom, including Petitry\u2019s positioning of himself on top of the defendant, had acted as a \u201ctrigger\u201d in the defendant\u2019s mind, from which she suffered continuing injury even in the \u201c[n]ot even ten seconds\u201d after he had left the room. Contrast <em>State </em>v. <em>Hendrickson, </em>81 Wash. App. 397, 398-399 (1996). Assessing the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s fear in light of her history of abuse, as called for by \u00a7 23F, we cannot say, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, that this matter should have been removed from the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Declining to give this instruction prejudiced the defendant. \u201cThe evidence warranted a finding of excessive force in self-defense, and if the jury so found, the defendant was entitled to a verdict of manslaughter. There can be no doubt of a miscar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>riage of justice if a defendant guilty of manslaughter is serving the penalty for murder.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>454 Mass. 770, 776 (2009) (concluding that same error, by itself, requires reversal of conviction of murder in first degree).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The defendant\u2019s conviction of murder in the first degree is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Effective July 8, 2008, the Department of Social Services (DSS) is now the Department of Children and Families.

The defendant\u2019s untruthfulness in those cases undermined the reliability of those experts\u2019 opinions. Here, however, the prior bad act evidence was in no way probative of the defendant\u2019s truthfulness, and thus did not undermine Burgess\u2019s opinion. Burgess was aware of both incidents, and the Commonwealth never suggested that the defendant had withheld information or been untruthful in discussing these prior incidents with Burgess.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Note that the opposing party may also undermine the expert\u2019s opinion by pointing out the expert\u2019s <em>failure </em>to rely on information that would seemingly be relevant to the expert\u2019s assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b690-8\">If anything, the allegation that the defendant had struck her son on two occasions would appear to strengthen the basis for Burgess\u2019s diagnosis, as she testified that individuals with PTSD are prone to \u201cangiy outbursts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\">The judge gave an additional limiting instruction at this point, telling the jury that this information was to put the information regarding DSS \u201cinto context\u201d and could not be considered to show the defendant\u2019s \u201cpropensity to commit the act which she\u2019s charged with.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b691-9\">During closing argument, the prosecutor returned to this theme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">\u201cThey were living together ....

Although we generally permit the Commonwealth properly to rebut a defendant\u2019s factual contentions with such evidence, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magraw, </em>426 Mass. 589, 595 (1998), the defendant made no assertions during the trial that opened the door to this information. Uncontroverted evidence of the abuse suffered by the defendant was admitted to explain the basis for the multiple expert diagnoses of PTSD and the experts\u2019 conclusions that the defendant was not criminally responsible for her actions. It did not serve to establish any character trait of the defendant as a \u201cvictim\u201d that the Commonwealth could then rebut with instances when she acted as an aggressor. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument to the contrary is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The judge gave a limiting instruction during the testimony of the DSS case worker that \u201cbecause there\u2019s been much testimony regarding what took place regarding DSS,\u201d the evidence as to the incident involving the sandal could only be considered as \u201ccontext.\u201d But the details of the complaint added little, if anything, to the context that the jury properly could consider; the only purpose this evidence could have possibly served was to prejudice the jury against the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The defendant does not argue that she was entitled to an instruction on self-defense as a complete defense. We therefore do not consider this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Although the fact that death results does not necessarily require a conclusion that a defendant used deadly force, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 396 n.3 (1998) (\u201crelevant inquiry is what level of force was used, not what the resulting injuries were\u201d), here, we conclude that the use of a sharp sixteen-inch piece of glass constitutes deadly force as a matter of law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pring-Wilson, </em>448 Mass. 718, 733 (2007), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toon, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 644 n.3 (2002) (knife constitutes deadly weapon).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The Commonwealth contends also that the defendant\u2019s theories of self-defense, reasonable provocation, and lack of criminal responsibility are inconsistent. We disagree. The expert testimony is consistent with all three theories, i.e., the defendant\u2019s reaction arose from Petitry\u2019s alleged violence and her fear in response. An attack by a victim can give rise to a need for self-defense, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>418 Mass. 1, 5 (1994), and a heat of passion resulting from reasonable provocation, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>446 Mass. 435, 444 (2006), and can trigger a defendant\u2019s mental illness such that she lacks the substantial capacity at that time both to appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct and to conform her conduct to the requirements of the law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1967). We see no inconsistency in allowing instructions on all three theories, particularly because we allow a defendant\u2019s fear to form the basis of reasonable provocation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glover, </em>459 Mass. 836, 841 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, supra </em>at 443 (\u201cReasonable provocation is provocation that \u2018would have been likely to produce in an ordinary person such a state of passion, anger, <em>fear, </em>fright, or nervous excitement as would eclipse his capacity for reflection or restraint\u2019 \u201d [emphasis added]). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapage, </em>435 Mass. 480, 486 n.7 (2001) (\u201cIn a case like this, the defendant is entitled to correct instructions on both provocation and self-defense, and the jury are to have an opportunity to consider voluntary manslaughter on both theories\u201d); Dressier, Rethinking Heat of Passion: A Defense in Search of a Rationale, 73 J.

L. &amp; Criminology 421, 448-449 (1982) (describing consistency of heat of passion, voluntary manslaughter, and self-defense in such cases).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 23F, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">\u201cIn the trial of criminal cases charging the use of force against another where the issue of defense of self or another, defense of duress or coercion, or accidental harm is asserted, a defendant shall be permitted to introduce either or both of the following in establishing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s apprehension that death or serious bodily injury was imminent, the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s belief that he had availed himself of all available means to avoid physical combat or the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s perception of the amount of force necessary to deal with the perceived threat:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>evidence that the defendant is or has been the victim of acts of physical, sexual or psychological harm or abuse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\"><em>\u201c(b) </em>evidence by expert testimony regarding the common pattern in abusive relationships; the nature and effects of physical, sexual or psychological abuse and typical responses thereto, including how those effects relate to the perception of the imminent nature of the threat of death or serious bodily harm; the relevant facts and circumstances which form the basis for such opinion; and evidence whether the defendant displayed characteristics common to victims of abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\">This is consistent with other evidentiary rules that have long allowed the admission of certain information known to the defendant for the purposes of a claim of self-defense.
