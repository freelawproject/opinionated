Groen (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), who assert that they were holders of Morgan Stanley stock at all relevant times, bring this derivative action on behalf of Morgan Stanley against former and current officers and directors of Morgan Stanley (\u201cDefendants\u201d), alleging violations of Sections 14(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and asserting various state common law claims including breaches of fiduciary duty, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and legal malpractice. The Court has jurisdiction of Plaintiffs\u2019 federal claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a. The Court has supplemental jurisdiction of Plaintiffs\u2019 common law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">Defendants move, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), to dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended Derivative Complaint (\u201cSAC\u201d) for failure to state a claim, arguing that Plaintiffs failed to meet the demand requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1 and that Plaintiffs\u2019 pleading is deficient on the merits as well. The Court has considered thoroughly the arguments and submissions of the parties in connection with these motions. For the reasons that follow, Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss are granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">The Court construes all of Plaintiffs\u2019 well-pleaded, non-conclusory allegations as true in deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The allegations material to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>resolution of this motion are as follows. Plaintiffs were shareholders of Morgan Stanley at all relevant times. Nominal Defendant Morgan Stanley is a corporation organized under Delaware law with its headquarters located in New York. Morgan Stanley is a financial services company which offers investment banking, institutional sales, trading and research of equities and bonds, individual investor services, investment management services and credit services. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 41M6.) Defendants, who are former and current directors or officers of Morgan Stanley, are named as follows: Phillip J. Purcell (\u201cPurcell\u201d), Edward A. Brennan (\u201cBrennan\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Stephen S. Crawford(\u201cCrawford\u201d), Sir Howard J. Davies (\u201cDavies\u201d), John E. Jacob (\u201cJacob\u201d), C. Robert Kidder (\u201cKidder\u201d), Charles F. Knight (\u201cKnight\u201d), John W. Madigan (\u201cMadigan\u201d), Miles L. Marsh (\u201cMarsh\u201d), Michael M. Miles (\u201cMiles\u201d), Laura D\u2019Andrea Tyson (\u201cTyson\u201d), Klaus Zumwinkel (\u201cZumwinkel\u201d) and Donald Kempf (\u201cKempf\u2019). <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">On December 3, 2002, Morgan Stanley paid the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) a $8.25 million fine for failing to comply with various SEC regulations that required investment banks such as Morgan Stanley to retain e-mail for certain periods of time. <em>See </em>17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.17a-4(b)(4). Morgan Stanley also agreed at that time to cease and desist from its noncompliance. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.) Several years later, in January of 2005, the SEC Division of Enforcement issued a \u201cWells Notice\u201d to Morgan Stanley, noting Morgan Stanley\u2019s potential violation of the 2002 cease-and-desist order and informing it of the Division\u2019s recommendation that the SEC pursue an enforcement action relating to Morgan Stanley\u2019s failure to retain emails. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 109.) In the same month, the board voted to increase its own compensation. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">On or around February 15, 2005, a proxy statement was issued in connection with the annual shareholders meeting scheduled for March 15, 2005, at which four board members \u2014 Jacob, Knight, Marsh and Tyson \u2014 were seeking re-election. Defendants are alleged to have \u201cconcealed\u201d from any mention in the proxy statement the fact that a Wells Notice had been received. (SAC \u00b6 110.) In addition, Defendants are alleged to have \u201cconcealed\u201d the Wells Notice from the public so that Morgan Stanley\u2019s repurchase of its own stock sometime in the first quarter of 2005 would be at an \u201cartificially inflated price.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 174.) On March 15, 2005, Jacob, Knight, Marsh and Tyson, who did not face any opposition, were re-elected. Morgan Stanley did not reveal the Wells Notice until April 6, 2005, in its quarterly report. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Notwithstanding Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that raises in director compensation were approved by the board in January 2005 (SAC \u00b6 151), Plaintiffs also occasionally refer to increases in board compensation that supposedly resulted from stockholder approval of the February 2005 proxy statement\u2019s proposals <em>(see, e.g., id. </em>\u00b6 170), though nothing in the actual proxy statement<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> makes any mention of any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>proposed compensation changes. <em>(See </em>Feb. 15, 2005 Proxy Statement, annexed to Aug. 7, 2006, Aff. of Paul Vizcarrondo, Jr. as Ex. A.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The SAC also alleges that Morgan Stanley\u2019s aircraft leasing business, AWAS, was severely impaired on or around February 2005, and that Morgan Stanley was obligated under relevant accounting standards to write down the value of AWAS by an unspecified amount at an earlier, unspecified time. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 144-148.) In Plaintiffs\u2019 Opposition to the Independent Directors\u2019 motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs assert for the first time that the board concealed information pertaining to the impairment of AWAS from being revealed in the February 2005 proxy statement. (Opp\u2019n to Independent Directors\u2019 Mot. to Dismiss at 9-10.) However, excerpts from Morgan Stanley\u2019s public filings with the SEC from 2002 to 2005 show<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that there were write-downs in prior periods as well as disclosures relating to problems with the aircraft leasing business following the events of September 11, 2001. <em>(See </em>Vizcarrondo Aff. Exs. B-E.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In May 2005, in separate litigation, a Florida trial court entered a judgment against Morgan Stanley in the amount of about $1.5 billion. Plaintiffs allege that the large judgment resulted in part from an adverse inference order entered in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s improper handling of electronic discovery in that case. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 31, 170.) <em>See generally Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley, Inc., </em>No. CA 03-5045 AI, 2005 WL 674885 (Fla.Gir.Ct Mar.23, 2005) (adverse inference order). The $1.5 billion verdict was later reversed by the appellate court, however, and the Supreme Court of Florida subsequently denied a petition for review of that reversal decision. <em>See generally Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc. v. Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc., </em>955 So.2d 1124 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007); <em>Coleman (Parent) Holdings, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc., </em>No. SC07-1251, 2007 WL 4336316 (Fla. Dec.12, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Plaintiffs argue that Defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a)) and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by concealing any mention of the Wells Notice in the February 2005 proxy statement. Plaintiffs additionally argue in their Opposition that they are pursuing a Section 14(a) claim premised on the board\u2019s concealment of AWAS\u2019s impairment. No such claim is, however, the allegation of which is not pleaded in the SAC. Plaintiffs also claim that Defendants violated Section 10(b) (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b)) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> asserting that the then-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>director defendants and Kempf concealed the Wells Notice from the public in order to approve Morgan Stanley\u2019s repurchase of its own stock at artificially inflated prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Plaintiffs did not make a demand on the Morgan Stanley board to sue any of the defendants on any of the claims asserted in the SAC or described in the Opposition. (SAC \u00b6 161.) In attempting to explain why making such a demand would be futile, Plaintiffs make generalized allegations to the effect that most of the defendants desire to maintain their offices and would never vote to sue themselves. Moreover, Plaintiffs set forth numerous allegations of personal connections among Defendants through past and present common board memberships, social relationships, geographic proximity, common use of Purcell\u2019s corporate jet, and having recruited one another to the Morgan Stanley board, arguing that such connections preclude the directors\u2019 exercise of independent judgment. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47-48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">It is a long held principle of corporate law that directors manage the business of the corporation. <em>Aronson v. Lewis, </em>473 A.2d 805, 811 (Del.1984), <em>overruled on other grounds by Brehm v. Eisner, </em>746 A.2d 244 (Del.2000). Where a shareholder brings a derivative lawsuit on behalf of the corporation against the directors based on their actions or failure to act, there is a threshold question of standing, focused on whether the shareholder has exhausted in-tracorporate remedies, namely, whether the shareholder has made a demand on the board of directors. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23.1; <em>accord </em>Del. Ch. Ct. R. 23.1. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1 requires that the complaint \u201cstate with particularity any effort by the plaintiff to obtain the desired action from the directors ... and the reasons for not obtaining the action or not making the effort.\u201d <em>Id.; accord </em>Del. Ch. Ct. R. 23.1. Because Rule 23.1 requires that Plaintiffs make particularized allegations, it imposes a pleading standard higher than the normal standard applicable to the analysis of a pleading challenged under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>In re Trump Hotels S\u2019holder Derivative Litig., </em>Nos. 96 Civ. 7820 DAB, 96 Civ. 8527 DAB, 2000 WL 1371317, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept.21, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">In the instant matter, Plaintiffs concede that they did not make a demand on the Defendants. Their standing to raise the claims on Morgan Stanley\u2019s behalf therefore turns on the question of demand futility. The Court evaluates demand futility according to the law of the state in which the company is incorporated, and therefore applies Delaware state law here. <em>In re Trump Hotels, </em>2000 WL 1371317, at *6 (citing <em>Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>500 U.S. 90, 99, 111 S.Ct. 1711, 114 L.Ed.2d 152 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">\n<em>Applicable Demand Futility Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">In <em>Aronson v. Lewis, </em>473 A.2d 805 (Del. 1984), the Delaware Supreme Court held that plaintiffs seeking to establish demand futility must \u201cplead particularized facts that create a reasonable doubt that 1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>directors ar\u00e9 disinterested and independent, or [that] 2) the challenged transaction was a valid exercise of business judgment.\u201d <em>Seminaris v. Lando, </em>662 A.2d 1350, 1354 (Del.Ch.1995) (citing <em>Aronson, </em>473 A.2d at 814). Such reasonable doubt must be raised as to a majority of the board of directors sitting at the time the complaint is filed. <em>See Harris v. Carter, </em>582 A.2d 222, 228 (Del.Ch.1990).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whether or not \u201creasonable doubt\u201d exists \u201cmust be decided by the trial court on a case-by-case basis\u201d and not by any \u201crote and inelastic\u201d criteria. <em>Grobow v. Perot, </em>539 A.2d 180, 186 (Del.1988), <em>overruled on other grounds by Brehm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Defendants argue, however, that the Court should not apply the two-pronged <em>Aronson </em>test, and that the Court should instead apply the demand futility test established by the Delaware Supreme Court in <em>Rales v. Blasband, </em>634 A.2d 927 (Del. 1993). The <em>Rales </em>test essentially eliminates the business judgment rule prong of the <em>Aronson </em>test and focuses solely on whether the pleadings create a reasonable doubt that a majority of directors are disinterested and independent. <em>See Rales, </em>634 A.2d at 933-34. Courts apply the <em>Rales </em>test \u201cwhere the subject of the derivative suit is not a business decision of the board,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 934, because in such a scenario, it would not be possible to apply the second prong of the <em>Aronson </em>test \u2014 whether a decision was the product of sound business judgment \u2014 when there is no decision to analyze in the first place. <em>Id. </em>at 933 (\u201cThe absence of board action, therefore, makes it impossible to perform the essential inquiry contemplated by <em>Aron-son </em>\u2014 whether the directors have acted in conformity with the business judgment rule in approving the challenged transaction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The Court finds that the <em>Rales </em>standard is applicable here, because the isolated and conclusory references to the board\u2019s \u201cconcealment]\u201d of, or failure to \u201cdisclose,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s receipt of the Wells Notice (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 98, 110), are insufficiently particularized to allege a specific board decision to omit the information from the proxy statement. <em>See, e.g., IAC/InterActi-veCorp. Sec. Litig., </em>478 F.Supp.2d 574, 596 (S.D.N.Y.2007) <em>(Rales </em>applied where complaint alleged that defendant directors allowed misleading financial prospects to reach the public). There are no particularized allegations as to when any board member had any knowledge of the Wells Notice, no allegations explaining any process by which the board decided to omit the information, and no allegation that the board actively or purposefully made a decision to omit the information. <em>Compare In re Abbott Laboratories Deriv. S\u2019holders Litig., </em>325 F.3d 795, 806 (7th Cir.2003) (applying <em>Aronson </em>where complaint contained particularized allegations that \u201cthe board knew of the problems and decided no action was required\u201d) <em>with Fink v. Weill, </em>No. 02 Civ. 10250(LTS)(RLE), 2005 WL 2298224, *3 n. 6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 19, 2005) (applying <em>Rales </em>where Plaintiff proffered \u201cgeneralized allegations that the defendant board members ... participated\u201d in the challenged activity and \u201cequally generalized allegations of knowledge\u201d); <em>see Rales, </em>634 A.2d at 933 (instruction to apply <em>Rales </em>test \u201c[w]here there is no conscious decision by directors to act or refrain from acting\u201d). Therefore, the <em>Rales </em>standard applies. The Court analyzes Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) and Section 10(b) claims sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>arately in determining whether the facts alleged in the SAC are sufficient to create any reasonable doubt as to the board members\u2019 disinterestedness and independence.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\n<em>The Section 11(a) Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated Section 14(a) by failing to disclose the Wells Notice in the February 2005 proxy statement. The <em>Rales </em>standard requires the Court to determine whether there are sufficient allegations in the SAC to create a reasonable doubt as to whether a majority of the board sitting at the time the original complaint was filed would have been sufficiently disinterested and independent in deciding whether Morgan Stanley should pursue the Section 14(a) claim that Plaintiffs have asserted in this action had a demand been made. <em>Disinterestedness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u201cDisinterested\u201d in this context generally means that \u201cdirectors can neither appear\u2019 on both sides of a transaction nor expect to derive any personal financial benefit\u201d from the transaction. <em>Aronson, </em>473 A.2d at 812. The February 2005 proxy statement was issued in connection with the re-election of four unopposed board members, and Plaintiffs essentially assert that Defendants are not disinterested because of their desire to \u201cperpetuate their control\u201d of Morgan Stanley. <em>(See, e.g., </em>SAC \u00b6 150.) However, there are no particularized allegations demonstrating that the board members\u2019 prospects of remaining in office were ever in serious doubt, or would have been in serious doubt if the Wells Notice had been revealed to shareholders in February 2005. <em>See Green v. Phillips, </em>Civil Action No. 14436, 1996 WL 342093, at *4 (Del.Ch. June 19, 1996) (no showing of disinterestedness where the complaint pleaded \u201cno facts demonstrating an <em>actual </em>threat to the directors\u2019 positions\u201d) (emphasis in original). Nothing in the SAC asserts that the allegedly improper actions resulting in the issuance of the Wells Notice directly impugned the \u201chonesty, loyalty or competency of [the] directors,\u201d <em>Maldonado v. Flynn, </em>597 F.2d 789, 796 (2d Cir.1979), in that there is no articulated connection between the circumstances giving rise to the Wells Notice warning and any actions taken by, or with the authorization of, any of the four board members up for re-election. <em>Cf In re Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. S\u2019holder Derivative Litig., </em>830 F.Supp. 361, 366 (S.D.Tex.1993) (\u201cplaintiffs do not indicate that any of the pending suits[, the existence of which was omitted from the proxy statement,] were against directors elected by votes on the proxy solicitations at issue\u201d). Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Defendants are not disinterested because of their desire to remain in office are insufficiently substantiated with particularized allegations to create an issue as to demand futility.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Nor are Plaintiffs\u2019 unsubstantiated, generalized allegations with respect to remaining in power sufficient in and of themselves. <em>See Lewis v. Graves, </em>701 F.2d 245, 250 (2d Cir.1983) (\u201cIf a derivative plaintiff could show self-interest in a transaction by mere conclusory allegations that the defendant directors approved a business acquisition simply to secure their own positions, without providing any logical or factual nexus between the transaction and the asserted entrenchment, the demand requirement of Rule 23.1 would ... become virtually meaningless\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">A reasonable doubt as to disinterestedness can also be shown if Plaintiffs\u2019 particularized allegations, construed as true, demonstrate a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d of Defendants\u2019 personal liability. <em>Rales, </em>634 A.2d at 936 (finding a reasonable doubt of disinterestedness where \u201cthe potential for liability is not \u2018a mere threat\u2019 but instead may rise to \u2018a substantial likelihood.\u2019 \u201d) (citing <em>Aronson, </em>473 A.2d at 815). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201cTo state a claim under Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9, a shareholder must allege that (1) his proxy was solicited for authorization of a corporate action; and (2) the proxy solicitation was materially false or misleading.\u201d <em>In re Trump Hotels, </em>2000 WL 1371317, at *11 (citing <em>Mills v. Elec. Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 U.S. 375, 384-85, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970)). To succeed on a Section 14(a) claim, a plaintiff must make \u201ca sufficient showing of [a] causal relationship between the violation and the injury for which he seeks redress ... [by proving] that the proxy solicitation itself ... was an essential link in the accomplishment of the transaction.\u201d <em>Mills v. Elec. Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 U.S. 375, 385, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970). In this case, the SAC contains no particularized allegations that, construed as true, would indicate a substantial likelihood of Section 14(a) liability on the part of any of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The SAC alleges that, as a result of the re-election of Jacob, Knight, Marsh and Tyson in March 2005, Morgan Stanley suffered the $1.5 billion jury verdict in May 2005 and was exposed to \u201cadditional civil fines and penalties for continuously flaunting federal law requiring e-mails to be retained.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 170.) The jury verdict however, was later reversed. Moreover, Plaintiffs allege no facts linking the reelection with any action or decision that resulted in the $1.5 billion verdict. The only other \u201ccivil fines and penalties\u201d mentioned in the SAC in connection with email retention all occurred <em>prior to </em>the alleged proxy omission <em>(see, e.g., id. </em>\u00b6 24) and, to the extent Plaintiffs allege future penalty exposure, no particularized allegations exist to that effect. Plaintiffs\u2019 Opposition additionally sets forth conclusory theories of causation, not pleaded in the SAC, between the March 2005 re-election and various injuries. These injuries include increased board compensation, allegedly wasteful severance packages, and drops in stock prices. (Opp\u2019n to Independent Directors at 16.) However, the vote to increase board compensation occurred in January 2005 <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 151), and nothing in the actual proxy statement seeks approval of, or indeed makes any mention of any such proposed compensation changes;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and nothing specific is asserted connecting the re-election of the four board members with actions or authorizations of action directly giving rise to the severance packages or drops in the price of Morgan Stanley stock. <em>See Marburg Mgmt., Inc. v. Kohn, </em>629 F.2d 705, 722 (2d Cir.1980) (\u201cFor example, if corporate officers are elected through solicitations which failed to disclose a material lack of qualifications, and those improperly elected officers subsequently proceed to harm the corporation and its shareholders through acts of deceit, waste or mismanagement which were not themselves authorized by the proxies, a suit to permit recovery of resultant damages will not be permitted\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 eleventh-hour attempts to articulate causal links not even alleged in the SAC are conclusory and proffer no facts demonstrating any substantial likelihood of success on the Section 14(a) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 ability to demonstrate a substantial risk of liability is further undermined by the lack of any specific allegations that the omission of information regarding the Wells Notice violated established SEC regulations or any rules implicit in the regulations that specifically govern proxy statements issued in connection with board elections and are intended to ensure that shareholders are not misled. <em>See generally United States v. Matthews, </em>787 F.2d 38, 48 (2d Cir. 1986) (rejecting requirement that \u201cmanagement make qualitative disclosures that were not at least implicit in the Commission\u2019s rules\u201d); Schedule 14A, Item 7(b), 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-101 (proxy materials must disclose litigation pending \u201cthat are material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any director [up for election]\u201d).

McGrath, </em>No. 06 Civ. 1684 CM, 2007 WL 1180650, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.16, 2007) (\u201cThe rote allegation that directors would have to sue themselves has been consistently rejected as a basis for excusing demand .... The existence of a so-called \u2018insured versus insured\u2019 exclusion ... likewise fails to establish director interest. Indeed, this argument has been rejected repeatedly under Delaware law.\u201d); <em>Brehm, </em>746 A.2d at 257 n. 34 (\u201cIt is no answer to say that demand is necessarily futile because (a) the directors \u2018would have to sue themselves, thereby placing the conduct of the litigation in hostile hands,\u2019 or (b) that they approved the underlying transaction\u201d); <em>Decker v.

In the demand futility context, \u201cindependent\u201d means that \u201ca director\u2019s decision is based on the corporate merits of the subject before the board rather than extraneous considerations or influences.\u201d <em>Aronson, </em>473 A.2d at 816. Plaintiffs\u2019 SAC lists Defendants\u2019 past and current business associations with one another (SAC \u00b647(0)\u00ae-(vi));<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> notes that most of the Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>reside \u201cin Chicago or the Midwest\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 47(c)(vii)); and alleges that Purcell, Knight and Brennan were members of the Augusta National Golf Club <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 47(c) (viii)); that Purcell permitted board members to have personal use of the corporate jet <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 47(d)); that Purcell recruited Brennan, Davies, Jacob, Knight, Madigan and Tyson to the Morgan Stanley board <em>(id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48(b), 50, 51, 53, 54, 57); and that Miles recruited Marsh and Kidder to the Morgan Stanley board <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 47(c)(iii)). The existence of these relationships, without more, falls far short of suggesting that \u201cthe directors are \u2018beholden\u2019 to [interested parties] or so under their influence that their discretion would be sterilized.\u201d <em>Weill, </em>2005 WL 2298224, at *3 (quoting <em>Rales, </em>634 A.2d at 936); <em>see also Beam v.

[F]or presuit demand purposes, friendship must be accompanied by substantially more in the nature of serious allegations that would lead to a reasonable doubt as to a director\u2019s independence.\u201d); <em>Aronson, </em>473 A.2d at 816 (\u201cit is not enough to charge that a director was nominated by or elected at the behest of those controlling the outcome of a corporate election. That is the usual way a person becomes a corporate director.\u201d); <em>Halpert Enters. v.

Brown, </em>913 F.Supp. 260, 266 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (to same effect). Nor do Plaintiffs plead any facts suggesting that the use of the corporate jet would somehow translate into an obligation to repay Purcell in the future in the form of favorable board action, or explain how such an extraneous obligation, if any, would continue to exist when Purcell, the source of those privileges, had already left by the time the original complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Unlike the pleadings at issue in the cases on which Plaintiffs rely, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations simply lack specificity concerning any improper benefit that might or would accrue to a director-defendant for voting against a demand to sue a former or current director or officer. <em>See, e.g., Int\u2019l Equity Capital Growth Fund, L.P. v. Clegg, </em>No. Civ.A. 14995, 1997 WL 208955, at *3 (Del.Ch. Apr.22, 1997) (demand was futile where defendant-CEO was also a majority shareholder of the nominal-defendant corporation and could, and indeed did on several occasions, unilaterally fire any board member who exercised independent judgment); <em>In re New Valley Corp. Derivative Litig., </em>No. Civ.A. 17649, 2001 WL 50212, at *7 (DeLCh. Jan.ll, 2001) (demand was futile where, in an action alleging impropriety of defendant-directors\u2019 approval of a substantial purchase of the assets of another corporation, several defendants held substantial equity in or were employed by the other corporation); <em>Harbor Fin. Partners v. Huizenga, </em>751 A.2d 879, 889 (Del.Ch.1999) (demand was futile where, in addition to defendant-director\u2019s 30-year history of \u201cmutually advantageous business relations\u201d with fellow defendant-director and their familial relationship as brothers-in-law, defendant-director\u2019s decision to sue would threaten $235 million of his stock holdings); <em>Haseotes v. Bentas, </em>No. Civ.A. 19155 NC, 2002 WL 31058540 (Del.Ch.2002) (demand on particular di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>rector-defendant to vote to approve a lawsuit against Ms sister director-defendant was futile where, without conceivable reason, director-defendant once sued a partnership and every single partner in the partnership except his sister).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Defendants violated Section 14(a) by failing to disclose an unspecified degree of impairment in the value of AWAS in the February 2005 proxy statement are similarly insufficient to create the requisite reasonable doubt, particularly in light of the SEC filings proffered by Defendants indicating that write-downs were in fact made between 2002 and 2005. For this reason, and for substantially the same reasons set forth in this Opinion with respect to disinterestedness and independence, there is no showing of demand futility for a Section 14(a) claim as premised on the AWAS situation even if such allegations were properly pleaded in the SAC. Therefore, the SAC will be dismissed to the extent Plaintiffs are attempting to sue on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">On the basis of the foregoing, the SAC does not create any reasonable doubt as to the relevant director-defendants\u2019 disinterestedness or independence with respect to the Section 14(a) claim and, therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) claim will be dismissed for failure to plead demand futility pursuant to <em>Rales.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Moreover, even if the Court were to infer, based solely on Plaintiffs\u2019 generalized allegation that Defendants \u201cconcealed\u201d or \u201cdid not disclose\u201d the Wells Notice (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 110, 167), that Defendants personally knew about the Wells Notice and decided as a board to omit mention of the notice from the proxy statement, and therefore conclude that a specific board decision was being challenged by Plaintiffs such that the business judgment prong of <em>Aronson </em>would apply, Plaintiffs would still fail to sufficiently plead demand futility. For substantially the same reasons that led the Court to conclude that Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that any of the defendants faces a substantial risk of liability on the Section 14(a) claim, Plaintiffs have failed to proffer facts sufficient to create a reasonable doubt that a decision to omit mention of the Wells Notice from the proxy statement would pass the business judgment test.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) claim without prejudice to a claim that may be raised by Plaintiffs on behalf of Morgan Stanley following a proper demand on the Morgan Stanley board. <em>See Grossman v. Johnson, </em>674 F.2d 115, 125-26 (1st Cir. 1982); <em>Shlensky v. Dorsey, </em>574 F.2d 131, 141-42 (3d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">\n<em>The Section 10(b) Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 10(b) claim asserts that, because the board did not reveal the Wells Notice to the public, Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock prices were artificially inflated, resulting in damages to Morgan Stanley when it repurchased its own stock during the first quarter of 2005. Plaintiffs seek, on behalf of Morgan Stanley, damages for the artificially high prices that it paid for the stock at that time. Plaintiffs did not make a demand on the board as to this claim, and the SAC is devoid of any specific allegations of a board decision to conceal the Wells Notice from the public, so the Court must again apply the <em>Rales </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">The pleadings do not provide a factual basis for reasonable doubt with respect to Defendants\u2019 disinterestedness or independence as to this claim. As explained in the preceding Section 14(a) analysis, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as to business and social relationships are insufficient to create any reasonable doubt as to Defendants\u2019 independence. With regard to disinterestedness, there are no allegations whatsoever as to what specific benefit was obtained by any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>defendant as a result of Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock repurchase, and as such there is no improper motive shown that would cast doubt on whether Defendants would be disinterested in considering whether to adopt Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 10(b) claim. The lack of any particularized allegation as to motive also derails any attempt by Plaintiffs to establish a substantial likelihood of liability with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 10(b) claim. Moreover, without any particularized allegation pointing to improper motive, the SAC also fails to create reasonable doubt with respect to business judgment even if <em>Aronson </em>were to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-18\">For these reasons, the Section 10(b) claim does not survive the <em>Rales </em>analysis and the claim is dismissed without prejudice to a derivative claim being raised after a proper demand is made on the Morgan Stanley board.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-19\">\n<em>Common Law Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-20\">Having dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 federal claims, the only claims over which the Court has original jurisdiction, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction of Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining common law claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Valencia v. Lee, </em>316 F.3d 299, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-21\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-22\">For the foregoing reasons, Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint are granted, without prejudice to renewal following a proper demand on the Morgan Stanley board.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-23\">The Clerk of Court is respectfully requested to terminate all of the pending motions, enter judgment dismissing the federal claims for failure to make a proper demand on the Board of Directors and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction of the common law claims, and to close this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-12\">.

The factual summary in this section focuses on the allegations underlying Plaintiffs\u2019 federal claims and those relevant to the question of whether Plaintiffs were required to have made a demand on the board before asserting their federal claims on behalf of the corporation. In light of the Court's determination, explained below, that Plaintiffs failed to make the required demands with respect to their federal claims, it is unnecessary for the Court to address the parties\u2019 arguments relating to Plaintiffs\u2019 common law claims and unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>sary, as well, for the Court to summarize here the allegations underlying those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">.Defendant Brennan has died since the filing of this action.
