Anderson, assignee of an insurer who reimbursed the Gandrups for a portion of their loss. They claim that the alleged damage was the proximate result of the spread of fire from a drainage ditch operated and maintained by the defendants across the Gandrup property. They seek to hold the defendant county under the Public Liability Act, and the other defendants (employees of the county) for negligence in the setting and supervision of the fire along the county\u2019s ditch right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The verdict of the jury was for the defendants. Plaintiffs have appealed, claiming insufficiency of the evidence, errors in the giving and refusing of instructions, and erroneous denial of their motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">(1) <em>Does the evidence support the </em>verdict? <em>Yes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">The ditch extends north and south through plaintiffs\u2019 land. A section was cleared by burning conducted by two county employees. One of them cut the weeds and grass with a scythe. The cuttings would fall into the bottom of the ditch. The other workman, using mobile water sprinkling equipment, sprayed the bank before the burning and the ashes after the burning. They burned for a distance of only about 10 feet at a time. They worked in this fashion on the morning of October 11 and again on the morning of October 13. They returned in the afternoon of each of those days, made an inspection and found no sign of fire. They repeated such inspections about five times, at intervals, between the 13th and the 26th of October, 1954, the day of the burning of plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>property. Upon each such occasion, they found no sign of fire in the ditch. There was evidence that this method of burning was standard approved practice. A burning permit had been obtained and the nearby forestry station had been notified of the general area in which the burning would be done. Such evidence would support an inference of non-negligence upon the part of the county employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">In thus cleaning the ditch, the defendants started near plaintiffs\u2019 north line and proceeded about 800 feet southerly where they encountered water in the ditch and stopped. This point was about 450 feet north of the spot where plaintiffs claim the fire of October 26 started. The topsoil is underlaid by a peat formation, through which, according to plaintiffs\u2019 theory, the fire traveled underground. But there is evidence that it would travel only about 414 feet in seven days and that the peat could not burn longer than 10 days without igniting the dry grass and weeds on the surface. Also, three eye-witnesses testified that on October 26 the fire started in an area south of plaintiffs\u2019 property, considerably west of the ditch, well over one thousand feet south and west of the southerly end of the burned section of the ditch. This evidence would support a finding that the defendants\u2019 ditch-burning was not the cause of the fire that burned plaintiffs\u2019 property on the 26th of October.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Plaintiffs invoke the testimony of a number of their witnesses which conflicted significantly with the evidence above summarized. That, however, merely produced a conflict which it was the function of the jury to resolve and which the jury did resolve in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The same evidence would support a finding that the injuries to plaintiffs\u2019 property did not result from a \u201cdangerous or defective condition of public property\u201d of the county nor from such a condition of such property, if any, that was known to the persons \u201cauthorized to remedy the condition\u201d or of which condition such persons had constructive notice (Gov. Code, \u00a7 53051.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">(2) <em>Was it prejudicial error to deny plaintiffs\u2019 instruction on res ipsa loquitur? </em>No.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Two of plaintiffs\u2019 instructions on this subject erroneously took from the jury the question whether the fire that burned plaintiffs\u2019 property proximately resulted from the defendants\u2019 ditch-burning operation. Bach would have told the jury that \u201cfrom the happening of the fire involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>this case, as established by the evidence,\u201d an inference arose \u201cthat the proximate cause of the fire was some negligent conduct on the part of the defendants.\"<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> If the court had given such an instruction it would have usurped the jury\u2019s function of resolving the conflict of evidence on the question of a causal connection between the ditch-burning and the fire that consumed plaintiffs\u2019 property. That, clearly, would have been a gross error. <em>(Snyder </em>v. <em>Hollingbery, </em>141 Cal.App.2d 520, 526-527 [297 P.2d 485]; <em>Hardin </em>v. <em>San Jose City Lines, Inc., </em>41 Cal.2d 432, 435 [260 P.2d 63].)  Where the evidence is conflicting or subject to different inferences, it is for the jury under proper instructions to determine whether each oE the conditions necessary to bring into play the rule of res ipsa loquitur are present. <em>(Seneris </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>45 Cal.2d 811, 826-827 [291 P.2d 915, 53 A.L.R.2d 124], and authorities there cited.) [4] The other instructions of plaintiffs on this subject were so closely tied into those just discussed, by specific cross-references, they would have been incomplete if given alone. They were inseparable without considerable revision as to\" form and content. The trial court was under no duty to undertake such a revision. It is, therefore, unnecessary to decide whether or not instructions on this subject, if properly expressed (as these were not), should have been given if requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">(3) <em>Did the trial court give prejudicially erroneous instructionsf No.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Defendants requested an instruction on the exercise of ordinary care - (based on BAJI 101E) which used the words \u201ccontributorily negligent\u201d as well as \u201cnegligent.\u201d Before giving it the court crossed out the words \u201ccontributorily negligent\u201d but in reading to the jury included them where they occurred in the forepart of the instruction. Realizing the error (there was no issue of contributory negligence in this ease) the judge stopped and said \u201cExcuse me, I will strike all reference to contributory negligence as was previously indicated, as that is not an issue in the case. So, let me reread this instruction. \u2019 \u2019 He then reread the instruction, omitting all reference to contributory negligence. Manifestly, any harmful effect which the inadvertent use of the word \u201ccontributorily\u201d might otherwise have had was promptly and effectively erased.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Plaintiffs criticize an instruction which informed the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>that in the maintenance of the drainage ditch area the county is not a guarantor of the property of adjoining residents or property holders. The criticism seems to be that it would have been appropriate if plaintiffs had been injured while using the ditch but not otherwise. We see no merit in this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Concerning instructions on the Public Liability Act, plaintiffs criticize the use of certain words and phrases as a source of confusion to the jury. Our reading of those instructions gives us no such impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">(4) <em>Was prejudicial error committed in the refusal of certain of plaintiffs\u2019 instructions? No.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">One of plaintiffs\u2019 rejected instructions defined a private nuisance and the liability of one who commits such a nuisance. Whether or not this rejection was erroneous has become moot in view of the verdict against plaintiffs in respect to their cause of action predicated upon the Public Liability Act. This is so for the reasons stated and upon the basis of the authorities cited, in respect to the fourth count of the complaint, in the recent ease of <em>Behr </em>v. <em>County of Santa Cruz, </em>172 Cal.App.2d 697, 710-714 [342 P.2d 987].</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Another of the rejected instructions was intended to present the issue of inverse condemnation. Even if the facts of this ease warranted the giving of such an instruction, the instruction presented by plaintiffs shot wide of the mark. It would have imposed absolute liability upon the county if the jury were to find that the county caused \u201cthe doing of work according to plans theretofore adopted and authorized\u201d and if the work was performed \u201cin conformity with the plans\u201d and if \u201cthe work thus planned or authorized\u201d <em>resulted </em>\u201cin an injury to adjacent property.\u201d This would have imposed absolute liability regardless of fault. The duty of the sovereign to compensate when \u201cprivate property\u201d is \u201ctaken or damaged for public use\u201d (State Const., art. I, \u00a7 14) is not that broad in scope.  \u201c Section 14 ... is designed not to create new causes of action but only to give the private property owner a remedy he would not otherwise have against the state for the unlawful dispossession, destruction or damage of his property. The state is therefore not liable under this provision for property damage that is <em>damnum absque injuria. </em> If the property owner would have no cause of action against a private citizen on the same facts, he can have no claim for compensation against the state under section 14 . . .  The effect of section 14 is to waive the immunity of the state where property is taken or damaged for public purposes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>To bring his complaint within the provision, the plaintiff must show not only a taking or damaging for a public use but also that it is actionable under the general law.\u201d <em>(Bauer </em>v. <em>County of Ventura, </em>45 Cal.2d 276, 282-283 [289 P.2d 1].)  We find no error in the rejection of the instruction under discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Plaintiffs question the rejection of 12 other instructions the subject matter of which appears to have been presented to the jury quite adequately in instructions which the court did give. The variances in form and wording do not appear significant to us. Certainly, plaintiffs suffered no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">(5) <em>Did the court err in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial? No.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The motion for new trial was predicated upon newly discovered evidence; i.e., two witnesses whose testimony would \u20181 establish that the fire did not start in an area some Two Hundred (200) yards below the house\u201d on plaintiffs\u2019 property, according to the affidavit filed in support of the motion.  The affidavit declared that these witnesses were discovered after May 28, 1957, the last day of the trial, nearly two years after plaintiffs filed their complaint. Such testimony would be merely cumulative and plaintiffs offer no convincing explanation of their delay in making the discovery. We find no basis for holding that the denial of the motion was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">' The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Bray, P. J., and Tobriner, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Limited, in one of the instructions, to the \"individual\u201d defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
