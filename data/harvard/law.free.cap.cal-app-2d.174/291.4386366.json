Carson, deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">The instrument was denied probate upon the ground that it is \u201cnot dated\u201d by the deceased within the meaning of section 53 of the Probate Code defining a holographic will.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">The instrument was written by and entirely in the handwriting of the deceased but the date of its execution reads: \u201cMay 1948.\u201d Thus the day of the month is omitted. The only question for solution is whether \u201cMay 1948\u201d consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>tutes a date within the meaning of section 53 of the Probate Code. The section provides, in part: \u201cA holographic will is one that is entirely written, dated and signed by the hand of the testator himself. It is subject to no other form, and need not be witnessed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">In construing this section our appellate courts have uniformly held that the day, month and year must be designated and that specification of the month and year is insufficient. <em>(Estate of Price, </em>14 Cal.App. 462 [112 P. 482], and cases cited therein; <em>Estate of Maguire, </em>14 Cal.App.2d 388, 389-390 [58 P.2d 209]; <em>Estate of Fritz </em>(1951), 102 Cal.App.2d 385 [227 P.2d 539].) Petition for hearing by the Supreme Court was denied in each of the foregoing cited cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Appellant concedes that the decision in the <em>Estate of Fritz, supra, </em>is adverse to the position taken by him. However, he contends that the law should be reexamined and modified with respect to the \u201centirely dated\u201d policy rule where there is evidence of an undisputed intention to execute a testamentary document and dispose of one\u2019s property; that \u201cthe policy rule should be modified by holding that \u2018 entirely written, dated and signed \u2019 means in regard to the date that the month and year is ample.\u201d The answer to appellant\u2019s contention is found in <em>Estate of Fritz, supra. </em>In that case in substance the same contention was made as herein and likewise many of the cases relied upon by appellant were cited and considered. We quote from page 394 of said opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u201cThe final argument presented by appellant is that the Supreme Court\u2019s early interpretation of section 53 of the Probate Code <em>(Estate of Martin, </em>58 Cal. 530, etc.) are outmoded, \u2018backward,\u2019 \u2018harsh and uncompromising\u2019 and should be brought \u2018 abreast with humanitarian progress of modern law.\u2019 She contends that \u2018December 1946\u2019 is such a reasonable compliance with the statute that the intention of the testator is frustrated by a holding that such date invalidates the will. She cites numerous California decisions <em>(Estate of Chevallier, </em>159 Cal. 161 [113 P. 130]; <em>Estate of Lakemeyer, </em>135 Cal. 28 [66 P. 961, 87 Am.St.Rep. 96]; <em>Estate of Durlewanger, </em>41 Cal.App.2d 750, 752 [107 P.2d 477]; <em>Estate of Wilkinson, </em>113 Cal.App. 645 [298 P. 1037]; <em>Estate of Fay, </em>145 Cal. 82 [78 P. 340, 104 Am.St.Rep. 17]; <em>Estate of Akeley, 35 </em>Cal.2d 26 [215 P.2d 921]) wherein the rule was interpreted and some cases from other jurisdictions <em>(Bailey </em>v. <em>Teackle, </em>Wythe (Va.) 173; <em>In re Hail, </em>106 Okla. 124 [235 P. 916]; <em>Estate of Irvine, </em>114 Mont. 577 [139 P.2d 489, 147 A.L.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>882]) which support her contention. The answer to such arguments is: (1) The statute says it must be entirely dated by the holographic author; (2) the Supreme Court has held for 70 years that compliance with the requirements of this section \u2018is essential to the validity of a document as an holographic will, viz., that it be <em>entirely </em>written, dated, and signed by the hand of the testator himself \u2019 <em>(Estate of Thorn, </em>183 Cal. 512, 514 [192 P. 19]; <em>Estate of Billings, </em>64 Cal. 427 [1 P. 701]); (3) if the Legislature had been displeased with such interpretation it would have modified the statute; (4) if it is not a rational interpretation the Supreme Court will reverse its former holdings; (5) an excess of virtue in the decision of an outside jurisdiction does not cause it to prevail over the settled judicial policy of this state; (6) to transmit one\u2019s property by will does not arise from a congenital right but is a privilege granted by the state; and in enacting regulatory rules governing the forms of wills as well as the order of succession the Legislature may fix certain arbitrary requirements. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">It is the duty of this court to follow the law as it is interpreted by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Peek, Acting P. J., and Schottky, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 2, 1959. Peters, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-19\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
