He asserts that his rights under the state and federal Constitutions were thereby violated. Consequently, he says, he did not have a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">There is evidence that the car was stolen from a used car lot in Richmond some time prior to May 5, 1958, and was found in defendant\u2019s possession in Stockton on May 6, 1958. The operator of a parking lot in Stockton testified that he saw this car in the possession of the defendant on May 5. He said also that-he had seen a man working in a nearby Stockton restaurant called Mary\u2019s Place whom he thought was the defendant. \u201cI think I saw him once in the kitchen when I went over there to order a hamburger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Defendant testified that he had not been in Richmond since April 22,1958; he did not drive the car, nor was he in the car, at any time before May 6, 1958; that the ear was entrusted to him by a person who had worked as a cook in the restaurant called Mary\u2019s Place, a man about 5 feet and 2 or 3 inches tall, and known to defendant as Shorty or Curley. Defendant had bought some gas for the ear and was returning to pick Shorty up and drive out to work at a certain ranch when he was apprehended by the police. He recently heard that Shorty sometimes went by the name of Ivory Phillips, sometimes as .Ivory Adams and was now an inmate of the San Joaquin County jail, committed thereto under a still different name.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">One of the owners and managers of a Stockton hotel situate near Mary\u2019s Place restaurant testified that a person called Ivory Phillips resided at her hotel from the 8th of April to about the last of April, 1958, and while a resident there worked \u25a0at Mary\u2019s Place. She said he continued to work there for about a week after moving out of her hotel. She described Phillips as \u201ca short fellow . . . around about five three or four [and] kind of a brown skinned fellow.\u201d She had also heard him called Ivory Adams. He was reputed to have used various names and, according to information she had received, was now in the San Joaquin County jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Defendant called to the witness stand Ray Stoffels, Chief of the Criminal Division of the Sheriff\u2019s Office, Contra Costa County, qualified him as a fingerprint identification expert, and asked him: \u201c. . . if a person has a file with a full print\u2014 set of fingerprints on an individual, and if there is a group of people, each one of whom there is a full set of fingerprints on, can you, without regard to the names that the people may have on their file, match up the first file with the full set of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>fingerprints with any set of fingerprints from such a group that would match it ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The prosecution objected that this was an irrelevant question. Defense counsel stated he was \u201cprepared to show that the Stockton Police Department have a file on Ivory Phillips with a full set of fingerprints\u201d and \u201cthat every prisoner in the San Joaquin-,\u201d whereupon the jury was excused and the discussion continued outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Defense counsel explained that he had issued a subpoena for Mr. Phillips, \u201cthis cook,\u201d but was unable to obtain service \u201cbecause the man is in prison under an alias\u201d and \u201cin order to establish the identity of the prisoner that I desire to have subpoenaed, it is necessary to match the fingerprints which are in the Stockton Police file under Ivory Phillips, to check those fingerprints against the fingerprints of the prisoner\u2019s in the San Joaquin County Jail.\u201d Defense counsel added: \u201c. . . I\u2019m trying to effect service of a subpoena on Ivory Phillips, and he\u2019s in prison under an alias in the San Joaquin County Jail. And the only way I can identify him in order to effect service of the subpoena, is to have these fingerprints matched. And I need an order from this Court directing that that be done in order to procure the attendance of this witness who is essential to the defense of my case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">The prosecutor said he had phoned the sheriff\u2019s office at Stockton and learned they had a record of an Ivory Phillips in 1954, 1955 or 1956, on a common drunk charge. He did not know whether it is the custom there to take a full set of prints on a common drunk charge. The prosecutor had called the Stockton city jail trying to locate Ivory Phillips, also the Richmond police department, without avail. Nor did the Stockton sheriff\u2019s office have any record of an Ivory Phillips presently incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">Asked to make his request more specific, defense counsel said \u201cI want an order that the Stockton County Sheriff\u2019s Office shall compare the fingerprints in their file on Ivory Phillips with the fingerprints of the present inmate of the County Jail,\u201d and that \u201cif they then establish that one of the inmates in the County Jail is the person Ivory Phillips, that I then may subpoena him. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Counsel added: \u201c. . . unless I get this\u2014I have no means of getting this accomplished without the Court\u2019s order. Arid unless I do that, I have no way of procuring this essential witness. I might also say that there is, in Sacramento, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>bureau that has all this information, but they won\u2019t give it to me because I\u2019m just a private lawyer. But it\u2019s available to any law enforcement agency. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The prosecutor stated that he recalled no evidence in this case that the Stockton officers fingerprint \u201ccommon drunks\u201d and expressed the view that \u201cfingerprinting common drunks is ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The court, addressing defense counsel, ruled: \u201c. . . if you have the name of any person in the County Jail in custody, I shall make an order that they come here. I think that\u2019s within the province of the Court. But I want you to name the party. . . . He may be John Doe alias Ivory, whatever the name is.\u201d Defense counsel again explained his need to have the fingerprints checked, not knowing the alias last used by Phillips. The court said: \u201c. . . don\u2019t go about it this roundabout way of whole sets of records of fingerprints and all that. ... I don\u2019t think we would be warranted in going that far. I would do this: make an order that Ivory Adams or Ivory Phillips-. . .I\u2019ll make an order that he appear here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">After some further discussion, the prosecutor volunteered to phone the Stockton officers and ask \u201cif they have this person.\u201d This he did, defense counsel accompanying him, and then reported: \u201c. . .we called up the San Joaquin County Jail. There is no man named Ivory Phillips, no man named Ivory Adams, no colored man named Adams, no colored man named Ivory, incarcerated therein. Mb. Bird [defense counsel] : So the only thing that would serve my purpose would be the cheek of the fingerprints, and I take it Tour Honor has ruled adversely on that. The Court: I don\u2019t think that we can put them to work on such\u2014what shall I say, a nebulous course?-... as that. Tes. I\u2019m sorry. I would have been glad to issue an order if we could identify the person you want. Tes. So I don\u2019t know that you need to go further with the testimony of Mr. Stoffels, do you? Mr. Bird: No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">The discussion between court and counsel on this subject demonstrates (contrary to one of the State\u2019s contentions upon this appeal) that the denial of defendant\u2019s request was predicated upon the assumed legal impropriety of making any such inquiry concerning fingerprints, not upon a determination by the judge that defendant\u2019s statements about having received the ear from one Ivory Phillips and that Phillips is an inmate of the San Joaquin County jail under an alias to the defendant unknown, were pure fabrications.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>It seems to us it was a reasonable request under the circumstances of this case. Defendant had been in custody continuously since May 6, 1958. It was now September 25, 1958. He was not free to go to Stockton and view the prisoners there, assuming he might be granted the privilege of viewing them if at liberty and thus free to make such a search. He did not have an attorney until July 9, 1958. His attorney had never seen Phillips and therefore could not locate him under an unknown name. Neither defendant nor his attorney had access to fingerprint records kept by law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Identification by fingerprints would seem equally as sure and certain as by name; more so, in this ease, upon the evidence that Phillips was in jail under a new or different alias. True, that was hearsay evidence but it went into the record without objection. Indeed, the prosecutor interposed an objection and then withdrew it, saying that the witness could testify \u20181 where Ivory was through hearsay. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">It would have been a very simple matter for the district attorney or his deputy, when phoning to Stockton officials that day, to have asked if they have a fingerprint record of Ivory Phillips. (The deputy had previously ascertained that the sheriff\u2019s office at Stockton had a record of an Ivory Phillips in 1954, 1955, or 1956.) If the answer had been \u201cNo,\u201d it would have ended that particular inquiry; if \u201cYes,\u201d the sheriff could then have been asked to check against the fingerprints in his file concerning prisoners currently in his custody. Proof whether or not it would be practicable and feasible for the sheriff to conduct such a search, and reasonable upon the part of the district attorney to request or the trial court to direct him to conduct it, was the very purpose of the question which defense counsel asked of fingerprint identification expert Stoffels but which Stoffels upon the prosecutor\u2019s objection was not allowed to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Such a question seems entirely reasonable and potentially fruitful of results. The fingerprint method of identification has come into vogue over the years. Anyone can change his name at will, but not his fingerprints. Also, fingerprints rep\u00fatedly, are readily classifiable. The Legislature sets great store by them as a ready means of identification. It requires each sheriff and each police chief to furnish the State Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation \u201cdaily copies of fingerprints\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11112), imposes upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>attorney general the duty of keeping a \u201ccomplete record of all copies of fingerprints\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11106) and of making a \u201ccomplete and systematic record and index, providing a method of convenience, consultation and comparison\u201d (\u00a7 11104). It is the further duty of the attorney general to furnish to all peace officers, upon application, \u201call information pertaining to the identification of any person,\u201d upon certification by the requesting officer that the information applied for is \u201cnecessary in the interest of the due administration of the laws, and not for the purpose of assisting a private citizen in carrying on his personal interest or in maliciously or uselessly harassing, degrading or humiliating any person\u201d (\u00a711105).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">It would seem quite proper for the state to utilize some of this information in furtherance of defendant\u2019s right \u201cto have the process of the court to compel the attendance of witnesses in his behalf \u2019 \u2019 and his right not to be deprived 1 \u2018 of life liberty, or property without due process of law\u201d (State Const., art. I, \u00a713; and U. S. Const., art. XIV of Amendments).  It does not appear that the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States applies directly to the states but the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment accomplishes substantially the same results in certain situations: \u201cThe \u2018due process of law\u2019 which the Fourteenth Amendment exacts from the States is a conception of fundamental justice. ... It is not satisfied by merely formal procedural correctness, nor is it confined by any absolute rule such as that which the Sixth Amendment contains in securing to an accused \u2018the Assistance of Counsel for his defense. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Foster </em>v. <em>People of State of Illinois, </em>332 U.S. 134, 136 [67 S.Ct. 1716, 91 L.Ed. 1955]. See also <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 324-325 [58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288]; <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>316 U.S. 455, 461-462 [62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595]; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Kaiser, </em>323 U.S. 471, 473-477 [65 S.Ct. 363, 89 L.Ed. 398]; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>355 U.S. 155, 159-160 [78 S.Ct. 191, 2 L.Ed.2d 167].)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">We conclude that defendant\u2019s fundamental rights were violated and that the judgment must be reversed. This ruling is, of course, limited to the circumstances of this case. We do not undertake to lay down a formula. We doubt if it is feasible to do so. Each case must be considered upon the basis of its own facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>In view of our conclusion we need not consider other questions discussed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The judgment and order appealed from are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Bray, P. J., and Tobriner, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 23, 1959.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
