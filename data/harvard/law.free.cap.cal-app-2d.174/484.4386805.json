From the ensuing judgment in favor of the state and its agencies plaintiffs have appealed. We have concluded that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Section 3479 of the Civil Code provides in part that: \u201cAnything which . . . unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of . . . any public . . . highway, is a nuisance. \u2019 \u2019  However, as stated in <em>Vater </em>v. <em>County of Glenn, </em>49 Cal.2d 815, 820 [323 P.2d 85], the court said: \u201cIn considering whether the facts alleged are sufficient to constitute a nuisance, we must keep in mind that, in order to state a cause of action based upon this theory, the plaintiff must show that a legislative body has declared the condition complained of to be a nuisance.\u201d  We do not feel that the situation described in the complaint and the claimed defective condition constituted an <em>unlawful </em>obstruction of the highway and the free use thereof in the customary manner within the meaning of the statute, although the existence of a drop from the level of the pavement to the adjacent \u201cfreshly plowed or graded shoulder\u201d undoubtedly could be found to be a dangerous condition requiring notice thereof or the erection of warning signs.  However, the state and its agencies, in the absence of statutory or constitutional provisions to the contrary, are immune from liability for torts in the discharge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>governmental duties and activities. <em>(Vater </em>v. <em>County of Glenn, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Appellants next contend that the maintenance of a highway is not purely governmental activity, but rather a ministerial function to which sovereign immunity does not apply. The rule in California is contrary to this contention. <em>(Yonker </em>v. <em>City of San Gabriel, </em>23 Cal.App.2d 556 [73 P.2d 623]; <em>Bettencourt </em>v. <em>State, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 60 [266 P.2d 201, 43 A.L.R.2d 545]; <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>114 Cal.App.2d 513 [250 P.2d 717].) In the Bettencourt case it was held that bridges have always been regarded in California as part of <em>our highways, </em>and that the maintenance and operation of publicly owned bridges, toll or otherwise, was a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In the Tonker case, <em>supra, </em>the court pointed out that all authorities agree that the management, control, construction and maintenance of public highways is a governmental function as distinguished from any proprietary undertaking or business carried on by a public body.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Likewise, in the Gillespie case, <em>supra, </em>it was held that the management, control, construction and maintenance of public highways are governmental functions as distinguished from any proprietary undertaking or business carried on by a city.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Hence it seems clear to us that the maintenance of a highway is a governmental activity as distinguished from a mere ministerial function, and that under such conditions the rule of sovereign immunity applies in the instant ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Nor is there anything in <em>Guidi </em>v. <em>State, </em>41 Cal.2d 623 [262 P.2d 3], contrary to our holding here. Paraphrasing what was said in the Bettencourt case, <em>supra, </em>concerning the Guidi case, the court there considered most of the California cases concerning the difference between governmental and proprietary functions and held that the state, although possibly immune from negligence in connection with agricultural and educational activities at the State Fair, was not immune from negligence in the course of setting off fireworks and maintaining the horse arena there, for the reason that the latter activities do not differ from those of private enterprise in the entertainment industry, and hence the state, as to these activities, was acting in a proprietary capacity. Obviously there is no similarity between the state maintaining its highways or highway systems and the setting off of fireworks or operating a horse arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Lastly, appellants strenuously argue that the doctrine of sovereign immunity should be reconsidered and discarded. The answer to this contention is found in <em>Vater </em>v. <em>County of Glenn, supra, </em>wherein the court said, at page 820: \u201cMost of the authorities who have recently written on the subject strongly advocate abolition or modification of the principle of governmental immunity, which lets the loss caused by tortious conduct of the government rest on the injured individual instead of distributing it among all the members of the community, the beneficiaries of the governmental activity. (See e.g., 2 Harper and James, The Law of Torts (1956), 1612; Prosser on Torts (2d ed. 1955), 775; Borchard, <em>State and Municipal Liability in Tort\u2014Proposed Statutory Reform, </em>20 A.B.A.J. 747 et seq.; Kuchel, <em>Should California Accept Tort Liability? </em>25 Cal. State Bar J. 146, 151.) However, the abrogation or restriction of this doctrine is primarily a legislative matter (see <em>Talley </em>v. <em>Northern San Diego County Hospital Dist., </em>41 Cal.2d 33, 41 [257 P.2d 22]; <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County General Hospital, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 143, 144 [266 P.2d 221]), and, where, as here, the Legislature has clearly expressed its intention to maintain immunity, that intention is controlling.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Peek, Acting P. J., and Sehottky, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 4, 1959, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 10, 1959. Peters, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-12\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
