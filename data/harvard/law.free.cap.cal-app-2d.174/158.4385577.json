It was further agreed that \u201call the agreements herein contained on the part of the Lessees, whether technically covenants or conditions, shall be deemed to be conditions for the purposes hereof, conferring upon the Lessor, in the event of breach of any of said agreements, the right to terminate this lease, but in those instances where notice hereof is required, only after such notice for the length of time and served in the manner in these presents provided. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>King\u2019s Market opened for business in September of 1948. At that time Rawson racks (a type of shelf stocked with miscellaneous commodities supplied and serviced by the Rawson company) were installed. The Rawson shelves included \u201c0\u201d type items. \u201c0\u201d type items consist chiefly of tooth pastes, tooth powders, shaving preparations, shampoos, soaps, deodorants, first aid supplies, and miscellaneous drugs and laxatives not requiring a prescription. These \u201c0\u201d type commodities were advertised by King\u2019s Market, along with other items, in a newspaper advertisement appearing September 30, 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 pharmacy was opened for business in December of 1948. Shortly thereafter King\u2019s Market ceased to carry the <em>\u201c0\u201d </em>type items.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In November, 1954, defendant Jacobs asked Charles Hildebrand, the manager of the pharmacy, if plaintiffs would object to the installation of a Rawson rack in King\u2019s Market. He was informed that there would be an objection. However, on November 15, 1954, the \u201c0\u201d type items were again offered for sale at King\u2019s Market. November 19, 1954, plaintiffs complained by letter to Stonecrest and were informed that the matter would be investigated. Plaintiffs\u2019 letter was forwarded by Stonecrest to defendant Jacobs, with a covering letter dated November 26, 1954. Near the end of November, plaintiff Neil Hildebrand, in a telephonic conversation with Arthur P. Schumacher, general manager of Stonecrest, repeated his earlier complaint regarding the sale of \u201c0\u201d type commodities by King\u2019s Market. Schumacher testified that he thereupon spoke to defendant Jacobs several times but that Jacobs \u20181 continued to make the argument that the rack did not contain any items that were in violation of . . . [the] agreement or understanding, [that] they were not drug items in the true sense of the pharmacy; that in the case of the cosmetics they were incidental, that he would agree to remove those, . . .\u201d On January 19, 1955, the \u201c0\u201d type items were again withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Charles Hildebrand testified that sometime in January of 1955 he was again engaged in a conversation with Jacobs, at which time Jacobs asked if there would be an objection to instituting the Rawson rack. Hildebrand informed him that there would be, whereupon Jacobs replied that he would not honor the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Under date of May 10, 1955, Stonecrest wrote a letter to defendants Jacobs, Miller and King\u2019s Market to confirm their verbal agreement that the addressees would not carry drugs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>medicines or cosmetics that would be in conflict with the merchandise offered by plaintiffs at their pharmacy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants Jacobs and Miller appended the word \u201cAcceptedand signed their names thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">On May 16, 1955, the \u201c0\u201d type items were again stocked by King\u2019s Market. From that date to the time suit was filed these commodities were offered for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Sometime in May of 1955, Charles Hildebrand complained to Stonecrest regarding the renewed sale of \u201c0\u201d items by King\u2019s Market. On June 8, 1955, plaintiffs through their attorney sent written notice to Stonecrest demanding that the sale of these items be stopped. This letter called attention to section 40 of plaintiffs\u2019 lease and declared that the provisions thereof were being violated. There appears to have been no further communication between plaintiffs and any of the defendants,</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The judgment declares that Jacobs, Miller and King\u2019s Market, a copartnership, are not entitled to sell drugs, medicines and cosmetics to the general public in premises at Broadmoor Shopping Center leased from Stonecrest, states that the term \u201cdrugs, medicines and cosmetics\u201d includes but is not restricted to certain items (including, for example, Sal Hep\u00e1tica, cold tablets, tooth powders, hair tonics and shampoos, cough syrup, vaseline, Turns, permanent wave kits, band-aids, cotton, gauze and bandages), and enjoins them from selling and displaying the same. In addition, it awards plaintiffs judgment against Stonecrest in the amount of $21,000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>and a like amount in favor of Stonecrest against the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Stonecrest\u2019s obligation to the plaintiffs and its liability for violation of that obligation seem abundantly clear. (See <em>Medico-Dental etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Horton &amp; Converse, </em>21 Cal.2d 411 [132 P.2d 457]; <em>Kulawitz </em>v. <em>Pacific etc. Paper Co., </em>25 Cal.2d 664 [155 P.2d 24]; 30 Cal.Jur.2d <em>178, </em>Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 52; 32 Am.Jur., Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 145.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Stonecrest seeks to escape liability upon the theory that it relied upon the other defendants to adjust their differences with plaintiffs. That is no defense. Stonecrest had solemnly promised not to \u201cpermit the sale of drugs, medicines, or cosmetics in the Super-Market, known as \u2018King\u2019s.\u2019 \u201d (\u00a740 of its lease to plaintiff.) It could not abrogate that obligation, or excuse itself from performance of that duty by seeking to delegate its performance to others, especially to the very persons from whose competition that promise was made for the protection of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The claim is made that no damages should have been awarded for breach of Stonecrest\u2019s promise after April 27, 1956, the date when Stonecrest sold the property to third parties. Section 31 of the lease with plaintiffs declared that such a sale would \u201coperate to release the Lessor from any further liability upon any of the covenants or conditions . . . in favor of the Lessee.\u201d This point is not well taken. There was no such issue framed by the pleadings. The amended complaint pleaded lessor Stonecrest\u2019s promise not to permit the sale of drugs, medicines or cosmetics in the super-market known as \u201cKing\u2019s\u201d by setting forth the very text of section 40 of plaintiffs\u2019 lease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Stonecrest in its answer admitted that obligation by not denying the portion of the complaint which alleged it. Nowhere in the complaint or in the answers of any of the defendants was there any mention of section 31 of plaintiffs\u2019 lease or the subject matter thereof. That subject (release of lessor upon sale of the property by it) was of course not within the contemplation of the parties because the complaint and the respective answers were filed a number of months prior to the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">During the trial after making proof of the sale Stonecrest tendered and filed an amendment to its answer which simply stated that on April 27, 1956, Stonecrest conveyed all of its right, title and interest in the premises to Elsie K. Stern and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Percy Stern Foundation and ever since said time \u201chas no right, title or interest in and to said premises.\u201d This amendment made no mention of Section 31 of the lease or the subject matter thereof. Obviously it tendered only the fact of the conveyance. It presented no question of \u201crelease\u201d from \u201cfurther liability\u201d (under \u00a7 31 of the lease) upon its promise not to permit the sale of drugs, medicines or cosmetics at King\u2019s Market. Stoneerest continued bound by its admission of the making of that promise. In such a situation the principle which requires a release to be specially pleaded is peculiarly applicable. (See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Ferrel, </em>78 Cal.App.2d 578, 579 [177 P.2d 973]; 2 Witkin, California Procedure, 1530.) No one is claiming that the mere sale of the property relieved Stoneerest of the burden of its obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The finding that the term \u201cdrugs, medicines and cosmetics\u201d included the nonprescription drugs and other preparations mentioned (such as tooth powder, hair tonic, shaving soap, cotton, gauze and bandages), known as \u201c0\u201d type commodities, is supported by the evidence. Defendants concede that there was a conflict of testimony on this subject.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They would have us decide that the \u201ctestimony that they were not \u2018cosmetics\u2019 or \u2018medicines\u2019 \u201d is the more persuasive of the conflicting views expressed by the witnesses. The view expressed by the trial court was a reasonable one, adopted in the exercise of its function of weighing and appraising the evidence. It is not our function to try to disturb that determination even if we were inclined to take the opposite view, which we are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Besides, the defendants\u2019 own interpretation (evidenced by twice withdrawing the \u201c0\u201d type products upon plaintiffs\u2019 protest and by formulating and signing the letter agreement of May 10, 1955) coincided with that of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Concerning the amount of damages, the trial court found (1) defendants other than Stoneerest continuously sold the proscribed articles, commencing in May of 1955, their average monthly receipts thereof being $2,500; (2) immediately upon the commencement of such sales, the volume of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>sales at plaintiffs\u2019 pharmacy declined and a loss of profits ensued; the loss in volume of sales and the loss in profits have been continuous; (3) upon cessation of such sales by defendants a period of time will be required for plaintiffs to regain their loss of volume and profit; the loss of profit to plaintiffs is $21,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Evidence bearing on damages included financial statements of the pharmacy from January, 1951 through the first nine months of 1956. The approximate monthly gross receipts from the sale of the items in controversy by King\u2019s Market was shown to range between $2,000 and $2,500. Dr. David Kendrick, an instructor of economics of the University of California, College of Pharmacy, estimated the loss of profits. This estimate was derived from computations using the annual sales volume for each year beginning with 1951. These computations were used as a basis for computing a \u201ctrend line\u201d which presumably predicts future sales. These anticipated sales volumes for 1955 and 1956 were then compared with the actual volume of sales for 1955 and 1956 to arrive at the loss of profits. This analysis led Kendrick to conclude that plaintiffs had suffered a loss of profits of $7,372.91 in 1955 and $11,796.65 in 1956 as a result of the competitive sales by King\u2019s Market. Plaintiff Neil P. Hildebrand and his brother Charles Hildebrand testified that on the commencement of sales of \u201cO\u201d type commodities at King\u2019s Market, there was a decrease of $50-75 per day average of cash register receipts, in the volume of customer traffic, in the number of transactions and in the volume per customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The defendants question the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence on several grounds. They criticize the method of proof and contend that plaintiffs\u2019 record of purchases and sales of the specified items in controversy should have been introduced (instead of a record of sales of all commodities stocked by the pharmacy). The plaintiffs rely on <em>Flagg </em>v. <em>Andrew Williams Stores, Inc., </em>127 Cal.App.2d 165 [273 P.2d 294], decided by this court, for the proposition that it is not necessary to prove a decline of sales, since damages can be predicated on a loss of expected growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">As another ground for urging that the award is not supported by substantial evidence, the defendants cite a number of factors which, they say, militate against a finding of damages occasioned by defendants\u2019 conduct. Plaintiffs testified that in 1955 they initiated a different system of merchandizing. The new system resulted in management changes, the curtail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ing of hours and days in which the pharmacy remained open and changes in advertising method and expenditure. Moreover, between March, 1954, and February, 1955, three new pharmacies opened, some of which were located in the area normally serviced by the Broadmoor Pharmacy (one in March, 1954, one in October, 1954, and a third in February, 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Those were all problems of fact which it was the function of the trial court to resolve and it did resolve.  Findings of fact may not be rejected merely because there is evidence which might authorize a different result. <em>(Sheward </em>v. <em>Magit, </em>106 Cal.App.2d 163, 166 [234 P.2d 708].)  Moreover, \u201cone whose wrongful conduct has rendered difficult the ascertainment of the damages cannot escape liability because the damages could not be measured with exactness\u201d <em>(Flagg </em>v. <em>Andrew Williams Stores, Inc., supra, </em>127 Cal.App.2d 165, 174, quoting from <em>Zinn </em>v. <em>Ex-Cell-O Corp., </em>24 Cal.2d 290, 297-298 [149 P.2d 177].)  In the instant case, the following seems particularly apt: \u201cThere may be some element of uncertainty but not such a degree of uncertainty as to render the testimony speculative. There is no uncertainty as to the fact of damage, that is, as to the nature, existence or cause of the damage. The same certainty as to the amount of the damage is not required.\u201d (Pp. 173-174 of 127 Cal.App.2d.)  It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the findings as to damages herein are not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Defendants Jacobs, Miller and King\u2019s Market say it was improper to award damages in favor of Stonecrest upon its cross-complaint because it sought only declaratory relief. Stonecrest did state a good cause for declaratory relief and prayed for \u201ca declaratory judgment . . . declaring and adjudicating the rights and duties of the cross-complainant and cross-defendants.\u201d But it pleaded all the facts material to an action for damages and also prayed for general relief. We find it was well within the scope of the discretionary function of the trial court to accord the relief it did grant to Stonecrest. (See <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>City of Glendale, </em>23 Cal.2d 68, 81 [142 P.2d 289]; <em>Record etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Pageman Hold. Corp., </em>42 Cal.2d 227, 234 [266 P.2d 1]; <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Plastic Stamping, Inc., </em>144 Cal.App.2d 306, 309 [300 P.2d 852].)</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Defendants Jacobs, Miller and King\u2019s Market claim that their lease with Stonecrest does not preclude the display and sale of \u201cO\u201d type commodities. They say such commodities qualify under section 3 of their lease which declares they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>shall use the premises for selling \u201cmerchandise to the public, consisting of <em>groceries, </em>vegetables, . . . meats and fish, . . . candies, . . . wines and liquors, ice cream, <em>and other kindred goods commonly sold in supermarkets </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">They argue that this language is sufficiently broad to encompass the \u201c0\u201d type commodities. They contend that such items as tooth paste, tooth powders, shampoos, soaps, and shaving preparations are commonly sold by supermarkets. This fact they claim is attested by the advertisement carried by them in a newspaper in September, 1948. Moreover, in their view, the term \"groceries\" in modern usage means more than merely food items. (Webster\u2019s International Dictionary, 2d ed., defines \u201cgrocer\u201d as: \u201ca dealer <em>in </em>tea, sugar, spices, coffee, fruits, various other commodities, chiefly foodstuffs.\u201d) It would place a somewhat strained construction on the word \u201cgroceries\u201d to construe it to include the items in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The defendants next suggest that \u201csupermarket\u201d means something more than \u201cmarket.\u201d This distinction was made in <em>Fricke </em>v. <em>Braden, </em>55 Cal.App.2d 266, 270-271 [130 P.2d 727], where, however, the distinction related to the physical boundaries intended by the terms of the contract. In further support of their position, defendants cite section 4057 of the Business and Professions Code which provides that certain drugs, chemicals and medicines may be sold by vendors generally, including grocers. Obviously, this statutory provision has little application to the determination of the restrictions contained in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Stonecrest contends that the conduct of defendants Miller and Jacobs in removing the \u201c0\u201d type commodities from sale on two separate occasions is indicative that under the terms of the lease the defendants in their own minds knew that they had no right to sell the items in controversy, citing <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>74 Cal.App.2d 449, 458 [169 P.2d 23]. This conduct of Jacobs and Miller is some indication that they understood that their lease bars the sale of the items in question. This is significant as it relates to the original intent of the contracting parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Their signing of the letter-agreement of May 10, 1955, is also indicative of such an interpretation by the parties to that lease, a species of admission that that is what it means. Stonecrest\u2019s views in this regard are more persuasive <em>to us </em>than those of the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Jacobs, Miller and King\u2019s Market claim it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>improper to make an award in favor of Stonecrest against King\u2019s Market, a copartnership, because in the caption to the cross-complaint the partnership was not mentioned. Jacobs and Miller, who made up the partnership, were there named simply in their individual capacities. Likewise, in the body of the cross-complaint, they were designated merely as individuals. This point is well taken. The partnership was not made a party cross-defendant by the allegations of the cross-complaint. (See 2 Witkin on California Procedure 1016-1017, \u00a7 39, and 1209-1210, \u00a7 233; 39 Cal.Jur.2d 693-696, Partnership, \u00a7 87 ; and authorities cited in each.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The record upon this appeal has been augmented, by stipulation, to include a letter from Stonecrest to the person to whom it sold the property in April of 1956. In this letter, Stonecrest guaranteed to hold the purchaser, \u201charmless from any liability under and pursuant to any judgment obtained in the said lawsuit,\u201d presumably this lawsuit. This evidence was not before the trial court. It was discovered by plaintiffs after the trial. We see no need to consider it in view of the failure of the defendants to present to the trial court, by their pleadings, the question whether Stonecrest had obtained a release under section 31 of plaintiffs\u2019 lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The judgment is amended by striking from paragraph 5 thereof (monetary award in favor of Stonecrest Corporation) the words \u201cKing\u2019s Market, a copartnership.\u201d As thus amended, the judgment is affirmed. Plaintiffs Hildebrand will recover their costs on appeal. Defendant Stonecrest Corporation will recover its costs on appeal to the extent said costs relate to the appeal of Jacobs, Miller and King\u2019s Market from the award against them and in favor of Stonecrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Bray, P.
