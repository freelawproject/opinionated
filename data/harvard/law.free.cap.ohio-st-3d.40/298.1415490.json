For the following reasons, we grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">This court has not previously addressed, in this type of case, the prohibition against issuing the writ when the petitioner is in custody under process, judgment, or order of a court of record that had jurisdiction to issue the process, judgment, or order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, in <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Stobbs </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St. 3d 137, 23 OBR 292, 491 N.E. 2d 1126, we held that because of R.C. 2725.05, the writ of habeas corpus would not issue for the alleged failure of the Ohio Adult Parole Authority to conduct a final parole revocation hearing within a reasonable period of time for a detainee who was simultaneously being held pursuant to a lawful court order on a new criminal charge and was unable to post the $5,000 bond set by the court. We find the present situation analogous. Petitioner is in custody under a lawful judgment; therefore, the writ cannot be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">Petitioner relies on <em>Liberatore </em>v. <em>McKeen </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St. 2d 175, 17 O.O. 3d 107, 407 N.E. 2d 23, in which this court allowed a writ of habeas corpus and granted bail in similar circumstances after weighing the evidence for and against bail that was available to the trial and appellate courts. That decision did not address the prohibition against issuing the writ when the petitioner is lawfully confined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Today, we decide that that prohibition is applicable to such cases and, by denying the writ, overrule <em>Liberatore </em>to the extent that it is inconsistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">However, by declining to issue the writ in such cases, we do not foreclose all remedies. Crim. R. 46(E) and (F)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> clearly indicate that the court <em>shall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>follow certain procedures and consider certain facts in allowing or denying bail on appeal. Although mandamus normally will not issue to control a court\u2019s discretion, <em>State, ex rel. Sawyer, </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 380, 8 O.O. 3d 393, 377 N.E. 2d 494, it will issue to require a court to exercise its jurisdiction or discharge its mandatory functions. R.C. 2731.03. Hence, in <em>State, ex rel. Martin, </em>v. <em>Corrigan </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St. 3d 29, 25 OBR 24, 494 N.E. 2d 1128, we issued a writ of mandamus to compel a judge of a court of common pleas to pay assigned counsel, even though the statute granted the judge discretion in setting the amount of the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Moreover, there is no constitutional right to bail on appeal. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>McGettrick </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 177, 31 O.O. 2d 326, 207 N.E. 2d 552. The right to bail on appeal exists through R.C. 2953.09,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> App. R. 8, and Crim. R. 46. Crim. R. 46 leaves the ultimate decision within the discretion of the trial and appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">Accordingly, we grant the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">\n<em>Motion to dismiss granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-14\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Wright and H.
