Relying generally on cases like <em>State, ex rel. Senn, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Elections </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St. 2d 173, 5 O.O. 3d 381, 367 N.E. 2d 879, appellant also contends that, as election statutes, R.C. 4301.321 and 4301.331 are mandatory and require appellees\u2019 strict compliance. From these premises, appellant concludes that appellees acted contrary to law in allowing the issue of appellant\u2019s permits to be placed on the ballot and erred in not sustaining appellant\u2019s protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">We, however, agree with the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that by finding appellant in violation of Ohio Adm. Code .4301:1-1-49, the commission also found appellant in violation of R.C. Chapter 4301, for purposes of exercising the local option privilege. Indeed, it is well-established that administrative regulations have the force and effect of law. <em>State, ex rel. Cuyahoga Cty. Hosp., </em>v. <em>Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1986), 27 Ohio St. 3d 25, 28, 27 OBR 442, 444, 500 N.E. 2d 1370, 1372. The violation of a regulation properly promulgated under R.C. Chapter 4301 is certainly a violation of \u201cany provision of\u201d that chapter. R.C. 4301.321 and 4301.331.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">Before a writ of mandamus will issue, appellant must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellees are under a clear legal duty to perform the requested act. <em>State, ex rel. Pressley, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 141, 40 O.O. 2d 141, 228 N.E. 2d 631, paragraph ten of the syllabus. Because appellees complied with the local option statutes at issue, they had no duty to remove the question regarding appellant\u2019s liquor permits from the ballot. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b58-13\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
