However, the pendency of relators\u2019 interlocutory appeals does not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction over their case, because the court of appeals itself lacks jurisdiction over those appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">A court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction to review judgments or final orders of'inferior courts. Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution. Clearly, the denial of a motion to consolidate is not a judgment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St. 2d 170, 174, 1 O.O. 3d 99, 101, 351 N.E. 2d 106, 109. Nor, in our view, is it a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">R.C. 2505.02, in pertinent part, defines a \u201cfinal order\u201d as \u201c* * * an order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding * * We have held that \u201ca prime determinant of whether a particular order is one made in a special proceeding is the practicability of appeal after final judgment.\u201d <em>Bernbaum </em>v. <em>Silverstein </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 445, 447, 16 O.O. 3d 461, 463, 406 N.E. 2d 532, 534. If relators are prejudiced by the denial of their motion, and such prejudice results in their convictions, appeal after conviction is clearly practicable. Indeed, we considered such an appeal this very term. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 305, 308-309, 528 N.E. 2d 523, 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-17\">We hold that the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to consolidate was not a final appealable order. Therefore, the court of appeals had no jurisdiction to consider the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>raised' in the appeals, and its erroneous assertion of jurisdiction did not affect the jurisdiction of the trial court. Accordingly, we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b170-5\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas and H.
