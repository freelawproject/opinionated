Allied Wheel Products, Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 47, 1 O.O. 2d 190, 139 N.E. 2d 41. Where the record contains some evidence to support the commission\u2019s findings, there has been no abuse of discretion and mandamus will not lie. <em>State, ex rel. Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936. In making a YSSR award, the commission must determine that a claimant\u2019s injury resulted from the employer\u2019s failure to comply with a specific safety requirement. Section 35, Article II, Ohio Constitution; <em>State, ex rel. Haines, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 15, 58 O.O. 2d 70,278 N.E. 2d 24. At issue presently is whether there is \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s determination that appellee\u2019s injury was not caused by the appellant-employer\u2019s failure to comply with a specific safety requirement. We find that there is some evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The machine in question, described as a hydraulic press, was installed in 1947. The appellate court found appellant-employer to be in violation of Ohio Adm. Code 4121:l-5-ll(E). This provision and its predecessors all require that power or hydraulic presses \u201cbe constructed, or shall be guarded, to prevent the hands or fingers of the operator from entering the danger zone during the operating cycle.\u201d The provision additionally lists a two-handed tripping device or control as an acceptable method of compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The commission found that appellee\u2019s injury did not occur during the operating cycle. This term is not defined in the cited provisions. Appellants contend that \u201coperating cycle\u201d must be defined within the context of the machine, <em>i.e., </em>the physical cycling of the machine, completed when the ram ascends to its resting position. Appellee\u2019s definition, on the other hand, encompasses the entire part production process \u2014 insertion of the piece through its final removal. Appellants\u2019 contention is more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">We addressed this concept in <em>State, ex rel. King, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St. 3d 185, 519 N.E. 2d 652. King worked on a trim press, removing the flash from aluminum castings. In operating this machine, he would manually insert a gate with its attached castings into a die set mounted inside the press. He would then activate the press with a two-handed tripping device, removing the part once the upper platen had ascended. On the date of injury, the platen unexpectedly descended onto his hands as he reached in to remove the gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">King alleged a violation of Ohio Adm. Code 4121:l-5-ll(E), contending that the employer failed to provide a guard so as to prevent his hands from entering the danger zone during the operating cycle. In affirming the commission\u2019s denial, we determined that the claimant was not injured during the \u201coperating cycle,\u201d reasoning:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">\u201cWhen describing his conduct just prior to his injury, appellant stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">\u201c \u2018That he then removed his hands and actuated the press. <em>That the upper </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>platen then ascended, </em>and the affiant reached into the press with both hands and took hold of the scrap gate.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u201cThis averment indicates that the upper platen of the press had ascended and completed a cycle before appellant placed his hands in the danger zone. This depiction would satisfy the requirement of Ohio Adm. Code 4121: l-5-ll(E) that the guard prevent the employee\u2019s hands from entering the danger zone \u2018during the operating cycle\u2019 of the press.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 187, 519 N.E. 2d at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">See, also, <em>State, ex rel. Grimes, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(Aug. 14, 1986), Franklin App. No. 85AP-902, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u201cOperating cycle\u201d was viewed more broadly in <em>State, ex rel. Geauga Industries Co., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 109, 14 O.O. 3d 341, 397 N.E. 2d 1202. In that case, the claimant worked at a molding machine operated by a two-handed tripping device. She placed parts into the die area and activated the machine. After cycling, the machine opened, claimant reached in, air-hosed each part, and then removed them. Immediately preceding the injury, the middle mold stuck to the top one. While she was reaching in to remove the parts, the middle mold suddenly fell, crushing claimant\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Citing the same safety requirements as those currently at issue, the employer also referred to the \u201coperating cycle\u201d and argued that since an acceptable guarding device (two-handed tripping device) was used, there was no violation of a specific safety requirement. The commission disagreed, finding that there \u201cwere not sufficient guards for the machine during the <em>entire </em>operating cycle of the machine as required by IC-5-08.03(A). There was a guard for the first phase of the process, but there was no guard during the second phase. It was during the second phase of the operating cycle that the claimant was injured.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 111, 14 O.O. 3d at 342, 397 N.E. 2d at 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">This court, in affirming the commission\u2019s decision, found that \u201cit was not unreasonable for the commission to require guards for the entire operating cycle of .the machine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The decision thus seems to contemplate \u201coperating cycle\u201d as encompassing more than merely the physical movement of the ram. It suggests that any required insertion of the hands into the danger zone falls within the \u201coperating cycle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">We find this interpretation to be too broad. If part removal is included in the \u201coperating cycle,\u201d it would follow that placement and midphase adjustment are included as well. As such, an employer would essentially be required to prevent hands from <em>ever </em>entering the danger zone. Such a result appears inconsistent with legislative intent. If the General Assembly intended the danger zone to be guarded at all times, there would have been no need for the limiting language \u201cduring the operating cycle.\u201d Moreover, a two-handed tripping device is specifically enumerated as an acceptable method of \u201coperating cycle\u201d protection. That device, however, only provides protection during actual physical cycling of the ram. It would not have prevented the present accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">In <em>State, ex rel. Gentzler Tool &amp; Die Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 103, 105, 18 OBR 137, 139, 480 N.E. 2d 397, 399, we dealt with the same safety provision as that presently before us, noting that the provision did \u201cnot require that a power press operator\u2019s hands be guarded from ever entering the danger zone. Rather, it is only required that an operator\u2019s hands be guarded from entering the danger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>zone \u2018during the [machine\u2019s] operating cycle.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The commission\u2019s interpretation also suggests that \u201coperating cycle\u201d is confined to operator-intended press activation. <em>Gentzler Tool </em>also supports this conclusion. In that case, the claimant was injured when a co-worker manually activated the press, bypassing the pull-back safety guard and causing the ram to descend on the claimant\u2019s hand. We found no VSSR since there was no evidence indicating that the guards had been ineffective during the operating cycle of the power press. We reasoned that because the guards had never failed when activated by the operator, this kind of activation must be that contemplated by the definition of \u201coperating cycle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Appellee\u2019s reliance on <em>State, ex rel. Carlton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 433, 6 OBR 477, 453 N.E. 2d 607, is misplaced. Unlike the present case, <em>Carlton </em>involved the question of VSSR liability where the employer knew of previous safety guard malfunctions. Here, appellee has provided no support for his allegation that the press previously malfunctioned with appellant\u2019s knowledge and inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Interpretation of a specific safety requirement is within the commission\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Allied Wheel, supra. </em>Moreover, \u201call reasonable doubts concerning the interpretation of the safety standard [are] to be construed against the applicability of the standard to [the] employer.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. New Departure Hyatt Bearings, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(Mar. 3, 1983), Franklin App. No. 82AP-842, unreported, at 3. A synthesis of the cases cited above supports the commission\u2019s, interpretation of \u201coperating cycle\u201d as operator-intended ram movement. The parties uniformly agree that ram descent in the case at bar was neither operator-intended nor operator-activated. There was thus \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b98-10\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b98-11\">H.
