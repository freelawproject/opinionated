Therefore, regardless of the fact that the trial court dismissed the public indecency charge, the appellant\u2019s admission of a parole violation was sufficient grounds for the revocation of this parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The ineffective assistance of counsel claim must also fail. A parolee is entitled to procedural due process protection; however, it has never been affirmatively decided whether a parolee is entitled to the assistance of retained counsel or to appointed counsel if he is indigent. <em>Morrissey v. Brewer </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 471, 489. Therefore, since appellant can establish no clear legal right or duty regarding the assistance of counsel during a parole revocation hearing, he can establish no right to the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">To be entitled to a writ of mandamus, appellant must demonstrate that he has a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, that respondents are under a clear legal duty to perform the requested act, and the relator has no plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State, ex rel. Berger, </em>v. <em>McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 28, 29, 6 OBR 50, 51, 451 N.E. 2d 225, 226-227.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">As appellant has not established a clear right to relief or a clear duty of respondent to grant relief, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b115-14\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
