We are first asked to decide whether appellee Frank Sorrell was a \u201crecreational user,\u201d as defined in R.C. 1533.18(B), at the time of his accident. For the reasons which follow, we hold that he was. Second, in their cross-appeal, the Sorrells ask this court to overrule its decisions in <em>McCord </em>v. <em>Division of Parks &amp; Recreation, </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 72, 8 O.O. 3d 77, 375 N.E. 2d 50, and <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Dept. of Natural Resources </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 138, 16 O.O. 3d 161, 404 N.E. 2d 742, paragraph one of the syllabus, wherein it was held that \u201c* * * the definition of \u2018premises\u2019 in R.C. 1533.18(A) effectively encompassed state-owned lands.\u201d We find no acceptable reason to deviate from that construction of the statute, and thus we reverse the decision of the court of appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>R.C. 1533.18 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u201cAs used in sections 1533.18 and 1533.181 of the Revised Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u201c(A) \u2018Premises\u2019 means all privately-owned lands, ways, waters, and any buildings and structures thereon, and all state-owned lands, ways, and waters leased to a private person, firm, organization, or corporation, including any buildings and structures thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u201c(B) \u2018Recreational user\u2019 means a person <em>to whom permission has been granted, </em>without the payment of a fee or consideration to the owner, lessee, or occupant of premises, other than a fee or consideration paid to the state or any agency thereof, to enter upon premises to hunt, fish, trap, camp, hike, swim, or engage in other recreational pursuits.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"AOm\">R.C. 1533.181 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u201c(A) No owner, lessee, or occupant of premises:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">\u201c(1) Owes any duty to a recreational user to keep the premises safe for entry or use;</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">\u201c(2) Extends any assurance to a recreational user, <em>through the act of giving permission, </em>that the premises are safe for entry or use;</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">\u201c(3) Assumes responsibility for or incurs liability for any injury to person or property caused by any act of a recreational user.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">Appellee Sorrell does not contend that snowmobiling is not a \u201crecreational pursuit\u201d for purposes of R.C. 1533.18(B), and in fact admitted in his answers to ODNR\u2019s interrogatories that he entered Buckeye Lake for recreational purposes. Instead, Sorrell argues that since he was operating his snowmobile between the prohibited hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., in violation of ODNR rules,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he was using the park without \u201cpermission\u201d and was thus a trespasser \u2014 not a recrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>tional user. He further argues that, as he was an undiscovered trespasser, ODNR owed him a duty to refrain from willful or wanton conduct which might cause him injury, citing <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Nagy </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 58, 22 OBR 77, 488 N.E. 2d 853, and that R.C. 1533.181 does not provide immunity from a breach of such duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Sorrell\u2019s argument correctly implies that the duty of landowners, both public and private, toward trespassers is narrow. \u201cOrdinarily, a landowner owes no duty to undiscovered trespassers other than to refrain from injuring such trespassers by willful or wanton conduct. See Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5 Ed. 1984) 397, Section 58.\u201d <em>Elliott, supra, </em>at 60, 22 OBR at 78, 488 N.E. 2d at 854-855. \u201cIn general, no one has any right to enter without his consent, and he is free to fix the terms on which that consent will be given. Intruders who come without his permission have no right to demand that he provide them with a safe place to trespass, or that he protect them in their wrongful use of his property. When they enter where they have no right or privilege, the responsibility is theirs, and they must assume the risk of what they may encounter * * * and are expected to look out for themselves.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>at 393. We find it unnecessary to consider the applicability of R.C. 1533.181 to trespassers, however, as we hold that appellee Sorrell was a \u201crecreational user,\u201d as defined in R.C. 1533.18(B), irrespective of any violation of ODNR\u2019s snowmobile operational restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">The recreational user statutes apply to premises owned by the state that are made available for recreational purposes. <em>McCord, supra; Moss, supra. </em>The immunity conferred by R.C. 1533.181 extends only to those persons who have (1) been given permission, (2) to gratuitously, (3) engage in a recreational pursuit. Buckeye Lake was dedicated for the use of the public as a public park in 1902 by operation of a predecessor of R.C. 1541.06. (R.S. 218-305.) R.C. 1541.07 mandates that Buckeye Lake and other lakes \u201cshall <em>at all times </em>be open to the public as resorts for recreation and pleasure. * * *\u201d* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) This is consistent with the general purposes of ODNR\u2019s Division of Parks and Recreation, which is to \u201ccreate, supervise, operate, protect, and maintain a system of state parks and promote the use thereof by the public.\u201d R.C. 1541.01. Thus, by statutory mandate, Buckeye Lake is held open for gratuitous recreational use by the general public. Cf. <em>Loyer </em>v. <em>Buchholz </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 65, 526 N.E. 2d 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Although the state may limit or control gratuitous recreational use by the promulgation of reasonable rules, see Ohio Adm. Code Chapter 1501, such rules do not limit the grant of permission by the General Assembly. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>immunity granted by R.C. 1533.181 to owners, lessees, or occupants of premises who hold such premises open for gratuitous recreational use by the general public can not be lost where a person violates state park rules and regulations while using a park for permitted, gratuitous recreational purposes. A contrary ruling would either discourage the state from holding its land open to the general public, or discourage it from promulgating reasonable safely rules and regulations for the protection of the public using its land. Such a result would hinder the common goal of both R.C. Chapter 1541 and the recreational user statutes, which is to encourage the state to open its land to public recreational use without fear of liability. See <em>Marrek </em>v. <em>Cleveland Metroparks Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St. 3d 194, 198, 9 OBR 508, 511, 459 N.E. 2d 873, 877; <em>Moss, supra, </em>at 142, 16 O.O. 3d at 164, 404 N.E. 2d at 745; <em>Loyer, supra, </em>at 66, 526 N.E. 2d at 302. Inasmuch as the court of appeals below erroneously held that Sorrell was not a recreational user in that the ODNR had not granted anyone \u201cpermission\u201d to snowmobile on Buckeye Lake between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., we must reverse that decision and reinstate the summary judgment against appellees, Sorrell being, as a matter of law, a recreational user at the time of his accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In their cross-appeal, the Sorrells argue that the immunity granted in R.C. 1533.181 applies solely to land which is privately owned, leased or occupied, and does not apply to land owned by the state. They charge that this court improperly engaged in \u201cjudicial legislation\u201d in our decisions in <em>McCord </em>and <em>Moss, </em>rather than applying the \u201cclear and unambiguous language\u201d of the statute. We recently clarified our prior holdings on this issue in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New London </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St. 3d 60, 63, 521 N.E. 2d 793, 796-797, wherein we emphasized that the state\u2019s immunity is not conferred directly by R.C. 1533.181, but rather is derived from the immunity enjoyed by private persons thereunder. The state\u2019s derivative immunity arises pursuant to R.C. 2743.02(A) of the Court of Claims Act. We find no reason to overrule these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Douglas, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\"> The Sorrells, in their cross-appeal in this court, raised two additional issues: (1) whether extension of the immunity from liability granted in R.C. 1533.181 to landowners who injure trespassers by willful or wanton conduct would violate Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, and (2) whether the statutory immunity would apply where injuries are caused by artificial and willfully created hazards, such as the mound of dredge material herein. These issues were not raised in the courts below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>nor in the Sorrells\u2019 cross-motion to certify the record to this court, see Section 4(A), Rule II of the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court, and have thus been waived. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 120, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E. 2d 277.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\"> Appellee cites the following Ohio administrative rules, of which he was apparently in violation, in support of his arguments:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\u201c[Ohio Adm.
