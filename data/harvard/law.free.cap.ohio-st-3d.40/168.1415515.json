Allied Wheel Products, Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 47, 1 O.O. 2d 190, 139 N.E. 2d 41. Where the record, however, contains \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s findings, there has been no abuse of discretion and mandamus will not lie. <em>State, ex rel. Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936. In the present case, our determination of the some-evidence question is hampered by the ambiguity of the initial March 19, 1984 order of the district hearing officer denying temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">In <em>State, ex rel. Ramirez, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 630, 632, 23 O.O. 3d 518, 519, 433 N.E. 2d 586, 588, we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">\u201c \u2018* * * An employee is entitled to be paid temporary total disability when injured and unable to work until one of the following three things occur[s]: (1) he has returned to work, (2) his treating physician has made a written statement that he is capable of returning to his former position of employment, or (3) the temporary disability has become permanent.\u2019 \u201d In addition, a claimant must establish that the alleged disability is due to the allowed conditions in the claim. <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 569, 55 O.O. 472, 125 N.E. 2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">In the present case, the hearing officer\u2019s determination that appellee \u201cis not totally disabled due to the allowed injury\u201d is subject to different interpretations. His conclusion that appellee was \u201cnot totally disabled\u201d as opposed to \u201cnot <em>temporarily </em>totally disabled\u201d appears to infer that any alleged disability was still temporary. In light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fox, </em>the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion thus appears to indicate that either appellee was able to return to her former position of employment or that the disability was not due to the allowed conditions. It is unclear, however, which finding formed the basis of the hearing officer\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">In <em>State, ex rel. Mitchell, </em>v. <em>Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E. 2d 721, we held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>that ambiguity can be resolved by the issuance of a limited writ \u201cdirecting the commission to specify the basis of its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 6 OBR at 533, 453 N.E. 2d at 724. Relying on this decision, we hereby affirm the appellate court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b210-5\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas and H.
