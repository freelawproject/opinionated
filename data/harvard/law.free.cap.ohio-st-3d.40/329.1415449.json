Here, appellants have filed notices of appeal with this court before final disposition of another\u2019s application for rehearing. Nevertheless, for the reasons that follow, we grant the motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-18\">Under the Ohio Constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> our jurisdiction to hear appeals in public utilities cases is as prescribed by statute. The relevant statutes are R.C. 4903.10, 4903.11 and 4903.13.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-19\">R.C. 4903.11 and 4903.13 provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>for appeals of \u201cfinal order[s],\u201d but do not define the term. R.C. 2505.02 provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u201cAn order that affects a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, an order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment, or an order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In <em>Cleveland, Columbus &amp; Cincinnati Highway, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 634, 636, 26 O.O. 197, 198, 49 N.E. 2d 759, 760, this court identified the term \u201cfinal order\u201d in R.C. 4903.13 with the same term in the second clause of R.C. 2505.02:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u201cIt is to be observed that a distinction is made between an order \u2018in an action\u2019 and an order \u2018in a special proceeding.\u2019 In the former, an order is a final order only \u2018when in effect it determines the action and prevents a judgment\u2019 while in the latter the only essential to constitute an order a \u2018final order\u2019 is that it be one \u2018affecting a substantial right.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\"><em>a </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">\u201cThat a proceeding before the Public Utilities Commission such as this is a special proceeding seems indisputable. Then, if the order in question here affects a substantial right, it is a final order within the contemplation of the provisions of Section 544, General Code [R.C. 2505.02], whether or not it \u2018determines the action and prevents a judgment.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">It could be inferred from this case that any order that affects a party\u2019s substantial rights is appealable irrespective of its relationship to other parties and orders. However, <em>Cleveland, Columbus &amp; Cincinnati Highway, Inc. </em>merely defines a \u201cfinal order\u201d; it does not state when a final order may be appealed. Hence, in <em>Toledo Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 95, 5 OBR175, 449 N.E. 2d 428, we dismissed an appeal by, the company filed after its application for rehearing had been granted, but before the commission had issued its order following rehearing. We cited \u201c* * * this court\u2019s repeatedly pronounced disfavor of piecemeal appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This decision foreshadowed our decision in the <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>cases, <em>swpra. </em>In all these cases, the appeals at least arguably involved substantial rights of the appellants, but were held to be untimely. Timeliness, as well as an effect on substantial rights, is necessary for a valid appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">R.C. 4903.10 and 4903.11 provide the time frame in which a final order, becomes appealable. R.C. 4903.10 requires a party to proceedings before the commission to file an application for rehearing with the commission, giving notice of the application to all other parties, in order to perfect an appeal to this court. If the commission grants rehearing, it must give notice to all other parties. Under R.C. 4903.11, if the commission denies an application for rehearing, or grants it and issues an order thereafter, it must give notice to all parties to the proceedings. Moreover, under R.C. 4903.10, any order on rehearing may modify or even abrogate the original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">Thus, the statutes link all parties in the rehearing process following issuance of the commission\u2019s original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>order and, in effect, hold the original order hostage to the outcome of the final rehearing. It is against this background that R.C. 4903.11 then provides that \u201c[n]o proceeding to reverse, vacate, or modify a final order of the public utilities commission is commenced unless the notice of appeal is filed within sixty days <em>after the date of denial of the application for rehearing by operation of law or of the entry upon the journal of the commission of the order denying an application for rehearing or, if a rehearing is had, of the order made after such rehearing.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Alone, R.C. 4903.11 might be construed to apply to each party\u2019s application for rehearing and appeal independently of other parties\u2019 applications and appeals. However, R.C. 4903.11 does not stand alone. We have previously stated that both R.C. 4903.10 and 4903.11 are jurisdictional. <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>cases, <em>supra. </em>Therefore, because R.C. 4903.10 links all the parties through notice requirements and because an order issued after a rehearing may modify or even abrogate previously issued orders, we construe it to establish the rehearing process as an integrated whole, with each application for rehearing potentially affecting the position of other parties to the proceedings. R.C. 4903.11 must be construed accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Secondly, R.C. 4903.11, by itself, appears to cause the sixty-day appeal time to run from the date of an order made after rehearing, regardless of whether subsequent applications for rehearing are filed with respect to that order. However, because R.C. 4903.10 is also jurisdictional, permits an application for rehearing after any order, and requires an application for rehearing to preserve the right to appeal an issue, we construe the language of R.C. 4903.11, \u201c* * * after the date of denial of the application for rehearing * * to refer both to applications for rehearing of original orders and applications for rehearing of orders made after rehearings. See R.C. 1.49(E). Consequently, we construe the language of R.C. 4903.11 \u2014 \u201c* * * or, if a rehearing is had, of the order made after such rehearing\u201d \u2014 to apply only to rehearings where no application for rehearing is subsequently filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">In the proceedings on which the cases before us are based, the last act of the commission was to deny, on May 10, 1988, CEI\u2019s and Toledo Edison\u2019s April 18, 1988 applications for rehearing of the orders issued on April 14, 1988. Therefore, under our construction of R.C. 4903.11, the date of denial of the last application for rehearing \u2014 May 10,1988 \u2014 was the date from which the sixty-day appeal period of R.C. 4903.11 began to run. Since all parties appealed prior to that date, the notices of appeal were premature. The motions to dismiss are therefore granted. Without jurisdiction, we cannot consider the applications for stay of execution requested by OCC. Therefore, the applications for stay of execution are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\n<em>Motions to dismiss granted.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\n<em>Motions for stay denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b373-10\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Wright and H.
