Workman\u2019s petition for [a] writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">\u201cOver the past eight years, relator has filed several post-conviction relief petitions alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. This action concerns a post-conviction relief petition filed by relator on February 10,1987 and denied by respondent Judge McGrath on November 24, 1987. Relator seeks a writ of mandamus compelling respondent to file findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the dismissal of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-17\">\u201cUnder R.C. 2953.23(A), it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to entertain a second petition or successive petitions for similar relief based upon the same facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-19\">\u201cAccordingly, we hold that a trial court is not required to file findings of fact and conclusions of law when declining to entertain a second or successive petition for post-conviction relief which alleges the same grounds as earlier petitions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Perdue </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App. 3d 285; <em>State </em>v. <em>Knight </em>(Aug. 20, 1981), Franklin App. No. 81AP-274, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-20\">\u201cWrit denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-21\">Therefore, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b131-22\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
