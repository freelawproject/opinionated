Code (1957), Article 27, Section 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">He raised three questions in his brief, but we find it necessary to consider the third only. He pleaded guilty, but the record fails to show, affirmatively, compliance by the trial court with Maryland Rule 723 b and c (now amended and designated as Rule 719 b 1 and d). Rule 723 b and c provided that \u201cif the defendant appears in court without counsel, the court shall advise him of his right to obtain counsel\u201d and \u201cthe record shall affirmatively show compliance with this Rule.\u201d We have held that these requirements are mandatory and must be complied with, irrespective of the gravity of the crime charged, the type of plea entered, or the lack of an affirmative showing of prejudice to the accused. <em>Hill v.
