M., January 31, 1962, Clinton Washington, a taxicab driver, was beaten with a hammer, cut and robbed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>two passengers in his taxicab, one a man and the other a person who was dressed in feminine attire and, to all outward appearances, appeared to Washington to be a woman. Soon after the robbery was reported, the two appellants were arrested near the location of the robbery. Appellant Sawyer was apprehended in the basement of a vacant house after a chase by a policeman. Appellant Espin was arrested while standing on a corner near the vacant house. Officer Portera, one of the arresting officers, testified he believed that Espin was a woman when he first saw him. A hammer was found on the ground in front of the building in which Sawyer was apprehended. The next day, Washington picked the two appellants out of a line-up of seven men, as the two who had robbed him. Espin also signed a statement which w'as admitted in evidence against him as having been voluntarily made, corroborating the testimony of the taxicab driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The appellants contend that there was not evidence legally sufficient to justify the court in finding them guilty of the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Under the uncontroverted facts, we can not say that there was not legally sufficient evidence before the trial judge to justify his denial of appellants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict, nor to permit us to reverse his verdicts of guilty as to both appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
