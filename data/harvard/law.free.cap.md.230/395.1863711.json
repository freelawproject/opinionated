Rather, it says that there was error because, in arriving at fair value, the Commission gave no weight to the testimony of the current monetary measure of its property. It seeks to have the case returned to the Commission with directions to give the Company\u2019s evidence of fair value proper (although unspecified) weight. The Company has a subsidiary complaint that the Commission, in calculating net operating income for rate making purposes, erred by disallowing two deductions claimed as operating expenses. It refused to give full credit for federal income tax paid by the Company since the amount paid was greater than the Company\u2019s proportionate share of the total tax payable under a consolidated return filed by its parent corporation, American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and the Company and other subsidiaries; and it disallowed charitable contributions made by the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">On February 11, 1958, the Commission filed its opinion and order in Case No. 5537 (the predecessor case to that now under review), allowing the Company to charge rates which would result in an increase of not more than $6,048,900 in gross annual revenues. On April 8, 1959, the People\u2019s Counsel, alleging that the Company\u2019s income was producing a return larger than that authorized by the order, filed a petition asking the Commission to reopen the 1958 case to determine the excess income, and to order refunds and set a revised schedule of rates. Perhaps on the theory that the best defense is a good offense, the Company, two days later, filed a petition asking the Commission to determine the earnings necessary to provide a reasonable return on the fair value of its property. As a result, the Commission ordered that the requested investigation be instituted in Case No. 5625, the instant proceeding, and made the petition of the People\u2019s Counsel and that of the Company a part of those proceedings. On February 25, 1960, the Commission dismissed the petition of the People\u2019s Counsel to reopen Case No. 5537 (the 1958 case) and to recluir\u00e9 the refund of any excess income. At the Company\u2019s request formal hearings on its application for the fixing of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>rate base were not commenced until March 23, 1960. Almost thirteen months later, on April 6, 1961, the Commission, after hearing extensive expert testimony from both sides, set the Company\u2019s intrastate rate base at $321,185,305 as of December 31. 1960, and allowed a return thereon of 6.3%. There was authorized an amended schedule of rates which would produce an increase to the Company of not more than $458,000 in gross annual revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The Company filed its appeal in the Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City pursuant to then Maryland Rule 1101 (now Rule B), limiting the issues on appeal to whether the Commission erred (a) in its finding of fair value, (b) in reducing the amount of income tax to be allowed as an operating expense, and (c) in disallowing the amount paid out as charitable contributions. Judge Allen resolved all issues against the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The testimony offered by the Company was that the fair value of its property used in rendering intrastate service (net plant, materials and supplies), as of May 31, 1960, was $338,885,965. The appraisals were predicated on the theory that the plant was built as it actually had been over the years at wage levels, labor productivity and other cost factors prevailing in 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Several techniques were used. Book cost was applied to rights-of-way, plant under construction and property held for future use. Most of the land was appraised. The price trend index method was applied to buildings, central office equipment, large private branch exchanges and underground conduits. Station apparatus and station connections were priced direct. The predominant unit method was applied to the remaining property. The last three classes of property made up forty-five, seventeen, and thirty-six per cent, respectively (a total of ninety-eight per cent), of total value.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The Company\u2019s appraisal resulted from ten months\u2019 study by its experienced engineers and accountants, assisted by outstanding experts, some of whom testified. The Dean of the School of Engineering of the Johns Hopkins University testified that the calculations which produced the Company\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>figures represented sound accounting, engineering and economic concepts and that the resulting figure indicated \u201cconservative fair value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The People\u2019s Counsel produced testimony from an accountant who had specialized in utility and regulatory commission procedures (he had long experience with the Public Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia and the Public Service Commission of Maryland, and had served as consultant to other Commissions). His testimony was that the fair value rate base should be \u201cthat figure which the Commission thinks is fair, after considering all of the evidence as to original cost, reproduction cost and any other matters having a bearing on the subject. It is purely a matter of Commission judgment. There is no formula that I am aware of with which to compute fair value.\u201d His estimate was that the fair value of the Company\u2019s property at December 31, 1960, was $292,481,788. He did not think the Company needed an increase in rates because \u201cEvery test shows the earnings to be more than generous. The securities of this Company are given the highest rating * * * [Dividends have been increased so that the effects of inflation have been compensated for, as they affect the stockholders, which in this case is A. T. &amp; T.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The United States, an intervenor, offered the testimony of a qualified economist that a fair and reasonable rate of return on a measurement of net book value would be 5.85%. The People\u2019s Counsel produced a recognized expert in the field of utility regulation, whose elaborate, painstaking and detailed analysis made him conclude that a return of from 6% to 6.25% on a rate base that was essentially determined from original cost less depreciation would be sound and proper to allow. This witness disagreed with the technical interpretation of statistics and data of the Dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Engineering and with his conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Code (1957), Art. 78, Secs. 68, 69 and 72, articulate what the decisions of this Court have previously determined. This is that the Commission in a rate case must fix \u201cthe fair value of the property of any public service company used and useful in rendering service to the public\u201d and allow a just rate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>return thereon, that is to say, a return which will result in as much net operating income as will yield a reasonable return on the rate base fixed. <em>C. &amp; P. Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, </em>201 Md. 170; <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Public Service </em>Commission, 206 Md. 533; <em>Hagerstown v. Public Service Commission, </em>217 Md. 101; <em>Baltimore Gas Co. v. McQuaid, </em>220 Md. 373. Section 85 (a) requires that every decision and order of the Commission in any contested proceeding shall be in writing and shall state concisely the grounds for the Commission\u2019s conclusions. Section 97 provides that every final decision of the Commission prima facie shall be correct and shall be affirmed on appeal to the courts unless shown to be unconstitutional, or without statutory authority or made upon unlawful procedure, or arbitrary or capricious, or unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, or is affected by other error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The Company contends that the Commission totally ignored the only evidence of current value in the record and relied on net original cost plus an increment value determined on a record made ten years before which, perhaps, was reasonable then but now was no more than the use of a rubber stamp, and that this makes the Commission\u2019s action unsupported by substantial evidence and affected by error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">A brief review of the prior rate cases in which the Company has been involved is necessary for a proper understanding and consideration of this contention. On March 16, 1950, the Commission decided a bitterly contested rate case (No. 4968) by finding a fair value of the Company\u2019s property to exceed its net original cost by $2,136,172. Less than fifteen months later, the Company filed a new rate application (No. 5176) which was tried largely upon the record made in the earlier case. After weighing all of the new evidence and considering the change in the economy which had taken place since its decision was rendered in No. 4968, the Commission in 1952 determined fair value by adding $3,060,139 to net original cost. The 1952 case came to this Court on appeal. The Company argued that the Commission had not given sufficient weight to the evidence of reproduction costs which had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>presented to the Commission. This Court affirmed the Commission and sustained its use of the $3,060,139 increment to net original cost in determining fair value. At pages 182-183 of 201 Md., we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\u201cWe come, then, to the heart of the question presented by the Company\u2019s appeal, whether the Commission failed to give to reproduction cost the consideration required by the concept of fair value * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">The Company argues that its estimate of reproduction cost was. conservative and designed to meet the objections raised in the prior hearings. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">Estimates of reproduction costs are conjectural at best, not merely because they rest on opinion, but for the obvious reason that probably no plant would ever be reproduced in its present form. Even the physical structures to replace the old would be designed, so far as possible, to compensate in efficiency and convenience for the higher construction costs. * * * In regard to plant equipment, the increased cost of reproduction would likewise be measurably offset by the technological improvements constantly discovered and introduced to meet the rising costs of labor and materials. One result is that equipment becomes obsolete before it wears out. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">There can be no doubt that the Commission took these factors into account. In its earlier opinion, reaffirmed in the opinion filed in 1951, it said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">'* * * In short, it is a theoretical reproduction of something which, as a practical matter if it did not exist, would not be produced in its present form and locations. As this highly theoretical process has questionable probative value in times of normal and stable economy, it has even less value at the present time. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-12\">'As heretofore mentioned, the Company is engaged in a major transition from manual to dial equipment. * * * These enormous changes strongly indicate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>there would be very little reality involved in undertaking to determine value from an estimate of the current cost of reproducing the entire plant.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">This Court went on to find the record did not justify the conclusion that the Commission had failed to give proper consideration to the evidence of reproduction costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In the 1952 proceeding, historical cost less depreciation showed a value for the Company\u2019s intrastate plant of approximately $115,000,000' the Company\u2019s evidence that it was approximately $145,000,000, or 26% above historical cost, and the Commission found fair value to be some $118,000,000, which was $3,060,139, or 2.7% above historical cost. After this Court had affirmed the Commission\u2019s action, a new application was made by the Company in 1953.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission then found fair value by taking the fair value found in the previous year (which included $3,060,139 above net historical cost) and adding to it the net investment in plant in the interim. Similarly, in 1954,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Company agreed by stipulation to accept as the fair value of its property the value determined by the Commission in 1953 plus the book value of net additions.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In 1958, the Company, again seeking an increase in income, offered evidence based upon a reproduction appraisal that the fair value of its plant was some $43,000,000 (or 17.67%) above the book value shown by the Company\u2019s records. The Commission found fair value to be $3,060,139 above book value.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus the same method and procedure has been followed in 1952, 1953, 1954 and 1958, in that fair value has been determined to be net book value plus an increment of $3,060,139. The Company acquiesced in the determinations of fair value made in 1953, 1954, and 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The Company says now that this Court in 1952 justified the Commission\u2019s use of $3,060,139 as an increment to net book cost bv deciding that the Commission had exercised its discretion to give some weight to reproduction cost, but that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the present case there is nothing to show why the same figure of $3,060,139 was used and that this indicates that no weight was given by the Commission to any evidence of value except original cost. It says that what was a judgment figure ten years ago in the 1952 proceeding today amounts to no more than an effort by the Commission to impose an original cost basis upon the Company contrary to the requirements of the statutes that fair value must be determined by the consideration and weighing of all relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We do not agree with the Company\u2019s contention. In determining fair value the Commission is not bound to accept any one factor or method, or any particular combination of these or to accept any particular kind of evidence. Its finding of fair value must only reflect \u201cthe reasonable judgment of the Commission, based on all relevant facts of which several only, or indeed but one, may prove to be controlling,\u201d as was said at page 547 of 206 Md. in <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra. </em>The Commission in the present case did acknowledge the evidence of the Company as to the value of its property in present day dollars, as is -shown by its actions in adding an increment to net book value and in increasing the rate base by using the end of the year as a test point. It chose to give no greater weight than it did to the Company appraisal of current value for the reasons which impelled it to largely reject similar testimony in 1952, an action which this Court found justified. In its opinion in the present case, the Commission said that the use of a predominantly net original cost base gave a factually determinable constant and necessitated but one variable, the proper rate of return, but if a rate base were determined by \u201ccurrent appraisal\u201d or \u201creproduction cost\u201d or \u201ctrended cost\u201d which change with the impact of recessions, booms, deflation or inflation or other economic trends, two variables would be involved. The Commission went on to say that in 1958 in Case No. 5537 the Company sought to have its rate base increased by giving evidence of cost indices indicating a current value derived from \u201ctrended original cost.\u201d The Commission then quoted its reasons for largely rejecting that evidence in the 1958 case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\u201cIn our opinion the determination of a rate base arrived at by the use of either \u2018trended costs\u2019 or \u2018reproduction costs\u2019 would, in today\u2019s economy, allow the company to reap a return on dollars never invested in plant and would require customers to pay for dollars never spent. In a reverse situation, with prices and cost declining, it could be argued that it would be equally unfair to Company to use either of these methods to establish a rate base, the result of which would be to deny the Company a return on dollars actually invested in plant. In point of fact the Company itself most vigorously opposed the use of price indices by the Commission when, some years ago, in a period of falling prices, the Commission attempted to arrive at a rate base by the trending method. The matter went to the Supreme Court of the United States and the position of the Company was sustained by the Court (295 U. S. 622) Vol. XLIX, 1958, P.S.C. of Md. Report, p. 42.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">It then went on to say it had in various applications of various utilities consistently sought to offset adverse inflationary effects by its determination of a proper rate of return and by using a terminal, or year end, rate base, and that it would do so in the instant case. The Commission then concluded its views on a fair rate base in the present case by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u201cUpon consideration of all of the evidence presented in this case we must find that the use of the rate base formerly used by the Commission in its determination of rates for this Company have produced results that have been fair and adequate insofar as the Company and its investors are concerned, and, if the results have been fair and adequate we assume that the means by which these results were accomplished were proper and reasonable. Having produced these results by the use of an original cost terminal rate base, plus the $3,060,139 increment added in 1951, it is our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>opinion that such a base, represents the \u2018fair value\u2019 of Company\u2019s property for rate making purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The opinion of the Commission shows it gave consideration to the Company\u2019s evidence of fair value by its discussion of the weaknesses of such evidence, its statement that there had been reliance on consideration of <em>all </em>the evidence in arriving at fair value and by the inferences drawn in it that previous similar rejections in large part of similar testimony had produced fair and reasonable results.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The fact that the Commission gave the same dollar weight to the Company\u2019s evidence of value\u2014by again adding $3,060,-139 to net original cost\u2014does not show that consideration and judgment had not preceded the use of this amount. It is scarcely arguable that actual original cost, less depreciation, is not the best evidence of the fair value of newly constructed plant and equipment, and for such new property reproduction cost (or \u201ccurrent appraisal\u201d) and book value tend to coincide. The Company has spent very large amounts in additions to its plant and equipment over the past ten years, and the proportion of new property and equipment in relation to the total thereof has constantly increased. In the 1952 case, the net \u201creproduction cost\u201d of plant exceeded net original cost by over 26%, while in this case \u201ccurrent appraisal\u201d exceeds net original cost by only 13%.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The increment of $3,060,139 is a substantially and significantly greater proportion of the difference between 1960 net original cost and 1960 current appraisal than it was between 1952 net original cost and 1952 reproduction cost. Further, the Commission not only added to the 1960 net original cost this presently more significant allowance of $3,060,139 for inflation but, by using a year end rate base, added an additional $14,213,454 above the mean average for 1960. These two items, totalling $17,273,593, are 41.5% of the $41,624,834 difference between the Company\u2019s current appraisal and net original cost found by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The conclusion of the Commission to give limited weight to the appraisal of current value not only finds support in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>decisions of this Court (C. <em>&amp; P. Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, Baltimore Transit Co. v. Public Service Commission, </em>and <em>Hagerstown v. Public Service Commission, </em>which have been cited above) but is consonant with the decisions and views of the courts of most of the jurisdictions in this country. The Company has cited cases in several States which have remanded rate cases because it was thought the regulatory body had not given proper weight to evidence of current value.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Often these turn on a controlling statute or particular facts of the case, and we do not find those which might be said to conflict with our prior decisions to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The testimony of the Company as to current appraisal of its plant is subject to many of the weaknesses noted in the opinion at page 183 of 201 Md. in <em>C. &amp; P. Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission </em>discussed above; as, for example, that the plant would not be rebuilt in its present form if it were rebuilt and the fact that the method used gives greatly unrealistic value to the oldest parts of the plant and equipment while appraisal of the new is almost the same under the historical value and current value tests.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The record offers ample support for the finding of the Commission of fair value. Code (1957), Art. 78, Sec. 72, makes all final conclusions of the Commission prima facie evidence of value <em>in </em>proceedings had in pursuance of that Article. Under this section, the valuation made by the Commission in the 1952 case, which was sustained by this Court, became prima facie evidence of the then value in a subsequent rate proceeding. The Company expressly agreed to use that value as brought up to date by changes in net book cost in the 1953 and 1954 proceedings, and acquiesced in the use of that value similarly modified in the 1958 case by failure to seek judicial review of the finding of fair value made at that time. In <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, </em>we said at pages 548 and 549 of 206 Md.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">\u201cThe 1948 figures were accepted by the Company without appeal. Code, 1951, Art. 78, Sec. 55 (c) provides that: 'All final valuations by the Commission shall be <em>prima jade </em>evidence of the value of said property in proceedings had in pursuance of this Article.\u2019 This is not to say that its failure to protest the 1948 value would bind or estop the Company but certainly, its acquiescence in the rate base found and used by the Commission' in 1948 must be put on the scale when there is weighed the lawfulness and reasonableness of the current finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The Company\u2019s estimates of value in this case are closer to book value percentage-wise than in their studies in the 1952 case and the 1958 case. The Commission determined net original cost of plant at the end of 1960 to be $318,000,000', whereas the Company\u2019s appraisal of the then value of the property was roughly $360,000,000, so that net original cost is about 88.3% of currently appraised cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The Company offered no evidence to show any substantial inflation between 1958 and the time of the hearing in the present case. The People\u2019s Counsel produced expert testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>mony as to fair value, which was considerably lower than that the Commission ultimately found. The validity of the theory upon which the Company\u2019s appraisal of value was predicated was challenged by witnesses produced by the People\u2019s Counsel and by the intervening protestants. During the years 1958 and 1959 the Company received profits which exceeded profits on a rate of return authorized by the Commission. In 1958 this profit was $2,500,000 more than that authorized, and after adjustments for net additions to plant, the Company\u2019s 1959 earnings were more than 6.5% of the average fair value of its plant used in intrastate service although the rate of return authorized by the 1958 order was only 6.25%. Net annual intrastate revenues have increased from $7,396,890 in 1951 to $18,572,975 in 1959 and about $20,000,000 in 1960. The Company\u2019s earnings per share increased from seventy-two cents in 1951 to $1.95 in 1960 and its earned surplus rose from $3,901,528 in 1951 to $22,039,079 in 1960. In the ten-year period the Company\u2019s securities have been given the highest ratings.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">The Company argues that the Commission\u2019s opinion (when it says the use of a readily measurable and factually determinable net original cost rate base leaves only one judgment figure or variable, that is, the rate of return, and when it says that the determination of a rate base arrived at by the use of trended costs or reproduction costs would allow the Company a return on dollars never invested) makes it clear that the Commission applied erroneous theories of law in arriving at its conclusions in this case. It says that although this Court has often ruled that a Commission order will not be reversed merely because the court, sitting in the place of the Commission, would have reached a different result, these rulings were based on the premise that the Commission has used correct legal principles in reaching the result. From this it argues that the court cannot uphold the Commission, even if it finds the result of its action valid, if the Commission gave the wrong reasons for reaching that result. Its reliance is on the principles enunciated in the case of <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U. S. 80, 87 and 94, 87 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>626, </em>wherein the Court said: \u201cThe grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that its action was based\u201d and \u201cThe Commission\u2019s action cannot be upheld merely because findings might have been made and considerations disclosed which would justify * * * [the] order * * *. There must be * * * a responsible finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The essential basis of the decision of the Supreme Court in the <em>Chenery </em>opinion was that the courts cannot review the actions of administrative bodies unless they are properly and adequately advised of the considerations which underlay the action under review. The opinion specified that the settled rule that if a lower court is right for the wrong reason there will be no reversal was not disturbed, but added that the rule included the corollary that if the correctness of a lower court\u2019s decision turns upon a determination of fact which had not actually been made, an appellate court cannot take the place of the trier of fact.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">We think that if the statements in the Commission\u2019s opinion which the Company seeks to use as showing the Commission gave wrong reasons for its action are read out of the context of its whole opinion, the Company would have a valid argument. So read, those statements would indicate that the Commission was adopting the philosophy of the case of <em>Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U. S. 591, 88 L. Ed. 333, that only the end result is significant in the determination of the validity of rate making, and that, as a matter of law, no weight need be given to reproduction costs or current value, and neither of these propositions is in accord with the law of Maryland. We think, too, as did Judge Allen below, that the statements must be read in context and accepted as expressions of the reasoning which motivated the Commission in determining what weight it should and would give to the evidence of current appraisal submitted by the Company and that they did not mean that the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>did not find fair value or that, in so doing, it gave no weight to the evidence of current value.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">We conclude from the record that the Commission did state the reasons which influenced it in its findings of fact and that it followed the duty imposed upon it by the statutes in determining the fair value of the Company\u2019s property used and useful in rendering service to the public, and allowed a rate of return based upon the fair value so determined. The Commission could have given more explicit reasons for its use of the same allowance for current value than it did, and in all cases it should do what it did not do in this case and concisely state the reasons for its actions, as fully and explicitly as is reasonably possible, as the applicable Maryland statute and cases say it should. Yet we find what we quoted in <em>Baltimore Transit Company v. Public Service </em>Commission, <em>supra, </em>at page 545 of 200 Md. to be apposite here, as it was there: \u201c \u2018The findings of the Commission in this regard leave much to be desired * * *. But the path which it followed can be discerned. And we do not believe its findings are so vague and obscure as to make the judicial review contemplated by the Act a perfunctory process.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">We do not see the Commission\u2019s action in setting a rate base to be arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, or otherwise affected by error in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">We turn to the Company\u2019s contentions as to its right to have deducted from operating income for rate making purposes the income tax it actually paid to the federal government, and the charitable contributions it made.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">In 1959 and 1960, as in earlier years, the Company filed a consolidated return with the sole owner of its stock, American Telephone and Telegraph Company (A. T. &amp; T.), and some seventeen other telephone company subsidiaries of the parent. The filing of the consolidated return resulted in large annual savings to A. T. &amp; T. amounting, for example, to some $52,000,000 in 1958 (because of the elimination of inter-company transactions). A. T. Sr T. retained all of this saving. A. T. &amp; T. has a substantial funded debt outstanding so that the debt-equity ratio for the Bell System as a whole is appreciably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>higher than that of the individual operating companies, including the appellant, the Maryland company. The federal income tax law permits the deduction of interest paid, so the tax liability of the Bell System is less than the aggregate liability of its component entities if computed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">All makers of a consolidated return are jointly and severally liable for the tax due. Each of the subsidiaries paid a tax computed as if it had filed an individual return which was larger than its proportionate share of liability under the consolidated return. For example, for 1960 the Company paid $144,110 more income tax than it would have if its liability had been figured by allocating to it a proportionate share of Bell System debt and deducting from taxable income the interest on such debt, calculated at the average interest cost of the System\u2019s outstanding debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Code (1957), Art. 78, Sec. 69, authorizes and directs the Commission to determine, as part of the process of fixing a just and reasonable rate, operating income which will yield <em>\u201cafter reasonable deduction for depreciation and other necessary and proper expenses and reserves\u201d </em>a reasonable return on a fair rate base. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">It was pursuant to this authority that the Commission made the adjustment in income tax allowed to be deducted\u2014an adjustment recommended, in such cases, by an accounting committee of the National Association of Railroad and Utility Commissioners and generally referred to as the NARUC tax adjustment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The Company says that the adjustment invaded the prerogative of a sound, honest and competent management and that the Commission could properly make the adjustment only on a finding of abuse of discretion, bad faith or wastefulness. It says the Commission is deciding what only the directors of the Company could decide\u2014the proper corporate structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">AVe think the Commission was justified in its action. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>owner and managers of the Company have the right to determine what its debt-equity ratio should be, but they may not always make the rate payers foot the bill resulting from the choice. There was no legal need for the Company to pay more than its proportionate share of the joint tax liability. It has not shown any reason or necessity for its assumption of a tax liability greater than it owed or any particular consideration passing to it from A. T. &amp; T., its sole owner, for contributing .a gift to that owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\">The liability of the System, under the consolidated returns, was determined not on the basis of some seventeen different \u25a0capital structures but on the basis of one composite structure with a 35% debt ratio (as against 18% for the Company). Since liability for taxes was figured on the theory of one system-wide entity, liability might fairly be set, as the Commission set it, among the component entities on a proportionate basis. There would seem to be no reason why Maryland telephone subscribers should pay more than the Company\u2019s proportionate share of the total Bell System tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The Company attacks the disallowance as based on a hypothetical debt structure. The structure was chosen by the Bell System management and was the one on which the Company had its tax liability established. The Company wishes to have its tax allowance based on a liability it would have if it had filed an individual return. It did not do so. The Commission allowed deduction of a tax liability which was the legal result \u25a0of actual action taken by the Company and its owner, rather \"than one voluntarily assumed for the benefit of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">There are cases upholding the Company\u2019s position. See <em>Application of Diamond State Telephone Co. </em>(Supreme Ct. Del.), 149 A. 2d 324, 328, and <em>Public Service Commission v. Indiana Bell Telephone Company </em>(Ind.), 130 N. E. 2d 467, 480. We are more impressed with the reasoning to the contrary of the majority of the regulatory bodies which have upheld the propriety of the Commission\u2019s stand,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and of the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>soning of cases such as <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Dept. of Public Utilities </em>(Mass.), 121 N. E. 2d 896; <em>Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm. </em>(La.), 94 So. 2d 431; and <em>Petitions of New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(Vt.), 80 A. 2d 671 (which upheld regulatory action based upon hypothetical debt ratios where actual ratios were unrealistically low), which support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The Commission\u2019s decision was primarily one of fact as to the necessity and propriety of the tax payment as an operating expense for rate making purposes. The statute authorized the decision, and our inquiry is limited on appeal to passing on illegality and unreasonableness. <em>Public Service Commission v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>207 Md. 524, 531; <em>Baltimore Gas Company v. McQuaid, </em>220 Md. 373, 382, and cases cited. We find nothing unlawful or unreasonable in what was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Much of what has been said on the issue of the income tax deductions applies to the disallowance of charitable contributions. If charitable contributions are allowed as an operating expense of a monopoly, it amounts to an involuntary levy on the rate payers. Many courts and commissions have, on this premise, required the utility itself to bear the burden and not to pass it on to the subscribers. See <em>Central Maine Power Co. v. Pub. Utilities Comm. </em>(Me.), 136 A. 2d 726, 731; <em>Peoples Gas Light &amp; Coke Co. v. Slattery </em>(Ill.), 25 N. E. 2d 482, 498; <em>Carey v. Corp. Comm. </em>(Okla.), 33 P. 2d 788, 794.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>We think the Commission did not err in doing this in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\">.

L. Rev. 188, the author, Joseph R. Rose, says in note 11: \u201cReproduction cost is defined as the estimated cost of constructing an identical plant at prices for labor and materials prevailing at the time of the valuation. But recently average prices over a period of time have been used rather than spot prices. See Pittsburgh v. Public Util. Comm\u2019n, 165 Pa. Super. 519, 525, 69 A. 2d 844, 847 (1949). In the present postwar period a variation of reproduction cost, denominated \u2018current value cost\u2019 or \u2018trended original cost,\u2019 has been introduced. Under this method price in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>dices are applied to an original cost base; the result is an estimate of reproduction cost on a piecemeal basis. Such an estimate is invariably in excess of true reproduction cost.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\">.
