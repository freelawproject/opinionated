Thereafter, on December 19, 1961, police officers discovered the radio in an apartment occupied by the appellant. He told the officers that he had purchased it from a store, but did not remember what store. At the trial, he did not testify and offer any explanation of how he came into possession of the radio, but produced his fifteen-year-old son, who testified that he, the son, had bought it, from \u201ctwo boys [who] were walking up the street,\u201d for four dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Appellant acknowledges and concedes the principle of law which requires that a person, who is found in possession of recently stolen property, produce a reasonable explanation of such possession, or face an inference that he is the one who has stolen it <em>(Butz v. State, </em>221 Md. 68, 156 A. 2d 423), but claims that the lapse of time between the theft and his possession in the case at bar is so great that he was not in possession of \u201crecently\u201d stolen property. In <em>Butz, </em>we stated: \u201cThe term \u2018recent,\u2019 when used in connection with recently stolen goods, is a relative term, and its meaning as applied to a given case will vary with the circumstances of the case.\u201d See also <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>213 S. W. 796 (Mo.); <em>State v. Brightman, </em>110 N. W. 2d 315 (Iowa); 32 Am. Jur., <em>Larceny, </em>\u00a7 142; <em>Boehm v. United States, </em>271 Fed. 454 (C.A. 2). Cf. 52 C.J.S., <em>Larceny, </em>\u00a7 106. We think that the radio was properly admitted in evidence, and that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction. The lapse of something over four months of time, under the circumstances of this case, was insufficient to destroy the probative effect that the trier of facts was entitled to give to the \u201crecent\u201d possession of the stolen property by the accused, in the absence of a reasonable explanation of his possession. And the trier of facts was justified in finding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>explanation given by the appellant was completely unreasonable and highly improbable\u2014in fact impossible in certain aspects. First, he claimed that he had purchased the radio from a store. This was quite unlikely, because the prosecuting witness had purchased it himself shortly before its theft. Second, the accused offered his young son, who stated that the son had bought it from two boys. Obviously, both versions could not be be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
