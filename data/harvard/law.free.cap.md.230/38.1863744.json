The appellant, Rita Lucille Rodda, had suffered personal injuries while riding in a 19S0 Dodge automobile owned by Malcolm V. Burton (Malcolm) and driven by his son Bobb Burton (Bobb) with his father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>permission. She and her mother recovered judgment for $37,812.00 against Bobb and the driver of the other car, one Stallings, whose insurance carrier paid $10,000 on account of the judgment. Nationwide paid the $20,000 it said it owed, without prejudice to appellants\u2019 right to sue for the $7,812.00 remaining unpaid on the judgment, as they did below.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In 1953 Nationwide issued its standard automobile liability policy, No. 52R-144-484 (the policy) to Malcolm covering the 1950 Dodge automobile and providing maximum limits of $20,000 for each person injured in one accident. The policy contained the usual omnibus clause extending the coverage of the policy to any person who was using the described automobile with the permission of the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In 1954 Bobb, a minor, wished to obtain a motor vehicle operator\u2019s license. To do so, it was necessary for him to file proof of continuing financial responsibility with the Department of Motor Vehicles by reason of the requirements of Code (1951), Art. <em>66\u00bd, </em>Sec. 92, as amended by Ch. 75 of the Laws of 1954 (Sec. 93 in the Code of 1957). Nationwide furnished this, for a premium, in the form of an endorsement numbered 359 (the endorsement), which named Bobb and which by its terms was \u201cAttached to and forming part of Policy No. 52R-144-484,\u201d and a JR-11 form to be filed with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles certifying that the requisite statutory insurance was in force. The endorsement was headed \u201cStatutory Coverage for Named Minors (Maryland)\u201d and recited it had been agreed \u201cthat such insurance as is afforded by the policy for Bodily Injury Liability * * * applies to the operation of any automobile by the minor named below * * * \u201d in accordance with the statutory requirements, subject to specified provisions, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\u201c2. The insurance afforded by this endorsement shall be excess over any other valid and collectible insurance available to the minor named below either as an insured under a policy applicable with respect to the automobile or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">\u201c5. The limits of bodily injury liability for the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>surance afforded by this endorsement are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">$10,000 each person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASh\">$20,000 each accident</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">The limit of property damage liability for the insurance afforded by this endorsement is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">$5,000 each accident</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">The above limits of liability are included in and are not in addition to any limits of liability stated elsewhere in the policy. If the limits of liability stated in the policy are in excess of the above stated limits, such insurance as is afforded by the policy with respect to such additional limits applies exclusive of the application of this endorsement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Nationwide paid $20,000 on account of the judgment against Bobb after it and appellant had, in writing, agreed that the rights of appellant to sue for and recover the $7,812.00 remaining unpaid would be left open.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Appellants then sued Nationwide. The suit was decided on the declaration, the policy and the endorsement (filed by Nationwide in response to the appellants\u2019 demand), and Nationwide\u2019s demurrer, which Judge Harlan sustained without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">Appellants argue that there were two separate policies and the limit under each must be paid, that provision two of the endorsement stating that the insurance thereby afforded shall be excess over \u201cany other valid and collectible insurance available to the minor * * * under <em>a policy </em>* * * or otherwise\u201d (emphasis supplied) makes Nationwide liable for ten thousand dollars under the endorsement in addition to twenty thousand dollars under Malcolm\u2019s policy, and finally, that if the terms of provision five of the endorsement, that \u201cthe above limits of liability are included in and are not in addition to any limits stated elsewhere in <em>the policy\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) conflict with those of provision two, there is an ambiguity created by Nationwide and the ambiguity must be resolved against it as the one who drafted the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">Nationwide says that the phrase \u201cthe policy,\u201d whenever used in the endorsement, as it is several times, means Nationwide\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>policy No. 52R-144-484 issued to Malcolm, to which the endorsement was attached as a part thereof, and the words \u201ca policy,\u201d used in provision two mean any other policy, that so read the endorsement as a whole clearly means that its ten thousand dollar coverage is excess if there is in force another policy which is primary, but if the insurer is liable under \u201cthe policy\u201d (No. 52R-144-484) its limits apply, and, in the words of provision five, \u201cif the limits of liability stated in <em>the policy </em>are in excess of the above stated limits, such insurance as is afforded by <em>the policy </em>with respect to such additional limits applies exclusive of the application of this endorsement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Judge Harlan agreed with Nationwide\u2019s construction, and we think he was right in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The endorsement was issued to enable Bobb to establish proof of financial responsibility under Code (1951), Art. 66\u00bd Sec. 92. The limit of liability coverage for injury to one person was required to be at least ten thousand dollars. Endorsement 359 fully met the statutory requirements since it explicitly provided that such insurance as was afforded by \u201cthe policy\u201d applied to the operation of any automobile operated by Bobb \u201cin accordance with the provisions of Section 92 of Article 66\u00bd of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1951 Edition) * * *.\" Since there was full compliance with all statutory requirements, and the rights of a third party who became injured were fully protected, the policy and the endorsement could contain any provision not in conflict with Art. 66\u00bd, otherwise unlawful, and is to be construed as would any ordinary policy. <em>Citizens Co. v. Allied </em>Co., 217 Md. 494, 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">We agree with Judge Harlan that there was no conflict of any term or provision of the policy or the endorsement with statutory demands, since Bobb had at least the statutory minimum of insurance coverage under all circumstances, and that: (a) the words <em>the policy </em>as used in the insuring clause of the endorsement are words of art used to identify the existing owner\u2019s policy of which the endorsement became a part; (b) provision five clearly and plainly limits coverage under the policy and the endorsement for liability of Bobb to twenty thousand dollars because that provision in precise and explicit terms says that the limits of liability specified in the endorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ment are included in, and are not in addition to, any limits of liability stated elsewhere in the policy; (c) there is no conflict between provision two and provision five and no ambiguity in the endorsement because the excess coverage language in two has no application to the coverage provided by \u201cthe policy.\u201d Since the insurance afforded by the policy applied to Bobb for his liability arising out of the accident and since it applied \u201cexclusive of the application of this endorsement,\u201d as provision five puts it, the endorsement afforded no additional insurance to Bobb, and provision two has no application; or to put it another way, provision two does not apply because its language, read as a part of the whole endorsement, undoubtedly means that the excess coverage clause applies only when Bobb is insured under <em>a policy </em>other than <em>the policy </em>and not when <em>the policy </em>protects him.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The sustaining of Nationwide\u2019s demurrer, without leave to amend, was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
