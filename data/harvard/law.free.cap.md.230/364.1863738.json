State, </em>219 Md. 512, 150 A. 2d 223; <em>Felkner v. State, </em>218 Md. 300, 146 A. 2d 424; <em>Cooper v. State, </em>220 Md. 183, 152 A. 2d 120. In the instant case, the evidence not only permits an inference of an intent to steal by the appellant, but some of the purloined property was actually found upon his person before he could escape. He, one \u201cFlatfoot,\u201d and another man were interrupted at a time when they were ransacking a dwelling. All three ran out of the house, but appellant was caught before he could get away. At first, he denied being in the house but later admitted that he was, and, when he was apprehended, a pair of gloves belonging to the matron of the dwelling fell from his pockets. There was ample evidence of his intent to steal.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
