Pursuant to Code (1957), Article 31B, Section 9 (b), his sentence was suspended, and he was committed to the Patuxent Institution for an indeterminate period.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">On June 11, 1962, he petitioned the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for a redetermination of his defective delinquency. At the time he was determined to be a defective delinquent on June 8, 1960, Article 3IB, Section 10 (a), provided that a defective delinquent could petition for a redetermination after he had been confined for two years. In 1961, the Legislature amended this Section so as to provide, <em>inter alia, </em>that before a defective delinquent was entitled to a redetermination, he must have been confined for at least two years after his commitment as a defective delinquent, <em>and </em>have been confined for a total period, including any period of confinement under his original sentence prior to commitment as a defective delinquent, equal to two-thirds of his original sentence. Code (1962 Cum. Supp.), Article 31B, Section 10 (a). On June 27, 1962, Judge Menchine denied his petition for a redetermination on the ground that Section 10 (a), as amended in 1961, was ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>plicable, and a sufficient period of time thereunder had not elapsed to warrant a redetermination.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Krs did not appeal from this decision, but, after about two and one-half months had expired, he, on September 11, 1962, filed a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>In this petition, he claimed that Judge Menchine was in error in two respects: that Section 10 (a), as amended, did not apply to his case because it would \u201cviolate his constitutional guarantee to protection from Ex Post Facto laws;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) that since his sentence was suspended at the time of his commitment, he \u201cno longer has a sentence to figure two thirds of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Judge Barrett heard the petition. He filed an able opinion, in which he stated that he was ruling upon a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>upheld Judge Menchine\u2019s rulings on both points raised by the petitioner, and denied the relief prayed. Thereafter, Krs wrote a letter to the trial court, which Judge Barrett construed as a request for an appeal. The Judge wrote a letter to the office of the Clerk stating that he had said in his memorandum opinion that he was ruling upon a <em>habeas corpus </em>petition, and he realized there was no right of appeal from a denial of such petition, but he thought the title to the petition was a misnomer \u201cunder the situation,\u201d and it was his opinion \u201cthat the allegations of the petition refer to the construction of Section 10 (a) Article 31B and that petitioner would have a right to file an application for leave to appeal in this matter.\u201d Judge Barrett, did not however, state what, in his opinion, was the true nature of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">It is certain that if the petition were a request for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>its denial afforded no right of appeal to this Court. Code (1962 Cum. Supp.), Article 27, Section 645A (b). And, if it is not a <em>habeas corpus </em>petition, it seems apparent that it must be considered as a petition for relief under the provisions of the Code (1962 Cum. Supp.), Article 27, Sections 645A-645J (Post Conviction Procedure). If this petitioner be permitted the right to appeal here, it amounts, purely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>and simply, to a delayed appeal from Judge Menchine\u2019s ruling on June 27, 1962. Where a person makes no showing or suggestion that he was denied a right to appeal, or that he made any effort to appeal within the time allowed therefor (30 days in this instance, Code (1962 Cum. Supp.), Article 31B, Section 11; Md. Rule 894 a 1), and no appeal was actually taken, he cannot thereafter obtain a delayed appeal through the vehicle of a post conviction proceeding. <em>Fisher v.
