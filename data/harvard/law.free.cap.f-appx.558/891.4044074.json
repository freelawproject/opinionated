The district court denied Prevo\u2019s motion because it found that he was ineligible for a reduction in sentence as he was serving a statutory mandatory-minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-27\">On appeal, Prevo argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010), lowered his mandatory-minimum sentence to five years. Prevo relies on <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. ---, ---, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), and states that the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Dorsey indicates that the FSA applies to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding brought by a defendant sentenced prior to the FSA\u2019s effective date. He also contends that the district court incorrectly believed his mandatory-minimum sentence was ten years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>instead of five years. Relying on <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. ---, 183 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), Prevo argues that his sentence is in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments because he was sentenced for conduct that was not charged in the indictment or provided for in the plea agreement. The government has responded with a \u201cMotion for Summary Affirmance and to Stay Briefing Schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Summary disposition is appropriate either where time is of the essence, such as \u201csituations where important public policy issues are involved or those where rights delayed are rights denied,\u201d or where \u201cthe position of one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case, or where, as is more frequently the case, the appeal is frivolous.\u201d <em>Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1969); <em>see United States v. Martinez, </em>407 F.3d 1170, 1173-74 (11th Cir.2005) (construing the defendant\u2019s \u201cunconventional\u201d motion as a motion for summary reversal, granting the motion, vacating the defendant\u2019s sentence, and remanding the case for resentencing where the district court had committed plain error by treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Section 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence where a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based. <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376. The Supreme Court has held that explained that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings have a limited scope and purpose, and that the proceedings are \u201cnot constitutionally compelled,\u201d but instead represent a \u201ccongressional act of lenity.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 825-29, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>see also United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that constitutional claims are \u201cextraneous resentencing issues\u201d that a court cannot address during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, and that a defendant is entitled to raise constitutional challenges to a sentence by making a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Amendment 750 retroactively lowered the sentencing range applicable to crack cocaine offenses by revising the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 750 (2011). Following Amendment 750, a defendant responsible for at least 28 grams, but less than 112 grams, of cocaine base has a base offense level of 26. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7). The FSA reduced the mandatory-minimum penalties for crack cocaine offenses in \u00a7 841(b) as to offenders who committed crack cocaine offenses before its August 3, 2010, effective date, but who were not sentenced until after that date. <em>Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. at ---, 132 S.Ct. at 2326; <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Following the FSA, a defendant who commits an offense involving 28 grams or more of cocaine base after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years, and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The Guidelines provide that a court may sentence a defendant anywhere within the applicable guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>line range except that the sentence imposed must not be less than the statutorily required minimum sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2). Thus, if a defendant\u2019s sentence is based on a \u00a7 841(b) mandatory minimum that is above the applicable guideline range, Amendment 750 does not lower the defendant\u2019s guideline range and the defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Here, Prevo was sentenced after the FSA\u2019s effective date for an offense committed prior to the FSA\u2019s effective date, and, thus, he was subject to the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory penalties for crack cocaine offenders. <em>See Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. at ---, 132 S.Ct. at 2326. At sentencing, the district court correctly determined that Prevo was subject to an enhanced 10-year statutory minimum in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) under the provisions of the FSA because his offense involved more than 28 grams of cocaine base and he had several prior felony convictions for drug offenses. Although Amendment 750 reduces Prevo\u2019s \u00a7 2D1.1 offense level, it does not reduce his advisory guideline range below the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2). Thus, because Prevo is serving a mandatory-minimum sentence, the district court correctly denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, as Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering his guideline range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">Prevo\u2019s arguments regarding the application of the FSA to his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are meritless because the district court at sentencing used the FSA to determine his statutory penalties, and, thus, he was sentenced pursuant to the FSA. Likewise, the government correctly notes that Prevo mistakenly believes his statutory sentencing range was 5 to 40 years under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), as he failed to account for the \u00a7 851 enhancement that was filed during his criminal proceedings. Additionally, Prevo\u2019s argument based on <em>Alleyne </em>does not provide any basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because a district court may not consider extraneous constitutional challenges to a sentence during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 825-29, 130 S.Ct. at 2691-92; <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">Accordingly, the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and the government\u2019s motion to stay the briefing schedule is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
