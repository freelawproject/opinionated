Harris argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the trial court denied the jury\u2019s request for a transcript of a witness\u2019s testimony because that ruling led the jury to believe that it was impermissible to recite that testimony. Because it was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law for the Florida courts to conclude that Harris failed to establish that his counsel acted deficiently or that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s conduct, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-14\">Harris proceeded to trial on charges of armed sexual battery and false imprisonment. Before voir dire, the trial court introduced the court .reporter. The district court explained that the reporter was \u201cmaking a record of everything that\u2019s being said in the courtroom\u201d and could \u201clater, upon request, make a written version of her notes so anybody can read what was said during trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-15\">At trial, the victim, Harris\u2019s wife, Janelle Harris, testified that, while she was separated briefly from Harris, he sexually abused and restrained her. Janelle testified that, about a year earlier, she was living in her mother\u2019s house, but returned to the family home to spend the night. The next morning, Harris forced his way into the house wielding a knife that they routinely left on the front porch to open the door. Harris told Janelle repeatedly to hush as he pushed her onto a bed, told her that he was going to rape and kill her, and placed duct tape over her mouth. When Harris tried to tape Janelle\u2019s wrists to the frame of the bed, she resisted and grabbed the knife. Harris began to strangle Janelle, who managed to bite Harris\u2019s arm, and he bit her in return. The couple tumbled onto the floor, and then Harris raped Janelle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-16\">As he was leaving, Harris warned Janelle not to tell anyone about the incident and not to appear for a court date, and he instructed her to tell her male \u201cfriend\u201d that \u201cit was over.\u201d Harris said that he was watching Janelle, she would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>harmed if she followed his instructions, and he would return in a week to \u201cbe a family.\u201d After Harris left, Janelle \u201claid ... on the floor for a while and cried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">Janelle eventually cleaned her body, got dressed, and drove to the police station, where she reported the incident. Janelle identified photographs taken of bruises and bite marks on her body, but she explained that some of her injuries had been inflicted a week earlier. On cross-examination, Janelle stated that she had not been raped and had acquiesced to Harris\u2019s request to have sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Harris called Janelle\u2019s mother, Mary Lovett, as a witness in his defense. Lovett testified that, on the morning of the incident, she visited the Harris home around 8:30 a.m. to obtain some clothes for her grandsons to wear to church; she was surprised to see Harris\u2019s car parked in the driveway; and she entered the house to find Janelle sleeping peacefully in her room. Lovett returned to the house a little before 11:00 a.m. and met Janelle as she was walking out the front door. Janelle, without explanation, asked her mother to keep the boys. Lovett could not remember if Janelle had been upset, but after Lovett had her memory refreshed with her statement to the police, she recalled that Janelle appeared to have been crying as she left the house. Lovett acknowledged that she did not want anything to happen to Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Harris admitted that he had assaulted Janelle. He testified that he entered their home with his key, woke Janelle, and \u201ccoerced her, pretty much, ... to have sex.\u201d Later in the morning, he allowed Lovett to enter the home and retrieve clothes for the boys, and the situation remained peaceful until Janelle received a telephone call and would not identify the caller. A fight ensued and, after Janelle admitted to talking to another man, Harris began to choke Janelle. According to Harris, Janelle retrieved a knife from under her pillow, tried to stab Harris, and then bit him. Harris admitted that he taped Janelle\u2019s mouth and one of her arms and then warned her not to call the police before he left the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">During deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial court that asked, \u201cMother and in-law\u2019s testimony, can we see, please?\u201d The trial court interpreted the note as requesting either the \u201ctranscript of the testimony, which [it was] not going to permit\u201d because \u201c[w]e can\u2019t type\u201d it, or the written statement that Lovett provided to the police, which was inadmissible and could not be considered by the jury. The prosecutor and the trial court agreed that the jury should rely on their recollection of the testimony. Harris agreed with the decision, \u201cassuming that [the trial court did not] want to read back her testimony,\u201d and the trial court responded, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">After the jury returned to the courtroom, the trial court told the jury that the court reporter could not produce a written transcript and that they should rely on their recollection of the testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-11\">If you\u2019re asking to have the oral testimony transcribed by the court reporter to be read back in there, the answer would be no because it would be time consuming and not possible to have her type that up that quickly. So that answers that part of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-12\">If you\u2019re asking to see those handwritten things that were used during the trial, the answer is no, because they\u2019re not in evidence. And so that answers your question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-13\">So you will have to rely on your collective memory, if you will, as to the testimony you\u2019ve hear from the witness stand and the evidence that\u2019s back there in the room with you. I know you may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>be disappointed, but, again, that\u2019s the law. Thank you very much, though. Any other questions, we\u2019ll be glad to try to answer them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">After the jury resumed its deliberations, the trial court mentioned that it intended to revise its initial instructions to the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-5\">I think they wanted me to \u2014 when I said that, they pointed at her. One of them went like that (indicating) to the court reporter. So I think I\u2019m going to change my initial instruction. When I introduce all the people, I make the mistake, I think, of telling them that the court reporter can type it up and read it back to us, if needed, which I never do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">The jury found Harris guilty of the lesser-included offense of sexual battery and false imprisonment, and Harris received a sentence of 12 years for sexual battery and a sentence of five years for false imprisonment. Harris appealed and argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the affidavit supporting his arrest warrant and the charging document was defective. The Fifth District Court of Appeal affirmed summarily. <em>Harris v. State, </em>15 So.3d 596 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Harris filed <em>pro se </em>a motion for post-conviction relief in which he raised two claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850. Relevant to this appeal, Harris argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the trial court denied the jury\u2019s request for a transcript of Lovett\u2019s testimony. Harris contended that the response of the trial court to the jury\u2019s question and its remark that it \u201cnever\u201d provided a transcript to a jury caused it to believe that it was not entitled to have testimony read back. Harris argued that he was prejudiced because a recitation of the testimony might have led the jury to acquit him and because, had the issue been preserved for appellate review, he would have been entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">A Florida court denied Harris\u2019s motion. The state court applied the standard for reviewing claims of ineffective assistance provided in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and ruled that counsel had not defi-ciently in failing to object because \u201cthe trial judge had broad discretion to deny the read-back during jury deliberations\u201d; the judge\u2019s remark about never providing a transcript was not communicated to and could not have misled the jury; and the judge\u2019s remarks \u201c[did] not indicate that the read-back [was] being denied because it [was] prohibited.\u201d The state court also ruled that Harris could not \u201cestablish prejudice where Counsel failed to object to the denial of the read-back in order to preserve it for appellate review\u201d and when Harris \u201cfailed to indicate how\u201d reading the \u201ctestimony would have assisted the jury in finding him not guilty.\u201d The Fifth Circuit affirmed summarily. <em>Harris v. State, </em>94 So.3d 607 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">Harris filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus and repeated his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court denied the writ and \u201cdefer[red] to the ... conclusion [of the state court] that [Harris] could not establish prejudice at trial where counsel failed to object to the denial of the readback.\u201d The district court noted that counsel \u201cmay have been deficient for failing to object to the [trial] court\u2019s summary denial of the jury\u2019s request\u201d because decisions of the Florida courts issued after Harris\u2019s trial \u201cexpressly prohibited the [trial] court\u2019s refusal to consider a read back,\u201d but the district court found it \u201cunnecessary ... to decide whether [those decisions] ... [could] be retroactively applied to make a determination that counsel performed deficiently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus that alleges ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Johnson v. Sec\u2019y, DOC, </em>643 F.3d 907, 929 (11th Cir.2011). A petitioner is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court reached a decision that was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). A state court makes an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law only if the court \u201c\u2018identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the] decisions [of the Supreme Court] but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts\u2019 of petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 520, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 2534-35, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (quoting <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)). To prevail on an argument involving an unreasonable application of federal law, a petitioner \u201cmust show that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. ---, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Harris must \u201c[s]urmount[ ] [a particularly] high bar\u201d to obtain a writ of habeas corpus based on ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 371, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 1485, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010). Harris must not only prove that his counsel committed an error and that error was \u201cso serious as to deprive [him] of a fair trial,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, but he also must overcome the \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d standard applied to the decisions of counsel in habeas corpus review. <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, 123, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1420, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009). We are required to determine \u201cnot whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable[,]\u201d but instead \u201cwhether there [was] any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">Harris\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance fails. Harris argued that counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the trial court denied the jury\u2019s request for a transcript and counsel\u2019s request to instruct the jury that it could request a readback. The Florida courts reasonably concluded that Harris\u2019s counsel would conclude that an objection would fail \u201cin [the] light of information then available to counsel.\u201d <em>Premo v. Moore, </em>562 U.S. at ---, 131 S.Ct. 733, 741, 178 L.Ed.2d 649 (2011); <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689,104 S.Ct. at 2065 (\u201cA fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d). At the time of Harris\u2019s trial, trial courts exercised broad discretion in determining whether to read back a witness\u2019s testimony to the jury. <em>See Frasilus v. State, </em>46 So.3d 1028, 1029 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2010); <em>see also In re Amends, to the Fla. Rules of Civil Proc., </em>967 So.2d 178, 183 (Fla.2007) (providing standard instructions for trial courts to either grant, defer, or deny a jury\u2019s request to have testimony read back). \u201cIn fact, the Florida Supreme Court [had] observed that \u2018courts [had] found no abuse of discretion even where the trial judge [had], without much consideration, entirely rejected the jury\u2019s request for a read back.\u2019 \u201d <em>Frasilus, </em>46 So.3d at 1029 (quoting <em>Francis v. State, </em>808 So.2d 110, 130 (Fla.2001)). Although the Second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>District Court of Appeals had held years earlier that a failure to advise a jury of the right to have testimony read back to them had been fundamental error, <em>LaMonte v. State, </em>145 So.2d 889, 892-93 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1962), that decision had been based on a statute that made a read-back mandatory, and that statute had since been repealed and replaced with a rule that \u201celiminate[d] the mandatory language\u201d and gave trial courts discretion whether to read back testimony, <em>Frasilus, </em>46 So.3d at 1031-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Moreover, the Florida courts reasonably concluded that Harris was not prejudiced. As explained by the state court, Harris \u201cfailed to indicate how he was actually prejudiced\u201d by counsel\u2019s conduct. Lovett\u2019s testimony was not such powerful evidence in support of Harris\u2019s defense that it was unreasonable for the state court to conclude that the jury would not have acquitted Harris even had the testimony had been read back, particularly in the light of Harris\u2019s admissions that he \u201ccoerced\u201d his wife into having sex with him and he bound her so she would not report the incident to the police. The state court reasonably determined that Harris failed to establish that his counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">We AFFIRM the denial of Harris\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
