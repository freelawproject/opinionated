On appeal, Johnson argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-16\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-17\">Then, we examine whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>Although we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum is another indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>2008). The defendant bears the burden to show his sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">With respect to procedural reasonableness, Defendant Johnson raises two guidelines calculation errors, neither of which has merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, the district court did not clearly err in attributing to Johnson pseudoephedrine purchases he made before he met two of his coconspirators, codefendant Amanda Stern and another individual identified as \u201cSZ\u201d in May 2012. By pleading guilty, Johnson admitted that he conspired with Stern and \u201cothers known and unknown,\u201d to manufacture methamphetamine \u201cfrom at least on or about January 9, 2012 until on or about July 11, 2012.\u201d <em>See United States v. Fair-child, </em>803 F.2d 1121, 1124 (11th Cir.1986) (stating that an unconditional guilty plea admits all the elements of a formal criminal charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Furthermore, contrary to Johnson\u2019s claim, his charged conspiracy was not limited to only Stern and SZ and did not begin when he met Stern and SZ at a Target store and they agreed to buy pseu-doephedrine for him. It is undisputed that, after Johnson\u2019s arrest, he admitted to manufacturing methamphetamine about twice a month for four years for his personal use and that of his friends. Johnson further admitted to using individuals other than Stern and SZ, such as his ex-girlfriend Laura Markheim and homeless people, to buy the pseudoephedrine he needed to make the methamphetamine. Under the circumstances, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Johnson\u2019s own pseudoephedrine purchases made during the conspiracy period were part of the charged conspiracy. Given that relevant conduct includes a defendant\u2019s own acts in furtherance of a drug conspiracy, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A), the district court properly included in its drug quantity determination Johnson\u2019s own pseu-doephedrine purchases made during the charged conspiracy period.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Second, the district court did not clearly err when it applied the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) for maintaining a premises for the purposes of manufacturing methamphetamine. The undisputed facts show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>that about twice a month Johnson made methamphetamine at a storage unit he rented. The fact that Johnson also used the storage unit to store his personal belongings does not preclude application of the enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 17 (providing that the manufacturing of a controlled substance need not be the only purpose for which the premises were used, but must be one of the primary or principal uses and not an incidental or collateral use). Given the frequency over time that Johnson used the storage facility to make methamphetamine, we cannot say the district court clearly erred in finding that his methamphetamine manufacturing was one of the primary purposes of the storage unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Defendant Johnson also has not shown that his 120-month sentence, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range of 120 to 151 months, was substantively unreasonable. In the charged conspiracy, Johnson was the one who made the methamphetamine, which, as the district court noted, is an inherently dangerous process involving toxic and explosive chemicals. In addition to purchasing pseudoephed-rine, Johnson recruited others to do so for him, including paying homeless individuals. While Johnson was not a large-scale methamphetamine distributor, he nonetheless trafficked in methamphetamine by sharing it with his co-conspirators and friends. Furthermore, as the district court pointed out, Johnson introduced codefendant Stern to the drug. We reject Johnson\u2019s characterization of himself as merely a drug addict who was unfairly sentenced as a drug trafficker.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Johnson also has an extensive, thirty-year criminal history, with many theft and drug-related convictions and arrests. Although the district court acknowledged that many of Johnson\u2019s offenses appear to stem from his long-term drug addiction, the district court further observed that Johnson had not shown any positive behavior during those thirty years and appears incapable of changing or of following the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Defendant Johnson argues that the district court failed to accord sufficient weight to his mitigating factors, such as his chronic drug addiction, the fact that he manufactured only small amounts of methamphetamine mainly for his personal use, and the fact that his criminal history included many \u201cminor\u201d crimes \u201cindicative of his status as a chronic drug addict.\u201d The district court explicitly considered all of these mitigating factors at sentencing, and was within its discretion in concluding that they were outweighed by other factors, such as the need to protect the public, promote respect for the law, and deter future criminal and thus did not justify a downward variance. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). To the extent Johnson asks this Court, reweigh individual \u00a7 3553(a) factors, this is not something we do when, as here, the ultimate sentence imposed is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">Finally, Johnson argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court \u201cgave improper weight to prejudicial factual findings that were irrelevant and/or unsupported.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, Johnson points to the district court\u2019s comments that: (1) Johnson introduced SZ to meth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>amphetamine and drove \u201cwhile he apparently [was] using these drugs\u201d; and (2) that Johnson\u2019s criminal history included a pending \u201cdomestic-type\u201d charge and two other offenses in which Johnson was found by law enforcement in possession of a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The district court\u2019s statements do not require us to remand for resentencing. First, the district court may properly consider a defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, including any undisputed criminal history described in the PSI. Johnson did not object to the criminal history portion of his PSI. Thus, the PSI\u2019s descriptions of Johnson\u2019s convictions, arrests, and pending charges \u2014 including his possession of a knife during two arrests and his pending charge for domestic battery \u2014 were deemed admitted. <em>See United States v. Bedeles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 844 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the PSI\u2019s factual statements renders those statements undisputed and allows the sentencing court to rely upon them). Notably, Johnson has never challenged the factual accuracy of the PSI\u2019s description of his criminal history. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>989 F.2d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.1993) (concluding that the district court may rely upon a PSI\u2019s undisputed summary of the facts surrounding an offense or arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Johnson is correct that he was not arrested for or charged with driving under the influence. However, Johnson does not dispute that he has been a drug addict his entire adult life and that he committed numerous driving offenses over that same time period. Moreover, the district court properly considered Johnson\u2019s driving record as part of his entire criminal history over thirty years. Although the district court was concerned that Johnson may have driven while under the influence of drugs, the record does not suggest that district court selected the 120-month sentence based on this particular concern. Rather, the district court concluded that Johnson\u2019s entire criminal history, considered as a whole, demonstrated that he was unable to follow the law and therefore posed a danger to the public. The fact that Johnson was not actually arrested for driving under the influence does not make the court\u2019s overarching concern any less valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Johnson is also correct that the record is silent as to whether SZ had used methamphetamine before meeting Johnson. However, the record is clear that codefendant Stern did not use methamphetamine until Johnson gave it to her. Given that Johnson had in fact introduced another person to methamphetamine, the district court\u2019s misstatement (that he introduced the drug to both SZ and Stern) is harmless. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that a harmless error is one that either did not affect the sentence or had only a very slight effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">In sum, in light of the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion when it imposed a 120-month sentence, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-6\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b930-8\">. We review the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual finding for clear error. <em>United States v. Ahnedina, </em>686 F.3d 1312, 1312 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b930-12\">.Johnson's reliance on <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>164 F.3d 1354 (11th Cir.1999) is misplaced. <em>Gomez </em>involved a defendant held accountable for an <em>uncharged </em>drug transaction that occurred away from the car wash where all the other transactions in the drug conspiracy took place. 164 F.3d at 1355, 1357. The Court in <em>Gomez </em>explained that although a defendant \u201cmay be held accountable at sentencing for illegal conduct not in furtherance of the offense of conviction,\u2019\u2019 it must be part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, which the uncharged drug transaction was not. <em>Id. </em>at 1356 (emphasis added). Here, however, Johnson\u2019s pseu-doephedrine purchases between January and May 2012 were part of the <em>charged </em>methamphetamine conspiracy to which he pled guilty and <em>were </em>in furtherance of that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b931-7\">. Johnson characterizes the alleged error as the consideration of improper or irrelevant factors and argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (explaining that a sentence may be substantively unreasonable if the district court gave \u201csignificant weight to an improper or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>irrelevant factor\u201d). However, the gravamen of Johnson's argument is that the district court made assumptions that were not supported by the record and thus were clearly erroneous. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (stating that a sentence is procedurally unreasonable if it is based on clearly erroneous facts). Regardless of how the alleged error is characterized, for the reasons discussed above, no reversible error has been shown.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
