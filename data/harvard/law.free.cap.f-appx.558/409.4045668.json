After commencing his term of supervised release, the district court determined that Luxford had violated the terms of his supervised release and revoked his supervised release. The district court imposed a sentence of two years of imprisonment and a lifetime term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Luxford appeals, arguing that the district court committed error by providing insufficient reasons for the lifetime term of supervised release. He also argues that the lifetime term of supervised release is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the statutory purposes for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">When a defendant properly preserves an objection for appeal, this court reviews \u201ca sentence imposed on revocation of supervised release under a \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 standard, in a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 326 (5th Cir.2013). This court generally follows the procedural and substantive considerations that are employed in the review of original sentences, but provides more deference to revocation sentences than to original sentences. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). First, the court ensures that the district court did not commit significant procedural error, such as, inter alia, \u201cfailing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 326. Second, if there is no procedural error, this court considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>If the sentence is unreasonable, this court \u201cmay reverse the district court only if we further determine the error was obvious under existing law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">Luxford did not object that the district court\u2019s reasons were insufficient. Therefore, plain error review governs this argument. <em>See Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 326-27; <em>United States v. Mandragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361-62 (5th Cir.2009). To establish reversible plain error, Luxford bears the burden of showing error, that is plain and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 326; <em>see Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To affect substantial rights, the defendant must demonstrate that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 327. This court will exercise its discretion to correct the error only \u201cif it seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">When evaluating whether a district court has provided adequate reasons for a revocation sentence, this court refers to <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and this circuit\u2019s case law that applies <em>Rita. See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 261 (5th Cir.2009). The lifetime term of supervised release was authorized by the Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 7B1.3(g)(2), 501.2(b)(2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2425, 3588(h), 3583(k); <em>United States v. Allison, </em>447 F.3d 402, 406 (5th Cir.2006). Therefore, a lengthy explanation was not required. <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 357, 127 S.Ct. 2456. Moreover, where a district court imposes a guidelines-range sentence, this court infers that the district court considered the necessary sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Luxford\u2019s reliance upon <em>United States v. Fraga, </em>704 F.3d 432 (5th Cir.2013), and <em>United States v. Alvarado, </em>691 F.3d 592 (5th Cir.2012), is misplaced. <em>Fraga </em>and <em>Alvarado </em>involved appeals of original sentencing proceedings, not resentencings upon revocation of supervised release, as in Luxford\u2019s case. <em>See Fraga, </em>704 F.3d at 437; <em>Alvarado, </em>691 F.3d at 594. Additionally, in both <em>Fraga </em>and <em>Alvarado, </em>the district judge failed to provide reasons for imposing a lifetime term of supervised release and indicated that she automatically imposed a lifetime term of supervised release in sex offense cases. <em>See Fraga, </em>704 F.3d at 441-42; <em>Alvarado, </em>691 F.3d at 598. In contrast to <em>Fraga </em>and <em>Alvarado, </em>in Luxford\u2019s case, the district court did not indicate that it automatically imposed a lifetime term of supervised release in sex offense cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">In the instant case, the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing prior to revoking supervised release and then, pri- or to sentencing, ordered the production of a forensic report for assistance with the sentencing decision. The forensic report, prepared by a psychologist, was filed in the record and presented to the parties. The record of the sentencing hearing reveals extensive consideration by the district court of Luxford\u2019s personal history and characteristics, the circumstances of his violation of the conditions of supervised release, the need for deterrence, the arguments of the parties, and the policy statements in the Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 844. The district court therefore did not commit plain error by providing inadequate reasons for the sentence. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 357, 127 S.Ct. 2456; <em>Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 326; <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Luxford objected to the length of his term of supervised release and thus adequately preserved his objection to substantive reasonableness. <em>See Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 326. The substantive reasonableness of his revocation sentence is therefore reviewed under the plainly unreasonable standard. <em>Id. </em>The imposition of a lifetime term of supervised release in sex offense cases can be reasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, </em>445 F.3d 815, 820 (5th Cir.2006). Because the supervised release term is within the guidelines range, it is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Luxford\u2019s conclusional arguments do not rebut the presumption of reasonableness that is afforded to his guideline-range sentence. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Luxford has failed to demonstrate that the sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>See Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 326; <em>Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
