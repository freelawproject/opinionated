Castillo-Ruelas argues that the district court erred in calculating the drug quanti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>ty and in imposing an enhancement for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The district court\u2019s calculation of the quantity of drugs involved in an offense is a factual determination that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). Castillo-Ruelas\u2019s mere opinion that his brother\u2019s testimony was not credible is not sufficient to undermine the district court\u2019s credibility determinations or rebut the reliability of the drug quantity information contained in the presentenee report (PSR). <em>See United States v. Montes, </em>602 F.3d 381, 384 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Ford, </em>558 F.3d 371, 376-77 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 832 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The district court\u2019s determination that a defendant obstructed justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 is also a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 208 (5th Cir.2008). Castillo-Ruelas\u2019s mere objection to the obstruction of justice enhancement, without more, does not suffice to rebut the truth, accuracy, or reliability of the supporting evidence contained in the PSR. <em>See id. </em>at 208; <em>see also Ford, </em>558 F.3d at 376-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The district court did not clearly err in calculating the drug quantity or in imposing an obstruction of justice enhancement. <em>See Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 246; <em>Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d at 208. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
