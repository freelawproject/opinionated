Brumfield appeals the sentence for his conviction for distribution of five grams or more of methamphetamine. The district court varied upward from the guidelines range of 60 to 71 months to 100 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Brumfield contends that his 100-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because the primary reason for the upward variance was the district court\u2019s perception that his prior drive-by-shooting sentence was lenient, which he argues the district court based on inherently unreliable information.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-23\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, we will review Brumfield\u2019s claim of error for plain error because his general objection to the sentence was not \u201csufficiently specific to alert the district court to the nature\u201d of the error he now asserts and did not provide the district court an opportunity to correct the error. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, Brumfield must show that the error was clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it \u201c \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range\u201d and \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201cA non-Guideline sentence unreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors where it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">At sentencing, the district court described the three-year suspended sentence for accessory after the fact to a drive-by-shooting as \u201clenient.\u201d The record does not support Brumfield\u2019s assertion that the district court believed the prior sentence was lenient because he was actually guilty of a more serious charge since the district court made no explicit statement to this effect. It was not improper for the district court to consider the leniency of Brum-field\u2019s prior sentence. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328-29 (5th Cir.2004). Moreover, the record does not support Brumfield\u2019s assertion that the district court\u2019s perception that his prior sentence was lenient was the primary reason for the upward variance. The district court did not make any explicit statement to this effect and mentioned the leniency of the prior sentence once. The district court cited the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and articulated several other compelling reasons for imposing an upward variance, including Brumfield\u2019s criminal history in light of his age, his poor performance on probation, the seriousness of the instant offense, the likelihood that he would commit further crimes, and the need to protect the public from further crimes. Rather than focusing on any particular prior offense or sentence, the district court was particularly troubled by the persistency of Brumfield\u2019s criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The extent of the variance, 29 months above the guidelines maximum of 71 months, is within the range of variances we have upheld. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 345 (5th Cir.2011). Given the significant deference that is due to a district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, and the district court\u2019s reasons for its sentencing decision, Brumfield has not demonstrated that the sentence is substantively unreasonable, <em>see McElwee, </em>646 F.3d at 344-45. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err or abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
