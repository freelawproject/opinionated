Dec. 552 (BIA 1999). This was the second such motion Onyido filed in 2013, almost 14 years after he was deported. The BIA denied the motion as both time-barred and number-barred, regardless of how it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>construed. The BIA also found no exceptional circumstances to justify reopening, and it noted that relief was barred by Onyido\u2019s deportation. In his petition for review, Onyido challenges his deportation and the underlying aggravated felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Onyido invoked the BIA\u2019s authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2. Section 1003.2(a) affords an Immigration Judge (IJ) or the BIA \u201ccomplete discretion\u201d to deny a motion to reopen, and we therefore have \u201cno legal standard by which to judge\u201d such a decision. <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir.2008). We accordingly lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id.; Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.2004) (citing other circuits\u2019 decisions holding the same). Onyido\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED. All motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
