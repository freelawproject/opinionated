Albarran-San-chez claims that the sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the requirements of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He asserts that the sentence should not be subject to the presumption of reasonableness because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis, but he acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mondraugon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 365-67 (5th Cir.2009). He also claims that \u00a7 2L1.2 double-counted his criminal history and overstated the seriousness of the offense, which is merely an international trespass. He asserts that the sentence failed to reflect his personal history and characteristics, including the facts that he came to the United States to obtain work when he was 15 years old, earned much less when he was removed to Mexico, returned to the United States to obtain work to support his United States citizen son, his mother, and his sister, arguing that his motive mitigated the seriousness of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under the bifurcated review process adopted in <em>Gall, </em>we first consider whether the district court committed procedural error, then examine the sentence for substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>619 F.3d 469, 471-72 (5th Cir.2010). A sentence within the advisory guidelines range is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-51 &amp; n. 11 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">After the district court considered the PSR and Albarran-Sanchez\u2019s personal history and characteristics, it determined that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range was appropriate. We have rejected the contention that the use of prior convictions to increase the offense level and also to calculate criminal history is impermissible double-counting. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. We have also rejected the contention that illegal reentry is not a serious offense, but only an international trespass. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). Albarran-Sanchez\u2019s disagreement with \u201cthe propriety of the sentence imposed\u201d is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). As Albar-ran-Sanchez has not shown that the district court failed to give proper weight to his arguments or a \u00a7 3553(a) factor, he has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that applies to his within-guidelines sentence for the illegal reentry of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>fense. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Albarran-Sanchez has also failed to show that the revocation sentence was substantively unreasonable. The 16-month sentence was within the advisory policy range of 12 to 18 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1, 7B1.4. The district court had the discretion to order that the sentences be served consecutively. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5G1.3(c) &amp; comment. (n.3(C)), 7B1.3(f) &amp; comment. (n.4) p.s.; <em>see also United States v. Cotroneo, </em>89 F.3d 510, 512 (8th Cir.1996). As the sentence both fell within the advisory range and was consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 advice regarding consecutive sentences, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 473 (5th Cir.2006). Al-barran-Sanchez has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion by imposing the consecutive sentence or to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 809 (5th Cir.2008). Further, the record supports the sentence in view of Albarran-Sanchez\u2019s criminal history and the facts that he was removed from the United States five times, that he used numerous different aliases and two different birth dates, and that he immediately returned to the United States after being deported in June 2012. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 929-31 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
