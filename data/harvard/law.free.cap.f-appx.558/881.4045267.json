Parker, Bradley Arant Boult Cummings, LLP, Montgomery, AL, for Defendants-Appellees.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b908-6\">Before TJOFLAT, WILSON and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b908-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">In this case, the Magistrate Judge, granting the defendants\u2019 motion for a more definite statement because it was virtually impossible for them to fashion a pleading in response to plaintiffs\u2019 65-page shotgun complaint asserting 13 claims, ordered plaintiffs to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs twice missed the judge\u2019s deadline for amendment, so the District Court, acting pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b), dismissed their complaint without prejudice. Plaintiffs now appeal that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">We review a Rule 41(b) dismissal for abuse of discretion. <em>Gratton v. Great Am. Commc\u2019ns, </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999). Rule 41(b) provides \u201c[f]or failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against the defendant.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). Despite the plain language of Rule 41(b) indicating that a defendant may move for dismissal, a district court may <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss a complaint under the authority of either (1) Rule 41(b), or (2) the court\u2019s inherent power to manage its docket. <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V Monada, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005). Dismissal with prejudice under Rule 41(b) is appropriate where there is: (1) a clear record of willful contempt; and (2) an implicit or explicit finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice. <em>Gratton, </em>178 F.3d at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">Here, plaintiffs twice failed to adhere to the imposed deadline to file an amended complaint. In the first instance, the Magistrate Judge granted an extension of the deadline based on plaintiffs\u2019 untimely motion to extend. The judge warned plaintiffs that their failure to file an amended complaint could result in dismissal. <em>See Moon, </em>863 F.2d at 837. Even if plaintiffs\u2019 claims would be time-barred, the District Court found that there was a clear record of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the Magistrate Judge\u2019s orders, and it implicitly found that the sanction was necessary in order to avoid rewarding the plaintiffs\u2019 noncompliance. <em>See Gratton, </em>178 F.3d at 1374</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
