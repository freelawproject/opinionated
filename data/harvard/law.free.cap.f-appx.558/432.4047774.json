Previously, this court denied counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and ordered the filing of a brief on the merits addressing whether the Government breached its plea agreement with Perez by opposing Perez\u2019s request for an acceptance-of-responsibility adjustment. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>No. 12-20389 (5th Cir. June 21, 2013) (unpublished; single judge order). In addition to the non-frivolous issue identified by this court, Perez has briefed the questions whether the district court erred in imposing the obstruction-of-justice enhancement and in refusing to reduce his offense level for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for procedural error and substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>619 F.3d 469, 471-72 (5th Cir.2010). Because Perez did not object that the Government had breached the plea agreement, we review that question for plain error. <em>See United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001). To show plain error, Perez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">The Government concedes that it violated the terms of the plea agreement by opposing Perez\u2019s request for an aecep-tance-of-responsibility adjustment. Because of the Government\u2019s concession that the plea agreement was breached, we have considered the sentencing issues raised by Perez, notwithstanding the appeal waiver in Perez\u2019s plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Keresztury, </em>293 F.3d 750, 756-57 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">The obstruction-of-justice enhancement was imposed because Perez plotted the murder of the case agent. The district court did not clearly err finding that Perez obstructed justice. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 208 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 &amp; comment (n.4(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-18\">Nor did the district court err in refusing to reduce Perez\u2019s offense level for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>acceptance of responsibility. A sentencing court may reduce a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). \u201cIf a defendant enters a guilty plea prior to trial, truthfully admits the conduct comprising the offense, and admits, or at least does not falsely deny, any additional relevant conduct for which he is accountable, the court may find significant evidence of the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 648 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a), comment, (n.3). However, pleading guilty does not entitle the defendant to a reduction as a matter of right, and evidence of the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility may be outweighed by conduct inconsistent with such a claim of responsibility. \u00a7 3El.l(a), comment, (n.3). Further, \u201c[c]onduct resulting in an enhancement [for obstruction of justice] under \u00a7 3C1.1 ... ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4). The defendant has the burden of proving entitlement to the reduction. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>120 F.3d 564, 574-75 (5th Cir.1997). We have no trouble determining that Perez has not met his burden here. Put simply, attempting to kill one\u2019s case agent is not the act of a defendant who was accepted responsibility for his criminal acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
