The district court denied the motion based on its conclusion that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize the court to reduce Jasmin\u2019s sentence. Upon review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">Jasmin\u2019s offenses and criminal history subjected his guideline range to computation pursuant to either the drug-quantity table at \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) or the career-offender guidelines at \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Because the career-offender guideline produced a higher offense level than the drug-quantity table, the career offender guideline applied. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Consequently, the district court sentenced Jasmin based on \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">Section 3582(c)(2) authorizes a court to reduce the term of imprisonment of a defendant who has been sentenced based on a sentencing range that the United States Sentencing Commission has subsequently lowered pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We have previously stated that the scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is \u201cquite narrow,\u201d as it only authorizes a sentence reduction if \u201c[t]he Sentencing Commission [has] amended the Sentencing Guidelines, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o), that guidelines amendment [has] lowered the defendant\u2019s sentencing range, and it [is also] one that is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c).\u201d <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012). Section 3582(c)(2) does not au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>thorize a reduction in the instant case because no amendment to the guidelines has had the effect of reducing Jasmin\u2019s sentencing range. It is true that Amendment 750 has lowered the guideline ranges associated with \u00a7 2D 1. 1(c), but the district court sentenced Jasmin as a career offender, and his guidelines range was therefore determined under \u00a7 4B1.1, not the drug quantities set forth at \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Moreover, it true that the Fair Sentencing Act lowered the statutory minimum penalties associated with Jasmin\u2019s offenses under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b), <em>see </em>Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. Ill\u2014 220 \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010), and that this modification had the effect of lowering Jasmin\u2019s guideline range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, \u201cthe FSA is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress, and thus it does not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.\u201d <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). For these reasons, Jasmin cannot show that he is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Jasmin argues that although the Sentencing Guidelines directed that he be sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, the district court\u2019s decision to sentence him below his career-offender guideline range resulted in what was \u201cfunctionally\u201d a sentence under \u00a7 2D1.1. In support of this argument, Jasmin cites opinions from several circuits concluding that, even if a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range was determined pursuant the career-offender provisions, when a court nevertheless sentences a defendant based on the drug guidelines, the defendant is eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on an amendment to the drug guidelines. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cardosa, </em>606 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2010) (\u201c[W]e conclude that where the defendant\u2019s existing sentence was ultimately <em>determined </em>by the old crack cocaine guidelines rather than by the career offender guideline, resentencing is within the discretion of the district court.\u201d); <em>United States v. Munn, </em>595 F.3d 183, 195 (4th Cir.2010) (\u201c[A] ... sentence reduction is not barred where the sentencing court, following an Overrepresentation Departure, based the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence on the Crack Guidelines.\u201d). In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2008), we discussed two then-recent district court decisions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reaching similar conclusions before determining that those decisions were distinguishable from the case then before us. We reach the same determination in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">The district court in the instant case departed downward from the career offender guidelines, but the record does not indicate that it based Jasmin\u2019s ultimate sentence on the drug guidelines, nor did the court grant an \u201coverrepresentation departure.\u201d To the contrary, although the district court discussed the possibility that the guidelines overrepresented Jasmin\u2019s criminal history the court also discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>other sentencing factors, such as the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities between Jasmin and his co-defendants, and it ultimately based Jasmin\u2019s sentence on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. The district court did not depart downward to a sentence that fell within the guideline range under the drug-quantity table that would have applied in the absence of the career-offender provisions. Instead, the district court rendered a sentence that was significantly below not only the career-offender guidelines but the drug-quantity guidelines as well.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cfi Munn, </em>595 F.3d at 197 (Duncan, J., dissenting) (noting that the resulting sentence after the district court\u2019s downward departure \u201cfit squarely within what otherwise would have been [the defendant\u2019s] applicable guideline range\u201d). The cases Jasmin cites are therefore distinguishable, and his argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-9\">. We review a district court's conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) <em>de novo. United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. This is so because the offense level for career offenders under \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) of the guidelines depends on the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for the underlying offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Because the FSA lowered the statutory maximum for Jasmin's offense from life imprisonment to 40 years, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii), his preliminary offense level under \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) would be reduced from 37 to 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b885-11\">. The decisions we discussed are <em>United States v. Ragland, </em>568 F.Supp.2d 19 (D.D.C.2008) and <em>United States v. Poindexter, </em>550 F.Supp.2d 578 (E.D.Pa.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b886-6\">. This fact provides an additional basis on which the district court was required to deny Jasmin\u2019s motion. The Sentencing Guidelines expressly state that a \u201ccourt shall not reduce the defendant's term of imprisonment under [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B). The only exception to this rule is if the initial sentence was below the guideline range \"pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance,\u201d which is not true in this case. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 IB 1.10(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-20\">In light of these provisions and the fact that Jasmin's current sentence is already below \"the minimum of the amended guideline range,\u201d the district court is not authorized to further reduce Jasmin\u2019s sentence. <em>See also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (authorizing a sentence reduction only \"if such a reduction is consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
