Soriano-Silva argues (1) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain any of his six convictions and (2) that the district court erred (a) in calculating the number of aliens attributable to him, (b) in overruling his objection to the lack of a minor role reduction, and (c) in allowing hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">We review preserved challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo. <em>United States v. Grant, </em>683 F.3d 639, 642 (5th Cir.2012). Regarding Counts One, Two, Three, Four, and Six, the record is replete with evidence demonstrating that Soriano-Silva had knowledge of and voluntarily participated in a conspiracy that involved bringing in, transporting, and harboring unauthorized aliens. <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>484 F.3d 762, 768 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Nolasco-Rosas, </em>286 F.3d 762, 765 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Maltos, </em>985 F.2d 743, 746 (5th Cir.1992). Accordingly, Soriano-Silva\u2019s sufficiency arguments are without merit as to Counts One, Two, Three, Four and Six. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Moreno, </em>420 F.3d 420, 437-38 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Casilla, </em>20 F.3d 600, 603 (5th Cir.1994). Regarding Count Five, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence demonstrates that Soriano-Silva participated in a conspiracy and knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that his conduct encouraged or induced illegal aliens to enter or remain in the country. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv); <em>United States v. Chon, </em>713 F.3d 812, 818 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, --</em>- U.S. ---, 134 S.Ct. 255, 187 L.Ed.2d 147 (2013); <em>Lopez-Moreno, </em>420 F.3d at 437-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">The district court\u2019s calculation of the number of illegal aliens attributable to a defendant is a finding of fact that we review for clear error. <em>See United States v. Elcanem, </em>555 F.3d 172, 175 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 168-69 (5th Cir.2002). Given the evidence presented at trial and the lack of direct evidence to rebut the reliability of the information contained in the presentence report, the district court did not clearly err in attributing 38 undocumented aliens to Soriano-Silva. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>558 F.3d 371, 376-77 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 247 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d at 168-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">Whether Soriano-Silva was a minor participant is a factual determination that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>review for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005). Soriano-Silva does not establish that he played a \u201csubstantially less culpable\u201d role than the \u201caverage participant\u201d in the illegal alien smuggling organization. <em>Id. </em>at 203-04. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s finding that Soriano-Silva was not deserving of a minor role adjustment is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">A district court\u2019s evidentiary decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion and are subject to a harmless error analysis. <em>United States v. Crawley, </em>533 F.3d 349, 353 (5th Cir.2008). The testimony of which SorianoSilva complains was not hearsay. <em>See United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 507 (5th Cir.2009); Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). Moreover, Soriano-Silva cannot demonstrate that any alleged error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Crawley, </em>533 F.3d at 353; <em>United States v. Cornett, </em>195 F.3d 776, 785 (5th Cir.1999). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b534-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
