He argues that the in absentia removal order was improper because an incomplete address was used to serve the notice and it was not his fault that the file contained an incomplete address.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">As the BIA determined, the notice to appear (NTA), which was personally served on Alaniz and which he signed, contains the address to which the hearing notice was mailed. The NTA advised Alaniz of his obligation to apprise the court of his full mailing address, and he was also advised of the consequences of his failure to appear at a hearing. The record is devoid of evidence that indicates that Alaniz attempted to notify the immigration court that the address on the NTA was incomplete or incorrect. Alaniz therefore did not comply with his obligation to keep his address current and his failure to do so precludes him from obtaining relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii) (providing for rescission of a removal order only when failure to appear was through no fault of the alien); <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 360-61 (5th Cir.2009) (affirming the BIA\u2019s denial of an appeal from an in absentia removal when the alien failed to comply with his obligation to provide current address information). The BIA\u2019s ruling therefore was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); <em>Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 358. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
