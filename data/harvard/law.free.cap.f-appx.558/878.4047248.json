After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b905-14\">Ponamgi, a female, was employed by Safeguard from June 2006 until May 2011 as an \u201cInsurance Specialist III,\u201d more commonly known as a data analyst. Safeguard\u2019s former program director, Barbara Atlas, explained that data analysts were paid varying salaries within established ranges based on their skills and experience. Atlas stated that Ponamgi\u2019s work performance was subpar, and her starting salary was justified based on the fact she had the least prior relevant experience of all employees hired as an Insurance Specialist III. Ponamgi\u2019s responsibilities were extremely limited and distinct from all other data analysts in her classification due to her limited skills and experience. These statements were all confirmed by Chris Anghelescu, one of Ponamgi\u2019s former supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">Atlas also explained Safeguard hired new employees at a more competitive salary after it received a substantial contract in 2009 (the Zone 7 contract), which created a pay disparity between old and new employees. The evidence confirmed that Safeguard discussed internally the need to attract and retain more qualified individuals and proposed increasing salaries to accomplish that goal. Old employees\u2019 salaries were not increased in line with the new compensation policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-16\">Of employees designated as an Insurance Specialist III, a female hired in December 2006 was the highest paid employee in 2009 and 2010. The ten next highest paid employees were hired in, or later than, October 2009. The lowest paid employee was a male hired in September 2000. The only male hired prior to October 2009 paid more than Ponamgi had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>salary of $50,000, as compared to Ponam-gi\u2019s salary of $47,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Ponamgi asserts the district court improperly evaluated Safeguard\u2019s motion for summary judgment through the burden-shifting regime of <em>McDonnell Douglas.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>She contends Safeguard\u2019s assertion that new employees\u2019 salaries were higher because of the Zone 7 contract is insufficient to support a grant of summary judgment. As to the experience argument, she argues Safeguard did not substantiate its claim the new employees had sufficient experience to justify the pay disparity. Conversely, the evidence shows Ponamgi has significant experience and qualifications to color her claim of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the EPA, a plaintiff must show that her employer paid employees of the opposite sex more for equal work on jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and that are performed under similar working conditions. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1). Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the employer may avoid liability by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the pay differences are based on any factor other than sex. <em>Steger v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>318 F.3d 1066, 1078 (11th Cir.2003). The burden to prove this affirmative defense is heavy and it must be demonstrated that gender provided no basis for the difference in wages. <em>Id. </em>An employer may consider factors that constitute unique characteristics of the same job such as: (1) an individual\u2019s experience, training, or ability; or (2) special exigent circumstances connected with the business. <em>Id. </em>Evidence of an employer\u2019s routine practices is relevant to prove that its conduct at a particular time conformed to its routine practices. <em>Id. </em>If the employer meets its burden, the employee must rebut the explanation by showing with affirmative evidence that the employer\u2019s offered explanation is pretextual or offered as a post-event justification for a gender-based difference. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Safeguard. Even if Ponamgi could establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination under the EPA, the evidence shows the salary disparity was based upon factors other than gender. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1). First, Ponamgi possessed limited technical skills, could not perform the same work as her coworkers, and had the least prior experience in data analysis at her position. Second, all of the male employees that were paid more than Ponamgi were hired after the award of the Zone 7 contract and corresponding increase in starting salary, or had the same salary that Ponamgi started with and would have been receiving were it not for her poor performance review in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Ponamgi has not produced affirmative evidence to contradict Safeguard\u2019s defense and prove that her lower salary was based on her gender. <em>See Steger, </em>318 F.3d at 1078. Although Ponamgi argues that the district court improperly evaluated Safeguard\u2019s motion for summary judgment through <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the court did not rely upon <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>in evaluating her claim and the record does not support her assertion. Although she asserts her experience and qualifications warranted higher pay, this argument does not contradict Safeguard\u2019s assertions the pay disparity was based upon her coworkers\u2019 superior experience and skill, and market exigencies. Accordingly, we affirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-10\">.
