He does not brief any challenge to the determination that he was ineligible for voluntary departure. Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to that ruling. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">Rivas argues that, contrary to the BIA\u2019s decision, his prior conviction under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 38.02 is not a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT) as set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2) and thus does not bar his eligibility for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). Additionally, he contends that, to prevail before the BIA, he should not have been required to cite a published or unpublished case to show that \u00a7 38.02(b) had been applied previously to conduct not involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-22\">We have jurisdiction to review questions of law, including whether an offense is a CIMT. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 284, 287-88 (5th Cir.2007). This court and the BIA employ separate analytical paths to determine whether an alien\u2019s prior offense constitutes a CIMT. <em>See Nino v. Holder, </em>690 F.3d 691, 694-95 (5th Cir.2012) (comparing this court\u2019s categorical analysis and the BIA\u2019s analysis, which is derived from <em>Matter of Silva-Trevino, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 687, 696-99 (A.G.2008)); <em>see also Silva-Trevino v. Holder, </em>742 F.3d 197, 198, 205 (5th Cir.2014) (holding that the last prong of the analysis set forth in <em>Silva-Trevino, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 699, which is not at issue herein and permits the adjudicator to look beyond the alien\u2019s record of conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>in reviewing a prior offense, was impermissible under this court\u2019s precedent). Using either analytical path, Rivas\u2019s prior offense is a CIMT.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">An alien is eligible for cancellation of removal if, among other requirements, the alien has not been convicted of an offense under \u00a7 1227(a)(2), which relevantly includes any alien who is convicted of a CIMT. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C); \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i). Texas Penal Code \u00a7 38.02 does not categorically describe offenses involving moral turpitude. <em>See Nino, </em>690 F.3d at 694-95. For example, a person violates \u00a7 38.02(a) by intentionally refusing to give his name, residential address, or birth date to a peace officer who has arrested the person and asked for the information. Such an offense does not involve dishonesty or lying, <em>see Omagah v. Ashcroft, </em>288 F.3d 254, 260 (5th Cir.2002), or \u201cshock[ ] the public conscience as being inherently base, vile, or depraved, and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general.\u201d <em>See Nino, </em>690 F.3d at 694 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, even if, as described in <em>Silva-Trevino, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 697-98, Rivas had produced a case showing \u00a7 38.02\u2019s application to conduct not involving moral turpitude, the BIA could not have categorically treated all convictions under \u00a7 38.02 as CIMTs. <em>See Nino, </em>690 F.3d at 694-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Because \u00a7 38.02 does not categorically describe CIMTs, a modified categorical approach is used to determine whether Rivas was convicted under a part of \u00a7 38.02 that describes a CIMT. <em>See id. </em>The record reflects that Rivas was convicted of the offense described in \u00a7 38.02(b). A person violates \u00a7 38.02(b) by intentionally giving a false or fictitious name, residential address, or birth date to someone known to be a peace officer, who has lawfully arrested or detained the person or who has requested the information from a person believed to have witnessed a crime. <em>See </em>\u00a7 38.02(b); <em>Green v. State, </em>951 S.W.2d 3, 4 (Tex.Crim.App.1997). This offense involves dishonesty or lying and the government, to obtain a conviction, must prove that \u201cthe defendant acted ... intentionally [to] deceive! ] someone.\u201d <em>See Omagah, </em>288 F.3d at 260. Therefore, the offense is a CIMT for immigration purposes. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the BIA did not err in finding that Rivas\u2019s prior conviction precluded him from seeking cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Rivas\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
