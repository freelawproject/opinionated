Price argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to strike a prospective juror whose responses during voir dire suggested that she thought a defendant should testify at trial. We issued a certificate of appeala-bility to resolve \u201c[wjhether the district court erred in finding that Price\u2019s consent to the jury panel precluded him from establishing that counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge juror Magda Brau for cause.\u201d Because it was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law for the Florida courts to conclude that Price could not argue that counsel had been ineffective for failing to strike a juror that Price had approved, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">During voir dire, defense counsel asked the jury panel if they \u201cwould expect Mr. Price or any defendant to sit on that witness stand and testify.\u201d Juror Brau\u2019s responses arguably suggested that she thought a defendant should testify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">Mr. Friedman: ... Do you understand [the defendant] has no burden whatsoever placed upon him and that is the way the law is created. The defendant doesn\u2019t have to defend himself or he doesn\u2019t have to do anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">Prospective Juror Brau: Doesn\u2019t he want to help himself because he already hired you? Doesn\u2019t he want to help himself as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-7\">Mr. Friedman: Perhaps the evidence states that the case against Mr. Price is so week (sic) that he doesn\u2019t have to get in the witness stand. That is a possibility. Perhaps he is the type of individual who doesn\u2019t speak well in front of others and he gets so nervous and fluster[ed] that he wouldn\u2019t present himself as a good witness. There could be multiple scenarios of why a person choses (sic) not to testify for himself. You understand the way our legal system [was] created, the fifth amendment doesn\u2019t allow you to incriminate against yourself. They have to proffer everything. Ms. Brau?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-9\">Prospective Juror Brau: As far as I am concerned, he is here. Why is he here? Wouldn\u2019t he have to go up there to say why he is here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-10\">Mr. Friedman: Are you saying there are absolutely no scenarios where a person who does not testify on his own behalf end up being found [not] guilty. That is possible isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-11\">Prospective Juror Brau: I am sure it is. I haven\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know. It feels like he should defend himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-12\">Mr. Friedman: I appreciate your honesty-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">Defense counsel and the State accepted Juror Brau for the petit jury. Before the jurors returned to the courtroom, the district court asked Price if he was satisfied with the jurors seated by his attorney, and he responded affirmatively.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-14\">The Court: Mr. Price, you have been sitting here throughout this process. Do you agree with the jurors that have been selected by your lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-15\">The Witness [Price]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">The jury convicted Price of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 775.087, 784.045(l)(a)(2). The verdict form stated that Juror Brau served as the foreperson of the jury. The Florida court sentenced Price to 15 years of imprisonment. Later, the state appellate court affirmed Price\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>Price v. State, </em>932 So.2d 1244 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-17\">Price filed a motion for postconviction relief, <em>see </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850, which a Florida court denied. Relevant to this appeal, Price argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to remove Brau from the jury panel. Price argued that Brau was biased because she thought he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>needed to prove his innocence and that he was prejudiced because Brau served as the foreperson of the jury. The Florida court ruled that Price could not acquiesce in counsel\u2019s decision to select Brau as a juror and later relitigate that decision in a collateral proceeding under the guise of ineffective assistance of counsel. The state appellate court affirmed summarily. <em>Price v. State, </em>986 So.2d 615 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Price filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus and raised the same claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court accepted the recommendation of a magistrate judge and denied Price\u2019s petition. The district court ruled that \u201cPrice produced no evidence proving trial counsel\u2019s deficiency\u201d when \u201cPrice consented to the selection of the jury, including Brau\u201d and the \u201cdenial of [Price\u2019s] claim [was] not contrary to or an unreasonable application of Strickland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Price must \u201c[s]urmount[ ] [a particularly] high bar\u201d to obtain a writ of habeas corpus on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 371, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 1485, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010). Under the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, a petitioner is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus if the state court reached a decision that was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). A state court makes an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law only when the court \u201c \u2018identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the] decisions [of the Supreme Court] but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts\u2019 of petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 520, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 2534-35, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (quoting <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362. 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)). \u201cIf [the] Court has not broken sufficient legal ground to establish an asked-for constitutional principle, the lower federal courts cannot themselves establish such a principle with clarity sufficient to satisfy the AEDPA bar.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 381, 120 S.Ct. at 1506-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">The district court correctly denied Price\u2019s petition. The state courts ruled that Price could not prove that his counsel had been deficient for failing to remove a juror whom Brau had agreed should be impaneled. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (\u201cThe reasonableness of counsel\u2019s actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant\u2019s own statements or actions.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (\u201c[Wjaiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Price cites no precedent of the Supreme Court establishing that \u201cthe state court\u2019s ruling ... was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. ---, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). The decision by the state court that trial counsel was not ineffective is not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">We AFFIRM the denial of Price\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
