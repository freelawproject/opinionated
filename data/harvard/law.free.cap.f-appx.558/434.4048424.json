The BIA relied on the IJ\u2019s decision; therefore, both the IJ\u2019s decision and the order of the BIA are reviewed. <em>E.g., Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). Because Sanchez does not challenge the BIA\u2019s holding that his asylum application is time barred, he has abandoned the issue. <em>E.g., Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830,. 833 (5th Cir.2003). He has also abandoned any claim he is entitled to withholding of removal or CAT relief based on any ground other than his homosexuality. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal if he can establish it is more likely than not that, if he is returned to his country of origin, his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 596 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (restriction on removal to a country where alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened)). Additionally, an alien is entitled to protection under the CAT if he proves it is more likely than not that, if deported, he will suffer torture by or with the consent or acquiescence of the government. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (eligibility for withholding of removal under the CAT); <em>see also Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir.2005). This court reviews, for substantial evidence, decisions to deny both withholding of removal and CAT relief, and it will not reverse unless the record compels it. <em>Id. </em>at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-16\">As Sanchez\u2019 contentions consist of a series of conclusory assertions, unsupported by citations to the record, regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ing alleged persecution and torture of homosexuals by Guatemalan authorities, he fails to show the record compels reversal. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 345. Although he maintains the scarcity of factual support for his claims is justifiable because the alleged persecution and torture of homosexuals in Guatemala is underreported, Sanchez bears the burden of presenting evidence showing he was entitled to withholding of removal and CAT relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1281(b)(3)(C) (sustaining burden of proof); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (same); <em>e.g., Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
