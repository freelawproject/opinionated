The relevant portion of the complaint was that Colonel Jimmy Smith used excessive force by sadistically and maliciously spraying Tyler with mace while he was locked in his cell because Tyler had written a letter complaining about prison personnel. Smith moved for summary judgment, asserting qualified immunity among other things. The district court denied the motion finding that Tyler\u2019s verified complaint and summary-judgment affidavits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>established a genuine issue of material fact \u201cregarding whether [Tyler] sustained an injury, the need for the application of force, the relationship between the need and use of force, the threat perceived by [Smith] and efforts made to temper the severity of the response.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Smith appeals the denial of his summary judgment motion based on qualified immunity. The denial of summary judgment based upon qualified immunity is a collateral order that may be an appealable final decision. <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). However, the court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the denial is \u201csignificantly limited,\u201d extending to questions of law only. <em>Kinney v. Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 346 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">When prison officials stand accused of using excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment, \u201cthe core judicial inquiry is ... whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). Smith concedes that he released mace into Tyler\u2019s cell, but he argues that there is no evidence other than Tyler\u2019s allegations that he acted with a culpable state of mind. This argument is directed to the truth of the verified allegations made by Tyler that Smith acted without provocation and with malicious intent. <em>See Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 346. Accordingly, the court does not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s conclusion that there was a genuine factual dispute whether Smith used excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Tyler\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal or, alternatively, stay the proceedings because Smith did not comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10 is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b524-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
