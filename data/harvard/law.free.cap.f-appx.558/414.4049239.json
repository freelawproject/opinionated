Jefferson contends: the evidence was insufficient for a disciplinary board to find against him; the disciplinary reports were falsified and without factual support; and the investigation was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">The district court found Jefferson\u2019s complaint was frivolous because it was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (holding \u00a7 1983 claimant may not recover damages for unconstitutional conviction where conviction has not been, <em>inter alia, </em>reversed, expunged, or called into question by issuance of a writ of habeas corpus), and <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 646-47, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997) (extending <em>Heck </em>to prison disciplinary proceedings). In his appellate brief, however, Jefferson does not address the legal basis for the district court\u2019s decision. When appellant fails to identify error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is as if appellant had not appealed that issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dall. Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Jefferson\u2019s claims regarding his prison disciplinary conviction, therefore, are deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); see <em>also Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-20\">In addition, because Jefferson\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, it is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-21\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jefferson\u2019s complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See, e.g., Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Jefferson is cautioned that, if he accumulates three such strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility, unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
