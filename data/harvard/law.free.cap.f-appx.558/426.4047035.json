Martinez was held accountable at sentencing for distribution of ten to 30 kilograms of heroin, and had an advisory Guideline-sentencing range of 360 months to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Martinez maintains the court clearly erred in its drug-quantity calculation. Specifically, he contends, as he did before the district court, that the evidence shows he distributed only 593.6 grams of heroin, rather than the ten to 30 kilograms attributed to the other lead conspirators. Based on the 593.6-gram calculation, Martinez contends his total offense level should be 30, instead of 36, resulting in an advisory range of 155 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">Under the sentencing regime in place after <em>United States v. </em>Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a \u201csentencing judge is entitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a Guideline sentencing range and all facts relevant to the determination of a non-Guidelines sentence\u201d. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 798 (5th Cir.2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The district court may rely on any relevant evidence which has sufficient indicia of reliability. <em>United States v. Ford, </em>558 F.3d 371, 377 (5th Cir.2009). A district court\u2019s findings of fact for sentencing purposes, including a district court\u2019s drug-quantity determination, are reviewed only for clear error. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">At sentencing, the court found \u201cfrom [the] overwhelming preponderance of the evidence\u201d that the amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy was more than ten kilograms of heroin. In that regard, Martinez is responsible for \u201call foreseeable acts\u201d in furtherance of the drug conspiracy. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) (reasonably foreseeable acts of coconspirators are factors that determine Guideline range). But, Martinez does not challenge the district court\u2019s \u201cforeseeability\u201d determination; therefore, he has failed to show the court clearly erred in holding him accountable for ten to 30 kilograms of heroin under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 447, 461-62 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cDistribution and possession with intent to distribute offenses are reasonably foreseeable acts in furtherance of a conspiracy to distribute drugs.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
