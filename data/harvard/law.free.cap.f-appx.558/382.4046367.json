In claiming his sentence is unreasonable, he challenges only the district court\u2019s assessment of a two-point sentencing enhancement for possession of a weapon (an AK-47 assault rifle). See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Castro contends: no physical evidence linked him to the firearm found; he cannot be held responsible for a weapon about which he had no knowledge; the stash house at which the firearm was discovered (Hargill house) was not in his control; the Hargill house was outside the scope of his involvement in the conspiracy; and, therefore, the firearm found there was not reasonably foreseeable to him. He also contends the district court erroneously placed the burden on him to show the weapon was not foreseeable, rather than on the Government to prove foreseeability.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) provides a two-level enhancement of defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 instructs: \u201cThe enhancement should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 11(A). This enhancement applies where defendant personally possessed the weapon or where a co-conspirator possessed the weapon during the conspiracy and that possession was reasonably foreseeable to defendant. <em>See United States v. Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, as in this instance, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). Whether possession of firearms by co-conspirators is reasonably foreseeable is a factual finding. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 423 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-18\">The Government must prove the applicability of the enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Aguilera-Zapata, </em>901 F.2d 1209, 1215 (5th Cir.1990). \u201cIf the Government meets that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>390, 396 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u201c[F]irearms are \u2018tools of the trade of those engaged in illegal drug activities\u2019 \u201d. <em>Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d at 390 (quoting <em>Aguilera-Zapata, </em>901 F.2d at 1215). As such, courts may infer defendant should have foreseen a coconspirator\u2019s firearm possession. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, a large \u201camount of drugs ... and their [high] street value increase the likelihood \u2014 and thus foreseeability \u2014 that those involved in the conspiracy will have dangerous weapons\u201d. Cis<em>neros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Castro fails to demonstrate the district court clearly erred in finding the enhancement applied. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 764-65. For starters, Castro played a significant role in an extensive drug conspiracy. The drugs originating in Mexico were moved initially to the Hargill house, where they were bundled for distribution, and then moved to the nearby FM 2812 house, controlled by Castro, where the drugs were concealed in cover loads of produce at the direction of Castro and others. The extensiveness of the conspiracy, the large volume (and necessarily high street value) of the drugs involved, as well as the connection between the Hargill and FM 2812 houses, establishes the requisite foreseeability. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 11(A); \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B); <em>see also Cisne-ros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 765-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Moreover, Castro has not demonstrated it was \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the AK-47 assault rifle found at the Hargill house was involved in the conspiracy. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 11(A). His claim that any offense committed at the Hargill house was outside the scope of his involvement is not supported by evidence. <em>See, e.g., Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d at 396. (The Supreme Court\u2019s just-rendered decision in <em>Rosemond v. United States </em>concerned conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 for aiding and abetting a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and is not applicable to this appeal from the sentencing for a guilty-plea conspiracy conviction. No. 12-895, 572 U.S. ---, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248, slip op. at *1-2, *11 n. 7, *16 n. 10, 2014 WL 839184 (2014) (stating \u201cholding is grounded in the distinctive intent standard for aiding and abetting\u201d and expressing no view on whether \u201ca \u00a7 924(c) violation is a natural and probable consequence of simple drug trafficking\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
