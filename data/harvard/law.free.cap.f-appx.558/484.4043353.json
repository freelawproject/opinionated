In 2004, Rocha was convicted of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 22.04(a)(3) of the Texas Penal Code Annotated, and he was sentenced to a two-year term of imprisonment. Subsequently, Rocha was charged with remov-ability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, which was a crime of violence (\u201cCOV\u201d) as defined at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). He was also charged with removability under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)\u00ae as an alien who had been convicted of a crime of child abuse. Rocha conceded the fact of his prior conviction and the fact he had received a two-year sentence. Thus, the only pertinent questions for the immigration judge (IJ) to determine were whether Rocha\u2019s prior conviction was a COV for purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) or a crime of child abuse for purposes of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)\u00ae. The IJ sustained both charges of removability, and the BIA affirmed that decision, dismissing Rocha\u2019s appeal without a written order. Rocha filed a motion for reconsideration that was denied by the BIA. He has filed two separate petitions seeking review of the BIA\u2019s orders dismissing his appeal and denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-19\">We first consider Rocha\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s order dismissing his appeal from the Id\u2019s order finding him removable as charged. Because Rocha was found to be removable due to his commission of an aggravated felony as defined at \u00a7 1101(a)(43), our jurisdiction to review the order of removal is limited to legal or constitutional questions. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-20\">The first issue Rocha presents, whether his prior conviction constituted a COV and, thus, an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), is a legal one. <em>See Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 532, 538 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Cir.2008). Rocha\u2019s conviction for injury to a child under \u00a7 22.04(a)(3) stemmed from Rocha\u2019s act of grabbing a child with his hand. We have previously addressed whether a conviction under \u00a7 22.04(a)(3) is a COV, and we held that when the offense was committed by an intentional act rather than by omission, the alien\u2019s conviction is for an aggravated felony for purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). <em>See Perez-Munoz v. Keisler, </em>507 F.3d 357, 360-64 (5th Cir.2007). Conceding that his crime involved an intentional act, Rocha nevertheless argues that it was not a COV because \u201cthere is no \u2018strong probability\u2019 that physical force (destructive or violent) will be used when grabbing a child with one\u2019s hand.\u201d We made clear in Perez-Munoz, however, that the details of the intentional act committed in a given case are irrelevant because the commission of the crime by an intentional act will ordinarily involve the use or risk of use of physical force by the perpetrator. <em>Id. </em>at 364. An offense under \u00a7 22.04(a)(3) committed by an intentional act, then, is by its nature a COV. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the BIA correctly found that Rocha had been convicted of an aggravated felony and was removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). <em>Id. </em>at 360-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Rocha also asserts that the BIA erred in dismissing his appeal from the finding of removability under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) because his conviction did not qualify as a crime of child abuse for purposes of that statute. As the decision that Rocha was removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2) (A) (iii) would not be altered even if we were to rule favorably on his challenge to the determination that he was convicted of a crime of child abuse for purposes of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)\u00ae, we need not address the legal issue raised by Rocha or the exhaustion issue raised by the respondent with respect to this point of error. <em>See Capital Concepts Properties 85-1 v. Mutual First, Inc., </em>35 F.3d 170, 176 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, Rocha\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order dismissing his appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">We turn next to Rocha\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. We have jurisdiction to consider the denial of a motion to reconsider, but our review involves a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Nolos v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 279, 281 (5th Cir.2010); <em>accord Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303-04 (5th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s ruling will stand, even if we conclude it is erroneous, \u201cso long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 304 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Rocha\u2019s attorney-drafted brief contains no discussion of the legal standards applicable to motions for reconsideration. Nor does it address the specific reasons stated by the BIA for denying Rocha\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We thus deem Rocha\u2019s challenge to the denial of that motion to be inadequately briefed and consequently abandoned. <em>See Rui Yang v. Holder, </em>664 F.3d 580, 589 (5th Cir.2011). Accordingly, Rocha\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b510-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
