His appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) was dismissed after his attorney failed to file an appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Mata subsequently filed an untimely motion to reopen his removal proceedings, based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and asking the BIA to equitably toll the applicable filing period or exercise its authority to reopen his proceedings <em>sua sponte. </em>The BIA denied Mata\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Mata then filed a motion to reconsider. The BIA denied it as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">Mata seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motions to reopen and to reconsider. He acknowledges his motion to reopen was filed outside the 90-day filing period, after the BIA dismissed his original appeal. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (reopening or reconsideration before the BIA). He asserts, however, the BIA should have equitably tolled the filing period because his attorney\u2019s failure to file a brief to the BIA deprived him of his right to appeal and violated his due-process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">In this circuit, an alien\u2019s request for equitable tolling on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is construed as an invitation for the BIA to exercise its discretion to reopen the removal proceeding <em>sua sponte. Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>548 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir.2008). As the BIA has complete discretion in determining whether to reopen <em>sua sponte </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), and we have no meaningful standard against which to judge that exercise of discretion, we lack jurisdiction to review such decisions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">Although Mata challenges our court\u2019s decision in <em>Ramos-Bonilla </em>as decided incorrectly, we may not overturn the prior decision of another panel of our court, absent an intervening change in the law, such as a statutory amendment, or a contrary or superseding decision by either the Supreme Court or this court <em>en banc. E.g., Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir.2008). Along that line, Mata asserts the Supreme Court, in <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em>overturned this court\u2019s decision in <em>Ramos-Bonilla. </em>Mata overstates the reach of <em>Kucana; </em>there, the Supreme Court \u201cexpressed] no opinion on whether federal courts may review the [BIA]\u2019s decision not to reopen removal proceedings <em>sua sponte\u201d. </em>558 U.S. 233, 251 n. 18, 130 S.Ct. 827, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010). Because we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Mata\u2019s untimely motion to reopen, we need not address the merits of Mata\u2019s equitable-tolling, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel, and due-process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">Additionally, Mata appears to seek review of the BIA\u2019s denying his motion to reconsider its denial of his motion to reopen. He fails, however, to provide adequate briefing addressing the BIA\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>sion on the motion to reconsider, and, as such, has abandoned any challenge he might have raised regarding that decision. <em>See, e.g., Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
