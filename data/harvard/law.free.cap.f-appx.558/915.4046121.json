He contends that that district court erred by declining to retroactively apply Amendment 750 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines and the reduced statutory penalties of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d) to reduce his sentence. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Allen\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>i.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">In February 2005, the government charged Allen with distributing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (Count One), and distributing in excess of five grams of cocaine base, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(iii) (Count Two). After a two-day trial, a jury found Allen guilty of both charges. At the July 20, 2005, sentencing hearing, the district court held Allen responsible for 26.1 grams of cocaine base and initially calculated an offense level of 28 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Allen, however, was a career offender, which, per the 2004 career offender table, produced a total offense level of 34 in light of the 40-year statutory maximum penalty to which he was subject. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(2004). When combined with Allen\u2019s criminal history category of VI, this produced a Guideline sentence range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court ultimately imposed a sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment for Count One and 262 months\u2019 imprisonment for Count Two to run concurrently, for a total imprisonment term of 262 months. Allen moved the district court twice to reduce his sentence, but the district court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">On appeal, Allen argues that he is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) notwithstanding his status as a career offender, because his sentence range was \u201cbased upon\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1, which includes offense levels for crack-cocaine drug quantities that were lowered by Amendment 750. Allen also argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction under the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory mandatory minimum penalties for crack-cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). Section 3582(c)(2) of Title 18 of the United States Code provides that a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). When determining whether a reduction is warranted, a court should first determine the Guideline sentence range that would have applied had the relevant amendment been in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s sentencing. <em>See United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759-60 (11th Cir.1998); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). If the relevant amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable Guideline sentencing range, a sentence reduction is inconsistent with the Guideline\u2019s policy statement, and is, therefore, not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>we held that a career offender is not entitled to a reduction of his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where a retroactive Guideline amendment reduces his base offense level but does not alter the Guideline sentence range upon which his sentence was based. 541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">Allen, like the defendants in <em>Moore, </em>was sentenced as a career offender. His Guideline sentence range was therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>based upon and determined by \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1. Although the Sentencing Commission lowered the offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) for crack-cocaine drug quantities, it did not lower the sentence range for career offenders under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which is what set Allen\u2019s Guideline sentence range. Application of Amendment 750 would therefore not lower his applicable Guideline sentence range.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Allen, however, argues that his sentence was based upon \u00a7 2D1.1 and thus he is eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. ---, 181 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), overruled our <em>Moore </em>decision and supports his contention. Unfortunately for Allen, we have already rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1817, 1319 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">In <em>Lawson, </em>the defendant, like Allen, appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that notwithstanding being sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman, </em>he was entitled to a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 750 because his sentence was based on \u00a7 2D1.1. In <em>Freeman, </em>the question before the Supreme Court was whether defendants who entered into Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements were eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at ---, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. \u201cNeither the plurality opinion nor Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman </em>addressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one [G]uideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and [Guideline sentence range under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. We therefore concluded that <em>Freeman </em>was not \u201cclearly on point\u201d to the issue that arose in <em>Moore </em>and thus did not overrule Moore\u2019s holding that a career offender was not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where his Guideline sentence range was not lowered by a retroactive amendment. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 for the proposition that to overrule a prior opinion of the court, the Supreme Court decision \u201cmust be clearly on point\u201d). Accordingly, we held that Lawson, a career offender, was not entitled to relief based on Amendment 750 and \u00a7 3582(c)(2), as his Guideline sentence range, which was based on \u00a7 4B1.1, was not reduced by Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Based on our decision in <em>Moore </em>and <em>Lawson, </em>Allen is not entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 because Amendment 750 only addressed his base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1, without doing anything to lower his Guideline sentence range as determined by \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">Allen also argues that he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction from his minimum penalty of 40-years imprisonment to a minimum penalty of 20-years imprisonment, based on the FSA, which became effective on August 3, 2010. The FSA lowered the statutory mandatory minimum penalties for crack cocaine offenses in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). <em>See </em>Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220 \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). According to Allen, Congress intended the FSA to apply to all sentencing and sentencing-reduction proceedings after the FSA\u2019s effective date and that the Supreme Court\u2019s justifications in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. ----, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012) counsel that the FSA should apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">We addressed the FSA\u2019s applicability in the context of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings in <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374 (11th Cir.2012). Berry was convicted of a crack cocaine offense and sentenced in 2002, and his initial Guideline range was 360 months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>to life imprisonment, which was based on his status as a career offender under \u00a7 4B 1.1(b), not on the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>Id. </em>at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">In resolving Berry\u2019s appeal, we noted that the FSA is not a Guideline amendment but a statutory change by Congress, thus it could not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Berry\u2019s case. Moreover, even assuming that Berry could bring his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we concluded that his claim still failed because he was convicted and sentenced in 2002 and the FSA did not apply retroactively to his 2002 sentence. <em>Id. </em>We pointed out that there was no evidence that Congress intended the FSA to apply to defendants who had been sentenced before the August 3, 2010 date of the FSA\u2019s enactment. <em>Id. </em>We also noted that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums should apply to defendants, like Berry, who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>Id. </em>at 378 <em>(\u201cDorsey </em>carefully confined its application of FSA to pre-Act offenders who were sentenced after the Act\u2019s effective date\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013) (reaffirming the conclusion in <em>Berry </em>that <em>Dorsey </em>did not indicate that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums should apply to defendants sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\"><em>Berry </em>supports the conclusion that the district court did not have the authority to grant Allen\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The FSA is not an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission and, thus it cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Allen\u2019s case. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. And even assuming that Allen could raise his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his claim fails because he was sentenced in 2005, before the August 3, 2010, effective date of the FSA, therefore he cannot benefit from the FSA\u2019s lower statutory mandatory minimum provisions. <em>See Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 542. Contrary to Allen\u2019s assertion on appeal, Dorsey did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new statutory penalties should apply to defendants who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377-78; <em>Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">In sum, the district court was not authorized to reduce Allen\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was sentenced as a career offender. Likewise, the FSA does not authorize a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and, in any case, it does not retroactively apply to defendants who, like Allen, were sentenced prior to its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">Accordingly, after a careful and thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-6\">. The defendants in <em>Moore </em>were eligible to have their base offense levels lowered by the retroactively applied Amendment 706, but because they were sentenced as career offenders under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, their Guideline sentence range would remain unaffected, thus they were ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
