Roque, Jr., appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint against AT &amp; T Inc., AT &amp; T Teleconference Services, and AT &amp; T employees Judy Newsone, Stephen Sitton, Randall L. Stephenson, Freya Chatelain, and Nathan Pierce (collectively, Defendants-Appellees) for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-23\">The dispute in this case arises out of Roque\u2019s inability to connect to a conference call hearing with the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services (LDCFS) using AT &amp; T\u2019s teleconference service, which resulted in the dismissal of his case before LDCFS. A generous reading of Roque\u2019s pro se complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is that he made multiple attempts to call in to the conference, was unable to do so due to neglect or other conduct attributable to AT &amp; T, and that this caused him a loss of program benefits, emotional distress, and physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-24\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We \u201caccept as true all well-plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ed facts.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, in order to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the complaint \u201cmust provide the plaintiffs grounds for entitlement to relief \u2014 including factual allegations that when assumed to be true raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Roque brought his claim against the defendants in federal district court pursuant to federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, alleging violations of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 225 and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 225 seeks to ensure the availability of telecommunications services for hearing-impaired and speech-impaired individuals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Civil Rights Act of 1991 is an amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed to create additional remedies for discrimination and harassment in the workplace and to generally improve the scope and effectiveness of federal civil rights protections.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">As the district court noted in granting the defendants\u2019 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, Roque\u2019s complaint \u201ccontains no facts showing that defendants violated either [47 U.S.C. \u00a7 225] or the Civil Rights Act [of 1991].\u201d Roque does not allege that AT &amp; T\u2019s telecommunications service was unavailable to him because of a hearing or speech impairment, or that he even has such an impairment. Nor does he claim that he had an employment relationship with AT &amp; T that might form the basis of an employment discrimination or harassment claim, or that his federal civil rights generally were violated by the defendants in any way. Because Roque has not alleged facts that, if proven true, could establish violations of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 225 or the Civil Rights Acts of 1991 and entitle Roque to relief, he has failed to state a claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court did not err in granting the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
