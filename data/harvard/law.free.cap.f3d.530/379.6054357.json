GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b406-17\">We hereby withdraw the previous panel opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we substitute the following in its place:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-18\">Plaintiff-Appellant (the \u201cGovernment\u201d) appeals the District Court decision sentencing Defendant-Appellee Richard Rowan, II (\u201cRowan\u201d) to a sixty-month period of probation following his conviction for possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-19\">Rowan pleaded guilty to the illegal possession of child pornography. During sentencing, the District Court properly calculated his Guidelines range as 46-57 months of imprisonment. Rather than sentencing Rowan to a term of imprisonment within this range, or even to a modest period of incarceration, the District Court sentenced him to a sixty-month period of probation. The Government timely appealed. We vacated and remanded for resentencing under <em>United States v. Duhon, </em>440 F.3d 711 (5th Cir.2006) (vacating sentence of probation for possession of child pornography), <em>cert granted, judgment vacated by </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 853, 169 L.Ed.2d 705 (2008). Rowan petitioned for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Following our decisions in <em>Duhon </em>and <em>Rowan, </em>the Supreme Court issued <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (clarifying appellate review of District Court sentencing decisions). The Supreme Court granted Rowan\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our previous decision in <em>Rowan, </em>and remanded the case for consideration under <em>Gall. </em>We now revisit this case in light of <em>Gall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We review District Court sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Our review is bifurcated. <em>Id. </em>at 597-98; <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 524-25 (5th Cir.2008). First, we must determine whether the District Court committed any significant procedural error. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 525. The District Court commits a procedural error if: it miscalculates or fails to calculate the proper Guidelines range; it treats the Guidelines as mandatory; it imposes a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts; it fails to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); or it fails adequately to explain its chosen sentence or any deviation from the Guidelines range. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 525. Second, if the District Court has committed no significant procedural error, we review the sentence for substantive reasonableness. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Sentences fall into three categories: (1) those within a properly calculated Guidelines range, (2) those outside a properly calculated Guidelines range that are based on an allowed upward or downward departure, and (3) those outside a properly calculated Guidelines range that are not based on an allowed departure. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>478 F.3d 266, 273 (5th Cir.2007). Rowan\u2019s sentence is outside the applicable Guidelines range and was not based on an allowed departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5B1.1. Therefore, Rowan\u2019s sentence is a non-Guidelines sentence. <em>See </em>id.; <em>Davis, </em>478 F.3d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">When the District Court imposes a non-Guideline sentence, we \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Even if we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate, [this] is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">We find no significant procedural error in the District Court\u2019s sentencing decision: the District Court properly calculated the Guideline range, heard arguments concerning appropriate sentences, and meticulously considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Based on the foregoing, the District Court concluded that a non-Guidelines sentence of a sixty-month period of probation was appropriate. In light of the deferential standard set forth in <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597-98, we</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\">. <em>United States v. Rowan, </em>No. 05-30536, 2008 WL 2266995, (5th Cir. June 4, 2008)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
