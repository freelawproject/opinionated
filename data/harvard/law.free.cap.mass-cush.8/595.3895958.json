The watercourse crosses the highway running from the north of it opposite the plaintiff\u2019s land, and runs on the south side thereof, between the wall of such land and the travelled part of the highway, several rods, and then, turning to the south, runs between the plaintiff\u2019s land on the east and the defendants\u2019 land on the west into a creek below. The northern boundary of the plaintiff\u2019s land is described in a deed from Joseph Ballard to Thomas Newhall, the plaintiff\u2019s father, under whom she claims title, as \u201crunning northerly seven poles to the county road, and from thence upon the road twenty-two poles to the first mentioned bound.\u201d The seven rods terminate on the north at the old wall which formerly constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the southern boundary of the road, and the watercourse is wholly north of the old wall and within the southern half of said highway; and one question submitted to the court is, whether such boundary can be construed to extend to the middle of the highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-5\">The defendants own a piece of land next west of the plaintiff\u2019s land, upon which they have erected a mill or factory, and also another piece of land on the north side of the highway above the plaintiff\u2019s land and wholly easterly of the place where the watercourse crosses the highway, which last piece of land the defendants have excavated and formed into a pond for the use of their mill. The watercourse runs through this last mentioned piece of land and pond and a dam has there been built across it by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-6\">The defendants, under the authority of an act of the legislature passed on the 3d of May, 1850, <em>(St. 1850, c. 285,) </em>put down a pipe or culvert, leading from their pond along and across the highway, to their mill, agreeably to the conditions and requirements of the act, so far as the size of the pipe and the manner of placing it in the ground are concerned. The defendants have since occasionally drawn water through the pipe, but at no time in such quantity as to prevent the plaintiff from using it in any manner in which she has ever been accustomed to use it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-7\">Nominal damages only are claimed by the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-8\"><em>T.

By the common law, no person has a right to divert the waters of a natural watercourse, for any purpose other than domestic. or the purposes of husbandry; and then the surplus must be returned to the channel, before it enters the land of the proprietor below. 3 Kent Com.

Although no actual injury may have been sustained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the plaintiff, yet if the diversion complained of was wrongful, she is entitled to nominal damages.

The special act of the legislature, under which the defendants claim, does not authorize them to divert the waters of the watercourse in question; or if it does, it is unconstitutional, because it does not provide a compensation for the damage which may be caused by the diversion to persons having rights in the watercourse. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>7 Mass. 393; <em>Holden </em>v. <em>James, </em>11 Mass. 396; <em>Thacher </em>v. <em>Dartmouth Bridge, </em>18 Pick. 501.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b605-6\"><em>J.

Nor has she any right to monopolize or control the waters of the brook. The boundaries of the plaintiff\u2019s land are such as to negative the entire ownership of the brook, and exclude the road under which the defendants\u2019 culvert is laid. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>11 Pick. 193. 2. If the plaintiff is owner or part owner of the brook, she has suffered no actual or perceptible damage. It is <em>damnum absque injuri\u00e9, </em>theoretical damage merely. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>9 Pick. 59; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Bruce, </em>17 Pick. 184; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>3 Pick. 269; <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Alden, </em>8 Mass. 136; <em>Colburn </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>13 Mass. 420; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>5 B. &amp; Ad. 1, and 2 Nev. &amp; Man. 747; <em>Bealey </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>6 East, 214. 3. The defendants are authorized by <em>St. </em>1850, <em>c. </em>285, to do whatever they have done. <em>Boston &amp; Roxbury Milldam Corp. </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>12 Pick. 467.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-8\">The opinion was delivered at the November term, 1852.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b605-9\">Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeF\">Two questions are presented in this case. The first is whether the plaintiff has title to the half of the highway, along which the stream in controversy runs; if she has, it being conceded that the brook lies wholly south of the middle of the highway at that place, it must of course for some extent pass wholly through the land of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">The northern boundary of the plaintiff\u2019s land is described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>in-a deed, from which she derives her title, as \u201c running northerly seven poles to the county road, and from thence upon the road twenty-two poles to the first mentioned bound.\u201d The ordinary construction of such a deed, to the highway and from thence upon the highway, would carry the land to the middle of the highway. Such is the established presumption, governing the construction of a deed, in the absence of controlling words. <em>Chatham, </em>v. <em>Brainerd, </em>11 Conn. 60; <em>Champlin </em>v. Pendleton, 13 Conn. 23; <em>Bucknam </em>v. Bucknam, 3 Fairf. 463; 1 U. S. Dig. Boundaries, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The only circumstance relied on, to control this presumption, is the fact found in the case, that in measuring the distance from the last named boundary, in the description, to the road, it is in fact seven rods to the southerly side of the road, there indicated by a stone wall, between which and the \u25a0travelled part of the road the brook runs for a little distance, and then turns in a southerly direction, enters the plaintiff\u2019s land, and runs through it to its outlet in a salt water creek. But the court are of opinion, that this fact does not rebut the strong presumption, that boundary on a highway is <em>ad filum vice. </em>The road is a monument, the thread of the road, in legal contemplation, is that monument or abuttal. By a well known rule of construction of deeds and other instruments, calling for localities, measurements will yield to monuments. Suppose this had been northerly to the centre of. the highway, there measuring seven rods, and it in fact measured nine rods, no doubt this would have passed the soil to the centre of the road. Land may no doubt be bounded by the side of a highway, but it must be done in clear and distinct terms, to control the ordinary presumption. Perhaps this point is not very- material to the present case, because it is conceded, that from the highway it runs exclusively through the plaintiff\u2019s land; but as it is made, and as perhaps it. makes the result more clear and satisfactory, we have examined it with the above result.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">2. Taking this to be so, the defendants, by excavating an artificial pond or reservoir, on their own land, on the north side of the road, and placing a dam across the brook to raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the water in that reservoir, and thence by a culvert or pipe taking the water from the reservoir, along and across the road and into their own land, and conducting it thence to their mills, from which it is discharged into the salt water below the plaintiff\u2019s land, have effectually diverted a large, portion of the entire volume of the water of the brook from the plaintiff\u2019s land.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">This was an unwarrantable and injurious use of a common right to a watercourse, running in its natural channel, through the lands of several different proprietors. The rule of law is well settled, that each of such proprietors has a right to a reasonable and beneficial use of the current as it passes through his own land; but he has no right to divert or corrupt it, so as to prevent the proprietor below him from having and enjoying the same use, for all usual and beneficial purposes. This substantial diversion of the watercourse, therefore, was unwarranted by any right of the defendants, as proprietors above, was an encroachment on the rights of the plaintiff, and prejudicial to her estate. And although the plaintiff has sustained no present damage, because she has had no miff upon it, or otherwise used it for any agricultural or manufacturing purpose, yet such diversion would prevent such beneficial use of it hereafter, and thus impair the value of the estate. It is therefore a case where an action can be maintained to vindicate the plaintiff\u2019s right, and to prevent a loss of it by adverse possession and lapse of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Even where it has been considered that a riparian proprietor had authority to make use of the stream for purposes of irrigation, and thus by that use divert a portion of it, it has been held under the condition, that such diversion was, under all circumstances, a reasonable use of the stream, and that the surplus of the water thus used must be returned into its natural channel. These cases carry a strong implication, that a diversion of the entire stream, or of a considerable part of it, is prejudicial to the proprietor below, and not justifiable. <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Alden, </em>8 Mass. 136; <em>Colburn </em>v. Richards, 13 Mass. 420; <em>Cook </em>v. Hull, 3 Pick. 269; <em>Embrey </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>6 Welsb Hurlst. &amp; Gord. 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>3. We have not considered the act of the legislature as having any effect on the rights of the plaintiff. It seems to have been made <em>alio intuitu, </em>and solely as a license to the defendants to make a certain use of the highway, which would otherwise have been a public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><em>Judgment for the plaintiff for </em>$1 <em>and costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
