The tenants pleaded the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-8\">At the trial in the court of common pleas, before <em>Byington, </em>J., the demandants, to prove their case, produced and proved a mortgage to them from Daniel Leland, Jr., and James Luke, Jr., of the land described in their writ, and the notes secured by the mortgage, made by Leland and Luke to the demand-ants. The mortgage and notes bore date the 31st of August, 1846; and the mortgage was duly executed, delivered, acknowledged, and recorded. The demandants then rested their case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-9\">The tenants introduced no evidence; and requested the judge to instruct the jury, that the demandants had not made out a <em>primd facie </em>case, and that merely showing a mortgage by Leland and Luke to them of the demanded premises, without showing some possession or seizin or title in the mortgagors, or some connexion between the mortgagors and the tenants, would not be sufficient evidence to warrant a verdict for the demandants. But the judge refused so to instruct the jury, and instructed them, that if they were satisfied by the evidence, that the mortgage was duly executed, delivered and recorded, and that the notes were executed by Leland and Luke to the demandants, and that there was something due to the demandants on the mortgage, they would be entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-10\">The judge further instructed the jury, that the tenants having pleaded the general issue, the demandants were not required to show that the tenants were in possession of the demanded premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The jury returned a verdict for the demandants, and the tenants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">This case was argued at the last October term, by <em>J. G. </em>Abbott, for the tenants, and <em>B. F. Jacobs, </em>for the demandants.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b192-6\">Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWB\">This case we think must be governed by that of <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>15 Pick. 185. The execution, delivery and acknowledgment of a deed, are by statute made to have the force and effect of livery of seizin, and therefore do constitute some evidence of seizin in the grantee, and therefore in the absence of all proof, on the part of the tenant, may avail. The plea of <em>mil disseizin </em>so far admits the tenant\u2019s claim to have the freehold, that it is not incumbent on the demandant, to prove the tenant\u2019s possession. <em>Higbee </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>5 Mass. 352 ; <em>Washington Bank </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>2 Met. 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
