Under the laws of New Jersey, the Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Hudson had no authority, Dec. 14, 1876, to purchase lands whereon to erect a court-house, and to issue in payment therefor bonds payable out of the amount appropriated and limited for the fiscal year commencing Dec. 1, 1877.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b623-10\">2.

In payment therefor the county was to issue to the owner of them bonds \u201cpayable out of the amount appropriated and limited for the expense of the next fiscal year; said bonds to run one year from, the date thereof, and bearing interest at the rate of seven per cent per annum.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-16\">Crampton, the owner, in accordance with the terms of the resolution, accepted the proposition of purchase, and delivered, Dec. 22, 1876, to the board a duly executed deed for the lots, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>bearing date the 18th of that month.

Zabriskie and two other resident tax-payers of the county thereupon filed their bill of complaint on the equity side of that court, praying that the bonds be declared void and be delivered up, that the board be ordered to reconvey the property to Crampton, and that he be enjoined from prosecuting an action on or parting with the bonds in any other way than by surrendering them to the board. The bill alleges that Siedler and other tax-payers of the county applied to the Supreme Court of the State by writ of <em>certiorari </em>for relief against said resolution and purchase, and that the court, by its final judgment rendered Nov. 22, 1877, declared that said resolution was illegal and void.

The Supreme Court of New Jersey expressly held that its decision was \u201c not upon the validity of his claim.\u201d He may, therefore, insist upon it here, notwithstanding that court was of opinion that the resolution was in violation of statutes that are merely directory, but which the board could not plead in avoidance of his rights under an executed contract. An order setting aside the resolution after it had been carried into effect cannot cancel the obligation of the bonds, or impair the title which passed by his conveyance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-11\">It must be conceded that by the original act creating the county of Hudson, its board of freeholders had all the rights, power, and authority vested in any other board, and that no limitation other than the public needs, of which it was the exclusive judge, was imposed upon its power to purchase land whereon to erect buildings for the use of the courts and public officers, or for any other authorized purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-12\">The only objection made below to the bonds is grounded upon the assumption that the statutes of 1874 and 1876 prohibit a contract by which the board gains a credit beyond the fiscal year in which such a purchase is made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-13\">The act of 1874 only requires that the <em>expenditures </em>of the fiscal year shall not exceed the amount raised by taxation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>that year. It will not be questioned that under its general powers the board had the right to purchase land and erect.a court-house thereon. The current of authority is that a municipal corporation may borrow money for any appropriate purpose within the scope of its charter. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Chillicothe, </em>7 Ohio, Part II. 31; <em>State </em>v. Madison, 7 Wis. 688 ; <em>Clark </em>v. Janesville, 10 id. 136; <em>Mills </em>v. Gleason, 11 id. 470. The properly constituted authorities of a municipality may bind the corporation whenever they have power to act in the premises. <em>Cincinnati City </em>v. Morgan, 3 Wall. 275. Authority to build a court-house carries with it the right to borrow money to build it, <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>The County </em>(16 id. 6) ; and bonds or notes may be given for any authorized work or purchase. <em>The Mayor </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>19 id. 468. But although there may be some conflict in the decisions as to the power of a municipality to borrow money, there is none as to its power to contract for work or property on credit. There is a wide and manifest difference between incurring <em>a debt </em>in the prosecution of a purpose expressly-sanctioned by statute and <em>borrowing money </em>with a view to such prosecution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-5\">The learned district judge who decided this case below says, \u201c The contract for the purchase was consummated on the 22d of December, 1876, and if the board at any regular meeting, or special meeting, called for the purpose prior to the 15th of July following, had included the consideration money to be paid in the amount to be raised by tax for the fiscal year, it is difficult to perceive any illegality in the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-6\">The board had, in his opinion, the right to give the bonds in question. The illegality then consists in the alleged failure to provide in the proper fiscal year the money to pay them. Crampton is in no wise responsible for that failure, and neither the board nor the tax-payers can set up its wrong to bar his claim for the stipulated price of the property. His reasoning substantially amounts to this,' \u2014 the bonds were valid when given; but inasmuch as the board neglected to levy a tax to pay them at maturity, the defence of <em>ultra vires </em>must be sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-7\">It does not, however, appear that when the bonds were due there was not money enough in the treasury to pay them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>There is no evidence whatever in-the record of the amount raised or then unexpended, and the burden of proof of any fact in discharge of the liability rests upon the board and not upon Crampton.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-5\">The act of 1876 must receive a strict construction. The object was not to impair obligations incurred, but to reach offending individual members of the board. Its terms do not .justify the assumption that it was the legislative intent to render absolutely void a contract in contravention of them. It contemplates certain things accomplished, \u2014 the disbursement as a fact, and the obligation incurred as an existing liability. Its policy was not to punish a third party who contracts with the board, and delivers to it his property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-6\">But if the bonds are void, they are mere evidences of debt, and can be severed from the consideration of the debt. The right of recovery on the consideration still subsists and may be enforced. <em>Hitchcock </em>v. Galveston, 96 U. S. 341.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b629-7\"><em>Mr. J. H. Lippincott </em>and <em>Mr. Peter Bentley </em>for the appellees. .</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b629-8\">Mb. Justice Field</author>\n<p id=\"AzY\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">On the 14th of December, 1876, the Board of Chosen'Freeholders of the County of Hudson, in New Jersey, passed a resolution to purchase of the defendant, Crampton, certain real property in Jersey City, upon which to erect a court-house and other buildings for the county, at the price of $2,000 for .every 2,500 square feet, the price at which he had previously offered to sell the same, and to issue to him in payment thereof bonds of the county, payable out of the amount appropriated and limited for the expenses of the next fiscal year, the bonds to run for one year and to draw interest at the rate of seven per cent per annum. The bonds were to be signed by the director at large and the collector of the county, and to be issued under its seal. On the 18th of December, Crampton executed and delivered to the board a conveyance of the property, which was accepted and recorded in the office of -the register of deeds; and thereupon three bonds were executed and delivered to him, two of which were for the sum of $75,000, and one was for $75,720. No provision was made by the board for the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>of the bonds beyond the general declaration that they should be paid out of the amount appropriated and limited for the next fiscal year. By the law then in force the fiscal year commenced on the first day of December of each year, and the expendifcui'es of the board were restricted to the amount raised by tax for that year, unless by the spread of an epidemic or a contagious disease a greater expenditure should be required; and the amount to be raised Avas to be determined at a meeting of the board to be held prior to July 15 of each year. Some of the resident tax-payers were dissatisfied Avit-h this issue of bonds without making definite provision for their, payment by taxation, and accordingly obtained from the Supreme Court of the State a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review the proceedings of the board. The court adjudged the proceedings invalid, and set the same aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">It does not appear that any attention was paid either by the board or Crampton to this judgment. The board did not re-convey or offer to reconvey the land to Crampton; nor did the latter return or offer to return to the board the bonds received by him. But, on the contrary, Crampton commenced an action in the Circuit Court of the United States to enforce their payment. The present suit, therefore, is brought by other taxpayers of the county to compel the board to reconvey the land' and Crampton to return the bonds, and to enjoin the prosecution of the action to enforce their payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The facts here stated are not contradicted; they are substantially admitted ; and upon them the court beloAv very properly rendered a decree for the complainants. Indeed, upon the simple statement of the case, it Avould seem that there ought to be no question as to the invalidity of the proceedings of the board. The object of the statute of Neiv Jersey defining and limiting-its powers would be defeated if a debt could be contracted without present provision for its payment in advance of a tax levy, upon a simple declaration that out of the amount to be raised in a future fiscal year it should be paid. The hiAv, in terms, limits the expenditures of the board, with a single ex ception, to the amount to be raised by taxation actually levied, not by promised taxation in the future. And, as if this limitation was not sufficient, it makes it a misdemeanor in any mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ber of tbe board to incur obligations in excess of the amount thus provided. It would be difficult to express in a more emphatic way the will of the legislature that the board should not incur for the county any obligations beyond its-'income previously provided by taxation; in other words, that the expenses of the county should be based upon and never exceed moneys in its treasury, or taxes already levied and payable there.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Of the right of. resident tax-payers to invoke the interposition of a court of equity to prevent an illegal disposition of the moneys of the county or the illegal creation of a debt which they in common with other property-holders of the county may otherwise be compelled to pay, there is at this day no serious question. The right has been recognized by the State courts in numerous cases; and from the nature of the powers exercised by municipal corporations, the great danger of their abuse and the necessity of prompt action to prevent irremediable injuries, it would seem eminently proper for courts of equity to interfere upon the application of the tax-payers of a county to prevent the consummation of a wrong, when the officers of those corporations assume,\u00bbin excess of their powers, to create burdens' upon property-holders. Certainly, in the absence of legislation restricting the right to interfere in such cases to public officers of tbe State or county, there would seem to be no substantial reason why a bill by or on behalf of. individual tax-payers should not be entertained to prevent the misuse of corporate powers. The courts may be safely trusted to prevent the abuse of their process in such eases. Those who desire to consult the leading authorities on this subject will find them stated or referred to in Mr. Dillon\u2019s excellent treatise on the Law of Municipal Corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
