The plaintiffs, Arthur B. Mulvey, Bichar\u00e1 J. Mulvey and Julia F. M. Armstrong, owned jointly a dwelling house in Chicago. They joined in a lease of said dwelling to defendant Charter for a term beginning April 1, 1903, and ending April 1, 1906. The defendant occupied the house and paid the rent up to March 31, 1904. The evidence showed that about March 31, 1904, Arthur B. Mulvey accepted from defendant a surrender of the term and told defendant to allow a Mr. Bicket to move in and to turn the keys over to him. Pursuant to the agreement defendant moved out and Bicket moved into the house and paid the rent up to August 31, 1905. Plaintiffs brought suit to recover the rent under the lease to defendant for the months of September, October and November, 1905. There was a judgment of nil capiat and the plaintiffs appealed.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-7\" pgmap=\"436\">A. B.

Ency. of Law, 356. A surrender may be inferred where there is a change of possession from the circumstances and conduct of the parties evincing that they both agree to consider a surrender as made. Where there has been a change of possession, with the assent of both parties, it amounts to a surrender of the term by act and operation of law. From the evidence the jury might properly find that a surrender was made to Arthur B. Mulvey, and such surrender is a bar to the action. Churchill v. Lammers, 60 Mo. App. 244. The jury might also from the evidence properly find that Arthur B. Mulvey had authority to act for and did act for the other joint lessors in accepting the surrender of the term and possession of the premises. He had charge of the renting and repairs of the premises and with him Charter made the agreement in regard to the surrender; he accepted Bicket as a tenant in place of Charter and collected rent from him for a year and some months, and the applications of Bicket for repairs were made to him.
