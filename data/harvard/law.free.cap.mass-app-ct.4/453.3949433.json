He was acquitted on the first two charges, convicted on the third, and sentenced. The two assignments of error argued by the defendant are grounded on the judge\u2019s denial of motions for a mistrial. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">It appears from the evidence that in the early morning of May 21,1974, the defendant entered a building in Cambridge in which the victim lived, made his way up a flight of stairs, and entered the victim\u2019s room. The victim awoke with a scream. The defendant told her who he was and that she \u201chad done him an injury.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He then forced her to leave the building with him, only allowing her to put a raincoat on over her nightgown. He told her to tell the two other occupants of the house not to interfere or \u201csomeone would be hurt.\u201d The victim complied and told the others not to become involved. She was then taken to the defendant\u2019s car and told to get in. As the defendant drove to Boston, he told the victim he was going to hurt her because of the \u201cinjury.\u201d He also said he would shoot her. The victim was eventually taken to an apartment in Brighton which was occupied by one Marcia Greenwood, a business associate of the defendant. The victim testified in detail as to what took place in that apartment and as to what she had observed Greenwood doing during that time. The victim claimed she was forced into sexual acts, in between which she was further intimidated by the defendant\u2019s display of a pistol which he had requested Greenwood get for him. The next day the defendant took the victim back to her home in Cambridge and told her that if she went to the police, he would kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Greenwood testified for the defendant and contradicted the victim\u2019s claim that she had been the unwilling companion of the defendant. Greenwood\u2019s testimony, if believed, supported the defendant\u2019s own testimony that the victim had been in the apartment of her own free will and had voluntarily slept with him. Greenwood also testified that there had been no firearm in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">On cross-examination by the prosecutor, Greenwood was asked several questions which were directed to a showing of bias on her part. Following those questions the witness was asked about the visit to her apartment of a police officer who had informed her that his purpose was to inquire about a matter which had happened in the apartment on the morning of May 21, 1974. She denied that she had refused to admit the officer, and that she had told him that she knew nothing about what had happened on that morning. She also denied having told the officer she was not in the apartment at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Greenwood was then questioned about the officer\u2019s return to the apartment on the following day with other officers. During the cross-examination that followed the witness\u2019s affirmative answer to a question as to whether the officer had come the next day with a warrant (charging her as an accessory to certain crimes), the prosecutor posed questions to Greenwood about her own individual sex life. Pertinent parts of the cross-examination are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At a bench conference which followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>that questioning, the judge strongly admonished the prosecutor that such questions were not proper and that he should limit his inquiry to matters tending to show bias or prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The defendant then moved for a mistrial, asserting that the prejudicial effect of the questions coupled with the other evidence which had been introduced could not be cured by any instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Following the bench conference the judge asked the jury to disregard the question and instructed them, as he had previously in his preliminary remarks, that questions are not evidence and that unless questions were answered, they should not be a factor in the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The prosecutor then twice asked whether anyone else was arrested with Greenwood. The judge sustained objections to both questions and promptly told the prosecutor not to direct his questioning in \u201cthat general area.\u201d At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the conclusion of that cross-examination the defendant renewed his motion for a mistrial, which was again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Officer Gentile, of the Cambridge police, who had arrested Greenwood, was called as a rebuttal witness for the Commonwealth. After giving testimony which contradicted in many respects that of Greenwood as to what had happened in her apartment on the two occasions when he had been there, he testified further. Pertinent parts of that testimony are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the end of a bench conference that followed, the judge denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the defendant\u2019s second motion for a mistrial. He then instructed the jury at length on ways in which witnesses may be impeached. He also instructed: \u201cWhatever Miss Greenwood was doing at the time of the arrest, whoever the gentleman was in her apartment, and whether he or she was arrested for that, is absolutely and positively irrelevant to any proceeding in this case. It certainly does not go to the substantive issues of the crimes... [of] which the defendant stands charged, nor does it go to the matter of the credibility of Miss Greenwood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The motions for mistrial were and are particularly appropriate vehicles by which to raise the effect of the prosecutor\u2019s excesses. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Red</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>mond, </em>370 Mass. 591, 593-596 (1976). While the irrelevant material disclosed by those questions and answers, viewed separately, might be regarded as harmless, their cumulative effect causes us concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The defendant contends that the intent and purpose of the cross-examination were to discredit Greenwood by suggesting to the jury that she was a woman of easy virtue, if not a prostitute. The prosecutor, despite the admonitions of the judge, persisted in lines of inquiry which were bound to elicit information which could not have been properly admitted for the purpose of impeaching Greenwood or showing bias on her part. Other questions sought answers which were relevant rebuttal but were inflammatory in nature and well beyond the scope permitted by the judge. On several occasions the judge acted to overcome the improper prejudicial effect of what was disclosed or suggested. He gave detailed instructions to the jury concerning information that might properly be elicited on cross-examination and informed them that what they had heard could not be considered as evidence bearing on the defendant\u2019s guilt or on Greenwood\u2019s credibility. While it would have been preferable for the judge to have given more succinct and positive instructions (compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paradiso, </em>368 Mass. 205, 206, n.2 [1975]), we cannot assume that the instructions did not have their intended effect. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagan, </em>357 Mass. 585, 589 (1970). The Supreme Judicial Court and this court have often refused to overturn convictions because of a judge\u2019s refusal to exercise his discretion to grant a mistrial where irrelevant harmful matters have been brought to the jury\u2019s attention but have been removed from the jury\u2019s consideration by appropriate corrective instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paradiso, supra, </em>at 208; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>368 Mass. 729, 734-735 (1975). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Banuchi, </em>335 Mass. 649, 654 (1957); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>348 Mass. 68, 70-71 (1964); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>351 Mass. 37, 45 (1966). \u201cErrors are almost inevitable in any trial, improprieties almost unavoidable, but the presence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>of one or the other furnishes no automatic signal for reversal and retrial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagan, supra, </em>at 591. While the cumulative prejudicial effect of the matters improperly brought out before the jury approaches the outer limits of what a jury can be expected to disregard in response to a judge\u2019s instruction, we, as did the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>363 Mass. 299, 309-310 (1973), \u201cfeel safe in concluding on the whole that it is highly probable that the jury would have voted the same way\u201d if they had not heard the material complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">We find strong support for this conclusion in the jury\u2019s discriminating verdicts. See <em>id. </em>at 309. Furthermore, Greenwood\u2019s testimony did not support the defendant\u2019s denial of the kidnapping charge. That charge was made out on the events which had taken place in Cambridge and which Greenwood did not witness. The evidence as to them had revealed that the victim had been forcibly removed from her bedroom, made to enter an automobile, and taken against her will over the river and into Boston. Two other witnesses corroborated the victim\u2019s account of her departure from the Cambridge apartment. Even the defendant failed to contradict the victim\u2019s account of those events. He testified that he told the victim that, despite her objections, she had to leave with him. Greenwood\u2019s testimony largely contradicted that of the victim and substantiated that of the defendant only as to what had occurred in the Brighton apartment. The attempt to discredit her does not appear to have caused the defendant any harm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury obviously disbelieved the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>testimony on the rape charge as well as that regarding the unnatural acts but believed her account of the kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">On the basis of the strong evidence in support of the kidnapping charge, the fact that the Greenwood testimony only concerned the events which took place in Brighton, and the jury\u2019s selectivity in rendering their verdicts, we conclude that no miscarriage of justice resulted and that the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying either motion for a mistrial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paradiso, </em>368 Mass. at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-5\"> There was evidence that two weeks earlier the defendant and the victim had gone to Provincetown for a weekend, during which they had engaged in sexual activities. The victim claimed to have been forced into them, which the defendant denied. The defendant apparently complained of \u201cinjury\u201d from the victim\u2019s reports to others of a claimed rape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\"> The prosecutor: \u201cWhen they [the police officers] came in \u2014 that was about 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AXO\">The witness: \u201cApproximately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ak7U\">The prosecutor: \u201c \u2014 were you working in your apartment at that time?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AvD\">The witness: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AORg\">The prosecutor: \u201cHow were you dressed?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3t\">The witness: \u201cI came to the door in a robe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Alj\">The prosecutor: \u201cIn a robe?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AsS\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ax4\">The prosecutor: \u201cYou weren\u2019t wearing a nightgown?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APs\">The witness: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOB\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd the police came into the apartment?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AuT7\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The prosecutor: \u201cAnd they advised you you were under arrest?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AfJ\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AGQ\">The prosecutor: \u201cAt some time shortly thereafter?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AgI\">[objection and exception]</p>\n<p id=\"ARb\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ahi\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd they told you what you were under arrest for at that time?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AtP\">[objection and exception]</p>\n<p id=\"ADF\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Anz\">The prosecutor: \u201cAt 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, in your apartment?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7g\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AX3\">The prosecutor: \u201cThey told you.

I heard some noise in there. I waited a few minutes, knocked again. Then I received an answer by Miss Greenwood. She asked me who it was. I told her it was the Cambridge police, Detective Gentile. She waited a few minutes, and then I heard locks being opened, and then the door was opened as far as the chain would allow. Then I identified myself again and showed her that I had a warrant for her arrest. She tried to close the door on me. I wouldn\u2019t let her. I forced my way in at this time \u2014 I had broke the chain, and I walked in there.</p>\n<p id=\"A4t\">As I was in there, I heard noise in the bedroom, so I ran into the bedroom with my gun drawn, and in the bedroom was a closet that was the length of the wall, a sliding closet; and as I looked there, I saw the door half-closed, and some clothes were shaking in the closet. I had my gun on the closet door, and I asked whoever was in there to come out by show-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>mg his hands first.

There the court held that, because it was error not to have permitted evidence of the victim\u2019s unchastity to impeach her testimony on a charge of rape, the defendant\u2019s convictions on other charges must be reversed as well. The rationale was that if the jury disbelieved the victim\u2019s testimony on the rape charge, they might well have disbelieved her testimony on the other charges also. In the present case, by contrast, the jury appear to have accepted Marcia Greenwood\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s testimony on the rape and unnatural acts charges and rejected that of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>plainant, and yet accepted the complainant\u2019s testimony as to what transpired in Cambridge. For these reasons the holding in the <em>Manning </em>case is inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
