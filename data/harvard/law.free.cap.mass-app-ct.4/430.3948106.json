L. c. 231A.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>In early 1975, Carabetta Enterprises, Inc. (developer), filed an application with the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) seeking to establish pursuant to G. L. c. 121A (as in effect prior to St. 1975, c. 827) a corporation which would build apartments in Watertown near the Charles River on land owned by Charles Mossessian. In accordance with the procedures of G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 6, the DCA transmitted the application to the town of Water-town, whose selectmen reported the matter to the planning board. On August 5, 1975, after conducting hearings, the planning board by a three to two vote determined, among other things, that the tract of land in question was a \u201cblighted open area\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 1, and approved the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Shortly thereafter the plaintiffs challenged the board\u2019s decision by filing this action seeking declaratory relief pursuant to G. L. c. 231A and judicial review of an agency decision pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 8, 1975, the defendants\u2019 Rule 12 (b) motions to dismiss, based on various grounds, were allowed. Judgments were entered, and the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The plaintiffs, as residents, voters, taxpayers, or town officials, may not use chapter 231A to obtain declaratory relief concerning the validity of an official act. <em>Povey </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Medford, </em>333 Mass. 70, 71-72 (1955). <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>334 Mass. 703 (1956). <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy. </em>350 Mass. 775, cert. den. 385 U. S. 845 (1966). Chapter 231A, \u00a7 8, requires that \u201call persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.\u201d The court in <em>Povey </em>made the following comment on a taxpayer suit similar to the present one: \u201cIf... these plaintiffs are proper parties to this proceeding why must not all other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>taxpayers who have the same rights as the plaintiffs be made parties? And if all others are not made parties why may not other taxpayers who are not bound by the present proceeding bring other and later suits in their respective rights? And if ten or more taxpayers have a right to sue for declaratory relief, why does not a single taxpayer have the same right? We cannot believe that the Legislature intended that public officers should be subject to harassment by taxpayers as to their official acts in this manner.\u201d 333 Mass, at 72. We agree with the reasoning of <em>Povey </em>and conclude that the plaintiffs have not complied with the requirements of c. 231A, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5As the plaintiffs have neither alleged nor argued any special statutory standing, dismissal of the action was proper.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also <em>Saraceno </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>361 Mass. 696, 701-702 (1972). Furthermore, the granting of the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s action against it was also proper because that agency plays no role in the chapter 121A statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We do not find it necessary to decide whether the plaintiffs are aggrieved persons within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, because the planning board of Watertown is a local body and is not an \u201cagency\u201d for purposes of the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A. See <em>Dixie\u2019s Bar Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd. </em>357 Mass. 699, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>702 (1970); <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>367 Mass. 1, 7-8 (1975). Therefore, review of the board\u2019s decision cannot be obtained under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. In light of our disposition of this appeal, we offer no opinion concerning the merits of the case or whether the decision of the board was ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\"> The action was originally filed in the Supreme Judicial Court which ordered it transferred to the Superior Court. On September 18, 1975, a judge of the latter court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the approval of the developer\u2019s application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\"> It has not been argued that the plaintiffs are representatives of a class. See <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>367 Mass. 293, 297-298 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\"> For instances where taxpayers or taxable inhabitants have been conferred standing by statute, see G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 63 (illegal expenditures by the Commonwealth); G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 35 (compliance with various financial requirements of county government); G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 53 (illegal expenditures by towns and regional school districts); G. L. c. 44, \u00a7 59 (compliance by treasurers, collectors, and assessors with various financial requirements); G. L. c. 45, \u00a7 7 (erection of buildings on park land); G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 34 (failure to provide sufficient funds for maintenance of public schools); G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69 (proper rate setting for gas and electricity); and G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3(10) (enforcement of gift or conveyance to town or city). See also G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, which authorizes appeals by a municipal officer or board in certain zoning matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
