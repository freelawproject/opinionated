We therefore draw our own conclusions. <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>342 Mass. 460, 461 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">The town points to the stipulation in the statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>agreed facts that the collective bargaining agreement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the basis of vacation entitlement as set out in an implementing personnel by-law) \u201ccontemplated and was understood and agreed upon by the parties to be based upon a five-day work week.\u201d It was further agreed that \u201csince March 4, 1957 to date the Town has granted vacations to Petitioners and the class whom they represent on the basis of five day work weeks.\u201d The town thus argues and we agree that the source of vacation time is contractual, and that under the collective bargaining agreement police officers with (e.g.) one year\u2019s service are entitled to a vacation of two working weeks or ten days, i.e., they are entitled to vacation time during any ten days when they would otherwise be working.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The plaintiffs argue, and the trial judge held, that this result is inconsistent with G. L. c. 147, \u00a7 \u00a7 16C and 17, adopted by the town March 4, 1957, and the case of <em>Holyoke Police Relief Assn. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Holyoke, </em>358 Mass. 350 (1970) (the <em>Holyoke </em>case), and that those sections and the <em>Holyoke </em>case require that police officers be given vacation time measured in calendar (seven day) weeks. Thus, on this view (e.g.) police officers with one year\u2019s service are entitled to vacation of two calendar weeks or fourteen days, i.e., they are entitled to vacation time during any fourteen days when they would otherwise be working. We do not accept this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">General Laws c. 147, \u00a7 16C, provides that: \u201cMembers of the police department of every ... town which accepts this section ... shall be excused from duty for two days out of every seven without loss of pay____\u201d General Laws c. 147, \u00a7 17, provides: \u201cIn no case shall the number of such days off be less than... one hundred and four in each year in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>a town subject to section sixteen C, and they shall be in addition to any annual vacation now or hereafter allowed ... and such annual vacation shall not be diminished on account thereof.\u201d But these sections do not address themselves to the number of working days \u2014 apart from the 104 days off \u2014 which an employee is entitled to take as vacation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Furthermore, reliance on the <em>Holyoke </em>case, <em>supra, </em>is misplaced. That case dealt with the construction of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111D, a statutory source of vacation entitlement; the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that because there existed no Statewide uniformity as to what constituted a work week for police officers (see G. L. c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 14-16B, \u201cprovid [mg] for one day off in thirty [and] ... one day off in fifteen, eight, seven and six days respectively____\u201d the <em>Holyoke </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at 353) the Legislature, in providing for vacations measured in \u201cweeks,\u201d must have meant calendar weeks. But the town has not accepted c. 41, \u00a7 111D, and the extent to which that statute would have constrained the bargaining process is not before us. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178 (I), as in effect prior to St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 1. See now G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7(e). Cf. <em>Chief of Police of Dracut </em>v. <em>Dracut, </em>357 Mass. 492, 499 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We see no reason to disturb the bargain which the parties struck. Accordingly, the decree is reversed, and a judgment is to be entered changing paragraph 1 of the decree in accordance with this opinion and incorporating paragraph 2 of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\"><em>So </em>ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-9\"> The agreement provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">\n<em>\u201cARTICLE V Vacation\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">\u201cAll employees [police officers] occupying a full-time position or a regular part-time position shall be granted the following vacations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">After 12 months continuous service \u2014 2 weeks</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMF\">After 10 years continuous service \u2014 3 weeks</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayl\">After 15 years continuous service \u2014 4 weeks.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\"> The declaration in paragraph 2 of the decree, which is not contested, correctly states the effect of \u00a7 16C and \u00a7 17: \u201cThe members of the Police Department of said Town of Bridgewater shall be excused from duty for two days out of every seven without loss of pay for a total of 104 days in each year in accordance with General Laws Chapter 147, Section 16C, and this shall be in addition to any annual vacation allowed to them and such annual vacation shall not be diminished on account thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
