The plaintiff conducted its business in the town of Seekonk. The defendant board is charged with the enforcement of the town\u2019s zoning bylaw through the defendant building inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The plaintiff brought this action for declaratory judgment, seeking a determination whether a \u201cbody shop,\u201d engaged in the repair of all parts, both interior and exterior, of motor vehicles, would be a permitted use in a \u201chighway business\u201d zoning district under the zoning bylaw of Seekonk. The building inspector in turn brought an action seeking to restrain the use of the premises which are the subject of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. A judgment was entered in the first action declaring such use to be permitted, and another was entered dismissing the second. The selectmen and the building inspector have appealed from the judgment in the first case, and the building inspector has appealed from the judgment entered in the second. For the reasons stated herein we reverse the judgment entered in the first case and affirm the judgment in the second case with a minor modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">The plaintiff purchased premises located at 1420 Fall River Avenue in Seekonk which are located in an area zoned for \u201chighway business\u201d and which had previously been operated as a \u201cfilling station.\u201d It was the plaintiff\u2019s intention to replace the structure on the newly acquired premises with a new building adapted to its business and then to move its business to the new location. The only issue presented is whether such a business is a permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>use in a district zoned as \u201chighway business\u201d under the Seekonk zoning by-law, which allows only specifically enumerated uses of land or structures within particular districts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That issue focuses on that part of \u00a7 7.1 of the by-law which makes \u201cautomobile service stations\u201d a permitted use in the district concerned and on whether that term includes use as a \u201cbody shop\u201d as contemplated by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">The Superior Court judge, in holding that the operation of an automobile body repair shop was included within the definition of the term \u201cautomobile service station\u201d in \u00a7 7.1, did so on the basis that that section permitted \u201crepair\u201d of motor vehicles and contained no language qualifying or limiting the type of repairs allowed. We disagree with that conclusion as we do not regard the language of the by-law which permits repairs as one of several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>operations which may be carried on in an \u201cautomobile service station\u201d as permitting an operation devoted wholly to automobile repairs. The term \u201cautomobile service station\u201d is not defined in the by-law, but there is nothing in the by-law to indicate that it was intended to have other than its ordinary meaning. We therefore have examined the phrase to determine its meaning, as a question of law for this court, <em>Salah </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Canton, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 492 (1974), \u201caccording to the common and approved usage,\u201d <em>Needham </em>v. <em>Winslow Nurseries, Inc. </em>330 Mass. 95, 99 (1953), and in the context in which it is employed. <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Melrose, </em>315 Mass. 291, 295 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">A service station is defined in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2076 (1963) as a \u201cfilling station\u201d and also as \u201ca depot or place at which some service is offered.\u201d It is known to us as an establishment which provides such services as fuel, lubrication, incidental repairs, and auto maintenance; it does not normally encompass the type of repair characteristic of the operation of an automobile body shop such as the plaintiff wishes to maintain. The judge found that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s principal business is the operation of an automobile body shop. Its activities for the purpose of this dispute are best described as making and undertaking of repairs of all parts, interior and exterior, of motor vehicles with the emphasis on external repairs, the lesser portion of its business being concerned with engine repairs and tune-ups and the like.\u201d Such activities are a use substantially different from that normally associated with a service station. Such a specialized and concentrated use is not within the definition or our understanding of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In entering the judgment in the second case, the judge acted in the belief that use of the property as a body shop would be permitted under \u00a7 7.1 of the zoning by-law. As we hold to the contrary, reversal of the judgment dismissing the building inspector\u2019s complaint would be appropriate. However, as it does not appear that any use has yet been made of the premises which violates the zoning by<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>law and in view of the declaration of rights of the parties which will be entered in the first action, we do not regard the apprehended violation to be reasonably imminent, and we conclude that an injunction is not necessary at this time. Accordingly, we do not reverse the judgment in the second case. See <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>306 Mass. 441, 449 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The judgment in the action seeking declaratory relief (No. 1463) is reversed, and a new judgment is to be entered declaring that the use of the premises located at 1420 Fall River Avenue, Seekonk, as an automobile shop is not a permitted use under \u00a7 7.1 of the zoning by-law of the town of Seekonk. The judgment in No. 1511 is modified to provide that the dismissal is without prejudice (Mass. R.Civ.P. 41 [b] [3], 365 Mass. 805 [1974]). As so modified that judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b723-5\"> Section 4.1 of that by-law provides: \u201cNo structure or land shall be hereafter used and no structure or part thereof shall be erected, altered, or moved unless in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located, except as otherwise provided.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b723-6\"> That part of \u00a7 7.1 entitled \u201cHighway Business\u201d provides: \u201cLocal business district uses.
