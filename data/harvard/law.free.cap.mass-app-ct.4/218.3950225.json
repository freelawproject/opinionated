Sharafs took exceptions to the order for judgment and to the denial of certain of its requests for rulings. Its bill of exceptions, having been presented but not allowed before July 1,1974, is treated as a notice of appeal. Mass.R.Civ.P. 1A (7), 365 Mass. 732 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The term of the original lease between Sharafs and the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor in title, one Graham, ran from May 1, 1960, to April 30, 1965. The lease gave Sharaf\u2019s an option to extend the lease for an additional five years, by notice in writing to the lessor prior to March 1, 1965. Graham died in September, 1964, and Sharaf\u2019s, on February 25,1965, sent notice of exercise of the option to Old Colony Trust Co. (bank), the executor of Graham\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The rent payable by Sharaf\u2019s during the first five years had been $615 per month. The rent during the five-year extension was to be \u201cat the rate then agreed upon by the Lessor and the Lessee, or failing such agreement at the rate decided by three arbitrators, one to be chosen by the Lessor, one by the Lessee, and the third by the two so chosen... Pending decision by the arbitrators, rent shall continue at the rate of... $615 ... monthly, but shall be adjusted as of May 1, 1965 upon the rendering of the decision by the arbitrators.\u201d The extension rental was never so determined; rather, the question of the new rental was permitted to drift undecided through the spring and summer of 1965 and did not come to a head until October of that year. The circumstances were these.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">From October, 1964, through February 25, 1965, when the option to extend was exercised, Sharaf\u2019s was engaged in negotiations with the bank for the possible purchase of the building in which the leased premises were located. These negotiations did not terminate until May, 1965. In July, 1965, the bank received offers from the plaintiffs to purchase the building, and in August the bank and the plaintiffs entered into a purchase and sale agreement, under which title was to pass on October 28,1965, and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>was expressly made contingent on the provision in <em>the </em>lease for arbitration of Sharaf\u2019s rent being \u201cstill in full force and effect.\u201d The plaintiffs were \u201cgiven permission to initiate negotiations with Sharaf\u2019s ... for determination of [the] rental to be paid by it during the extended term of the lease. No agency or power of attorney is to be construed by this permission and the Seller [bank] shall not be bound... by any such negotiations without its specific written assent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">On August 19, 1965, the plaintiffs initiated discussions with Sharaf\u2019s, and, following a meeting with a representative of Sharaf\u2019s in early September, sent Sharaf\u2019s a letter, dated September 9, 1965, proposing that the new rent be $1,200 per month. Sharaf\u2019s replied on September 15, rejecting any increase in the rental and offering to surrender the premises if the plaintiffs thought they could obtain a higher rental from another tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-20\">On October 1, 1965, the bank sent Sharaf\u2019s a letter requesting payment of $517.50 for the year 1965 pursuant to a clause of the lease requiring Sharaf\u2019s to bear 45 per cent of any increase in Boston real estate taxes assessed on the building over the taxes assessed in 1959. The bank\u2019s letter made no reference to the question of the rental for the extended term. Sharaf\u2019s remitted the sum requested on October 15, in a letter which stated its position on that question to be that the bank, by accepting payment of the $615 monthly rent checks from the beginning of the extended term (May 1) without objection, and without seeking arbitration, had in fact by its conduct agreed with Sharaf\u2019s that the rental for the extended term was to remain the same ($615 per month) as for the original term, subject only to the tax escalation clause. On October 25 the bank, by a letter which did not refer to the previous correspondence, notified Sharaf\u2019s that the rental for the extended term was to be $1,200 per month, effective May 1, 1965, and that if Sharaf\u2019s did not agree to that rate, the bank claimed arbitration. The letter named the arbitrator selected by the bank. There is no evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>correspondence or discussions thereafter between the bank and Sharaf\u2019s concerning a new rental.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The plaintiffs purchased the building from the bank in December, 1965. They received January and February, 1966, rent checks from Sharaf\u2019s, each in the amount of $615, and, after crossing out notations reading \u201cRent paid in full...,\u201d deposited them. There was evidence that Sharaf\u2019s failed or refused to appoint an arbitrator,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that thereafter the plaintiffs asked or demanded that Sharaf\u2019s vacate the premises, that Sharaf\u2019s did so in March or April, 1966, and that the premises were thereafter vacant until October or November of 1967 notwithstanding efforts of the plaintiffs to let them before that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The lease contained a provision whereby Sharaf\u2019s covenanted to indemnify the lessor for lost rent in the event of termination of the lease due to a default by Sharaf\u2019s. Compare <em>Edmands </em>v. <em>Rust &amp; Richardson Drug Co. </em>191 Mass. 123, 126-127 (1906); <em>Gardiner </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>224 Mass. 347, 350 <em>(1916); Wentworth Bldg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Bernstein, </em>346 Mass. 770 (1963). It is evident from the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery that it included a substantial sum (we cannot ascertain an exact figure) for lost rentals subsequent to termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The indemnification clause<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was, however, conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>upon continuation of whatever default prompted it \"for a period of seven (7) days after written notice from the Lessor to the Lessee specifying such default.\u201d The purpose of that clause was to afford the lessee an opportunity to remove the default and thereby avoid termination due to the default. Compare <em>Milona Corp. </em>v. <em>Piece O'Pizza of America Corp. </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 839 (1973). Contrast <em>New England Structures, Inc. </em>v. <em>Loranger, </em>354 Mass. 62, 67-69 (1968). There was no evidence to warrant a finding of compliance with the notice requirement or excuse from such compliance, as to which the plaintiffs had the burden of proof. See <em>Waldo Bros. Co. </em>v. <em>Platt Contracting Co. Inc. </em>305 Mass. 349, 359 (1940). The plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on statements to the contrary allegedly contained in the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions, which was duly presented on June 26,1974, but never allowed (and which does not even appear in the appendix), is misplaced for the reason stated in <em>McElaney </em>v. <em>Hubby, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 717 (1975). Consequently the indemnification clause must be treated as inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Apart from such a clause, the plaintiffs have no right to recover rent for any period subsequent to the termination of the lease. <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Goodman, 194 </em>Mass. 389, 394-395 (1907). <em>Taylan Realty Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Student Book Ex</em>c<em>hange, Inc. </em>354 Mass. 777, 778 (1968). The judge\u2019s ruling to the contrary, implicit in his denial of Sharaf\u2019s sixth requested ruling* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (which is not entirely clear but which we interpret as requesting a ruling that no additional lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>bility for lost rentals could accrue after termination of the lease) was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">It does not follow, however, that the plaintiffs forfeited any right to damages which accrued before termination. See <em>Factory Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Corbin-Holmes Shoe Co. </em>312 Mass. 325, 329-331 (1942). Neither the bank\u2019s acceptance of half a dozen $615 rent checks in the early months of the extended term, nor the bank\u2019s October 1, 1965, letter asking for the 1965 tax escalation payment, nor the bank\u2019s delay in presenting a written claim for an increased rent until October 25, 1965, required the judge to find either an implied agreement that the rent remain unchanged or a waiver by the bank of its right to claim an increased rental. To the contrary, Sharaf\u2019s, through a representative, engaged in negotiations with the plaintiffs concerning the new rent in September, 1965, and, so far as appears, did not advance its theory of implied agreement or waiver until its letter of October 15, 1965. Compare <em>MacDonald &amp; Payne Mach. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Metallic Arts of New England, Inc. </em>324 Mass. 353, 357 (1949). There is no suggestion that Sharaf\u2019s was in any way prejudiced by the delay. Contrast <em>Weinreb </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>361 Mass. 883 (1972). When Sharaf\u2019s exercised its option to extend the lease term, it undertook the obligation to pay whatever rent should be determined in lieu of agreement, effective May 1,1965; when that determination took place could not materially affect the nature or scope of its undertaking. And assuming, as Sharaf\u2019s argues, that the words in the extension clause, that the new rent was to be \u201cat a rate <em>then </em>agreed upon\u201d (emphasis supplied), contemplated agreement between the time of exercise of the option and the commencement of the extended term, it was still open to the judge to find that the parties by their conduct had extended the time for such agreement. <em>MacDonald &amp; Payne Mach. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Metallic Arts of New England, Inc., supra. </em>It follows that Sharaf\u2019s third, fourth and fifth requests for rulings, asserting that as matter of law there was an implied agreement, waiver or estoppel, were properly denied. For the same reason, the denial of Sharaf\u2019s first requested ruling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>that the evidence did not warrant a recovery for the plaintiffs, was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The defendant\u2019s further contention that the judge\u2019s assessment of damages was in derogation of the arbitration provision of paragraph 10 is without merit, because the judge could have found a waiver of that provision by the defendant as matter of fact (if, indeed, there was hot a waiver as matter of law). <em>Fall River </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>219 Mass. 454, 458 (1914). Furthermore, the defendant failed to raise that issue before the trial court by requests for rulings or otherwise. <em>Sikora </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>315 Mass. 66, 71 (1943). The defendant\u2019s remaining contention, relating to the rent which would have been payable before the plaintiffs acquired the premises in December, 1965 (see <em>Burden </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>3 Met. 76, 77-81 [1841]; <em>Winnisimmet Trust, Inc. </em>v. <em>Libby, </em>232 Mass. 491, 492 [1919]), need not be considered for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The findings for the plaintiffs on counts one and two are to be modified, following such further proceedings as may be necessary, so that damages shall be based on the fair rental value of the premises from May 1, 1965, until the date (which we cannot ascertain on this record) that Sharaf\u2019s vacated the premises (see <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>194 Mass. at <em>395), </em>and judgment is <em>to </em>enter for the plaintiffs on the findings as so modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-15\"> Not before us (because no appeal was taken by the plaintiffs) is a third count for damages for failure to restore the leased premises to tenantable condition, on which there was a finding for Sharaf\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\"> There was testimony that on November 17 the bank sent a letter to Sharaf\u2019s stating that the additional payment due on account of the real estate taxes had been miscalculated and asking Sharaf\u2019s to remit an additional $186.30, and that Sharaf\u2019s never remitted the additional sum requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b241-9\"> Although the point is not crucial on the view we take of the case, it is our opinion that the testimony of John W. Priestley warranted a finding that Sharaf\u2019s <em>refused </em>to name an arbitrator notwithstanding the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Sharaf\u2019s <em>failed </em>to name an arbitrator. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 87 (as in effect prior to St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 190). Such a finding would not contradict, but rather would tend to support, the allegations by which the plaintiffs are assertedly bound. See <em>Adiletto </em>v. <em>Brockton Cut Sole Corp. </em>322 Mass. 110, 112 (1947). See also <em>Broman </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>322 Mass. 578, 580 (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b241-10\"> \u201c...
