L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G) from his conviction of unarmed robbery. The victim, a twenty-one year old woman, testified at trial that the defendant and a male companion seized her as she descended the stairs at the Prudential subway station on the evening of September 21,1974. The two men took $9.38 (consisting of a five dollar bill, three one dollar bills, and change) from her wallet and fled. Police of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority were notified and arrived at the scene shortly thereafter. The victim accompanied the police officers in their cruiser as they searched the vicinity. The victim spotted the defendant and his companion inside a sandwich shop about four blocks from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the scene of the crime. The officers and the victim entered the shop; the victim again identified the two males as her assailants. The officers asked the two to empty their pockets; they did so, producing a five dollar bill, three one dollar bills, and some change. The two males were then placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">1. One of the police officers testified that while the defendant was in a cell at the police station he said to the officer, \u201cHow about giving me some money for cigarettes? I had that cigarette money when I made the hit.\u201d The officer testified that he then gave the defendant sixty cents of the money which had been taken from him earlier. During cross-examination the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">Counsel foe the defendant: \u201cSo you were going to give this girl what was left and say that belonged to her. Is that what you were going to do?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">The prosecutor: \u201cObjection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">The court: \u201c[To counsel for the defendant] Whatever his reasons... this is what he said, and this is what he did. I join with you in your outrage over this lady\u2019s money being given to him for cigarettes. Will you go on to something else.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Counsel for the defendant then moved for a mistrial, arguing that the court\u2019s comments suggested to the jury that the money found on the defendant had belonged to the victim and thus that the court had expressed its opinion that the defendant was guilty of the offense charged. The motion was denied. Shortly thereafter, the cross-examination of the witness was completed. The trial judge then addressed the jury as set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Again, dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ing his charge the trial judge instructed the jury that \u201cif through any indication or acts on my part, you might feel I lean a certain way, you are to disregard any thought that I have any opinion in this case, because I haven\u2019t. It\u2019s not my job.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">It is clear that the trial judge realized the impropriety of his remark to the defendant\u2019s counsel and took great pains to impress upon the jury that they should disregard it. We cannot say that these emphatic and repeated admonitions were not sufficient to accomplish that purpose. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leventhal, </em>364 Mass. 718, 723-724 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>352 Mass. 218, 226-228, cert. den. sub nom. <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>389 U. S. 916 <em>(1967); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>360 Mass. 404, 409 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>363 Mass. 513, 520-522 (1973). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 869 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">2. The defendant testified in his own behalf and produced two alibi witnesses. Prior to the imposition of sentence, and after reviewing the defendant\u2019s record, the trial judge remarked: \u201cI don\u2019t see a flicker of hope for him.\u201d The prosecuting attorney recommended six to nine years at Walpole, and the judge then sentenced the defendant to that term saying, \u201cI am not punishing this boy one minute for trying his case, but I am punishing him for coming up here and lying and for his whole attitude.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The sentencing judge may take into consideration a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>large variety of factors, including the defendant\u2019s demeanor at the trial (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Celeste, </em>358 Mass. 307, 309-310 [1970]) \u2014although it often happens that the information set out in a probation report will provide the judge with a better picture of the defendant than the judge\u2019s own observations during the course of the trial. See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>United States, </em>419 F. 2d 264, 271 (D.C. Cir. 1969). But the considerations are not unlimited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>369 Mass. 608, 609 (1976); <em>S. C. </em>365 Mass. 74, 78, 82 (1974). And, \u201cpunishing him for coming up here and lying\u201d seems to us improper. In effect, the sentence includes a punishment for perjury though the defendant had not been indicted for perjury (see <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>8 Gray 329, 342-345 [1857]) and though no such charge had been proved at a criminal trial. The point has been well put in Judge Craven\u2019s separate opinion in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>484 F. 2d 1284, 1288 (4th Cir. 1973): \u201cSince the offence of perjury is properly punishable in a separate criminal proceeding, to allow a summary adjudication of guilt by the court denies the defendant every constitutional and procedural safeguard to which he is entitled and which is inherent in indictment and trial. This is judgment by hunch \u2014 without accusation and without opportunity to defend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Further, such a practice must inevitably chill a defendant\u2019s right to testify in his own defense. Indeed, it puts a particularly heavy burden on a claim of alibi by which a defendant most unequivocally places his credibility at issue. Judge Bazelon, in the <em>Scott </em>case, 419 F. 2d at 269, puts the matter thus: \u201cOf course a defendant has no constitutional right to lie, however much we may sympathize with his too human temptation. But the defendant does have a right to testify in his own defense. In doing so, he risks the jury\u2019s disbelief. If he in fact fails to convince the jurors, conviction and punishment will follow. If the Government for whatever reason concludes that prosecution for perjury is appropriate, he risks punishment for that as well. To allow the trial judge to impose still further pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ishment because he too disbelieves the defendant would needlessly discourage the accused from testifying in his own behalf.\u201d The <em>Scott </em>case has been cited with approval in <em>Poteet </em>v. <em>Fauver, </em>517 F. 2d 393, 396 (3d Cir. 1975), <em>State </em>v. <em>Poteet, </em>61 N. J. 493, 496 (1972), <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>391 Mich. 419, 423 (1974), <em>People </em>v. <em>White, </em>130 Ill. App. 2d 775, 778 (1971), and <em>People </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>22 Ill. App. 3d 788, 797 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Compare <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 F. 2d 916, 917-918 (1st Cir. 1968), in which the court remanded for re-sentencing because the trial judge, after the defendant had been found guilty and before imposing sentence, asked the defendant whether he was in fact guilty. The court held that this was an improper inquiry because it might jeopardize the defendant\u2019s appellate and other postconviction rights. We think the analogous burden on the defendant\u2019s right to testify in his own behalf arising from the danger that a trial judge might determine that the defendant was lying should likewise preclude the use of that determination in sentencing. We see little difference between a greater sentence imposed because a defendant refused to expiate, by confessing before sentencing, what the trial judge considered a false claim of innocence and a greater sentence imposed specifically for what the trial judge believed was lying during the trial. Both practices would burden a defendant\u2019s rights. And though the rights involved are somewhat different we cannot say which are more worthy of protection. See the <em>Poteet </em>cases (61 N. J. at 495-496; 517 F. 2d at 395-396), in which the vice of a greater sentence because a defendant has not confessed after trial is treated as corollary to the vice of a greater sentence because the trial judge believed the defendant has committed perjury. But compare <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 F. 2d 941 (5th Cir. 1966), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nunn, </em>525 F. 2d 958, 960-961 (5th Cir. 1976), in which the Fifth Circuit appears to have treated these sentencing considerations separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The Second Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hendrix, </em>505 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>F. 2d 1233 (2d Cir. 1974), cert. den. 423 U. S. 897 (1975), has, with other courts,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> refused to follow the <em>Scott </em>case. But even in the <em>Hendrix </em>case, the court held that a sentencing judge should not take into consideration his belief that a defendant was lying unless the judge had made the determination beyond a reasonable doubt. This may go part way in answering Judge Craven\u2019s objection, quoted above, that sentencing on the basis of such a belief is \u201cjudgment by hunch\u201d; it does not meet the point that a defendant is entitled to a determination beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury and not by a judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor, in our view, does it sufficiently obviate the burden thus put on the right to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Although \u201cit is not a function of this court to review an otherwise lawful sentence which is within the limits of the applicable statutory provisions ..., where it appears as it does here that a defendant was sentenced for a crime other than that of which he was convicted it is within the appellate power of this court to vacate the sentence and to take steps necessary to correct the error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>365 Mass. 74, 81 (1974); S. <em>C. </em>369 Mass. 608 (1976). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>2 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Ct. 113, 119 (1974). Accordingly, we remand the case to the Superior Court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-10\"> \u201c...

And I send a lot of people to Concord because I think they can be rehabilitated, but to send him there would cause difficulty and trouble there.
