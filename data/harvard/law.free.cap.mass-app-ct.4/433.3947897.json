The contract contained an arbitration clause which we set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ***VThe contract also specified that final payment from the plaintiff to the defendant was due on June 21, 1966. As the result of a dispute arising out of the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the work was not properly performed, final payment was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The defendant first made demand for arbitration on May 8,1972, after an action it brought in a District Court was dismissed for failure to comply with the contractual requirement of a decision of an arbitrator as a condition precedent to an action at law. The plaintiff \u201cappeared specially\u201d before the arbitrator and moved to dismiss the arbitration proceeding on the ground that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction, as the defendant\u2019s demand for arbitration was not timely. The arbitrator denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The plaintiff then brought this action in the Superior Court, seeking a judgment declaring that as the demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>for arbitration was delayed beyond the contract time limit (the time when final payment was due), it was not within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and that arbitration was thereby precluded. The defendant\u2019s answer contained a prayer that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cbill be dismissed\u201d and that a decree issue \u201cdeclaring that arbitration take place between the parties.\u201d The case was submitted on an \u201cagreed statement of facts\u201d to a Superior Court judge, who entered the judgment which is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s brief states a single issue in the form of a question. \u201cIs a party to a contract containing an arbitration clause requiring demand for arbitration within a definite time entitled to arbitration if demand is made after the definite time has elapsed?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The defendant asks us to defer to the arbitrator\u2019s decision, noting that \u201c[i]f an arbitrator has committed an error of law or fact in arriving at his decision, a court will not upset the finding unless there is fraud involved.\u201d <em>Trustees of Boston &amp; Maine Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy. </em>363 Mass. 386, 390 (1973). As we noted in <em>School Comm. of Hanover </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 155 (1975), <em>S. C. </em>369 Mass. 683, 685 (1976), \u201cWhether an arbitrator acted beyond the scope of his authority is \u2018a question which is always open for judicial review.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AK2\">The plaintiff argues that \u201ctime of final payment\u201d in the context of the arbitration clause means the time set in the contract when the final payment was due, whether or not such payment has actually been made. Thus, it argues, that as there was no demand for arbitration made by June 21, 1966, the defendant may neither obtain arbitration of the contractual dispute nor bring an action on the contract, as the contract requires a decision of the arbitrator as a condition precedent to such action. See <em>Reynolds Jamaica Mines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>La Societe Navale Caennaise, </em>239 F. 2d 689, 694 (4th Cir. 1956). The last paragraph of the arbitration clause (fn. 1) strongly imports that the parties contemplated that demands for arbitration would be made while the work was in progress and not years later. We have found no Massachusetts decision construing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>meaning of \u201ctime of final payment.\u201d The plaintiff directs our attention to two cases which considered an arbitration provision similar to the one in the present contract, <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Freidman, </em>72 Cal. App. 2d 726 (1946), and <em>Duke Labs. Inc. </em>v. <em>Albert A. Lutz Co. Inc. </em>9 Misc. 2d 779 (N.Y. 1957). The phrases \u201ctime of final payment\u201d in <em>Jordan </em>and \u201cdate of final payment\u201d in <em>Duke Labs, </em>were construed to mean the time set in the contract for final payment, and the courts held that the form of notice of demand for arbitration sent prior to that time failed to satisfy contractual procedural requirements. Demands delivered subsequent to that time, even when treated as in satisfactory form, were held to be too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The defendant has argued, without citation of any authority, that application of this accepted interpretation of \u201ctime of final payment\u201d as the time specified in the contract for final payment would deprive it of any meaningful opportunity to demand arbitration under some circumstances. The record before us contains none of the other contractual provisions, nor any agreed facts from which the due date of the final payment may have been determined. We know only that the parties have agreed that that date was June 21, 1966. Neither does the record disclose how much time elapsed between the onset of the dispute and June 21. On this record we need not reach the question whether the parties might have a reasonable time after June 21 to demand arbitration of a dispute not known to them before that date. We choose to follow the interpretation of \u201ctime of final payment\u201d established in the <em>Jordan </em>and <em>Duke Labs, </em>cases, which we consider to be the proper one. See also <em>Diesel Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart Tenants Corp. </em>33 Misc. 2d 1090 (N.Y. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Thus, the defendant\u2019s demand for arbitration in 1972 was almost six years too late and should not have been allowed. The judgment is reversed, and a new judgment is to be entered which precludes arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\"> <em>\u201cARTICLE 26.

It is mutually agreed that the decision of the arbitrators shall be a condition precedent to any right of legal action that either party may have against the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\u201cNotice of the demand for arbitration of a dispute shall be filed in writing with the other party to the contract.

The arbitrators shall fix their own compensation, unless otherwise provided by agreement, and shall assess the costs and charges of the proceedings upon either or both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">\u201cAll arbitration proceedings shall take place at the conclusion of the work. The Contractor shall not cause a delay of the work by reason of any dispute with the Owner and the Owner shall not withhold any payments by reason of any dispute with the Contractor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
