The patrolmen refused, citing Rule 25(10) of the Rules and Regulations of the Boston police department which, as then in effect, provided that a patrolman should not permit any person other than an \u201cofficer of rank\u201d to ride in a patrol car except in the event of an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The patrolmen appealed from the order to the defendant, who denied the appeal. On January 30, 1975, the plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction in the Superior Court, enjoining the defendant from enforcing the order given them by the lieutenant. On January 31, 1975, the defendant amended Rule 25(10) so as to permit civilians to ride in patrol cars when \u201cauthorized by the Police Commissioner.\u201d On June 3, 1975, the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to the amended rule was allowed by a judge of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">1. The plaintiffs\u2019 principal contention is that the defendant\u2019s amendment of Rule 25 (10), without giving notice or affording anyone the opportunity of commenting on the rule change, was an unlawful exercise of his rule-making authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no merit to this contention. The defendant had authority to organize and administer the police department. See <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>368 Mass. 33, 34, n.1 (1975), cert. den. 423 U. S. 1048 (1976). Moreover, the defendant has extremely broad rule-making power under St. 1962, c. 322, \u00a7 11: \u201cThe police commissioner shall have cognizance and control of the government, administration, disposition and discipline of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>the department, and of the police force of the department and shall make all needful rules and regulations for the efficiency of said police____\u201d See <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>367 Mass. 368, 371 (1975). The police department is not an \u201cagency\u201d as defined in the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a71(2), so its rule-making process need not conform to the procedural requirements set forth in that act. Compare <em>Brignoli </em>v. <em>Boston, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 829 (1973). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant did not exceed his rule-making authority in amending Rule 25(10). The plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that the defendant was required to give them notice and an opportunity to be heard is rejected, as no such process is required. See <em>Brignoli </em>v. <em>Boston, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">2. The judge did not err in allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, as there was no dispute as to any material fact. Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 553-556 (1976). However, the action should not have been dismissed, as the parties were entitled to a declaration of the validity of the rule as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The judgment is to be modified by striking out the provision for dismissal and inserting in place thereof a declaration of the validity of Rule 25 (10) as amended on January 31, 1975, and, as so modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> The plaintiffs expressly state in their brief that they do not raise any \u201cissues of constitutionality or statutory authority behind the enactment of the \u2018new\u2019 Rule 25(10).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
