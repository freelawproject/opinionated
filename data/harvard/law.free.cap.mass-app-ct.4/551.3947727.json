L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 289; Mass.R.Civ.P. 81 [b], 365 Mass. 841 [1974]), of a vote of the defendant Boston Redevelopment Authority (authority) authorizing the redevelopment (G. L. c. 121A; St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7\u00a7 12-14) of a parcel of land in the so called West End of Boston. The cases were tried together in the Superior Court, and judgments were entered for the defendants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">On July 22, 1975, the defendants Winchester and Gallagher, as general partners of the Blacks tone Company (the developer), a limited partnership (see G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 18C; St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13A [inserted by St. 1965, c. 859, \u00a7 3], as amended), applied to the authority for authoriza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>tion and approval of a redevelopment \u201cproject\u201d (G. L. c. 121 A, \u00a7 1). The proposed project was and is for the construction, operation and maintenance of a single building on Blossom Street in Boston. The site contains 28,344 square feet (approximately 0.6 acres) of land and is presently occupied by a building known as the Blackstone school, formerly in use but now abandoned and in an advanced state of disrepair.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">The developer proposes to erect on the site a fourteen-story building containing 176 dwelling units and 14,000 square feet of commercial space. The dwelling units would be for the use of elderly (including elderly handicapped) persons; the proposed plans for the units incorporate features specifically designed for the needs of such persons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">A public hearing was held on August 27, 1975. On September 25, 1975, the authority issued a \u201cReport and Decision\u201d which, in all material respects, approved the application. See St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13 (sixth paragraph), as appearing in St. 1965, c. 859, \u00a7 2; G. L. c. 121 A, \u00a7 6. The authority found that the project area was a \u201cblighted open area\u201d and a \u201cdecadent area\u201d as those terms are defined in G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 1. It took note of the shortage of suitable housing accommodations for elderly persons of low and moderate incomes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It found that the project \u201cwill not cause any significant damage to the environment as defined by Chapter 30, Section 61, of the General Laws____\u201d The authority also granted permission for the developers to deviate from certain requirements of the City of Boston Zoning Code and from the State Building Code, as the developer had requested in its application. See St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13 (ninth paragraph).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>The vote of the authority approving the application was approved by the mayor of Boston on September 30, 1975. On October 1, 1975, the authority filed a certificate of its vote with the Boston city clerk. See St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13, as amended (penultimate paragraph) (note 8, infra). The present actions under \u00a7 13 (see and compare G. L. c. 121 A, \u00a7 6C, inserted by St. 1975, c. 827, \u00a7 5) were filed on October 30 and 31,1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">1. So far as appears from the consolidated record, the plaintiffs in both cases are nearby property owners or lessees. The Shriners\u2019 Hospital for Crippled Children (hospital) abuts the project site on the north. The individual defendants are the general partners of several limited partnerships which, together with two of the corporate plaintiffs, were organized pursuant to the redevelopment of the West End area of Boston during the 1960\u2019s. The other corporate plaintiffs operate certain business establishments in the immediate vicinity of the project site. The record does not indicate which (if any) of the various partnerships (or corporations) own (or lease) land that directly abuts the project site.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The Superior Court determined that the plaintiffs had no standing to challenge the action of the authority in approving the project but held that the plaintiffs did have standing to challenge the authority\u2019s action with respect to the deviations granted from the City of Boston Zoning Code and the State Building Code, and with respect to the issue of compliance with G. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 62, regarding environmental impact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are of the opinion that the hospital has standing to challenge all of the actions of the authority leading to the approval of the project, and as it will not affect the outcome of the cases, we need not decide whether the other plaintiffs have like standing. For the purposes of this case, we assume that they have. Section 13 of St. 1960, c. 652, as amended,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>provides that within thirty days following the filing of the vote of the authority, \u201cany person, whether previously a party to the proceeding or not, who is aggrieved by such vote... may file a petition ... for a writ of certiorari against the authority to correct errors of law therein.\u201d It is settled that the term \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d is \u201cto be given a comprehensive meaning.\u201d <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>343 Mass. 375, 381 (1961) (construing \u00a7 13). See <em>Marotta </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Revere, </em>336 Mass. 199, 204 (1957) (construing analogous language appearing in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21). The property on which the hospital is situated abuts the development site; shadows cast by the proposed structure will fall upon parts of the hospital, and any other impact on the environment would be likely to affect directly the hospital property and the persons occupying it; the variances from the city zoning code and deviations from the State building code granted to the developers are subjects of proper concern to the hospital for the reason stated by the trial court \u2014 erroneous action in these areas would cause direct injury to the property interests of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">2. The plaintiffs submit that the authority abused its discretion in selecting the Blackstone Company as the developer of the site. Their argument on that point is based not on the qualifications of the developers or on alleged inadequacies of the proposal but rather on the fact that the size of the parcel (approximately 0.6 acres) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>so small that a decision to develop the site pursuant to c. 121A violates the intent and purpose of the redevelopment laws. The short answer to that contention is that this court will not \u201csit in review on the size of a particular project area.\u201d <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>348 U. S. 26, 35 (1954). Our review of G. L. c. 121A and of St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 13, discloses no indication of a legislative intent to prescribe a minimum (or maximum) size of an area which may be redeveloped thereunder. See especially the definitions and declaration of public necessity set forth in G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2. To the contrary, the clear intent of the statutes is to permit the appropriate redevelopment agency, within the broad and comprehensive guidelines delineated, to approve (or disapprove) proposed projects for any area, provided that the area is found to be a \u201cblighted open,\u201d \u201cdecadent,\u201d or \u201csubstandard\u201d area, and provided also that the proposed project meets the \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement of G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 2. See <em>Stockus </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>304 Mass. 507, 509-510 (1939); <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Authy. </em>349 Mass. 553, 561 (1965), cert. den. 382 U. S. 983 (1966). See also <em>Allydonn Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Holyoke Housing Authy. </em>304 Mass. 288, 291 (1939). In the present cases it is undisputed that the proposed project \u2014 the construction of a substantial number of dwelling units for elderly persons with low and moderate incomes \u2014 serves a public purpose and is designed to fulfill a demonstrated need.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The statutory framework enables the appropriate redevelopment agency to consider the unique characteristics of each site in making its determinations. Several unique characteristics of the Blackstone site should be noted. The site is irregularly shaped; the building currently on the site \u2014 a school building \u2014 is abandoned, and has been unused for many years; the site abuts (and part of it was originally included within) the West End Land Assembly and Redevelopment Project, a comparatively large area previously found by the authority to be a blighted open, decadent, and substandard area. Thus, the redevelopment of the Blackstone site can be seen, not as the isolation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>one small parcel for redevelopment but as a slight expansion of a larger redevelopment site, reflective of changed conditions in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">3. The plaintiffs challenge the sufficiency of the findings made by the authority in its report. The substance of their argument is that the findings (which are reproduced in the margin <footnotemark>9</footnotemark>) amount to little more than \u201ca mere repeti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>tion\" of the statutory words____\u201d <em>Prusik </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>262 Mass. 451, 457-458 (1928). Having carefully reviewed the entire consolidated record, we agree with the determination of the Superior Court that the findings are supported by the record and are sufficient to permit redevelopment under G. L. c. 121A.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">An analysis of the subsidiary findings reveals that they are not extensively detailed and that they do in fact incorporate language from the definitions of \u201cBlighted open area\u201d and \u201cDecadent area\u201d appearing in G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 1. Such incorporation, standing alone, would, as the plaintiffs contend, be insufficient as a matter of law to substantiate a determination that a particular site was \u201cblighted\u201d or \u201cdecadent.\u201d However, the findings here clearly go beyond a bare repetition of statutory language, and specific reasons underlying the authority\u2019s conclusions have been set forth. A detailed engineering report on the soil and subsurface conditions fully supports the finding of \u201cunsuitable subsoil conditions.\u201d The building plans disclose the irregular shape of the site. Photographs of the Blackstone school building as it now stands, together with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>other documentary evidence, show the deterioration and abandonment of that structure. The plaintiffs\u2019 attack on the fourth \u201cblighted open area\u201d finding is an attempt to isolate that finding from its context and does not merit extensive discussion. The finding that business and economic conditions in the area have changed substantially (which the plaintiffs do not dispute) serves primarily to explain why the use of the site as a school, as was intended when the site was omitted from the earlier extensive West End redevelopment, has been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">4. The plaintiffs next contend that the authority abused its discretion in granting certain deviations from the City of Boston Zoning Code for the Blackstone project.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Under the ninth paragraph of St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 859, \u00a7 2, the authority, with the approval of the mayor of Boston, is given exclusive power to grant deviations from zoning, building, health or fire standards in effect in Boston. The plaintiffs recognize, as they must, that the standards for granting deviations under that section are less restrictive than those governing the granting of variances under the zoning laws. Compare St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13, with G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10 (inserted by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3). Compare <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Emergency Housing Commn. </em>330 Mass. 693, 697-698 (1953) (construing a standard under St. 1946, c. 592, substantially identical to that contained in St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13), with <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport, </em>356 Mass. 37, 40-41 (1969), and <em>Damaskos </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>359 Mass. 55, 60-61 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The questions concerning the several deviations granted by the authority \u201care primarily questions of fact although they may become questions of law. Insofar as they remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>in the realm of fact they are matters for the... [authority] to determine.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Emergency Housing Commn., supra, </em>at 698. In a proceeding seeking relief in the nature of certiorari our duty is to ascertain whether the reasons given by the authority in support of its determination, as they appear in the authority\u2019s answer, are erroneous as a matter of law. See <em>Norcross </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>255 Mass. 177, 186 (1926). \u201cWith their soundness in point of fact we have nothing to do.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It is unnecessary to recite here the respective reasons underlying the granting of the various deviations. It is sufficient to say that in each instance the reasons given are adequate as a matter of law and (as mandated by St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13) do not substantially derogate from the intent and purposes of the City of Boston Zoning Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">5. The plaintiffs also challenge the power of the authority to grant deviations from the State Building Code. See G. L. c. 23B, \u00a7\u00a7 16-23. The State Building Code became effective on January 1, 1975. St. 1972, c. 802, \u00a7 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that the State Building Code Appeals Board (G. L. c. 23B, \u00a7 23) has the exclusive power to grant such deviations. Further support for this contention is to be found in St. 1972, c. 802, \u00a7 67 (\u201c[s]aid code shall be binding and have the full force and effect of law on January... [1, 1975], <em>in all cities and towns notwithstanding any special or general law to the </em>contrary\u201d [emphasis supplied]), and in \u00a7 75 (as amended by St. 1975, c. 144, \u00a7 1) (\u201c[a] 11 by-laws and ordinances of cities and towns or regulations promulgated by any state boards, commissions, agencies or departments or any special acts... in conflict with the state building code shall cease to be effective on January... [1, 1975]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The above quoted sections, together with the whole of c. 802 and its subsequent amendments, evince a clear legislative intent, as the Superior Court found, to create uniform standards throughout the Commonwealth for the construction of buildings and materials used therein and to provide both a uniform enforcement procedure and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>exclusive appeals procedure. We agree with the determination of the Superior Court that the relevant provisions of St. 1972, c. 802, were intended to supersede those provisions of St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13, which had given the authority the power to grant deviations \u201cfrom any ... building... code... in effect in Boston ...\u201d and on which the authority purported to base its vote. See <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>299 Mass. 321, 324 (1938); <em>Rennert </em>v. <em>Trustees of State Colleges, </em>363 Mass. 740, 743-744 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Although he indicated his agreement with the plaintiffs\u2019 position on this issue, the Superior Court judge did not order that the vote of the authority purporting to grant these variances be quashed. Instead, the judge ruled that the issue was moot (see fn. 4, <em>supra), </em>based on the representations made at trial by counsel for the developer and the authority \u201cthat the only deviations which will be incorporated ... into the Blackstone project will be those deviations which have been approved by <em>both </em>the State Building Code Appeals Board and the respondent Authority\u201d (emphasis in original). On this point we disagree with the Superior Court. The issue is not moot. See <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Welfare, </em>367 Mass. 293, 297-300 (1975). The representations made by counsel at trial do not relieve the court of its duty, in an action seeking relief in the nature of certiorari, to review any alleged errors of law. The determination of the Superior Court that the provisions of St. 1972, c. 802, superseded those of St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13, with which we agree, was in effect a determination that the action of the authority purportedly granting those variances was an error of law. Such a determination required that the action of the authority be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">6. Our decision in part 5 of this opinion, <em>supra, </em>renders it unnecessary to consider the issues raised in part VI of the plaintiffs\u2019 brief, as they are premised on a determination that the authority had the power to grant variances from the State Building Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">7. Finally, the plaintiffs allege error in the finding by the authority that no significant environmental damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>would be caused by the project.* 123456789*<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In its report the authority stated that it \u201cha[d] made an environmental analysis evaluating the [pjroject\u201d and went on to enumerate specific findings (see findings 1-9 set out in fn. 11) on the issue of environmental damage. The authority concluded \u201cthat the Project will not cause any significant damage to the environment as defined by... [G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 61<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>and finds that no further action need be taken in this regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The authority\u2019s answer asserts that \u201cthe Environmental Assessment of the Project has been completed by the authority and the MHFA, and a joint report has been filed... with the Secretary of Environmental Affairs.\u201d (See fn. 11.) So far as appears from the record, the \u201creport\u201d alluded to appears to be a document entitled \u201cEnvironmental Impact Statement,\u201d prepared for the developer by a private consultant. The findings contained in that \u201creport\u201d are consistent with those made by the authority. It appears that the \u201creport\u201d was submitted to the developer in January of 1975, more than three months before the developer submitted its application to the authority. The filing of the document with the Secretary of Environmental Affairs forms the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge. The plaintiffs characterize the document filed as a report of the type required in certain circumstances by G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We take this to allude to the second paragraph of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The plaintiffs acknowledge the existence of the remedy provided in G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62, to review allegedly improper determinations regarding environmental impact (see the final paragraph of \u00a7 62, [fn. 13]; <em>Secretary of Environmental Affairs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy. </em>366 Mass. 755, 761-762 [1975] [hereinafter the <em>Massport </em>case]). The plaintiffs also recognize that the function of the court in a proceeding seeking relief in the nature of certiorari is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ordinarily limited to a determination of whether an error of law is apparent on the record. <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Carlisle, </em>369 Mass. 755, 757 (1976). Thus, the plaintiffs do not attack directly the environmental findings made by the authority but assert that an error of law is nevertheless apparent. The essence of their argument, as we perceive it, is that if the authority, as it did here, makes a determination of no significant environmental damage (a so called \u201cnegative assessment\u201d), no.report of any kind need be filed with the Secretary of Environmental Affairs under \u00a7 62. See the <em>Massport </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at 768. Hence, the plaintiffs argue, the fact that a report was filed in this case is tantamount to determination that the project will cause significant environmental damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">There is no merit to that argument. General Laws c. 30, \u00a7 62 (see fn. 13), requires an authority to prepare an environmental impact report only in the case of any work, project, or activity \u201cwhich may cause damage to the environment.\u201d By definition (G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 61, second par. [see fn. 12]) such damage does not include \u201cany insignificant damage to or impairment of\u201d the environment. \u201c[T]he threshold of potential environmental damage to warrant an impact statement... is minimal.\u201d The <em>Massport </em>case, 366 Mass. at 768-769. The authority made subsidiary findings of fact which determined \u201cthat the project will not cause any significant damage to the environment as defined by c. 30, \u00a7 61, of the General Laws, and [found] that no further action need be taken in this regard\u201d (fn. 11). See the <em>Massport </em>case, 366 Mass. at 767-768.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Not only are those findings supported by the consultant\u2019s \u201creport,\u201d but there is nothing in that \u201creport\u201d which would support a conclusion to the contrary, and the plaintiffs do not contend otherwise. It also appears that an environmental assessment of the project was filed with the Secretary of Environmental Affairs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That assessment was not included in the record before us. The plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>argument concedes that there was such a filing but, as stated above, questions whether the statement concluded with a \u201cnegative determination.\u201d While the consultant\u2019s \u201creport\u201d might well have been sufficient in form and content as an impact report (or a draft of one), the Superior Court reached the conclusion that the consultant\u2019s report was used by the authority merely to support its negative assessment. We concur in that conclusion. It appears to us that the document filed should be characterized as a supportive document rather than as a true \u201cenvironmental impact report\u201d of the type contemplated by \u00a7 62. A true \u00a7 62 report would be required only upon a threshold determination of at least minimal environmental damage. That threshold was not crossed in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In sum, the authority made the determination that the project would not cause significant environmental damage, as defined by the second paragraph of \u00a7 61 (see fn. 12). There is nothing in the record which indicates that that determination was erroneous as a matter of law. Therefore, preparation of a draft or final environmental impact report under \u00a7 62 was not required. The decision of the authority to file the supportive document, even though such filing was not required by \u00a7 62, was not an error of law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">As we have determined that the action of the authority purporting to grant deviations from the State Building Code was an error of law (see part 5 of this opinion), the judgments entered in the Superior Court (see note 4, <em>supra) </em>cannot stand. If the action of the authority approving the project had consisted of several distinct parts, we would order quashed only that part concerning the State Building Code deviations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>3 Mass. 268, 270 (1807); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blue-Hill Tpke. Corp. </em>5 Mass. 420, 422-424 <em>(1809); Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>West Boston Bridge, </em>13 Pick. 195, 196-198 (1832). However, as the vote of the authority approving the project was unitary, and as the granting of the deviations was integral to that approval, the vote of the authority as it now stands must be quashed. See <em>Dwight </em>v. <em>City Council of Springfield, 4 </em>Gray 107, 110 (1855). The judgments of the Superior Court are vacated. However, as the developers and the authority represented to the Superior Court that the only deviations from the State Building Code which will be incorporated into the project will be those approved by both the State Building Code Appeals Board and the authority, we believe that an opportunity should be afforded to obtain such approvals. See <em>Village on the Hill, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authy. </em>348 Mass. 107, 119-120 (1964), cert. den. 380 U. S. 955 (1965); <em>Kelloway </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Melrose, </em>361 Mass. 249, 257-258 (1972). The Superior Court is to retain jurisdiction of the cases for the entry of judgments in accordance with this opinion, first affording the developer an opportunity to secure from the board variances from the requirements of the State Building Code (G. L. c. 23B, \u00a7 23), and the approval of any such variances by the authority. The times within which such approvals are to be sought and of all further proceedings in these cases are to be in the discretion of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-12\"> The court entered the following judgment in each case: \u201cJudgment for defendants subject to respondents\u2019 compliance with the determination of both the State Building Code Appeals Board and the Boston Redevelopment Authority with respect to the proposed variances from the State Building Code.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\"> From the evidence before us it appears that the developer had sought and obtained the cooperation of nearby property owners, including at least some of the plaintiffs, in arriving at the final proposal.

This Project specifically responds to that need and assurance by providing housing for many of those who were forced to leave their homes during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">\u201cAs has been noted above, the conditions which are causing the blight and deterioration are not being remedied by the ordinary means of private or public enterprise. These conditions warrant the carrying out of the Project in accordance with Chapter 121A of the General Laws and the proposed construction, operation, and maintenance of decent, safe, and sanitary housing and commercial facilities proposed by the Applicants in their Application constitutes a \u2018Project\u2019 within the meaning of that law. The purpose of Chapter 121A and Chapter 652 of the Acts of 1960 will be met by this Project. The demand for such housing for elderly individuals and elderly couples at rent levels below those which the conventional operations of the real estate market produce, is, as a matter of common knowledge, intense. Construction of the units and facilities proposed for the Project Area will serve to alleviate this intense demand, and will, in addition, encourage the conservation and improvement of the area.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\"> The deviations sought by the developer in its application and granted by the authority included deviations from use requirements to permit retail business establishments on the lower floors of the proposed building, as well as several deviations from various dimensional requirements, such as reductions of usable open space per each dwelling unit, reduction of front and side yard requirements, reduction of setbacks, and reduction of off-street parking facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b582-4\"> \u201cENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS \u201cIn conformance with the provisions of Sections 61 and 62 of Chapter 30 of the General Laws, as inserted by Chapter 781 of the Acts of 1972, and the Regulations thereunder as adopted by the Authority on April 11, 1974, the Authority has made an environmental analysis evaluating the Project, which contains the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">1. The Project will have virtually no effect on the site which it occupies, causing no land or soil erosion and no change in the ground water level;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">2.

There will be no impact in terms of increasing the load on existing infrastructure facilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">5. There will be minimal car ownership by those occupying the Project, therefore, there will be virtually no impact on the present amount of traffic in the area and there will be no substantial increase in the amount of air pollution generated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">6. The Project will not increase the noise levels in the surrounding environment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">7. The Project will have no effect on the quality of Boston\u2019s water supply, nor will it have any effect on the quality of the water of the Charles River;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-12\">8. The Project will require deviations from the State Building Code as noted below, but not in such manner as will cause damage to the environment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-13\">9. The Project does not result in the generation of a significant amount of noise or dust, except during the construction period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">\u201cThe Authority therefore concludes that the Project will cause only minimal damage to the environment, and that all feasible measures have been taken to avoid or minimize said impact. The Environmental Assessment of the Project has been completed by the Authority and the MHFA, and a joint report has been filed by the Authority and the MHFA with the Secretary of Environmental Affairs. The Authority hereby determines that the Project will not cause <em>any significant damage to the environment </em>as defined by Chapter 30, Section 61, of the General Laws, and finds that no further action need be taken in this regard\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b582-16\"> The second paragraph of G.
