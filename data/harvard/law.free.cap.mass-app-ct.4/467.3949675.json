In the spring and summer of 1974 the building inspector issued the necessary building permits. After hearings called to air the complaints of various residents, the board of appeals revoked the permits for three of the four developments in two decisions rendered in November, 1974. Two of the cases are appeals by the plaintiff under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a721,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from those decisions. The third is an action for declaratory relief, brought by the plaintiff against the building inspector in the belief that the latter intended to revoke the permits for the fourth development. The three cases were heard together in the Superior Court on a stipulation of facts amounting to a case stated, and judgments were entered favorable to the plaintiff in each case. The appeals to this court were taken by the complaining residents;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> neither the board of appeals nor the building inspector has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s parcels of land are shown on a plan which was endorsed by the planning board, \u201capproval under the Subdivision Control Law not required,\u201d on December 22, 1971.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P. Most of the lots shown on the parcels are of the \u201cpork chop\u201d variety, connected to Cambridge Street by long, narrow strips of land twenty feet in width. At that time Nantucket did not have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>zoning by-law; and the plaintiff\u2019s position throughout this litigation has been that, because his plan received the endorsement of the planning board before a zoning by-law took effect, he is entitled to the protections afforded by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 5A and 7A, against the application of pertinent provisions of the present zoning by-law to his proposed condominium developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The zoning by-law was adopted in May, 1972, and as amended through 1974, when the building permits in question were issued, classified the plaintiff\u2019s parcels in the \u201cresidential 2\u201d zone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The only private use permitted in that zone as of right is single family detached dwellings together with accessory buildings (subject to certain yard requirements), one of which may contain another dwelling unit. The applicable density or intensity regulations require lots to have 20,000 square feet of area,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 75 feet of frontage, 20 feet of front yard, a maximum 20 per cent \u201cground coverage ratio,\u201d and a maximum 40 per cent \u201cfloor area ratio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In addition to single family detached dwellings, permitted as of right, it may be (the point is not argued<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>that cluster developments are permissible by special exception in the residential 2 zone. Such developments require, among other things, that the tract be not less than 10 acres, that the number of lots not exceed the number of lots upon which dwellings could otherwise be constructed on the tract, that there be no more than 8 dwelling units per acre, and that lots contain 10,000 square feet and have (subject to an exception not material) 50 feet of frontage on a public or private way, a minimum front yard of 15 feet, and a minimum width at the building of 50 feet. A further requirement is that at least 65 percent of the tract be open land, and that the area of open land, when added to the areas of all lots smaller than those permitted as of right in the zone, be not less than the number of such lots multiplied by the minimum number of square feet required in the zone for a buildable lot. It is thus apparent that the area requirements for dwellings in cluster developments cannot be less than, and may exceed, those applicable to single family dwellings in the same zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s first development, which has in fact been built under the still outstanding building permit, occupies the smaller of the two parcels.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It contains seven one- and-a-half story, single-family detached dwellings. The parcel contains 107,337 square feet and has 358 feet of frontage on Cambridge Street. The second development is planned to have eight such dwellings, occupying a portion<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the larger parcel containing 138,148 square feet and 100 feet of frontage. The third development would have nine dwellings on another portion<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> containing 186,541 square feet and 120 feet of frontage. The fourth would have eight dwellings on the remaining portion<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> containing 150,773 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>square feet and 223 feet of frontage. Although all of the developments fall well within the front yard, ground coverage ratio, and floor area ratio requirements of the zoning by-law, it is clear that none is in compliance with both the area requirement and the frontage requirement of either the single family detached dwelling intensity regulation<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or the cluster development intensity regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">We turn to the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the second paragraph of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7A,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> affords his land protection against the application of those provisions of the zoning by-law. In <em>Bellows Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Acton, </em>364 Mass. 253, 260 (1973), the protection afforded by the second paragraph of \u00a7 7A to \u201cthe use of the land\u201d shown on a plan endorsed \u201capproval not required\u201d was held to mean \u201cprotection only against the elimination of or reduction in the kinds of uses which were permitted when the plan was submitted to the planning board.\u201d The second paragraph was held not to include protection against the application of dimensional and density requirements to land shown in the plan, at least where such requirements \u201c[do] not constitute or otherwise amount to a total or virtual prohibition of the use of the locus for\u201d a purpose permitted at the time of submission of the plan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>Ibid. </em>Contrast <em>Rayco Investment Corp. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Raynham, </em>368 Mass. 385, 389-390 (1975). It follows that, in the present cases, the protection afforded by \u00a7 7A to the plaintiff\u2019s parcels goes only so far as to permit his use of the land for a \u201ccondominium development\u201d (which the plaintiff contends is a multi-family use) in the face of the 1974 zoning by-law restricting the zone in which the plaintiff\u2019s parcels lie to single-family use. Section 7A does not protect those developments from the dimensional and intensity requirements of the 1974 by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The plaintiff attempts to distinguish the <em>Bellows Farms </em>case on the ground that the increased intensity requirements held applicable in that case expressly applied to apartment houses in a zone where apartments were a permitted use. By contrast, he argues, the defendants are seeking to have us apply intensity requirements intended for single-family, detached dwellings to a multi-family use. The plaintiff\u2019s contention is that, under the protection of \u00a7 7A, he may devote his land to a multi-family use, and that the zoning by-law prescribes no intensity requirements whatever for such a use.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">This argument, if accepted, would result in the anomaly that the protection afforded by \u00a7 7A to a use forbidden in a zone would be broader than the protection it affords to a use permitted in the zone. The latter would be subject to intensity regulation, but the former would not. We hold, instead, that in applying the principle of the <em>Bellows Farms </em>case to a use permitted in a zone solely through the protection of the second paragraph of \u00a7 7A, a reasonable accommodation must be made, applying either the intensity regulations applicable to a related use within the zone or, alternatively, applying the intensity regulations which would apply to the protected use in a zone where that use is permitted. No hard and fast rule can be laid down. The reasonableness of the accommodation will depend on the facts of each case. \u201cZoning bylaws must be construed reasonably.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Norwood, </em>358 Mass. 253, 258 (1970). <em>Lindsay </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, </em>362 Mass. 126, 130 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The cases before us present no difficulty in this respect. In particular, we need not decide whether the applicable intensity requirements are those applicable to single-family dwellings (as the plaintiff is in fact constructing single-family dwellings) or those applicable to cluster developments (as the plaintiff apparently envisions common ownership of the open land). It would be especially inadvisable to attempt to do so in view of the paucity of the record in this respect. The crucial fact is that none of the developments meet both the area and frontage requirements for either use. Section 7A does not protect the plaintiff\u2019s parcels from the applicability of the intensity requirements of the zoning by-law, as amended through 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The plaintiff contends, however, that the first paragraph of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 5A<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>, protects his developments from the area and frontage requirements of the zoning by-law. Alternatively, he contends that, because the four land areas (comprised in each case of six or more contiguous lots shown on the 1971 plan) each exceed the minimum specifications for a buildable lot under the Nan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>tucket zoning by-law, he does not need the protection afforded by \u00a7 5A.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Section 5A, by its terms, affords its protection to <em>lots </em>shown on a plan (in contrast to \u00a7 <em>7A, </em>which affords protection to the <em>land </em>shown on a plan). In order to qualify for protection under \u00a7 5A, a lot must have at least 5,000 square feet of area and 50 feet of frontage. The only lots shown on the 1971 plan which comply with the minimum frontage requirement needed to obtain \u00a7 5A protection are lots 508 and 612. Upon neither of those lots do the plaintiff\u2019s development plans call for the construction of a dwelling, and none of the building permits which were issued authorized or involved construction on either of those lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The plaintiff contends, however, that under the principle applied in <em>Vassalotti </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Sudbury, </em>348 Mass. 658 (1965), and <em>Gaudet </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Dracut, </em>358 Mass. 807 (1970), he is entitled to combine lots shown on a plan, each of which is too small to qualify by itself for protection under \u00a75A, into larger lots which may qualify for that protection. The circumstances in those cases, however, were quite different from those in the cases before us. In the <em>Vassalotti </em>case the predecessor in title of the person seeking the protection of \u00a7 5A had, before the zoning by-law took effect, purchased a parcel of land consisting of several lots shown on a plan, none of which had the requisite area and frontage to qualify under \u00a7 5A, but the whole parcel did meet the dimensional requirements of \u00a7 5A. Neither the plaintiff nor his predecessor in title owned any adjacent land, either at the time the zoning by-law took effect or thereafter. Under those circumstances the plaintiff\u2019s entire parcel, as shown in the deed, was held to be a single \u201clot\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5A. The <em>Gaudet </em>case, although the record before the court was said to have been \u201climited\u201d and the decision was somewhat cryptic, appears to have turned on similar principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The circumstances in'the cases before us are quite different. The present plaintiff, by applying his adjacent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>land, could meet the dimensional requirements of the zoning by-law for buildable lots. We do not think that \u00a7 5A permits him to stop short of that point. Section 5A must be read to apply to the lots shown on the plan, or to all the plaintiff\u2019s adjacent land shown on the plan, but not to anything in between. Section 5A does not give a developer the privilege of meeting the dimensional requirements of \u00a7 5A by assembling new nonconforming lots when he has it within his power to assemble conforming lots. Compare <em>Sorenti </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wellesley, </em>345 Mass. 348, 352-353 <em>(1963); Chafer </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, </em>348 Mass. 237, 244 (1964); <em>Smigliani </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Saugus, </em>348 Mass. 794 (1965); <em>Giovannucci </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Plainville, ante, </em>239, 242-243 (1976). See also <em>Lindsay </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, </em>362 Mass. 126 (1972), and <em>Rain </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of No. Reading, ante, </em>318, 321-322 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The plaintiff has, in fact, assembled contiguous lots into larger lots, four in number, each devoted or intended to be devoted to a condominium development. These larger lots are buildable lots for single family detached dwellings. It does not follow, however, that the plaintiff may construct on each of those lots more dwellings than are permitted by the intensity requirements of the zoning by-law. The purpose of \u00a7 5A is to permit a \u201clot\u201d which meets the dimensional requirements of that section to be built upon notwithstanding the fact that it fails to meet 'the dimensional requirements of the zoning by-law. It is not meant to permit a lot which conforms to the dimensional requirements of the zoning by-law to be built upon more intensively than the zoning by-law contemplates. Compare <em>Vetter </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeal of Attleboro, </em>330 Mass. 628, 630-631 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">It follows that the zoning by-law is applicable to the four developments and that the building permits which were issued exceeded in number those which could have been issued in conformity with that by-law. We have no way of deciding on this record which of the permits are to be considered as having been lawfully issued and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>are to be considered as excess, nor have the parties gone into those questions. The cases are therefore remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In the exercise of that court\u2019s discretion, the two cases arising under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21, may be remanded to the board for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-15\"> The statement of agreed facts refers to \u201cparcel\u201d in the singular, but the attached plans, incorporated by reference and stipulated to be accurate, show that lots 483-488 and 612 (referred to in the aggregate by the parties as \u201clot 1\u201d) are not contiguous with the remaining lots involved in the case, being separated from them by lot 557. The statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>of agreed facts does not disclose who owns lot 557; for purposes of decision we must assume that it is not owned by the plaintiff, as the land he owns is described by reference to particular lot numbers, and 557 is not one of those mentioned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\"> All references in this decision to sections of G.

See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>366 Mass. 197, 199-200, 202 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\"> The area requirement is subject to the following exception: that \u201cany lot shown on a plan endorsed with the words \u2018approval under the subdivision control law not required\u2019.. . before the effective date of this By-law, may be built upon although the lot contains less than the required minimum lot area provided such lot was held in ownership separate from that of adjoining land located in the same district and provided that the building(s) to be built shall not cover more than the greater of... 1,200 square feet of lot area, or...

The by-law does not contemplate two independent single family dwellings on a lot. The second dwelling unit must be contained in an accessory building, which is defined as \u201ca structure devoted exclusively to a use accessory to a principal use of the lot.\u201d An \u201caccessory use\u201d is \u201ca use customarily incident to, and on the same lot as, a principal use.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s proposed single-family, detached dwellings are clearly principal uses, not accessory to some other principal use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b491-6\"> The second paragraph of G.
