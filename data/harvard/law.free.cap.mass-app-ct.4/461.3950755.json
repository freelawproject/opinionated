The defendant demurred to the bill on the ground, among others, that the alleged memorandum of the agreement was insufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. The trial judge overruled the defendant\u2019s demurrer. The case was submitted to a master. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to recommit the master\u2019s report, and confirmed the report. He then ruled that there was no memorandum of the agreement which complied with the Statute of Frauds and ordered that a final decree enter dismissing the bill. The plaintiff appeals from the final decree so entered on June 20, 1974. The defendant appeals from the interlocutory decrees overruling his demurrer, denying his motion to recommit the master\u2019s report, and confirming the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">1. We first consider whether the trial judge was correct in overruling the defendant\u2019s demurrer. Applying the tests with respect to the sufficiency of the pleadings embodied in the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure and adopting the terminology used therein <em>(Charbonnier </em>v. <em>Amico, </em>367 Mass. 146, 147, n. 3 [1975]; <em>Consumers Organization for Fair Energy Equality, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>Util., </em>368 Mass. 599, 612 <em>[1975]; Ciccone </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 733 [1975]), we decide that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint (bill) adequately states a claim which is not rendered unenforceable by the Statute of Frauds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mass.R.Civ.P. 8 (a), 365 Mass. 750 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendant owned the locus, and that the plaintiff discussed with the defendant the possibility of purchasing the locus. The complaint alleged that \u201ca sale price was agreed upon in the amount of $105,000 and the Defendant told the Plaintiff that his wife was actually the owner of the property and she would be home in the morning to receive a $1,000 deposit by the Plaintiff and that a signed agreement would be turned over.\u201d The complaint further alleged that the $1,000 deposit was delivered as instructed and that the defendant\u2019s wife gave \u201cto the plaintiff a written signed instrument\u201d (which was annexed to the complaint and is reproduced in the margin).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The annexed \u201cagreement\u201d was signed by the plaintiff\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The defense of the Statute of Frauds may be raised by a motion to dismiss (Mass.R.Civ.P. 12 [b] [6], 365 Mass. 755 [1974]) when the complaint shows on its face that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is based upon an oral agreement which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>is unenforceable by virtue of the statute. <em>Siegel </em>v. <em>Knott, </em>316 Mass. 526, 527-528 (1944). <em>Cluff </em>v. <em>Picardi, </em>331 Mass. 320, 321-322 (1954). <em>Continental Collieries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shober, </em>130 F. 2d 631, 635-636 (3d Cir. 1942). Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 1357, pp. 607-609 (1969). The defendant argues that this is such a case because the complaint contains no allegation that the defendant\u2019s wife was authorized to sign the \u201cagreement\u201d annexed to the complaint. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We believe that, in light of the more liberal standards by which pleadings are tested under the new rules (Char<em>bonnier </em>v. <em>Amico, </em>367 Mass. 147, 152-153 <em>[1975]; Cox </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commn. 3 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 793 [1975]), the allegation that the defendant told the plaintiff that his wife owned the locus and that she would give the plaintiff a \u201csigned agreement\u201d together with the allegation that the following day the defendant\u2019s wife did give the plaintiff such a signed agreement sufficiently alleges that the defendant had given his wife actual authority to sign the \u201cagreement\u201d annexed to the complaint and thereby bind him as an undisclosed principal (see <em>White </em>v. <em>Dahlquist Mfg. Co. </em>179 Mass. 427, 431 [1901]; <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>183 Mass. 389, 391 [1903]), to sell the property on the terms contained therein. <em>Simes </em>v. <em>Rockwell, </em>156 Mass. 372, 373-374 (1892). <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>205 Mass. 80, 85 (1910), and cases cited. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>O'Brien, </em>320 Mass. 739, 741-742 (1947). Mechem, Agency, \u00a7 261, pp. 185-186; \u00a7 280, p. 200 (1914). Restatement 2d: Agency, \u00a7 22, comment b (1958). Proof of these allegations at a hearing on the merits of the case would justify a finding that the \u201cagreement\u201d annexed to the complaint satisfied the Statute of Frauds. Contrast <em>Cluff </em>v. <em>Picardi, </em>331 Mass. at 323. We therefore conclude that the demurrer was properly overruled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Compare <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Coster, </em>249 Mass. 391, 394 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>2. The defendant did not plead the Statute of Frauds in his answer, nor does it appear from the master\u2019s report that the statute was relied upon during the hearing before the master. In these circumstances we must regard the statute as having been waived as a defense. <em>Livingstone </em>v. <em>Murphy, 187 </em>Mass. 315, 318 (1905). <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>281 Mass. 528, 531-532 (1933). <em>Stoneham Five Cents Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>295 Mass. 390, 393-394 (1936). <em>Pieczarka </em>v. <em>Pieczarka, </em>328 Mass. 51 (1951). See now Mass.R.Civ.P. 8 (c), 12 (b), 15 (b), 365 Mass. 750,755-756,761-762 (1974). <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>442 F. 2d 422 (3d Cir. 1971). <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Johnson, 8 </em>F.R.D. 37, 38 (M.D. Pa. 1948). The trial judge therefore erred in ordering that the bill be dismissed on the ground that the Statute of Frauds had not been satisfied. See anno. 158 A.L.R. 89, 165 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">3. Finally, we reach the question of what judgment should be entered on the master\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This court is in the same position as was the trial court with respect to drawing inferences and reaching conclusions from the subsidiary findings of the master. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Gingras, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 393, 395-396 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The only subsidiary findings which we need summarize are the following. On May 7, 1972, the defendant orally agreed to sell the locus to the plaintiff for $105,000. The defendant refused to carry out this agreement, and on June 12, 1972, he conveyed the locus to another person for $119,240.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We believe that the plaintiff, who no longer seeks specific performance of the contract, is entitled to damages for the defendant\u2019s breach of the oral agreement measured by the difference between the value of the property at the time the plaintiff was to have a conveyance of it,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the price which he was then to pay. <em>Old Colony R.R. Corp. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>6 Gray 25, 34-36 (1856). <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>177 Mass. 6, 8-9 (1900). <em>Widebeck </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>327 Mass. 429, 434 (1951). Williston, Contracts, \u00a7 1399 (3d ed. 1968). See <em>Olszewski </em>v. <em>Sardynski, </em>316 Mass. 715, 717-718 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We interpret the master\u2019s findings that the locus was conveyed to a third person for $119,240 approximately a month after the defendant agreed to sell it to the plaintiff and that the defendant had thus been unjustly enriched in the sum of $14,240 as implicit findings that the fair market value of the property was the price for which it was sold. See <em>Lembo </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>330 Mass. 461, 463 (1953); <em>Ramacorti </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Authy. </em>341 Mass. 377, 380 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The interlocutory decrees overruling the demurrer, denying the defendant\u2019s motion to recommit the master\u2019s report and confirming the master\u2019s report are affirmed. The final decree is reversed. Judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff in accordance with this opinion.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\"> If we were to test the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint by the law as it existed prior to the effective date of the new rules and decide that the defendant\u2019s demurrer should have been sustained, the plaintiff would still be given an opportunity to amend his complaint. The sufficiency of the amended complaint would be tested by the new rules. Mass.R.Civ.P. 1A, subpar. 2, 365 Mass. 731 (1974). Since, as we decide, the complaint already adequately states a claim under those rules, it would be unnecessary for the plaintiff to amend the complaint. In these circumstances it would be pointless to apply the rules of pleading as they existed prior to the effective date of the rules. Contrast <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Textron, Inc. </em>367 Mass. 540, 557-558 (1975); <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 793 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\"> \u201cMay 8, 1972 Received from Robert F.

Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>359 Mass. 327, 329 (1971). (On the master\u2019s findings the \u201cagreement\u201d annexed to the bill [see n.2] could not bind the parties to terms not agreed upon. <em>Fichera </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>312 Mass. 287, 289 [1942].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b486-13\"> We decline to assess the plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees against the defendant.
