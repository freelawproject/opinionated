Subsequently, on July 18, 1974, the plaintiff submitted to the building inspector of the town an application (including blueprints and a plan) to build apartments on the locus which he owns and which is in an industrial district. He asserts that the locus was subject to the zon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ing by-law in effect prior to the amendment (the old bylaw) by virtue of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7A. This section provides in pertinent part that property shown on a plan endorsed, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P, as not requiring approval under the Subdivision Control Law is governed \u201cby applicable provisions of the zoning ... by-law in effect at the time of the submission of such plan... and for a period of three years from the date of endorsement by the planning board that approval under the subdivision control law is not required, or words of similar import____\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further asserts that on October 12, 1972, he filed a plan with the planning board and the town clerk (the 1972 plan) and requested that it be endorsed as not requiring approval. The planning board failed to act; and the plaintiff relies on the provision of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P, that: \u201cIf the board fails to act upon a plan submitted under this section... within fourteen days after its submission, it shall be deemed to have determined that approval under the subdivision control law is not required, and it shall forthwith make such endorsement on said plan, and on its failure to do so forthwith the... town clerk shall issue a certificate to the same effect____\u201d <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Revere, </em>335 Mass. 740, 743 (1957); <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Agawam, </em>358 Mass. 709, 714 (1971). The town clerk had issued such a certificate on November 12, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The building inspector denied the building permit. The plaintiff appealed to the board of appeals (the zoning board) under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 19. The zoning board sustained the action of the building inspector; three members construed the old by-law (its application apparently was not contested) to provide that \u201cthe right to build apartments in the Industrial District is not a right but permitted only by special permission of the Board of Appeals\u201d and voted to deny the application in their discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>tion because they found \u201cit would derogate from the neighborhood which is basically a single residence district____\u201d One member voted to deny the appeal on the basis that it did not comply with the off-street parking requirements of the zoning by-law. One member voted to grant the permit. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The court, after hearing, made \u201cfindings and rulings\u201d (Mass.R.Civ.P. 52[a], 365 Mass. 816 [1974]), annulled the decision of the zoning board and ordered that a building permit issue. The zoning board appeals; the evidence is included in the record appendix. We turn to the zoning board\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">1. Its major contention, as it was in the Superior Court, is that the 1972 plan, on which the plaintiff based his claim that the old by-law applied, had never been submitted to the planning board, and therefore the zoning freeze in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7A, was inoperative. However, the trial judge found that the 1972 plan had been thus submitted on October 12, 1972, and his finding is not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d See Mass. R.Civ.P. 52 (a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). Indeed, the minutes of a meeting of the planning board as late as November 14, 1972, show that the plan was then discussed, and the court could find (as it did), from certain documentary evidence and testimony of the previous owner of the property, that he had filed the plan with the secretary of the planning board on October 12, 1972. Such inconsistencies as the zoning board was able to develop at trial were for the judge to appraise in assessing the witness\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">2. The zoning board further contends, as set out in its decision, that the old by-law provided for apartments in an industrial district not as a matter of right but merely as a discretionary matter requiring, in effect, a special permit. We agree with the trial judge that the old by-law could not thus be read. In the industrial district in which the property is located there was permitted (in typical fashion) \u201c... [a]ny use permitted <em>by right </em>in a General Business (GB) District\u201d (emphasis supplied), which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>a more restricted district than the industrial district. The \u201cGeneral Business District\u201d included in a list of thirteen uses permitted by right: \u201c7. Apartments and multi-family dwellings, subject to the conditions of Section V.C., paragraph 5.b.\u201d The conditions in paragraph 5.b. merely specify the lot area as a function of the number of families and require connection to the municipal sewer system. We do not believe that it is material that Section V.C. (\u201cGeneral Residence [GR] and Intown Residence [IR] Districts\u201d), which established districts quite different in character from a \u201cGeneral Business District\u201d and which first made provision for apartments, required a special permit for apartments and multi-family dwellings.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">To obviate what the zoning board concedes is the \u201cliteral interpretation\u201d of the by-law, it also points to the general language in the purpose clause of the by-law, Section I, and the preamble to Section V, which lists the various districts and the uses within each district, as well as to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. But the argument proves too much. If taken seriously it would abolish all uses as a matter of right and require a special permit for any use of land in Ipswich \u2014 even single-family dwellings in single residence districts. A by-law which provided only for special permits would be extraordinary to say the least. The various parts of the by-law and The Zoning Enabling Act to which the zoning board refers suggest standards for the exercise of discretion where such discretion is otherwise provided. They are not themselves a source of discretion. See <em>Daley Constr. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Randolph, </em>340 Mass. 149, 155 (1959); <em>Mac-Rich Realty Constr. Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Southborough, ante, </em>79 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">3. The zoning board contends, finally,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the decision should be upheld because the plaintiff\u2019s proposal to build <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>apartments does not comply with section VIII of the bylaw, entitled \u201cOff-Street Parking and Loading Requirements.\u201d That was not the basis on which the majority of the zoning board rejected the permit. Only one member of the board voted to refuse on the basis of noncompliance with the parking requirements, and it is worth noting that the building inspector\u2019s rejection, although also based in part on the parking requirements, referred only to a provision for the protection of \u201c [properties in residential districts ... from headlight glare and other nuisances or hazards \u2014\u201d He made no reference to the various difficulties later raised by the zoning board member. The plaintiff introduced testimony by the surveyor who drew the plan for the apartment project that it complied with the requirements of the provisions for off-street parking. However, the trial judge made no such findings on this issue, and we are not inclined to supply findings of compliance from the conclusory evidence in the record (warranted though such findings might be). See <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Milton Sav. Bank, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 138 (1974); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Norwood, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 393, 397 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Thus, though the decision of the board must be annulled since its basis is untenable, we do not believe that the judgment should at this time order that a building permit issue\u2014 though it is clear that there is power in a court to do so. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Ashland, </em>354 Mass. 660 (1968). Rather, the case should be remanded to the zoning board to consider the applicability of the parking requirements in Section VIII of the by-law \u2014 apparently the only matter left unresolved. This will also give the plaintiff an opportunity to make such modifications as may appear necessary on such reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Superior Court is modified to provide that (1) the decision of the zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>board exceeded its authority and is annulled, (2) the case is to be remanded to the zoning board for further consideration in accordance with this opinion and specifically the next prior paragraph, and (3) the Superior Court shall retain jurisdiction of the case. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Norwood, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\"> In this case the three-year freeze is extended from the date of the building inspector\u2019s refusal of the plaintiff\u2019s application for a permit to the termination of this litigation. See <em>M. DeMatteo Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Hingham, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 446, 461-462 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\"> The only other matter which the zoning board mentions in its brief and which may be said barely (if at all) to rise to the level of an argument (Mass.R.A.P. 16, 365 Mass. 860 [1974], as amended, 367 Mass. 919 [1975]) is the failure to file the 1972 plan with the board of health under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81S. A short answer is that \u00a7 81S refers to the submission of a subdivision plan for <em>approval. </em>It has no application to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>plans submitted for endorsement as not requiring approval under \u00a7 81P. See <em>Roland Lavoie Constr. Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Ludlow, </em>346 Mass. 274, 277-278 (1963). See also <em>Cassani </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Hull, </em>1 Mass.
