L. c. 94, \u00a7\u00a7 200 and 210A (as in effect prior to their repeal by St. 1971, c. 1071, \u00a7 2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 30, 1973, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the complaint alleging violation of G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 200, and verdicts of guilty on numerous complaints alleg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>ing violations of G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 210A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant is here on his exceptions to the denials of his motions to dismiss, filed pre-trial and renewed at the close of all the evidence, and to the denials of his motions for directed verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">On or about August 6, 1971, police officers of the city of Springfield observed the defendant\u2019s patients purchasing methadone in local drug stores under prescriptions issued by the defendant. Thereafter, a search of the records of the Department of Public Health in Boston failed to disclose the names of the patients treated by the defendant or any of the other data required to be submitted by physicians treating patients \u201csuffering from the chronic use of narcotic drugs.\u201d G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 210A. A search warrant was obtained, and, pursuant to the warrant, the defendant\u2019s office was entered on August 26,1971. The defendant was placed under arrest, and approximately 1,000 copies of prescriptions were seized, together with the defendant\u2019s ledger books, diaries, and other records of patients receiving psychiatric treatment, including their names, addresses, dates of treatment, and diagnostic data.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">At the trial several witnesses presented by the Commonwealth testified as to how long they had been narcotics users and as to the treatment given them by the defendant. Numerous other witnesses, also called by the Commonwealth, testified as to their respective opinions of what constituted \u201cchronic use\u201d for the purposes of G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 210A. Summaries of the testimony of some of these witnesses will be presented in greater detail later in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>The defendant\u2019s first contention is that the statute under which the complaints were issued, G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 210A, was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite and that his convictions thereunder constitute denials of due process of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 210A, carried criminal penalties for those who failed to comply with its terms (G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 217 [as in effect prior to its repeal by St. 1971, c. 1071, \u00a7 2]), it must be regarded as a penal statute for the purpose of determining whether the language employed was definite enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Due process requires that the terms of a penal statute, particularly one creating a new offense, \u201cmust be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties \u2014 And a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.\u201d <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Constr. Co. </em>269 U. S. 385, 391 (1926) <em>. Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939). <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.

See <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.

Pa. L. Rev. 67 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">The statute that the defendant was convicted of violating, G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 210A, required every physician to report to the Department of Public Health the name, address, description, and other data concerning every person he treated who was \u201csuffering from the chronic use of narcotic drugs.\u201d \u201cChronic\u201d is defined in medical dictionaries as \u201c[cjontinued over a long period of time, usually in a mild form\u201d and as the opposite of acute. E.g., Schmidt, Attorneys\u2019 Dictionary of Medicine (1976); Maloy, Medical Dictionary for Lawyers (2d ed. 1951). \u201cChronic diseases\u201d have been defined variously in court decisions as being of long duration and unyielding to treatment (e.g., <em>Swann </em>v. <em>National Union Ben. Assn. </em>357 Ill. 78, 80-81 [1934]; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Southern Sur. Co. </em>211 Mich. 444, 452 [1920]; <em>Stegall </em>v. <em>St. Joseph Lead Co. </em>465 S.W. 2d 855, 860-861 [Mo. App. 1971]; <em>Messer </em>v. <em>Beighley, </em>409 Pa. 551, 554 [1963]), and as being constant and continuing and characterized by progressive symptoms (e.g., <em>Woodward &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>State Industrial Commn. </em>349 P. 2d 638, 640 [Okla. I960]), as opposed to \u201cacute diseases\u201d (e.g., <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Yarborough, </em>2 Ala. 524, 525 [1841]).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">None of the witnesses who testified at the trial could agree on any one definition of \u201cchronic.\u201d Inspector N. Cornelius of the food and drug division of the Department of Public Health, called by the Commonwealth, testified that he believed \u201cchronic meant long term or a long period\u201d and that he had heard it defined \u201cas meaning permanent or incurable.\u201d He also testified \u201cthat if a person used heroin for six months or a year on a daily basis, he would call that person a chronic user but that if that person stopped using heroin, he would be neither a chronic user nor a user.\u201d Police Sergeant Kulig, who participated in the investigation that led to the defendant\u2019s arrest, testified that \u201che had made a conclusion as to chronic use based upon the quantity or the frequency of the prescriptions seized.\u201d The Commonwealth called Sister Caroline Smith, a program coordinator of the methadone mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>nance treatment program at Providence Hospital, in Holyoke, Massachusetts. She testified that it was her understanding that a person who had been using \u201csay, hard drugs for approximately two years ... would be... a chronic user, perhaps.\u201d Dr. John J. Driscoll, called by the Commonwealth, a physician in general medicine and surgery at Providence Hospital and the director of its methadone clinic, when asked to define \u201ca chronic use of drugs,\u201d replied: \u201cFifteen bags of heroin on a daily basis is a chronic use of drugs, also one bag of heroin each day for two years is a chronic use.\u201d He also testified \u201cthat acute and addiction refer to two different things; that an addict is a person in chronic use.\u201d Marilyn Karczynski, a defense witness and an attorney for the Department of Public Health,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> testified that \u201cthere was no legal definition published by the Department of Public Health available for the guidance of those seeking to determine its meaning.\u201d As can be observed from the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s own witnesses, there are quite a few different definitions of the term \u201cchronic.\u201d This fact alone would make application of the term \u201cchronic\u201d in the context of this statute most difficult, if not impossible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Moreover, the definitions of \u201cchronic\u201d provide so much latitude that it could have been expected that the statute would be applied differently by different practitioners.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For example, if \u201cchronic\u201d use is use over a \u201clong\u201d period of time, how should \u201clong\u201d be defined? If \u201cchronic\u201d is defined as \u201cfrequent\u201d use, what is the proper interpretation of \u201cfrequent\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b777-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>In <em>McMurtry </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Medical Examrs., 180 Cal. </em>App. 2d 760 (1960), a similar statutory scheme employing the language \u201chabitual user\u201d was found to be unconstitutionally vague because the statute provided no criterion by which a physician could determine how many instances of narcotics use must take place before a person becomes an \u201chabitual user.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770. The phrase \u201cchronic use\u201d poses problems in application similar to those posed by the phrase \u201chabitual user.\u201d A physician must, of necessity, guess at its meaning and application. See <em>Weissman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 F. 2d 799, <em>800-801 </em>(9th Cir. 1967), citing <em>McMurtry </em>with approval. We therefore conclude that the statute did not comport with the requirements of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The defendant\u2019s motions for directed verdicts on the complaints charging him with violations of G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 210A, should have been granted, and his exceptions are therefore sustained. Judgments are to be entered for the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-14\"> At all times material to the controversy, these sections of the statute were in effect, but repeal occurred and was effective before the trial in the District Court.

Such information shall be made available for the use of any agency of the commonwealth or of the United States which may require it\u201d (emphasis supplied). Compare the current statute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 24 (inserted by St. 1971, c. 1071, \u00a7 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b774-6\"> We are not confronted with a situation where the statutory language in question has received prior judicial construction. In such circumstances, it would be more difficult for the defendant to press his vagueness claim. See <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, </em>333 U.
