We summarize the material facts as they appear from the statement of agreed facts and its supporting documents on which this matter was submitted to the appeal board.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">Mr. Gallagher was continuously employed in the law department of the city, either as an assistant city solicitor or as the city solicitor, during the entire period from and including January 6, 1938, through March 11, 1944, when he left the employ of the city. The city\u2019s contributory retirement system (system) went into effect on January 1,1946. Mr. Gallagher reentered the employ of the city on February 7, 1950, as the city solicitor, and thereafter served in that capacity during the separate periods from and including February 7, 1950, through March 11, 1957, and March 3, 1958, through January 6,1972, which was the date of his death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">On September 21, 1950, Mr. Gallagher executed an application for membership in the system<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in which he char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>acterized his employment as \u201cpermanent\u201d and \u201cpart-time\u201d, identified the date of his \u201cpresent permanent appointment\u201d as February 7, 1950, and stated his desire \u201cto make partial periodic deposits to cover past service.\u201d The space in the form for the local board\u2019s formal approval of the application<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was left blank, but it appears from other records of the local board and from the agreed facts that Mr. Gallagher was accepted into the system (see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3[2] [d]; <em>Andrade </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>350 Mass. 447, 449-450 [1966]) as of October 1, 1950, that he was thereafter permitted to make make-up payments applicable to a portion of his service prior to 1950 and to the period from and including February 7, 1950, through September 30, 1950,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that deductions were regularly made from his earnings during the two separate periods of his subsequent service as city solicitor which have been recited above. At some undetermined point Mr. Gallagher filed an election in favor of the member-survivor allowance now found in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12 (2), <em>Option </em>(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">Historically, the office of city solicitor of Medford has been a part-time position, and it seems to have been so regarded under the salary ordinance which was in effect at the time Mr. Gallagher reentered the employ of the city on February 7, 1950. On April 4, 1950,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Gallagher, acting in his capacity as city solicitor, specifically approved the legality of an amendment to the salary ordinance which described his position as \u201cpart time\u201d under the relevant pay rating description found in the ordinance. Throughout Mr. Gallagher\u2019s employment as city solicitor during and following 1950 he appears to have performed all the duties expected of him as city solicitor, but those duties did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>require his full time, and he also maintained his own private law office and practice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Following Mr. Gallagher\u2019s death the plaintiff applied to the local board to determine the yearly allowance to which she was entitled under the aforementioned <em>Option </em>(d,). In the course of making its determination of such allowance the local board appears to have arrived at a judgment that only two thirds of Mr. Gallagher\u2019s total time had been devoted to his duties as city solicitor and to have reduced by a factor of one third the total number of calendar years and full months actually served by him in that capacity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That treatment appears to have been confirmed both by the appeal board (under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 [4]) and by the Superior Court (under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14[8]).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff has taken a still further appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">In their briefs and oral arguments before us all the parties have proceeded on the assumption that the central is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>sue in this case is one which will be resolved by determining the proper interpretation of the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (2) (6), as appearing in St. 1966, c. 509, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Both boards have taken the position that the local board\u2019s action in reducing Mr. Gallagher\u2019s years and months of actual service as city solicitor following his 1950 reemployment in that capacity was and is justified by the broad general language of the first sentence of paragraph (b). The plaintiff has taken the position that the language of the first sentence must be read in the light of and is controlled by the narrower language of the second sentence of (6) which, she urges, would permit a local board to reduce the \u201camount of credit for membership service\u201d of a part-time employee such as Mr. Gallagher only \u201cunder appropriate rules and regulations which shall be subject to the approval of the actuary,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that no such reduction is authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>in the circumstances of this case because no such rules and regulations have been adopted by the local board.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We do not resolve the conflicting contentions of the parties because we conclude that \u00a7 4(2) (b) has no application here except with respect to the period of Mr. Gallagher\u2019s employment by the city prior to February 7, 1950, a period as to which there does not appear to be any controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">We reach that conclusion by a consideration of the legislative history of the present provisions of the General Laws pertaining to retirement systems as they relate to part-time employees of cities and towns and by a careful reading of \u00a7 4(2) (6) in its context. It would appear from the definition of \u201cemployees\u201d in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 26 (as appearing in the Tercentenary Edition), as \u201cregular and permanent employees whose sole or principal employment is in the service of the city or town\u201d that at least some part-time municipal employees were intended to be covered by the division of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 32 which was entitled \u201cRETIREMENT SYSTEMS FOR CITIES AND TOWNS\u201d and which was comprised of \u00a7\u00a7 26-31, inclusive, of that chapter. The sections just referred to were struck by St. 1936, c. 318 (\u201cAn Act providing for contributory retirement systems for cities and towns that may be accepted by them, and making certain other changes in the laws relative to retirement systems\u201d), \u00a7 1, which inserted in place thereof a new \u00a7 26 and the fourteen new following sections. The new \u00a7 26 defined an employee in general terms as \u201cany person who is regularly employed in the service of, and whose salary or compensation is paid by, the city or town, including... officials or public officers so paid, whether employed or appointed for stated terms or otherwise...\u201d and provided that \u201c[i]n all cases of doubt the [local] board shall decide who is an employee.\u201d None of the statutory provisions thus far referred to contained any provision which dealt expressly with the membership or retirement rights of part-time municipal employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The first legislative effort to deal comprehensively with the membership and retirement rights of part-time employees in and under the contributory retirement systems of cities and towns is found in the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3(2) <em>(a) </em>(iv), 3(2) <em>(d), </em>4(2) <em>(b), </em>4(2) (c) and 5(3) (c), as appearing in St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[A]s applied to persons whose regular compensation... is paid by any political subdivision of the commonwealth\u201d an \u201cemployee\u201d was again defined by the new c. 32, \u00a7 1, in general terms substantially similar (for present purposes) to those previously quoted from the prior c. 32, \u00a7 26. The rights of part-time employees (nowhere expressly defined) were delineated in the aforementioned new \u00a7\u00a73(2) <em>(a) </em>(iv), 3 (2) (d), 4 (2) (b), 4 (2) (c) and 5 (3) (c) ,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Having traced the immediate history of \u00a7 4(2) <em>(b) </em>and related it to other provisions concerning part-time municipal employees, we may now address ourselves to the proper construction of \u00a7 4(2) <em>(b) </em>itself.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We note first the structure of the entire \u00a7 4 and the titles assigned to it and its four various subdivisions by the Legislature in the course of enacting the aforementioned St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1. Section 4, standing by itself, constituted an entire division of c. 32 entitled \u201cCREDITABLE SERVICE.\u201d That division was then broken down into four separate subdivisions which were respectively and successively entitled <em>\u201cQualifications for Credit for </em>Service\u201d (\u00a7 4[1]), <em>\u201cFiling and Verification of Statements of Service\u201d </em>(\u00a7 4[2]), <em>\u201cPrior Service Certificates\u201d </em>(\u00a7 4[3]), and <em>\u201cMembership and Retirement Certi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>ficates\u201d </em>(\u00a7 4[4]). What has become the present \u00a7 4(2) (6) thus emerged as an integral part of the subdivision entitled <em>\u201cFiling and Verification of Statements of </em>Service\u201d which must be read in conjunction with the other paragraphs of that subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">There has been no change in any of the aforementioned division or subdivision titles since the enactment of St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1. Accordingly, the first sentence of \u00a7 4 (2) (6) <em>(supra, </em>n.10), on which the two boards rely, must be read as referring directly and only to the \u201cdetailed statement of all service for which he claims credit rendered by him as an employee of any governmental unit prior to the date as of which such system became operative therein\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which \u00a7 4(2) (a) requires be filed by \u201c[ejach person becoming a member of any system.\u201d The first portion of the second sentence of \u00a7 4 (2) (b), that which precedes the first proviso and on which the plaintiff relies, provides that in the course of evaluating and determining the rights claimed by a part-time employee in his \u00a7 4 (2) <em>(a) </em>\u201cstatement of... service\u201d the local board shall make the two separate and distinct subsidiary determinations which we have bracketed as [1] and [2], respectively, in note 10, <em>supra</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The first such determination is as to the amount of the part-time employee\u2019s \u201ccreditable prior service.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The second is as to the \u201camount of credit for membership service\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>given to a part-time employee \u201cwho becomes a member\u201d of a system by reason of his membership in an earlier system which may have existed prior to January 1,1946. The balance of the second sentence of \u00a7 4(2) <em>(b), </em>that portion which commences with the first proviso thereof and on which no party relies, is concerned with two particular situations in which a local board is to give part-time employees credit for prior service in accordance with the specific statutory formulae set out therein rather than in accordance with any rules or regulations which may be promulgated by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">We conclude from the foregoing analysis that no part of \u00a7 4(2) <em>(b) </em>is concerned with any type of determination by a local board other than one of the types discussed in the preceding paragraph of this opinion. The present controversy is not concerned with any such determination which may have been made by the local board.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As we understand the case as it has been argued to us, the controversy centers over the question whether there was any statutory or other warrant for the local board\u2019s reduction of the length of Mr. Gallagher\u2019s actual service by reason of the fact that his employment subsequent to February 7, 1950,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> was not full-time. In our opinion the resolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>of that controversy turns on other provisions of c. 32 which have not previously been considered in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">General Laws, c. 32, \u00a7 4 [\u201cCREDITABLE SERVICE\u201d] (1) <em>[\u201cQualifications for Credit for Service\u201d]</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> (a), </em>provides that \u201c[a]ny member in service shall, subject to the provisions and limitations of sections one to twenty-eight inclusive, be credited with <em>all </em>service rendered by him as an employee in any governmental unit after becoming a member of the system pertaining thereto\u201d (emphasis supplied) . No distinction is drawn in the quoted language or in the word \u201cservice\u201d (as defined in \u00a7 l<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>) between a part-time employee and one who might be described as full-time. Accordingly, the question arises whether there is anything to be found elsewhere in \u00a7 \u00a7 1-28 which would authorize a local board to reduce the length of a part-time employee\u2019s actual service in the course of determining the amount of the \u201cretirement allowance\u201d (see n.8, supra) to which he is entitled. We have already seen that \u00a7 4(2) <em>(b) </em>has nothing to do with the credit which is to be allowed to any employee with respect to the time served by him subsequent to his becoming a member of a retirement system.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">We cannot accept the suggestion that the local board\u2019s action in this case was governed by the provisions of \u00a7 4 (2) (c) (as appearing in St. 1961, c. 494) <footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for it is clear, whether those provisions are read alone or in conjunction with those of \u00a7\u00a7 4(2) (6) and 4(2) (d), that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>are concerned only with the credit which is to be allowed to a member of a retirement system with respect to his part-time service prior to becoming eligible for membership in a retirement system. Nor can we accept the local board\u2019s suggestion that its action was warranted by the provisions of \u00a7 5 (3) (c) (as appearing in St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1) <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Without pausing to determine whether the word \u201cmay\u201d which appears in that section is to be construed as mandatory or merely permissive, we think it clear that the only reduction in the actual service of a part-time employee which is authorized by that section is one which is made under rules and regulations of the type therein referred to, and it is an agreed fact in this case <em>(supra, </em>n.12) that the local board has not promulgated any such rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">We conclude that there is nothing in any of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 1-28 which authorized the local board to deviate in this case from the general requirement of \u00a7 4(1) <em>(a) </em>that \u201c[a]ny member in service shall... be credited with all service rendered by him as an employee... after becoming a member of the system,\u201d and that the local board erred in reducing what would otherwise have been the plaintiff\u2019s yearly allowance because of Mr. Gallagher\u2019s having been a part-time employee during the periods from and including February 7, 1950, through March 11, 1957, and March 3, 1958, through January 6, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The only remaining questions are as to the disposition which should now be made of this case. It seems clear that the plaintiff has in fact been paid less than the yearly allowance to which she is entitled. The parties appear to be in agreement that $4,700.00 is the \u201capproximate\u201d amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>of the yearly allowance to which the plaintiff is entitled under \u00a7 12 (2), <em>Option (d), </em>if the reduction made by the local board is not to stand (as it is not) and that $3,133.00 is the \u201capproximate\u201d amount of the yearly allowance which has actually been paid to the plaintiff since the date of Mr. Gallagher\u2019s death (see n.8, supra). We are told in the local board\u2019s brief that the actuary, acting under the provisions of \u00a7 21 (3) <em>(a) </em>,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> has \u201capproved the determination\u201d of the local board. We would suppose, although we cannot be certain, that the actuary\u2019s approval relates to the figure of $4,700.00 as well as to the $3,133, even if both those figures may be \u201capproximate.\u201d We think both \u201capproximate\u201d figures should now be translated into precise figures (if that has not already been done) so that a precise determination may now be made of the difference between each of the periodic payments which has been made to the plaintiff under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 13(1) <em>(b), </em>and what each of those payments should have been. The plaintiff is presently entitled to the sum of those differences, as well as to interest on each of those differences from the date on which it should have been paid. No reason appears why such further calculations as may now be necessary should not be made by or under the direction of the Superior Court. See <em>Bianchi </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Somerville, </em>359 Mass. 642, 651-652 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, and the decisions of the appeal board and of the local board are set aside. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for the further proceedings required by this opinion and for the entry of a judgment which will (a) determine the total amount (including interest) now due the plaintiff and (b) declare the precise yearly amount which shall be paid her in the future. The judgment may provide for the issuance by the local board of whatever vouchers are necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>effect the required payments to the plaintiff. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 23(2) <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b22-8\"> He appears also to have served as acting city manager during a period of approximately two weeks in June of 1958.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b22-9\"> The application appears to have been on a \u201c [p] rescribed form\u201d, as \u2022 defined in G.

All we actually know concerning that board\u2019s calculations is found in its letter to the plaintiff of February 29, 1972, in which it advised her that \u201cit was voted to grant you... member-survivor benefits ... in the amount of approximately $3,133.00 per year____This figure represents 2/3rds of your late husband\u2019s pension, approximately $4,700.00 per year, as required by law. The $4,700.00 represents your late husband\u2019s pension based on 66+2/3rds% of his total creditable service [sic], rather than full-time service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-11\">We assume that the board used the word \u201cpension\u201d in the same loose sense in which all the parties have used that word in their respective briefs. What the plaintiff was and is entitled to under either \u00a7 5 (2) <em>(a) </em>or \u00a7 5(3) (c) of c. 32 is the \u201cyearly amount of [her] retirement allowance.\u201d The \u201cretirement allowance\u201d is defined in c. 32, \u00a7 1, as \u201cthe sum of the amount of the annuity and the amount of the pension provided for in sections one to twenty-eight inclusive.\u201d The words \u201cannuity\u201d and \u201cpension\u201d are separately defined in \u00a7 1, and it is clear that the \u201cpension\u201d is only one component of the \u201cretirement allowance.\u201d See and compare <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>345 Mass. 692, 694-695 (1963); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>364 Mass. 847, 853-854 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b24-12\"> The local board intervened in the proceedings in the Superior Court.
