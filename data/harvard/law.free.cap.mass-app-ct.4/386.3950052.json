P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor </em>Co. 370 Mass. 69, 71 (1976), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a salesman under a written contract terminable at will, without cause, by either party. The contract, apparently used generally by the defendant, assigned to a salesman a \u201cterritory\u201d, consisting not of a geographical area but of certain enumerated customer accounts. The contract provided that the salesman was to be paid a weekly salary in a fixed amount plus \u201cbonus credits\u201d measured by sales in the \u201cterritory\u201d (i.e. to the accounts) assigned to him, whether such sales were made by him or someone else. Bonus credits were computed as a percentage of the price of products sold (with different percentages for different products), subject to adjustments not now material. The salesman was to be paid a percentage of the bonuses thus computed: seventy-five percent if the territory was assigned to him at the date of the order, twenty-five percent if the territory was assigned to him at the date of delivery and installation, and one hundred percent if the territory was assigned to him at both times; provided that the salesman\u2019s \u201cbonus interest in any order shall terminate... [i]f [with exceptions not material] shipment of the order is not made within eighteen months from the date of the order unless the [t]erritory is assigned to... [him] at the date of delivery and installation.\u201d* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>In 1968 the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cterritory\u201d consisted of certain named chain stores in New England, including First National Stores, Inc. (First National). Around that time the defendant introduced a new type of cash register. The plaintiff arranged a demonstration of the new machine to executives of First National in October, 1968. On November 29 First National placed an order for 2,008 of the machines, with deliveries and payments to be spread over a period of four years. While the plaintiff did not personally negotiate the order, he was credited with it by reason of the \u201cbonus credit\u201d provisions of his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In early 1969 the plaintiff was notified that his contract was terminated, effective December 2, 1968. He was permitted to remain in the defendant\u2019s employ thereafter in a \u201csales supportive\u201d capacity at his previous weekly salary, but without a written contract and without an assigned territory. During the eighteen-month period following the order of November 29, 1968, 774 of the ordered machines were delivered to First National. The plaintiff received seventy-five percent of the bonus credit applicable to the machines so delivered, but the remaining twenty-five percent was denied him because he was no longer assigned as salesman to the First National account when the deliveries were made. In June, 1970, the plaintiff was discharged from the defendant\u2019s employ altogether. After that date an additional 729 cash registers were delivered to First National pursuant to the order of November 29, 1968, but the plaintiff received no bonus payments on them because they had not been delivered within eighteen months of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>The defendant moved for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case and rested. Contrast <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>369 Mass. 882, 884-885 (1976). Counsel for the defendant argued to the trial judge that the plaintiff could not recover under the first two counts because there was no evidence of any breach of the plaintiff\u2019s contract and that the existence of the contract precluded recovery on a quantum meruit under count 3. In denying the motion the judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to present a jury question as to whether the defendant had terminated the contract and later fired the plaintiff in bad faith, and that a finding of bad faith would entitle the plaintiff to recover.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By agreement of counsel (the defendant, however, preserving its right to claim error in the denial of its motion for a directed verdict), the judge presented the case to the jury in the form of two questions Mass.R.Civ.P. 49[a], 365 Mass. 812 [1974]): \u201c1. Did the Defendant act in bad faith ... when it decided to terminate the Plaintiff\u2019s contract as a salesman by letter dated December 2, 1968, delivered on January 6, 1969?\u201d and \u201c2. Did the Defendant act in bad faith ... when the Defendant let the Plaintiff go on June 5, 1970?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury returned affirmative answers to both questions, and the judgment was entered. Of the $45,649.62 adjudged due the plaintiff, $9,272.52 represented the twenty-five percent of the bonus credit denied the plaintiff for the 774 machines delivered to First National within eighteen months after the order had been placed, and the remainder represented one hundred percent of the credit payable for the 729 machines delivered thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>It is clear that the plaintiff\u2019s contract of employment as a salesman explicitly gave the defendant a power to terminate that employment at will, and that the plaintiff has been paid all the commissions to which the literal provisions of the contract entitled him. The plaintiff relies, however, on a line of cases<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which hold that a broker engaged to find a buyer for real estate or merchandise may be entitled to his commission if the seller, prior to completion of all conditions which would entitle the broker to a commission, discharges the broker in bad faith in order to avoid paying him the commission for his services. For purposes of decision we assume that there was evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding, by its answer to the first question put<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, that the defendant terminated the plaintiff\u2019s contract as a salesman for the purpose of avoiding the incurring of further liability to the plaintiff under the contract for bonus credits applicable to the First National order. The question for decision is whether a termination for that purpose left the plaintiff entitled to the commissions he would otherwise have earned from the order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>At the outset we note two distinctions which lead us to question generally the applicability to the present case of the brokers\u2019 commission cases relied on by the plaintiff. The first is that those cases seem to involve unilateral contracts, and to arise from an offeror\u2019s attempted revocation of his offer to pay a commission for a specified result as the broker is nearing accomplishment of the result.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The rule applicable to unilateral contracts is that, until the offeree- \u2014 in this context, the broker \u2014 accepts such an offer by tendering performance in accordance with its terms, no contract comes into existence. <em>DesRivieres </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>247 Mass. 443, 446 (1924). <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Kazajian, </em>255 Mass. 459, 461-462 (1926). <em>John T. Burns &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hands, </em>283 Mass. 420, 422 (1933). <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Haycock, </em>301 Mass. 594, 596 (1938). <em>Eastern Paper &amp; Box Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Herz Mfg. Corp. </em>323 Mass. 138, 140 (1948). <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Keith, </em>325 Mass. 265, 268 (1950). <em>Dragone </em>v. <em>Dell\u2019Isola, </em>332 Mass. 11, 12-13 (1954). <em>Lattuca </em>v. <em>Cusolito, </em>343 Mass. 747, 751-752 (1962). The line of cases on which the plaintiff relies is an exception to that rule, formulated to avoid inequities which would result if the offeror were permitted to take advantage of the rule by discharging the broker and closing the negotiations himself in order to avoid liability to the broker for a commission. The principle of those cases is discussed by leading commentators as an aspect of the law of unilateral contracts. See Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 50, pp. 202-211 (1963); Williston, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a760, 60A, pp. 185-193 (3d ed. 1957). The employment contract in the case before us, however, was bilateral from its inception, binding both parties in accordance with terms mutually agreed upon. It is questionable whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>the line of cases upon which the plaintiff relies has any application in the context of bilateral contracts, where the question is not whether the defendant wrongfully prevented a contract from coming into existence, but whether the defendant\u2019s actions constituted a breach of a contract in being. Compare <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Kazajian, </em>255 Mass. at 462; <em>Eastern Paper &amp; Box Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Herz Mfg. Corp. </em>323 Mass. at 140-141; <em>Coan </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>327 Mass. 221, 223, n.1 (1951); <em>John T. Burns &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brasco, </em>327 Mass. 261, 263 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The second factual distinction is that the plaintiff\u2019s line of cases is grounded on the concept that the principal should not be permitted to enjoy the product of the broker\u2019s efforts without paying the broker the compensation promised.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cAn agent to whom the principal has made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>a revocable offer of compensation if he accomplishes a specified result is entitled to the promised amount if the principal, in order to avoid payment of it, revokes the offer and thereafter the result is accomplished as the result of the agent\u2019s prior efforts.\u201d Restatement 2d: Agency, \u00a7 454 (1958). Under the contract before us, the entitlement of the plaintiff to bonus credits did not depend on his efforts or on his producing or accomplishing any particular result. His entitlement to credits depended, instead, simply on his being employed in a particular position or job slot at the time when orders were written or deliveries were made. In this context the policy underlying the brokers\u2019 commission cases is of greatly diminished vitality, if, indeed, it has any applicability at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Assuming, with the plaintiff, that those cases might have application to some cases of bilateral employment contracts, it is the opinion of a majority of the court that those cases have no application in this case because of the particular contractual provisions agreed to by the parties. One of those provisions expressly provided that either party could terminate the contract \u201cat will and without cause.\u201d Another provision plainly contemplated that the defendant could change the plaintiff\u2019s territory and, in consequence thereof, his bonus entitlements after orders had been obtained.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Following the termination of the contract, the plaintiff was paid seventy-five percent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>bonuses arising from the cash registers ordered by First National and delivered within eighteen months. The plaintiff\u2019s contract entitled him to no more. The contract purports to set out in full the rights and obligations of both parties, and is binding upon them in accordance with its terms regardless of any undisclosed misunderstanding which the plaintiff might have entertained as to the powers of the defendant thereunder. See <em>Canney </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>353 Mass. 158, 165 (1967). We are not justified in rewriting the contract. <em>Van Dusen Aircraft Supplies of New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy. </em>361 Mass. 131, 143 (1972). \u201cIf there was hardship here, it was due to the contract itself and to its failure to afford the plaintiff more adequate protection against termination.\u201d <em>Shain </em>v. <em>Washington Natl. Ins. Co. </em>308 F. 2d 611, 616 (8th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">As to count three of the amended declaration, in which the plaintiff claims that the defendant \u201cowes him the reasonable value of services performed\u201d by him in connection with the First National order, there was no evidence that the defendant ever expressly or impliedly promised to pay the plaintiff the \u201creasonable value\u201d of any \u201cservices\u201d rendered by him. What the defendant promised was a bonus for orders obtained and deliveries made in accordance with, and subject to the conditions imposed by, the written contract. Either the defendant was liable for such a bonus or it was not liable at all. <em>Lattuca </em>v. <em>Cusolito, </em>343 Mass. at 752. <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Laverdure, </em>362 Mass. 828, 840 (1973). See <em>John T. Burns &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brasco, </em>327 Mass. at 263. It follows that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover under count three.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">This case was initially heard by a panel composed of the Chief Justice and Justices Goodman and Armstrong and was thereafter submitted on the record and briefs to Justice Grant (Justice Keville not participating) who took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>part in this decision in accordance with the provisions of Rule 1:18 of this court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-15\"> While the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was defective in that it failed to \u201cstate the specific grounds therefor\u201d (Mass.R.Civ.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>50[a], 365 Mass. 814 [1974]; <em>Moy </em>v. <em>Jack Madden Ford Sales, Inc. ante, </em>102, 107-108 [1976]), the defect was cured by the defendant\u2019s oral argument on the motion, which supplied the necessary detail (compare <em>Soares </em>v. <em>Lakeville Baseball Camp, Inc. </em>369 Mass. 974, 974-975 [1976]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> Other clauses provided that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cbonus interest shall be determined by the date of the order and whether the territory in which the sale is made <em>is </em>assigned to you for coverage or supervision at the date of delivery and installation, except in the case where the order does <em>not </em>include specific shipping and delivery instructions, in which case bonus credit shall vest in the salesman assigned to the territory at the date of delivery and installation ...

It must be clear that when employment is at will the employer is free to terminate ... at any time.\u201d 296 F. 2d at 18.

Y. 378 (1881). \u201cWhere the principal revokes the broker\u2019s authority in bad faith in order to secure to himself the fruits of the broker\u2019s work without paying him for it, the revocation, being in fraud of the broker\u2019s rights, is of no effect so far as those rights and the trade subsequently made are concerned.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>206 Mass. at 528. \u201cThe cases in which such bad faith has been found to exist are cases in which a sale has later been made.

But the majority reads out of the contract the \u201cimplied covenant [\u201cin every contract\u201d] that neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract, which means that in every contract there exists an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d <em>Druker </em>v. <em>Roland Wm.

Without a requirement of good faith dealing, such a future undertaking becomes not \u201cadditional compensation\u201d as the bonus structure is characterized in the \u201cSalesman\u2019s Contract\u201d, but illusory. <em>Blish </em>v. <em>Thompson Automatic Arms Corp. </em>30 Del. Ch. 538, 569 (Sup. Ct. 1948). See also Restatement 2d: Contracts, \u00a7 79, comment a (Tent. Drafts 1-7, 1973) (\u201cIllusory promises\u201d), and material cited from Restatement 2d: Contracts, \u00a7 254, Corbin, and Williston above.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Further, the implication in the majority opinion that parties may contract themselves out of an obligation of good faith dealing seems to me to be unsound. It runs counter to the Uniform Commercial Code which provides in c. 106, \u00a7 1-203 (tracked in \u00a7 231 of the Restatement 2d quoted above), that \u201c[ejvery contract or duty within this chapter imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement,\u201d and further (in \u00a7 1-102) that \u201cthe obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness and care prescribed by this chapter may not be disclaimed by agreement.\u201d Compare Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 575(1) (1932) (\u201cA bargain for exemption from liability for the consequences of a willful breach of duty is illegal...\u201d). Certainly employment contracts, in which the parties are probably less likely to have equal bargaining power, should not have less stringent guarantees of fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Finally, I see no distinction in principle between the present case and <em>RLM Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carter Mfg. Co. </em>356 Mass. 718 (1969), which, as the record in that case reveals, also involved a detailed, written \u201cagreement\u201d signed by both parties which could \u201cbe cancelled by either of the two parties upon thirty days written notice.\u201d That case seems to me to answer the suggestion in the majority opinion that a duty of good faith dealing may be applicable only to unilateral contracts and not ordinary bilateral con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>tracts. See also <em>Eastern Paper and Box Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Herz Mfg. Corp. </em>323 Mass. 138, 142 (1948). <em>RLM Associates </em>also disposes of the suggestion that the principle of good faith dealing is somehow restricted to the type of unjust enrichment usually found in the brokerage cases. In <em>RLM Associates </em>the court noted: \u201cRLM, entitled to a commission on any sale in the territory, was not bound to show to what extent it had contributed to obtaining the award____\u201d Furthermore, the record in this case discloses evidence from which the jury could have found that the plaintiff had cultivated the First National Stores account over a long period, and had laid the ground work for what he characterized as a \u201conce in a lifetime sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Because the jury could have believed that the defendant\u2019s termination of the plaintiff\u2019s contract was motivated by a desire to avoid the paying of commissions I believe the case was properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
