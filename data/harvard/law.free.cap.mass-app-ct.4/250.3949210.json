L. c. 32, \u00a7 3 (2) (g), the plaintiff\u2019s late husband (Gaw), who had been, until his death, manager of the Reading Municipal Light Department. The Reading contributory retirement board (local board), whose prior decision re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>garding Gaw\u2019s classification was upheld by the appeal board, intervened as a party defendant. The plaintiff appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court entered after July 1, 1974 (Mass.R.Civ.P. 1A, 365 Mass. 731 [1974]), affirming the decision of the appeal board.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The case turns on the proper construction of that portion of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3 (2) (g), as amended through St. 1970, c. 662, which directed retirement boards to classify members of their respective retirement systems in one of four numbered \u201cgroups.\u201d The question is whether Gaw should have been classified in Group 1, as decided by the two boards and the judge, or in Group 4, as contended by the plaintiff. Section 3(2) (g), as so amended, provided that Group 1 should consist of <em>\u201c\\o]fficials </em>and general employees including clerical, administrative and technical workers, laborers, mechanics <em>and all others not otherwise classified\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) and that Group 4 should include \u201cemployees of a municipal gas or electric plant who are employed as linemen, electric switchboard operators, electric maintenance men, steam engineers, boiler operators, firemen, oilers, mechanical maintenance men and <em>supervisors of said employees\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The importance of the dispute lies in the fact that persons classified in Group 4 attain maximum retirement allowances (see <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., ante, </em>1, 4, fn. 8 [1976]) at an earlier age than those classified in Group 1 (G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5[2] [a], as appearing in St. 1967, c. 826, \u00a7 6)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the fact that the plaintiff would be entitled to a correspondingly greater survivor\u2019s allowance if Gaw were so classified. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12 (2), as amended through St. 1968, c. 600, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The case is before us on the decision (including findings of fact) of the appeal board, a transcript of the testimony heard by the appeal board, various exhibits introduced in evidence before it, and findings of the judge. The facts as found by the appeal board and the judge are not in dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>and those facts, together with others drawn from the evidence, may be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">There were sixty-two persons employed by the Reading Municipal Light Department According to the official job specifications, there were several supervisory positions in the department. The highest ranking of those positions was that of manager, the position held by Gaw. \u201cThe manager [d]irect[ed] all activities of the [department, [and] perform [ed] duties as prescribed by law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>Under the manager was the general line foreman,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> who was responsible for \u201c[supervision of overhead and underground line crews\u201d and had \u201cdirect charge of construction, maintenance, operation and stores.\u201d Subordinate to the general line foreman was the line truck foreman or foremen, who had \u201ccharge of [a] line crew\u201d and \u201cwork[ed] with men under order of [the] [g]eneral [l]ine [f]oreman.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, the specifications refer to several classes of linemen, including linemen first class who, at least on occasion, super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>vised other linemen. On paper, then, there were several echelons of supervisory personnel interposed between the manager and the members of the line crews in the field. See <em>Maddocks </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>369 Mass. 488, 495 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">On the other hand, when Gaw served as manager of the department, he personally engaged in the direct supervision of line crews on a number of occasions, particularly during emergencies. But those activities were sporadic and secondary to the performance of his managerial functions as prescribed by the specifications and by statute (see fn. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The appeal board concluded, and the judge agreed, on the basis of those facts, that Gaw was not among the \u201cemployees of... [the Reading Municipal Light Department] who ... [were] employed as linemen [and the like] ... and supervisors of said employees\u201d contemplated for inclusion in Group 4 by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3 (2) <em>(g). </em>The plaintiff contends that it is irrelevant for purposes of the statute whether Gaw performed the field work sporadically or regularly and whether the performance of such work was a secondary or primary function. The crucial point, she asserts, is that he did perform such work and that its performance, though infrequent, qualified him for inclusion in Group 4. Our examination of \u00a7 3 (2) <em>(g) </em>in accordance with standard principles of statutory construction (see <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 [1975], and cases cited; <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 542, 546-547 [1976]) persuades us that the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation is not correct and that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">As originally created Group 4 included only \u201c[m] embers of police and fire departments not classified in Group 1.\u201d See St. 1967, c. 826, \u00a7 3. Its purpose, as explained in the special report of the Retirement Law Commission recommending it (1967 House Doc. No. 5316), was to encourage earlier retirement of police officers and firemen in order to make room for younger men better able to perform the arduous and hazardous tasks expected of such employees. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 16-21. Group 4 was thereafter enlarged by successive amendments to include the municipal light plant employees described in the clause at issue here (St. 1970, c. 662, \u00a72) and other classes of employees (St. 1968, c. 542, \u00a7 <em>2; </em>St. 1968, c. 650, \u00a7 <em>2; </em>St. 1969, c. 816) .<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is fair to assume that the additions were made for reasons similar to those underlying the creation of Group 4 in its original form. Apart from the clause at issue in the present case, we note that the Legislature has consistently described employees falling within Group 4 by naming their positions or titles rather than by describing the type of work they perform. See fn. 7. Subject to two exceptions, the same is true of those included in Group 2,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> who also enjoy an advantage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ous retirement status (see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5[2] [a], as appearing in St. 1967, c. 826, \u00a7 6) and many of whom have from time to time been transferred to Group 4 (see e.g., St. 1967, c. 826, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3; St. 1968, c. 542, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; St. 1968, c. 650, \u00a7\u00a7 1, <em>2; </em>St. 1970, c. 662, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2). Those exceptions, which appear in the last two classes of employees enumerated in Group 2 as reproduced in the margin (see fn. 8), are county and Commonwealth employees \u201cwhose regular and major duties <em>require </em>them\u201d (emphasis supplied) to perform certain tasks of a hazardous nature. But the difference between the clauses referred to and the remaining language of Group 2 is somewhat superficial, as one\u2019s eligibility for classification in Group 2 under the two clauses may depend largely on the job description of his position. See <em>Maddocks </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>369 Mass. at 495-497. Group 3, the remaining retirement classification group, which includes a single class of employees, certain \u201c[ojfficers and inspectors of the division of state police\u201d for whom special provision is made,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is also framed in terms of positions held rather than work performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Given that consistent pattern of legislative draftsmanship in characterizing those eligible under Groups 2, 3 and 4, we would expect to find, as we do, a similar approach in the language of the clause in Group 4 pertaining to em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ployees of municipal gas and electric plants. That clause does not by its terms apply to employees who <em>serve </em>as linemen and the like or as their supervisors, but rather to \u201cemployees\u201d of such a plant \u201cwho are employed\u201d in those capacities (emphasis supplied). Again, the test for eligibility is largely the employee\u2019s title or job description. To construe the clause otherwise would be to treat the word \u201cemployed\u201d as surplusage. Compare <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Assessors of Wenham, </em>350 Mass. 629, 632 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Our examination of the legislative history of that clause (see <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., ante, </em>1, 6-9 [1976]) supports the conclusion that a restrictive interpretation was intended. While the clause was inserted in Group 4 by St. 1970, c. 662, that was accomplished simply by shifting it, word for word, from Group 2, and the legislative history underlying the shift is not instructive. The events leading to the insertion of the clause in Group 2 by St. 1957, c. 255, however, are revealing. The bill on which it was based, as originally filed, applied to \u201cemployees of a municipal gas and electric plant who are engaged in work of a dangerous nature.\u201d 1957 House Doc. No. 2140. Had the clause been enacted in that form, the interpretation urged by the plaintiff would have much to support it. But the original formulation was rejected by the Senate, where the present wording, including the insertion of the phrase \u201cemployed as,\u201d was adopted as a floor amendment. 1957 Senate Journal, at 563, 589. See fn. 7. It therefore appears that the Legislature regarded the phrase as having some significance. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 355, fn. 2 (1974). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kraatz, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 196, 201 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The ultimate question is whether Gaw, as manager of the Reading Municipal Light Plant, was \u201cemployed as\u201d a supervisor of the types of personnel enumerated in \u00a7 3 (2) <em>(g), Group 4. </em>The appeal board answered that question in the negative. To the extent that its answer was a finding of fact, it was supported by substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>and must stand. Compare <em>Maddocks </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>369 Mass. at 495-496. To the extent that it was a ruling of law, we agree with the judge that it was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">While the words \u201csupervise\u201d and \u201cmanage\u201d are commonly used interchangeably (see <em>Fluet </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>299 Mass. 173, 179 [1938]; Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary, at 1372 [1971]), we believe that the Legislature intended the clause in question to refer only to the <em>immediate </em>supervisors of linemen and the like. An intention to exclude managers from the scope of the word \u201csupervisors\u201d may, at least in the case of most electric light departments, be inferred from the use of the phrase <em>\u201cemployees </em>of a municipal ... electric plant\u201d (emphasis supplied) to describe the class of persons covered. That phrase is at best inappropriate to describe the manager of an entire plant whose functions include the hiring of its employees. See fn. 4. Such an inference is also justified by the omission of the word \u201cmanager\u201d from the recitation of those included as employees. The manager of a municipal electric plant is a public officer <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>342 Mass. 82, 84 [1961]) whose position is created by statute (see fn. 4), and the Legislature, which is presumed to have been aware of those facts, could be expected to have made specific reference to the position if its inclusion had been intended. Compare <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 542, 546 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">It is true that there may be instances in which an electric plant is so small and has so few employees that its manager is required to serve regularly as the immediate supervisor of its field crews. But even assuming a manager of such a plant to be a \u201csupervisor\u201d within the meaning of Group 4, the interposition of various levels of authority between the manager of the Reading Municipal Light Department and its crews excluded Gaw from that category. The fact that Gaw supervised field work from time to time is not decisive. It is the function of this court on review to construe the statute as written and not to engage in ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>dicial legislation by extending its application to events or contingencies for which no provision has been made. <em>Id. </em>at 546-547.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-18\"> General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 14, as in effect prior to July 1,1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\"> Gaw was forty-nine years of age when he died on December 24, 1971.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b272-5\"> Under G.

Other evidence before the appeal board indicates that the department also had an assistant manager, who presumably ranked between the manager and the general line foreman. Moreover, the specifications which were introduced include the positions of superintendent of distribution and construction co-ordinator, each of which was assigned duties which suggest that its holder had supervisory authority over the general line foreman. But no finding was made as to the status of any of those three positions, and the evidence relative thereto is not sufficiently clear to warrant our supplying such a finding. We therefore omit those positions from consideration in determining the organizational structure of the department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> The testimony indicates that the department also had positions entitled substation supervisor, line superintendent and underground supervisor.
