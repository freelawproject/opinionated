L. c. 248, \u00a7 1, by the father of three minor children (whom he purported to include as copetitioners) to have his visitation rights restored. The respondents are the mother of the children, a probate judge, a \u201cfamily service officer\u201d and a court psychologist. The petition was brought in the Supreme Judicial Court and transferred by a single justice of that court to the Superior Court where, after a hearing, it was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The petitioner has appealed from an order allowing the respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-17\">The allegations of the petition (and documents appended thereto) are imprecise, but a fair distillation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the petitioner\u2019s complaint is that he and the children, by suspension of his visitation rights, have been unlawfully restrained from associating with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In May, 1973, the children\u2019s mother was granted a decree nisi of divorce from the petitioner and was given custody of the children. The petitioner was allowed visitation rights to be exercised under supervision of a \u201cfamily service officer,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one of the respondents here. Nine months later, the judge, who had granted the divorce and who is also a respondent, entered an ex parte order suspending the petitioner\u2019s visitation rights. After a full hearing held twenty-three days later on the petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate that order, the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In the circumstances of this case, habeas corpus is not an appropriate remedy to test the suspension of the petitioner\u2019s visitation rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petitioner does not assert that the judge or the family service officer or the court psychologist are either legal or physical custodians of the children, nor does he challenge the validity of the decree giving custody of the children to their mother. \u201c[Cjustody in the sense of restraint of liberty is a prerequisite to habeas, for the only remedy that can be granted on habeas is some form of discharge from custody.\u201d <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em>372 U. S. 391, 427, n.38 (1963). \u201cFrom the beginning habeas corpus has been the means by which one who claims to have been held in illegal custody of another has the right to have the legality of his custody determined. The writ proceeds against the custodian.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>dricks, </em>213 F. 2d 922, 926 (3d Cir.), cert. den. 348 U.

There is no such right. Parents\u2019 rights must yield to the best interests and welfare of their children. Although parents are the natural guardians of their minor children, their obligation to their children is in the nature of a trust reposed in them subject to their correlative duty of care and protection. The parents\u2019 right to associate with their children may be terminated by their failure to discharge those obligations. See <em>Purinton </em>v. <em>Jamrock, </em>195 Mass. 187, 201 (1907); <em>Tornroos </em>v. <em>R. H. White Co. </em>220 Mass. 336, 342 <em>(1915); Richards </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>278 Mass. 547, 553 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The obvious vulnerability of children to mistreatment at the hands of adults places a continuing responsibility upon the court in custody cases. <em>Pur-Shahriari </em>v. <em>Pur-Shahriari, </em>355 Mass. 632, 633 (1969). Orders for the care and custody of children are considered interlocutory in nature, subject to revision based upon changing circumstances and directed to the best interests of the children. G.
