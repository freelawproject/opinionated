L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23) to issue a comprehensive permit for the construction of 230 units of low and moderate income housing. The only contention made by the board in this court which has not already been decided adversely to it in <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm. </em>363 Mass. 339 (1973) (the <em>Hanover </em>case), or been waived by it<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is that one of the conditions contained in the order of the Housing Appeals Committee is invalid because it conflicts with provisions of the State Building Code and the law under which it was promulgated.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The condition in question provides in part<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that \u201c[i]n the event that disagreement between the builder and local officials arises, certification by the Department of Community Affairs, if requested, shall be adequate proof of compliance with any requirement under the Comprehensive Permit, or any of the other terms of this order.\u201d The board of appeals contends that, as compliance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>State Building Code is one of the express \u201cterms of this order\u201d (see fn. 3), the condition is intended to displace the procedure provided by the State Building Code for the resolution of disputes concerning compliance with its terms. That procedure provides that, in the event of such a dispute, any appeal by the builder is to be heard by the State Building Code Appeals Board or, in some instances, by a local or regional appeals board with a further appeal to the State Building Code Appeals Board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Conditions similar to the one at issue in this case were included in the two orders of the Housing Appeals Committee reviewed in the <em>Hanover </em>case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> both of which preceded the effective date<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the State Building Code; consequently, we should have questioned whether the condition was meant to apply to disputes concerning compliance with the State Building Code had the Housing Appeals Committee not stated in its decision that that was in fact what it did intend. \u201cTo the extent that... [the order in question in this case] may differ from the administrative provisions of the new [S]tate [B]uilding [C]ode, the or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>der of the [Housing Appeals Committee] shall take priority, and resolutions of local disputes between the developer and the town will be resolved pursuant to that order.\u201d Again, in an effort to avoid a conflict, we might have assumed that the phrase \u201clocal disputes\u201d meant disputes concerning local requirements only; but the decision <em>explicitly </em>blocked this path, making it clear that the condition was intended to apply to disputes concerning the application of the provisions of the State Building Code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The conclusion is inescapable that the condition at issue was intended to, and would, have the effect of displacing the procedure provided by the State Building Code for the resolution of disputes concerning its provisions between the builder or developer on the one hand and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>local building inspector, who is the designated enforcement officer of the code,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The <em>Hanover </em>case held that G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, gave the Housing Appeals Committee \u201cthe authority to override local requirements and regulations ... including zoning ordinances or by-laws.\u201d 363 Mass. at 354-355. We find nothing in those sections or in the <em>Hanover </em>case which suggests that the Housing Appeals Committee has been empowered to override or ignore laws passed by the Legislature or regulations validly promulgated by the Commonwealth\u2019s various boards, departments, agencies or commissions. The position of the Housing Appeals Committee seems, at most, to be that such a power would be helpful in effectuating the legislative purpose underlying \u00a7\u00a7 20-23. That is quite possibly true,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but it is not a basis for this court to invest the Housing Appeals Committee with powers beyond those given it by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We hold, therefore, that the third condition appearing in the decision of the Housing Appeals Committee is in excess of its authority; and for that reason (and no other) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the judgment affirming the decision is reversed. The Superior Court, retaining jurisdiction, shall enter an order remanding the case for further proceedings by the Housing Appeals Committee not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The case was argued before Keville, Goodman and Armstrong, JJ., and was thereafter submitted on the record and briefs to all the other Justices pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 24 (a), 365 Mass. 872 (1974).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b697-5\"> We refer particularly to its argument that the defendant Planning Office for Urban Affairs, Inc., is not a proper applicant for a comprehensive permit under G.

The Appellant\u2019s counsel expressed great concern that any comprehensive permit which might be ordered by the board of appeals could delegate to local building officials the inspection powers to assure compliance with the building code, be it BOCA or the State Building Code. Mr. Gorman, Chairman of the Housing Appeals Committee, set forth the basis of the policy of the Committee concerning inspection by local officials and resolution of possible disputes arising from the inspections needed for compliance with the code in the construction process .... It would be unreasonable to expect that the local board of appeals would have the expertise or the time to conduct compliance inspections under the comprehensive permit issued by the board of appeals. The most logical way to implement the necessary inspection process is the delegation to the local inspection agencies, i.e., building inspector, public works inspector, etc. of the duty to make such inspections as are necessary to assure adequate construction and development of the site. Where a comprehensive permit is granted by vacating the denial of the local board of appeals and overruling their decision in action by the [Housing Appeals Committee]; the possibility of the remnants of local adversary relationship existing is something which must be considered. Therefore, disputes between the local building inspector and the developer are best not handled on the local level, but should be decided by an unbiased arbitrator. In our previous cases we have always provided that such disputes will be handled and disposed of by the state agency best equipped to respond to such matters, the Department of Community Affairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\"> General Laws c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 3A. In addition, section 108.1 of the code provides that the \u201cinspector of buildings and the local inspector shall enforce all the provisions of the Basic Code and any other applicable state statutes, rules and regulations, or ordinances and by-laws, and act on any question relative to the mode or manner of construction, and the materials to be used in the construction ... of all buildings and structures ... except as may otherwise be specifically provided for by statutory requirements or as herein provided.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\"> There was a colloquy during the hearing in which the chairman of the Housing Appeals Committee opined that a local zoning board of appeals, having been overruled and ordered to issue a comprehensive permit, is apt to remain hostile to the project; the town counsel for North Andover responded that an appeal of the type we are concerned with would not be heard by the zoning board of appeals but by a local building code appeals board newly appointed under the authority of \u00a7 126.81 of the State Building Code, \u00a7 126.82 of which provides that \u201c[e]ach member of a local board of appeals established under section 126.81 shall have had at least five (5) years experience in the construction, alteration, repair and maintenance of building and building codes. At least one (1) member shall be a registered structural or civil professional engineer and one (1) member a licensed professional architect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b701-6\">Goodman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5E\">(dissenting, with whom Brown, J. concurs) . We see no occasion in this case to determine how condition no. 3<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> relates to the two provisions (\u00a7 108.1 and \u00a7 126.1) of the State Building Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>board of appeals (board) asserts to be inconsistent with that condition. Section 108.1 concerns only the local building inspector, who was not a party to the administrative proceeding before the Housing Appeals Committee (committee) or to this action. The parties to the administrative proceeding were the board and the applicant; and the order issued by the committee was directed to the board. Further, there is no present conflict between \u00a7 126.1 and condition no. 3 of the committee\u2019s order which requires our intervention. The comprehensive permit which the order required the board to issue mandates by condition no. 1 (see fn. 1) construction according to the State Building Code. If there should arise a conflict as to compliance with the State Building Code which arguably calls into question the duties and responsibilities of the building inspector, it will then be time enough to adjudicate the extent to which, if any, condition no. 3 is relevant. Its relationship to the State Building Code should await a concrete situation in which its application is in issue. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Norwood, </em>358 Mass. 253, 264 (1970). <em>Lugo </em>v. <em>Employees Retirement Fund of the Illumination Prod. Indus. </em>529 F.2d 251, 257-258 (1976), cert. den. 429 U.S. 826 (1976). See <em>County of Middlesex </em>v. <em>Gevyn Constr. Corp. </em>450 F.2d 53, 55 (1971). This disposition is particularly appropriate here because the plaintiff\u2019s brief does no more than cite the two sections of the building code without any attempt at analysis. See Mass.R.A.P. 16 (a) (4), as amended effective February 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>1975, 367 Mass. 921; <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>New England Power Co. </em>359 Mass. 119, 126-127 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">However, since the majority opinion casts doubt on the authority of a zoning appeals board and the committee to enforce building requirements under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, sometimes called the Anti-Snob Zoning Act, we deem it necessary to state our views:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We see nothing in the State Building Code or the enabling legislation (see fn. 2) \u2014 and nothing has been suggested\u2014 which changed the powers of a local building inspector to enforce building requirements as such powers existed prior to the enabling legislation. And adoption, after the Anti-Snob Zoning Act, of provisions which existed before its adoption does not affect that statute. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>361 Mass. 897, 899 (1972). \u201cThe revision of statutes already existing is to be interpreted as a continuation of the earlier provisions, unless there is a clear indication of a legislative intent to change the meaning [citations omitted].\u201d <em>Longyear </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>265 Mass. 585, 588 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The general constraints added by St. 1972, c. 802, on the building inspector to enforce a uniform State building code rather them a local code (see G. L. c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 3A) subject to supervision by a State inspector (G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3A; G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 4A) are not inconsistent with the conditions in the order of the committee (see fn. 1). Condition no. 1 of the order requires construction in accordance with the State Building Code and condition no. 3 is confined to \u201cdisagreement [s] between the builder and <em>local </em>officials\u201d (emphasis supplied); it does not purport to affect the powers of State officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">We do not infer from the enactment of the State Building Code, subsequent to the Anti-Snob Zoning Act, that the entire subject matter of building requirements has been withdrawn from the authority given a local zoning board of appeals under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, to issue a comprehensive permit (which authority is also given to the committee, <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>363 Mass. 339, 355 [1973]), so that in effect the words \u201cbuilding inspector\u201d have been excised from the definition of \u201cLocal Board\u201d in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, and the third sentence of G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, has been repealed pro tanto.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">It rather seems to us that, despite the uniformities imposed by the State Building Code on the traditionally local building requirements, they are still \u201clocal requirements\u201d within the <em>Hanover </em>case (at 354-355) to the extent that they are \u2014 apart from the Anti-Snob Zoning Act \u2014 administered by local building inspectors as well as to the extent that \u2014 under the Anti-Snob Zoning Act \u2014 such administration has been conferred upon local zoning boards or (in default of proper administration by a zoning board) upon the committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Our conclusion that the State Building Code and the statutory provisions for enforcement by local building inspectors do not oust the committee of jurisdiction is buttressed by the way the <em>Hanover </em>case dealt with sewage disposal controlled by the State Sanitary Code (see G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 127A). Though the local board of health is given authority by that statute to enforce the State Sanitary Code (in addition to local requirements) the <em>Hanover </em>case (at 381, 382-383) permitted the Housing Appeals Committee to override the rejection by local officials (in that case the zoning board of appeals) of drainage and sewage disposal plans. It specifically upheld the condition imposed by the Housing Appeals Committee that \u201cproposed provisions for drainage and sewage disposal have received approval from the appropriate state authorities\u201d (the <em>Hanover </em>case, at 372-373, fn. 22, condition no. 1 for the town of Hanover). Compare condition no. 1 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>committee\u2019s order in this case (fn. 1). See <em>Board of Appeals of Maynard </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm. </em>370 Mass. 64, 68-69 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">If, as we maintain, the comprehensive permit, which the committee has ordered the board to issue, validly includes a building permit, condition no. 3 is merely ancillary to the administration of that building permit. The committee recognized in its decision that the board as a practical matter would be obliged to delegate the supervision of compliance to various local inspectors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And this is the point to the first sentence in condition no. 3: \u201cCompliance inspections shall be carried out by local officials in the usual manner.\u201d Where a comprehensive permit has been issued in the first instance by a zoning appeals board under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, any disputes between the builder and local officials to whom the board has delegated the task of compliance supervision would be settled by the board. In this case, where the board has been recalcitrant and the committee was obliged to order the issuance of a comprehensive permit, the committee has decided to take the resolution of such disputes from the board; but instead of exercising this power directly as the surrogate of the board (see the <em>Hanover </em>case, at 355) it has lodged this power to settle local disputes in the Department of Community Affairs, apparently in its construction division.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this context the certification in condition no. 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>does nothing more than bind the committee and the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Our view that the Anti-Snob Zoning Act has continued vitality in the area of building requirements need not impinge on the power of State officials to exercise their statutory authority to enforce the State Building Code at the behest of the building inspector or of anyone else for that matter. Nor need we decide whether the building inspector, who is not a party to this action, may become a person \u201caggrieved\u201d under \u00a7 126.1 (see fn. 2), and G. L. c. 23B, \u00a7 23, inserted by St. 1972, c. 802, \u00a7 1 (see fn. 4 of majority opinion), by the future action of the committee (which may indeed, by virtue of the Anti-Snob Zoning Act, be, in a limited way, a \u201cstate... agency charged with the administration or enforcement of the state building code\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\"> The order of the Housing Appeals Committee provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">\u201cSaid Comprehensive Permit shall be subject to the following further conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">\u201c1.
