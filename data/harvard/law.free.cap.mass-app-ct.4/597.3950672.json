L. c. 152, \u00a7 11. The facts are before us in the form of a statement of the evidence in accordance with Mass.R.A.P. 8 (c), 365 Mass. 849 (1974). The portions of the evidence relevant to this appeal are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">The plaintiff injured his back on October 5,1973, in the course of his employment with the defendant. A claim for workmen\u2019s compensation was filed on February 22, 1974. Following a conference on May 23, 1974, a member of the Division of Industrial Accidents, acting pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7 (as amended through St. 1972, c. 742, \u00a7 1), entered an order, dated June 14, 1974, directing that the plaintiff be paid \u201ctemporary total incapacity compensation\u201d at the rate of eighty dollars a week pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34 (as amended through St. 1971, c. 879, \u00a7 4), covering the period from October 5, 1973, to April 18, 1974. Due to inadvertence and mistake the defendant, a self-insurer, did not make payment as ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">On August 27,1974, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court which sought the following: (1) a judgment ordering the defendant to comply with the order of payment; (2) attorney\u2019s fees and costs for the Superior Court proceeding; (3) a ten per cent increase in workmen\u2019s compensation benefits for unreasonable delay in payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">On September 9, 1974, the defendant sent $2,240, directly to the plaintiff, which amount represented twenty-eight weeks of total incapacity compensation at the rate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>eighty dollars a week, as ordered by the member. On September 17, 1974, the defendant filed an answer which specifically denied each of the claims and also asserted payment of the amount ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">On October 21, 1974, a Superior Court judge dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and ordered entry of judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s attorney is precluded from presenting his claims for an attorney\u2019s lien (G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50) and for interest on the award (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50), as neither of those claims was asserted in the complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such claims are not properly before us as they were not before the trial judge. <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn. </em>365 Mass. 368, 379 (1974) .<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The refusal of the trial judge to hear the plaintiff\u2019s claim for an increase in the amount of the award for unreasonable delay in payment was correct. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 7E, as amended by St. 1972, c. 188, which provides for such an increase, also provides that the aggrieved party seek such an increase from the \u201cboard, reviewing board or single member.\u201d The Superior Court is without jurisdiction over a claim made under \u00a7 7E until an order made pursuant to it has been certified to the Superior Court. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11, as amended through St. 1972, c. 742, \u00a7 5. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 16. See <em>Broderick\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 149, 150 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">However, that part of the complaint seeking attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in connection with the Superior Court proceeding was not rendered moot by the defendant\u2019s compliance with the order for payment, which was not made until after the action had been commenced. \u201cIf any party in interest presents certified copies to the superior court... for the purpose of enforcing decisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the board or a member made in his favor, the court shall ... allow such party the fees, briefs and expenses provided for by this section.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, as amended through St. 1957, c. 693, \u00a7 3. The complaint should not have been dismissed until that issue had been disposed of. See <em>Lambert's Case, </em>325 Mass. 516, 519 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\"> For the same reason, we need not decide whether G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50, applies to a case such as this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b619-9\"> For a discussion of enforcement of claims for attorney\u2019s fees in workmen\u2019s compensation cases see Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 634, at 749 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
