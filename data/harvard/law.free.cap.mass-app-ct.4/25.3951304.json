L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 [7], as amended through St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3) which affirmed a decision of the Board of Registration in Pharmacy (board) which purports (a) to suspend the certificates of registration and renewal of registration of the individual plaintiff (Kearney) as a pharmacist (G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 24A, 27 and 28) and (b) to suspend both the regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>tration of the corporate plaintiff (Epray) to dispense controlled substances (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 13) and its permit to conduct a retail drug business (G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 37-40). The charges which were levelled against Kearney, all of which were sustained by the board, appear in the board\u2019s letter of July 2, 1973, which is reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3No charges were ever advanced against Epray, in whose drugstore Kearney worked as a pharmacist.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><em>a. The Kearney appeal. </em>The first charge set out in the aforementioned letter clearly rests on some rule or regulation promulgated by the board, possibly under the authority of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 42A, as most recently amended by St. 1970, c. 584. Each of the statutory provisions cited in the second through fifth charges (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 17 [a] and [c],<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 20 and 23 [d]) is concerned with the dispensing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>of a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d (as defined in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1), and each of those charges rests on one or more regulations. Unless or until we are advised of the manner and extent in and to which the Commissioner of Public Health (commissioner), or the commissioner and the board acting jointly, have exercised the regulatory powers committed to them, respectively, by the provisions of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4, we shall be unable to tell which (if any) of the drugs referred to in the evidence in this case is a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d or, if so, how it has been scheduled. The sixth charge may also rest on regulations to the extent that it is based on one or more of the first five charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">No rule or regulation of the board or the commissioner was set out in the evidence or otherwise made a part of the transcript of the proceedings before the board. No such rule or regulation appears to have been brought to the attention of the Superior Court (see <em>Finlay </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Assn. </em>308 Mass. 20, 26-28 <em>[1941]; White </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>347 Mass. 367, 373 [1964]; <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>348 Mass. 491, 494-495, 496 [1965]; <em>York </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>369 Mass. 157, 160 [1975]), nor has a stipulation as to any such been presented to us (see <em>Gentile, petitioner, </em>339 Mass. 319, 320-321 [1959]; <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Acting Director of Pub. Welfare, </em>355 Mass. 182, 183, n. 2 [1969]; <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>359 Mass. 175, 177, n. 2 [1971]; <em>Pomeroy </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 177, 184, n.4 [1975]). In such circumstances we shall not take judicial notice of any rule or regulation which might be relevant. <em>Diaduk\u2019s Case, </em>336 Mass. 5, 6-7 (1957). <em>York </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>369 Mass. 157, 160, n.2 (1975). The resulting hiatus leaves us in a position where we are unable to determine whether the board\u2019s decision is (1) \u201caccompanied by a statement of reasons ... [therefor], including [a] determination of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>issue of fact or law necessary ... [thereto]\u201d (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11[8]), (2) \u201c[b]ased upon an error of law\u201d (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14[7] [c]), (3) supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 1[6] and 14[7] [e]; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 251, 253 [1966]), or (4) \u201c[arbitrary or capricious [or] an abuse of discretion\u201d (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14[7] [g]). <em>Compare Hamilton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>346 Mass. 130, 137 (1963); <em>New York Central R.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>347 Mass. 586, 592-593 (1964); <em>School Comm. of Chicopee </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>361 Mass. 352, 353-355 (1972). Contrast <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>354 Mass. 332, 336-337 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">A study of the transcript in this case discloses several instances of uncertainty during the course of the hearing as to what rules or regulations were or might have been applicable to the evidence before the board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that the charges against Kearney should be heard anew. See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Chiropody (Podiatry) </em>, 343 Mass. 536, 539-541 (1962). Compare <em>Kneeland Liquor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>345 Mass. 228, 235-236 (1962). Contrast <em>Akers Motor Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>344 Mass. 359, 362-363 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The board is to give Kearney reasonable notice (preferably in writing) in advance of the rehearing of all the rules or regulations of the board or the commissioner on which the board wishes to rely at the hearing (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11[1]), and all such rules or regulations are to be made parts of the record. The board is also to give Kearney like notice of the facts relied on in support of the sixth charge. See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>239 Mass. 424, 426-427 (1921); <em>Ott </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>276 Mass. 566, 573 (1931); <em>For</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>ziati </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>333 Mass. 125, 126-127 (1955). We trust that the Attorney General will participate in the further proceedings and will advise the board of its burden of proving the charges which it will continue to press. See <em>Matter of Mayberry, </em>295 Mass. 155, 156-157,167-168 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><em>b. The Epray appeal. </em>The only charges ever formulated by the board are those which are set out in note 2 hereof, <em>supra. </em>They were clearly addressed to Kearney and not to Epray. The only notice of any hearing was addressed solely \u201c[t]o Robert Kearney of Stoneham in the county of Middlesex.\u201d And yet the decision of the board purported to suspend Epray\u2019s registration to dispense controlled substances as well as its permit to conduct a retail drug business. Such a registration may be suspended only \u201cafter a hearing pursuant to the provisions of chapter thirty A\u201d (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 13[a]) in proceedings which are clearly \u201cadjudicatory\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 1(1) and 11. Proceedings to suspend a permit to conduct a retail drug business require the board to \u201cgive a hearing to the holder of the permit, after due notice to him of the charges against him and of the time and place of the hearing\u201d (G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 40) and are likewise \u201cadjudicatory.\u201d <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>348 Mass. 491, 494 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">There having been no compliance with the notice requirements of either G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(1), or G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 40, so much of the board\u2019s decision as purports to discipline Epray must be set aside as \u201c[mjade upon unlawful procedure\u201d (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 [7] [d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed. A new judgment is to be entered which sets aside so much of the decision of the board as purports to relate to Epray. Compare Mass. R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974). So much of the board\u2019s decision as relates to Kearney is also to be set aside, but that aspect of the case is to be remanded to the board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The Superior Court is to retain jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>tion over those proceedings. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Plumbers, post, </em>767, 768 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b46-5\"> July 2, 1973</p>\n<p id=\"AFF\">Robert Kearney</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Epray Drug, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">93 Main Street</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">Stoneham, Mass.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Dear Mr. Kearney:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Recent inspection of Epray Drug, Inc.

Oral prescriptions lacked information required by Sec. 20 of Chap. 94C G. L. 3. Illegal sales of Valium 5 mg. during period beginning January 1, 1973 to June 1, 1973 (Chap. 94C \u2014 Sec. 17(d) G. L.) 4. Prescriptions for Schedule III were filled which called for amounts in excess of a thirty (30) day supply. (Chap. 94C \u2014 Sec. 23(d). 5. Schedule II prescriptions were filled by telephone order in violation of Chap. 94C \u2014 Sec. 17(a). 6. Violations of Chapter 112 G. L. Sec. 61 (malpractice and gross misconduct in the practice of the profession.) A hearing before the Board will be forthcoming.
