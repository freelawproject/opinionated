Prior to trial the defendant moved, <em>inter alia, </em>to suppress certain statements, identification testimony and physical evidence \"upon the ground that such evidence was obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights\u201d. Combined <em>Huntley </em>and <em>Wade </em>hearings were held and the court subsequently denied the motions to suppress the admissions, the alleged murder weapon and the in-court identifications while granting the motions to suppress a tape recording of an interview between the police and the defendant, and a jacket allegedly worn by him. In doing so, the court made no factual findings and arrived at no conclusions on the issue of probable cause to arrest the defendant who argues that the legality of his arrest was at issue in the suppression hearing and that the People failed to sustain their burden of proof in that regard <em>(Dunaway v New York, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>442 US 200; <em>People v Lypka, </em>36 NY2d 210). Accordingly, we remit the matter for a hearing and appropriate findings on this issue. (Appeal from judgment of Erie Supreme Court \u2014 murder, second degree.) Present \u2014 Cardamone, J.
