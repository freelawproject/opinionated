Order reversed, without costs or disbursements, and matter remanded for a hearing consistent herewith. Plaintiff was injured when the taxicab in which she and her husband were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>passengers allegedly struck another vehicle in the rear. Plaintiff claims that her brother personally and timely notified an unidentified police officer of the accident as required by statute (see Insurance Law, \u00a7 608, subd [b]), although concededly, the police department denies having any record of the accident. Plaintiff also claims she made all reasonable efforts to identify the vehicle involved, its owner and operator, but was unable to do so because she and her husband do not understand the English language. MVAIC counters that taxicabs are required to display identification, which should have been noted by plaintiff or her husband. Neither plaintiff\u2019s husband nor her brother submitted affidavits in support of her application. In our opinion, triable issues of fact are presented as to whether the required notification to the police department was given (see <em>Matter of Edwards v MVAIC, </em>36 AD2d 841), and whether all reasonable efforts were made to ascertain the identity of the motor vehicle involved and the owner and operator thereof (see <em>Matter of O\u2019Rourke v MVAIC, </em>29 AD2d 938). Mollen, P. J., Cohalan, O\u2019Connor and Weinstein, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
