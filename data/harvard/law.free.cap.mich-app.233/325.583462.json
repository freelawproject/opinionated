Plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal to our Supreme Court was held in abeyance pending the resolution of <em>Kerbersky v Northern Michigan Univ </em>(Supreme Court Docket No. 105234). In light of its July 30, 1998, decision in <em>Kerbersky, </em>found at 458 Mich 525; 582 NW2d 828 (1998), our Supreme Court, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, remanded this matter to us so we may reconsider our decision in light of <em>Kerbersky. </em>459 Mich 881 (1998). On remand, we must conclude that the rationale underlying our previous decision does not reflect the Supreme Court\u2019s current statement of the law as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>set forth in <em>Kerbersky. </em>We further conclude, however, that in light of <em>Kerbersky, </em>issues of fact exist regarding whether the construction of the drain adjacent to the inmates\u2019 shower, or a defect in the drainage system, constituted a \u201cdangerous or defective condition of the public building itself.\u201d Accordingly, we vacate our prior opinion, reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition, and remand this matter for further proceedings and evidence to determine whether the shower area itself constituted a dangerous or defective condition of the jail, which is a public building.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">In <em>Kerbersky, supra </em>at 527-528, a worker was injured when he fell from a ladder permanently attached to a building on the defendant university\u2019s campus during a renovation project involving the building. Kerbersky filed suit against the defendant university and others, alleging a negligence or premises liability theory and the application of the public building exception to governmental immunity. <em>Id. </em>Our Supreme Court determined that requiring a plaintiff to \u201cprove he was injured in a \u2018public area\u2019 of a public building has no basis in the [public building exception to governmental immunity] statute,\u201d MCL 691.1406; MSA 3.996(106).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 537 (Kelly, J., concurring). In short, the Supreme Court concluded that if the building in which the plaintiff is injured is a public building open for use by members of the public, regardless of whether the <em>situs </em>of the accident is accessible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the public, the plaintiff should be able to invoke the public building exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Having decided this case before <em>Kerbersky </em>and pursuant to then-existing case law, we concluded in our prior opinion that \u201cthe shower area <em>where plaintiff fell </em>is not \u2018open for use by members of the public\u2019 or accessible to members of the general public,\u201d so the public building exception did not apply. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 368 (emphasis added). Clearly, through <em>Kerbersky, </em>the Supreme Court has established a new, expanded area of focus in public building exception cases, i.e., the public nature of the <em>building </em>where the accident occurred rather than the public nature of the <em>accident site </em>within the building where the accident occurred, is the critical inquiry. We therefore must follow the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent pronouncement on the subject and vacate our previous opinion because it conflicts directly with <em>Kerbersky.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition on governmental immunity grounds, reinstate plaintiff\u2019s public building exception claims, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-5\"> The majority opinion chronicles this Court\u2019s opinions issued after <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567; 363 NW2d 641 (1984), commenting on their continued viability, but none of those cases involved facts similar to those presented in <em>Kerbersky </em>or in the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
