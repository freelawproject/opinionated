(Health and Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377, subd. (a).) The trial court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>that defendant had four robbery convictions and one burglary conviction within the meaning of Penal Code sections 667, subdivision (d), and 1170.12, the three strikes law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court imposed a term of 25 years to life in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">On appeal, defendant contends (1) the trial court erred by admitting evidence of a tattoo on the person of defendant\u2019s wife, a witness in his defense, because the evidence was more prejudicial than probative under Evidence Code section 352; (2) the court erred by not instructing the jury sua sponte on CALJIC No. 12.06 regarding the defense of transitory possession; (3) serious felony convictions incurred before March 7, 1994, the effective date of the three strikes law, may not count as \u201cstrikes\u201d; (4) the three strikes law is unconstitutionally vague; (5) this case must be remanded for the trial court to exercise its discretion under section 1385, subdivision (a) by considering whether to strike the prior conviction allegations; and (6) the sentence imposed constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">Sacramento city police officers conducted a parole search of defendant\u2019s residence in January 1995. Defendant\u2019s wife, Heather Frazier, was present during the search. A narcotics smoking pipe was found in a dresser drawer in defendant\u2019s bedroom. Officers found a plastic baggie containing methamphetamine on the headboard of defendant\u2019s bed. Another plastic baggie containing methamphetamine was found on the closet shelf in the bedroom. The headboard baggie contained .27 grams and the baggie in the closet contained .07 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">At trial, Heather testified defendant\u2019s brother, Carl, had visited their house and had brought with him a shotgun and three ounces of methamphetamine. She admitted that at the time of the search, she had a tattoo on the back of her neck that read, \u201cAaron\u2019s Bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">Defendant testified that he was still married to Heather. He said after his brother visited his house the day before the search, he found a small amount of methamphetamine on the dining room table. Defendant assumed the drugs belonged to his brother. He handed the drugs and the pipe to Heather and told her to get rid of them. He did not check to see whether Heather disposed of the drugs as instructed. Defendant could not explain how the methamphetamine ended up in his bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">Defendant contends the trial court had a duty to instruct the jury sua sponte on CALJIC No. 12.06 regarding the defense of transitory possession. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">The background of the development of CALJIC No. 12.06 was definitively explained by the Sixth Appellate District in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hurtado </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 805, 810-812 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 853] from which we quote at length:</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\"><em>\u201c[People </em>v. <em>Mijares </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 415 [99 Cal.Rptr. 139, 491 P.2d 1115]] was the impetus for the initial version of CALJIC No. 12.06, \u2018Momentary Possession as Not Unlawful,\u2019 which provided that possession of an item is not unlawful where all four of the following conditions were met: (1) possession is \u2018momentary\u2019 and \u2018based on neither ownership nor the right to exercise control over\u2019 the item; (2) the item is \u2018possessed in furtherance of its abandonment or destruction\u2019; (3) the item is possessed \u2018for the purpose of terminating the unlawful possession of it by another person or preventing another person from acquiring possession of it\u2019; and (4) \u2018control is not exercised over the [item] for the purpose of preventing its imminent seizure by law enforcement.\u2019 (CALJIC No. 12.06 (5th ed. bound vol.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">\u201cCALJIC No. 12.06 was revised in 1989 based on <em>People </em>v. <em>Cole </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1439 [249 Cal.Rptr. 601], in which the Second District concluded that the holding of <em>Mijares </em>\u2018is not limited to possession for \u201cbrief moments\u201d only, but that possession of illegal drugs solely for the purpose of disposal does not constitute unlawful possession.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1445, italics omitted.) Cole\u2019s defense was that he had seized cocaine from his teenage daughter and had placed it in his safe while he and his wife decided how to dispose of it. The cocaine was found in the safe by police a day later. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1442.) The court concluded that the trial court had erred by giving instructions by which the jury might have accepted Cole\u2019s claim that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>only \u2018momentarily handled the cocaine for purposes of disposal or abandonment\u2019 yet felt compelled to convict him because \u2018the drugs were in his constructive possession in the safe for more than \u201cbrief moments. . . .\u201d \u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">\u201cThe revised instruction, renamed \u2018Possession-Not Unlawful,\u2019 deleted reference to \u2018momentary possession\u2019 and added a paragraph stating, \u2018Length of time of possession is one of the factors that may be considered in deciding whether the defendant physically handled the substance solely for abandonment, disposal, or destruction.\u2019 (CALJIC No. 12.06 (1989 rev.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">\u201cWhile the Comment to the 1989 version of CALJIC No. 12.06 advises that the revision is based on <em>Cole\u2019s </em>conclusion that \u2018. . . while <em>People </em>v. <em>Mijares </em>factually only involved a momentary handling, ... the critical issue was not the length of time of the handling but whether the defendant physically handled the substance solely for the purpose of disposal,\u2019 the Use Note to the 1989 version advises that \u2018[i]n <em>People </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1989) 215 C.A.3d 1446, ... the court took issue with [Cole], and concluded that decision unreasonably extended the <em>Mijares </em>rule.\u2019 The Use Note then explains that \u2018[a]s a result, there is a split in appellate authority and the trial court must choose between CALJIC 12.06, as found in the bound volume, and the 1989 revision, which is based upon the Cole case.\u2019 (Use Note and Comment to CALJIC No. 12.06 (1989 rev.) (5th ed. pocket pt.) pp. 10-11.)\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">As noted above, the <em>Sullivan </em>court rejected the approach of <em>Cole </em>and offered a compelling rationale: \u201cMijares\u2019s rule arose from a situation involving a fleeting, de minimis possession and a reflexive act of abandonment. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding was that this de minimis possession and reflexive response was not a criminal possession[.] [T]his rule is one which is an understandable and simple rule. <em>Cole </em>complicates the rule by bringing in inquiries into the defendant\u2019s subjective intent in possessing the contraband. These inquiries are not suggested by <em>Mijares </em>or supported by the language of the statute. Mijares\u2019s focus was on the fleeting nature of the possession (during the instant of abandonment), not on the subjective mental state of the defendant. The statute makes possession illegal without regard to the specific intent in possessing the substance. We conclude the <em>Cole </em>court misinterpreted the <em>Mijares </em>decision and erred in deleting the \u2018momentary\u2019 possession requirement. We therefore decline to follow <em>Cole, </em>preferring instead to apply pure <em>Mijares.\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1446, 1452 [264 Cal.Rptr.284].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>We agree with the <em>Sullivan </em>court. In doing so, we are not alone.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Sixth Appellate District in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hurtado </em>adopted the <em>Sullivan </em>rationale in a case involving illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. (\u00a7 12021, subd. (a).) There, the son of defendant\u2019s girlfriend gave him a loaded weapon the boy had found lying on the ground. Defendant intended to get rid of the gun but still had it in his possession three days later when he was stopped for a traffic violation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hurtado, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th at pp. 808-809.) The <em>Hurtado </em>court unequivocally sided with <em>Sullivan. </em>\u201cLike the trial court in this case, we also find the <em>Sullivan </em>analysis persuasive. Recognition of the \u2018momentary possession\u2019 defense serves the purpose of encouraging disposal and discouraging retention of dangerous items such as controlled substances and firearms. However, expansion of the defense to lengthier possession incidental to a defendant\u2019s \u2018intent\u2019 to dispose of those items rewrites the statutory requirements by introducing a new element of \u2018specific intent to retain.\u2019 We are not authorized to so revise the Legislature\u2019s description of a criminal offense. Therefore, in a case in which a defendant is entitled to an instruction on temporary possession for disposal, we conclude the trial court should instruct pursuant to the original version of CALJIC No. 12.06 based upon <em>Mijares.\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Hurtado, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th at p. 814; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Pepper </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1036-1038 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 877], ruling the momentary possession defense does not apply to a violation of section 12021 except when the firearm is possesed momentarily in self-defense, in defense of others, or as a result of legal necessity.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">In this case, the evidence shows that defendant found methamphetamine in his house the night before his house was searched. According to his own testimony, defendant gave the drugs and smoking pipe to his wife and told her to get rid of them. However, a baggie containing methamphetamine was found by the investigating officers several hours later sitting in plain view upon the headboard of defendant\u2019s bed. Moreover, another bag of methamphetamine was found on a shelf in the closet of defendant\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Therefore, defendant\u2019s possession, which was neither fleeting nor personally for the purpose of abandonment, disposal, or destruction, does not meet the requirements of the <em>Mijares </em>rule. Defendant\u2019s lengthy possession of the contraband denied him the right to a momentary possession instruction despite his stated intent to get rid of the drugs. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by failing to give sua sponte the momentary possession instruction derived from <em>Mijares.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>III-VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">Puglia, P.
