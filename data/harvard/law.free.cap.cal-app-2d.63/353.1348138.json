J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuF\">The County of Orange sued the Serrano Irrigation District and a sand and gravel company, FST Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. (Frank Smith Trucking), for removing sand and gravel from county land. Frank Smith Trucking was insured by Citation General Insurance Company, which became insolvent. The California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA), took over Frank Smith Trucking\u2019s defense, and filed a summary judgment motion against the county on the theory that CIGA was not statutorily required to pay any obligation to the county. The trial court granted the motion, and this appeal followed in the wake of the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AT5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>CIGA\u2019s job is to pay \u201ccovered claims\u201d arising out of the obligations of an insolvent insurer (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.2, subd. (a)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but its liability cannot exceed the amount of covered claims. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.12, subd. (a); <em>Isaacson </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 775, 786 [244 Cal.Rptr. 655, 750 P.2d 297].) (1) In bringing its summary judgment motion, CIGA successfully argued that subdivision (c)(3) of section 1063.1 (now subd. (c)(4)) excluded from the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d any obligation to the <em>county </em>because of the county\u2019s status as a local government entity created by the state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The key language from section 1063.1, former subdivision (c)(3) (now subdivision (c)(4)) is: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 shall not include . . . any obligations to any state or to the federal government.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> CIGA contends that the Legislature intended, in order to ration CIGA\u2019s limited resources, to exclude all <em>government </em>entities from making claims upon it, because their need is \u201cmanifestly less urgent\u201d than that of private sector claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>We recognize the Legislature has insulated CIGA from whole categories of claims and claimants, including obligations arising out of life and health insurance, reinsurance agreements, or obligations to other insurers. (\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(3)-(5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) Ultimately, however, CIGA\u2019s argument is not persuasive for three reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">\u2014(1) it rests on an ungrammatical reading of the critical text;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u2014(2) the clear implication from the way the word \u201cstate\u201d is used in the Insurance Code is that the Legislature did not intend the word to necessarily include local government bodies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u2014(3) while excluding all governmental entities from any claims may (or may not) be good policy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> differentiating between local government entities and any state or the federal government is hardly so irrational that it constitutes an absurd result so as to force us to ignore reasons (1) and (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\n<em>Including Local Government Entities in Section 1063.1, Subdivision (c)(4) Is</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\n<em>Ungrammatical</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">First, CIGA\u2019s reading is contrary to accepted rules of parallel construction in English grammar. That is, CIGA\u2019s reading forces the word \u201cfederal\u201d into the role of noun rather than adjective.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Throughout its brief, CIGA reads the statutory phrase \u201cany obligations to any state or to the federal government\u201d this way: \u201cany state . . . government.\u201d In doing so, CIGA ignores two key words: \u201cto\u201d and \u201cthe.\u201d If one were to diagram the sentence, one would see that the words \u201cto any state\u201d and \u201cto the federal government\u201d are both parallel modifications of the words \u201cany obligations.\u201d But the second \u201cto\u201d (as in \u201cto any state or <em>to </em>the federal government\u201d) shows the independence of the two clauses, so \u201cstate\u201d can stand on its own as a noun. The sentence makes perfect sense if one stops at \u201cto any state.\u201d By contrast, any attempt to read \u201cstate\u201d as modifying \u201cgovernment\u201d is thwarted by the conspicuous <em>the </em>in front of \u201cfederal government.\u201d No one would say: \u201cto any state or the federal\u201d and end the sentence there.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">There are several ways the Legislature might have phrased the statute if it had wanted to convey the idea that it should apply to \u201cany state government.\u201d The Legislature could have written, very simply: \u201cto any state or federal government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Or, more explicitly, it might have said: \u201cto any level of state or federal government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Or even: \u201cto any governmental body, local, state or federal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">But it did not, even though, as we are about to see, there are numerous places elsewhere in the Insurance Code where the Legislature felt compelled to elaborate on the various levels and forms of government which exist by virtue of state law. What the Legislature wrote was: \u201cto any state or <em>to the </em>federal government.\u201d (\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(4), italics added.) The logical and natural reading of the statute, then, is that covered claims do not include obligations to \u201cany state.\u201d Period.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\n<em>The Legislature Does Not Use the Word \u201cState\u201d in the Insurance Code to Include Local Governmental Bodies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The definition of \u201cstate\u201d is found in section 28, which reads, in its entirety, as follows: \u201c \u2018State\u2019 means the State of California, unless applied to the different parts of the United States. In the latter case, it includes the District of Columbia, the commonwealths and the territories.\u201d \u201cCounty\u201d is separately defined in section 14. (The complete text of section 14 is: \u201c \u2018County\u2019 includes \u2018city and county.\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">While the definition of \u201cstate\u201d is almost the same one as found in the Government Code (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 18),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is significant that there are a variety of places and contexts in the Insurance Code where the state government of California is differentiated from local government entities. The California Risk Retention Act of 1991, for example, addresses the liability of nonprofit associations. In discussing potential liability of nonprofit associations, section 130, subdivision (e)(1)(B) defines liability to include legal liability to third parties arising out of any activity \u201cof any state or local government, or any agency or political subdivision thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Section 685 addresses the possibility of retaliatory taxes on California insurers \u201cpursuant to the laws of any other state.\u201d The final sentence of the statute <em>explicitly </em>deems a tax imposed by a local government body of another state as imposed by that <em>state-. </em>\u201cAny tax, license or other fee or other obligation imposed by any city, county, or other political subdivision or agency of the other state or country on California insurers or their agents or representatives shall be deemed to be imposed by that state or country within the meaning of this article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>In discussing what certain associations can do in administering insurance policies for health care for people who are 65 years old or older pursuant to a \u201cfederal or state program,\u201d section 795.25 allows such an association to \u201cperform administrative services in connection with any such program under contract with the federal government, the state, any agency of either, or any other entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In addressing the withdrawal of insurers from doing business in the state, section 1077.3 allows the commissioner to disclose certain records to \u201ca department, agency, or instrumentality of this or another state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Section 1192.9 permits an insurer to make excess fund investments in \u201copen-end diversified management investment\u201d companies if, among other things, those companies confine their assets to certain categories, one of which is \u201cdebt obligations issued by . . . states or their political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities . . . .\u201d Two other statutes on the topic of excess fund investments, section 1192.95, subdivision (a)(6) and section 1194.5, also distinguish between \u201cdebt obligations issued by . . . states\u201d and local governments. Section 1192.95, subdivision (a)(6) uses the phrase \u201cdebt obligations issued by . . . states or their political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities . . .\u201d while section 1194.5 refers to \u201cany debt obligation issued by . . . any state, its agencies or political subdivisions, or by any city, county, or city and county, or by any department or board of such city, county, or city and county . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Section 4014 deals with eligibility to be a policyholder of a mutual insurer, i.e., the sort of entities which might make claims upon such an insurer. This statute also differentiates the state government from local government bodies: \u201cAny person, government or governmental agency, state or political subdivision thereof, public or private corporation, board, association, estate, trustee or fiduciary may be a policyholder member of a mutual insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">And the words \u201cany state\u201d are explicitly differentiated from local government authorities in section 10089.47, dealing with bonds issued by the California Earthquake Authority. Such bonds \u201cmay legally be deposited with, and received by, any state or municipal officer or agency or political subdivision of the state . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Another context in which local governments are distinguished from the state for purposes of who may buy a particular kind of insurance policy is section 10270.5, which explicitly defines group disability insurance to be a policy issued to a variety of entities, including \u201cthe federal or state government, or to any federal or state agency, political subdivision or district, or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>any public, governmental, or municipal corporation, or to any unit, agency or department thereof . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Finally, a statute which authorizes public entities to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance through the State Compensation Insurance Fund, section 11870 is very clear that \u201c[t]he state\u201d is not synonymous with local government: \u201cThe state, any agency, department, division, commission, board, bureau, officer or other authority thereof, and each county, city and county, city, school district, irrigation district, any other district established by law, or other public corporation or quasi public corporation within the state, including any public utility operated by a private corporation may insure against its liability for compensation with the State Compensation Insurance Fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">It is true that none of these statutes deal directly with CIGA, and therefore, strictly speaking, the doctrine of construing statutes in pari materia does not apply. But it is also inescapably clear that in the Insurance Code the Legislature certainly does not consider the word \u201cstate\u201d as shorthand for \u201cstate, political subdivision or district\u201d or some variation on that theme. Time and again the Legislature felt the need to add such extra words, and in contexts\u2014liability, claims, authorization to obtain insurance, even the use of the phrase \u201cany state\u201d\u2014similar to that of section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(4). There is no reason for the Legislature to have suddenly and without indication switched its practice in section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">While CIGA offers a <em>reason </em>the Legislature <em>might </em>want to restrict covered claims to all levels of government (i.e, to save its limited resources),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it offers no <em>explanation </em>as to why the Legislature should suddenly discontinue its practice of assuming that local governmental bodies are not necessarily subsumed in the word <em>state. </em>If, for example, the Legislature had really wanted to adopt a policy that CIGA had no obligation to pay any entity even remotely resembling a government it could have recited the litany set out in section 11870, or at the very least, used a phrase like \u201cno government entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Thus while the doctrine of construing statutes in pari materia may not apply, the venerable rule of construction <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>does. Having distinguished between the State of California and various local agencies and bodies numerous times in the Insurance Code, the Legislature certainly could have added words to that effect when it wrote \u201cany state or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the federal government.\u201d The omission of those entities in section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(4) is conspicuous and naturally leads to the conclusion that the Legislature wanted to give local bodies the benefit of being able to make claims against CIGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">CIGA\u2019s counterargument to the doctrine of <em>expressio unius </em>is that the doctrine is inapplicable when its operation contradicts a \u201cdiscernible and contrary legislative intent.\u201d (E.g., <em>Wildlife Alive </em>v. <em>Chickering </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 195 [132 Cal.Rptr. 377, 553 P.2d 537].) The argument fails because there <em>is </em>no \u201cdiscernible and contrary\u201d legislative intent. CIGA has mentioned nothing in the legislative history of section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(4) which shows a clear intent on the part of the Legislature to insulate it from the claims of local governments, and what intent may be discerned from the actual text of the statute indicates that the Legislature deliberately did not include local governments within the statute\u2019s ambit. CIGA\u2019s proffered interpretation renders surplusage all the references in the Insurance Code to various public entities in addition to \u201cthe state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\n<em>Distinguishing Between the State of California and Local Government Is Rational in the Context of Claims Against CIGA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The acid test of statutory interpretation based on principles of statutory construction is always whether the interpretation yields an absurd result. Here, CIGA argues that it is absurd that the statute should be read to differentiate between \u201ccertain forms of state or federal government, but not others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">While it might be true that it would have made perfect sense for the Legislature to limit CIGA\u2019s coverage to claims arising from entities other than the state or federal government, it can hardly be said that differentiating between the state (or <em>the </em>federal government) on the one hand, and other public entities on the other, is absurd. Different public entities have their own liabilities, and the State of California is normally <em>not </em>liable for the debts of separate public entities, even when those entities are created pursuant to state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">As noted in <em>First Interstate Bank </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 627, 633 [243 Cal.Rptr. 8], the fact that some governmental body is created by state law does not \u201ctransmute\u201d it into \u201c \u2018the state\u2019 \u201d itself. The authority of any given government agency is measured by the authority statutorily conferred upon it. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 633-634.) Most importantly, unless there is a joint powers agreement, \u201cno liability is created in the state for the acts or omissions of the [local] agency.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 634.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>For purposes of tort claims, the Legislature differentiates local public entities from the state. Government Code section 900.4 states, \u201c \u2018Local public entity\u2019 includes a county, city, district, public authority, public agency, and any other political subdivision or public corporation in the State, <em>but does not include the State.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The Government Code requires claimants against local public entities to run their own gauntlet of requirements (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 905), exempting, interestingly enough, claims by the state itself against such an entity. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 905, subd.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">(i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Because local governments are not the \u201cstate\u201d for purposes of <em>tort liability, </em>it would make sense for the Legislature to \u201cgive them a break\u201d and allow them to press claims against CIGA while prohibiting entities in whom sovereignty resides\u2014the state itself, and <em>the </em>federal government\u2014from making such claims. The statute thus boils down to the Legislature\u2019s decision as to who should bear a loss as between local governments and CIGA. And as between forcing a loss on CIGA or on the taxpayers, it is hardly absurd to prefer the taxpayers over CIGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Because the present case does not deal with workers\u2019 compensation benefits, we are spared the need to deal with two cases, <em>Burrow </em>v. <em>Pike </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 384 [235 Cal.Rptr. 408] and <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>v. <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 624 [278 Cal.Rptr. 23], which conflict with each other on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The judgment is reversed. Appellant is to recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Wallin, L, and Crosby, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-5\">All statutory references in this opinion are to the Insurance Code unless otherwise specifically designated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\">There was an unstated premise behind the motion that is counterintuitive, to say the very least. The trial judge appears to have granted summary judgment in favor of a party just because the party\u2019s <em>insurer </em>had become insolvent and the claim against the party was <em>not </em>a covered claim under the statute governing CIGA. As one might expect, claims outside of the original scope of an insolvent insurer\u2019s coverage are not statutorily covered claims. (See \u00a7 1063.1. subd. (c)(l)(i) (covered claim means obligation of insolvent insurer \u201cwithin the coverage of an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer\u201d).) But this prospect raises a potential anomaly in granting summary judgment to a party just because the litigation does not involve a covered claim against CIGA. Perhaps we are missing something\u2014the issue has, after all, not been briefed\u2014but if someone with a <em>solvent </em>insurer is sued and loses, he or she must pay any part of the judgment which is not covered by the policy, and may even be required to reimburse the insurer for defense costs that \u201care not even potentially covered.\u201d (See generally, <em>Buss </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 35, 50 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 939 P.2d 766].) Why should someone with an insolvent insurer get a better deal and not be required to pay anything\u2014even if not otherwise covered by the original insurance policy\u2014because CIGA is statutorily precluded from paying any part of the third party\u2019s judgment? Because we reverse on the ground that CIGA is not necessarily precluded from paying the county\u2019s claim under section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(4), we need not address this precise question or how it might relate to the precise facts of the case before us. However, nothing in this opinion is meant to endorse the highly novel proposition of law that appears to have served as an unarticulated predicate for the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Here is the entire text of section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(4) as it reads after the 1997 amendments: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 does not include any obligations of the insolvent insurer arising out of any reinsurance contracts, nor any obligations incurred after the expiration date of the insurance policy or after the insurance policy has been replaced by the insured or canceled at the insured\u2019s request, or after the insurance policy has been canceled by the association as provided in this chapter, or after the insurance policy has been canceled by the liquidator, nor any obligations to any state or to the federal government.\u201d (See Stats. 1997, ch. 497, \u00a7 2.5.) The only change to the statute in 1997 was to replace the word \u201cshall\u201d with \u201cdoes\u201d in the first sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Formerly subdivision (c)(2)-(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b328-13\">It is, however, a tautology to conclude, as CIGA urges us to, that because the Legislature intended CIGA to be a \u201clast resort\u201d local government bodies are excluded from making claims against it. Obviously CIGA would have no reason to exist unless it paid <em>some </em>claims, and so the idea of last resort does not answer the question: <em>last resort for whom?</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b329-10\">The Insurance Code definition includes \u201ccommonwealths,\u201d which are not mentioned in section 18 of the Government Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Though CIGA never quite says it, implicit in its argument is that either the taxpayers or the legitimate creditors of government should pick up losses otherwise borne by CIGA and, indirectly through CIGA, consumers of insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
