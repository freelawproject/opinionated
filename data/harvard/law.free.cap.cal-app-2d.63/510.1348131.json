J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">This appeal and cross-appeal arise from litigation between Mark Hankins, a disabled man, and the owners and operators of an El Torito restaurant located in Burlingame, California.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The litigation was precipitated by Hankins\u2019s visit to the restaurant in October 1991. During that visit, restaurant employees refused to permit Hankins to use an otherwise accessible \u201cemployee restroom.\u201d Hankins sought damages and injunctive relief under state and federal law for this denial of access and for other alleged violations of state and federal laws which prohibit discrimination on the basis of a disability and prohibit denying disabled individuals access to public accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>After a court trial, the court found El Torito\u2019s refusal to permit Hankins to use the restroom violated California law and awarded Hankins $80,000 damages. The court also enjoined El Torito from requiring that a recently installed wheelchair lift be accessed and controlled only by restaurant employees. El Torito appeals each of these rulings. El Torito also contends the trial court erred by awarding Hankins\u2019s expert witness fees as part of his damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Hankins cross-appeals, alleging the trial court erred by concluding that (1) the Burlingame restaurant was in compliance with state disability access laws as of the date of his October 1991 visit, and (2) Hankins does not have standing to assert a violation of title III of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12181 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">II. Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In 1988, Hankins was in an accident which resulted in amputation of his right leg several inches below his knee. Wearing his prosthesis causes Hankins periodic problems and pain which sometimes requires that he use crutches or a wheelchair. Hankins was using cratches when he and his fianc\u00e9e went to the El Torito restaurant in Burlingame on October 23, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">At the time of Hankins\u2019s visit, there were six steps at the entrance of the restaurant. Three steps separated the main dining room of the restaurant from the lower bar level. And, there were 18 steps from the main level to the second floor of the building where the public restrooms were located. The building did not have an elevator. A sign near the front entrance of the restaurant warned: \u201cPremises Not Wheelchair Equipped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">With his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s assistance, Hankins climbed the six stairs leading to the restaurant entrance. At some point during the evening, Hankins had to use the rest room. Hankins explained to the restaurant manager that he could not climb the 18 stairs leading to the public restrooms and asked if he could use the employee rest room on the first floor. The manager refused Hankins\u2019s request and told him to go use the restroom in another restaurant which was located next door.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Using his cratches, Hankins made his way out of the restaurant (up the three interior stairs and down the six exterior stairs) and across the approximately seventy-five yards of parking lot to the restaurant where the El Torito manager had directed him to go. That restaurant was not, however, handicapped accessible. On his way back to the El Torito restaurant, Hankins encountered several people in the El Torito parking lot. Unable to wait any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>longer, Hankins found a bush and relieved himself. Hankins was angered and humiliated by this experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Hankins filed his complaint against El Torito on August 10, 1992. He sought damages and injunctive relief for violations of various state disability access laws, state laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of physical handicap or disability and the federal American with Disabilities Act. Hankins also sought punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. A court trial commenced on July 26, 1994, and the court issued its statement of decision on December 18, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The trial court found that the Burlingame restaurant was not in violation of California\u2019s disability access laws and regulations on October 23, 1991, the date of Hankins\u2019s visit. The court ruled that Hankins failed to prove that (1) the structure was already in violation of applicable access laws when El Torito acquired it in 1984, (2) remodeling work performed in 1985 to convert the restaurant from a \u201cTia Maria\u201d to an \u201cEl Torito\u201d violated applicable access laws, or (3) the 1989 construction of a seawall between the restaurant building and San Francisco Bay required installation of access features inside the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The trial court further ruled that, although the Burlingame restaurant was not in violation of applicable disability laws, El Torito breached its duty to Hankins as a disabled person and discriminated against him by refusing to permit him to \u201cuse the only available restroom facilities on the ground floor of the building, the employees facilities.\u201d The court awarded Hankins $80,000 as damages for this discriminatory act.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In ruling on Hankins\u2019s requests for injunctive relief, the court framed the issue as a question of whether handicapped access features installed by El Torito in the fall of 1992 (after litigation commenced) were \u201csufficient to comply with the applicable State Laws and Regulations governing handicapped access.\u201d The court ruled that the improvements were sufficient, \u201cwith the sole exception of the [wheelchair] lift\u201d which was installed between the main entrance and the lower bar area of the restaurant. The court ruled that the lift was not sufficiently accessible to disabled persons because it could only be actuated by restaurant management.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The trial court entered judgment for El Torito on Hankins\u2019s claim for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act because Hankins\u2019s visit to the restaurant occurred prior to the effective date of this federal law, which the court ruled was not retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The court denied Hankins\u2019s request for punitive damages but awarded him attorney\u2019s fees. In this regard, the court expressly accepted Hankins\u2019s argument that his complaint was the \u201csubstantial precipitating cause\u201d of El <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Torito\u2019s actions in installing handicapped access features in the Burlingame restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">III. The Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">El Torito contends the judgment against it must be reversed because the trial court erred by (1) concluding that El Torito\u2019s restroom policy violated Hankins\u2019s rights (2) enjoining El Torito from maintaining its policy with respect to use of the wheelchair lift, and (3) permitting Hankins to include his expert witness fees as recoverable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">A. <em>The Restroom Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The precise statutory basis for the trial court\u2019s ruling that El Torito violated Hankins\u2019s rights by denying him access to an available restroom is unclear. In his complaint, Hankins alleged violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, codified at Civil Code sections 51 and 52, and also of Civil Code section 54 et seq. The trial court found that El Torito violated Hankins\u2019s rights under \u201cCivil Code \u00a7 51 et seq.\u201d It ruled that El Torito \u201cbreached its duty to Plaintiff as a disabled person,\u201d and awarded Hankins $80,000 in damages for the \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d acts of El Torito\u2019s employees. It also awarded attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to sections 54.3 and 55 of the Civil Code, both which expressly relate to violations of Civil Code section 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">El Torito contends the judgment against it cannot be sustained because (1) the record does not establish a violation of Civil Code section 51 (hereafter section 51), and (2) the trial court\u2019s express findings affirmatively establish that El Torito did not violate Civil Code section 54.1, subdivision (a) (hereafter section 54.1(a)). Although the trial court could have been clearer in its ruling, we conclude the record supports findings that El Torito violated both section 51 and section 54.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">1. <em>Section 51</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Section 51 states, in part: \u201cAll persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, <em>or disability </em>are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever, [\u00b6] This section shall not be construed to confer any right or privilege on a person which is conditioned or limited by law or which is applicable alike to persons of every sex, color, race, religion, ancestry, national origin, <em>or </em>disability.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">El Torito contends the judgment against it cannot be affirmed under section 51 because it did not intentionally discriminate against Hankins. \u201c[A] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>plaintiff seeking to establish a case under the Unruh Act must plead and prove intentional discrimination in public accommodations in violation of the terms of the Act.\u201d <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Capital Growth Investors XIV </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1142, 1175 [278 Cal.Rptr. 614, 805 P.2d 873].) El Torito argues Hankins did not plead intentional discrimination, the trial court did not find intentional discrimination, and there was insufficient evidence of intentional discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Hankins did plead intentional discrimination by alleging a violation of section 51 in his third cause of action. Although sufficiency of the pleadings is not at issue here, we note that Hankins expressly alleged that El Torito \u201cwrongfully and unlawfully denied accessible restroom facilities to physically handicapped persons,\u201d that it acted with \u201cknowledge of the effect [its conduct] was having on physically disabled persons,\u201d and that Hankins was \u201cdiscriminated against on the sole basis that he was physically disabled and on crutches.\u201d Thus, the issue of intentional discrimination was before the lower court. Further, although we agree the court\u2019s statement of decision could have been clearer, that decision includes a finding of intentional discrimination. It expressly states that damages are awarded for El Torito\u2019s \u201cdiscriminatory conduct,\u201d and it imposes liability under \u201cCivil Code \u00a7 51 et seq.\u201d Thus, we turn to the crux of El Torito\u2019s argument, that the record does not establish a section 51 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Initially, we dispose of the semantic argument that El Torito is not guilty of discrimination at all. El Torito admits that Hankins was denied access to a restroom pursuant to company policy, but contends the policy was not discriminatory because it applied to all restaurant patrons. In other words, El Torito contends, all customers were denied access to the employee restroom. However, El Torito\u2019s policy was not, as it contends, to deny all patrons access to a restroom. Rather, a combination of its policy and the physical layout of its premises allowed patrons who were not physically handicapped to use a restroom while dining at the restaurant (the one on the second floor), but denied that same service to physically handicapped patrons even though there was a restroom on the premises (the one behind the kitchen) that a physically disabled person could otherwise use. El Torito\u2019s policy thus discriminated against disabled patrons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">El Torito argues that Hankins did not prove discriminatory intent because the trial court expressly found that El Torito\u2019s policy was motivated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>health, safety and sanitation concerns and this finding establishes an absence of discriminatory intent as a matter of law. The trial court made no such finding. It merely acknowledged that El Torito <em>argued </em>that former Health and Safety Code section 27626 precluded it from permitting Hankins to use the employee restroom because Hankins would have to travel through a portion of the food preparation area to get there. Rejecting El Torito\u2019s alleged excuse, the trial court ruled that former Health and Safety Code section 27626 did \u201cnot support that interpretation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Section 27626 of the Health and Safety Code was repealed in 1995. At the time of the incident, it provided in pertinent part: \u201cIn each food establishment, there shall be provided clean toilet facilities in good repair for use by employees. The number of toilet facilities required shall be in accordance with local building and plumbing ordinances. Toilet facilities whose construction begins on or after January 1, 1985, and which are provided for use by patrons, shall be so situated that patrons do not pass through food preparation, food storage, or utensil washing areas.\u201d (Deering\u2019s Ann. Health &amp; Saf. Code (1988 ed.) former \u00a7 27626, repealed by Stats. 1995 ch. 415, \u00a7 170.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The trial court reasoned that El Torito\u2019s purported concern that Health and Safety Code former section 27626 precluded it from letting any patron use the employee restroom did not justify its actions, i.e., \u201cforcing Plaintiff to undertake an arduous and painful journey to another structure some distance away to relieve himself.\u201d We agree. Former Health and Safety Code section 27626 regulated the construction of toilet facilities from January 1, 1985, onward. The statute is irrelevant, not only because El Torito\u2019s employee rest room was constructed before January 1985, but also because it does not pertain to El Torito\u2019s policy of denying disabled individuals access to an otherwise available restroom <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Finally, El Torito argues that it did not violate section 51 because its policy was a reasonable restriction rationally related to its business and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>services it offers. \u201cAlthough the Unruh Act proscribes \u2018any form of arbitrary discrimination\u2019 [citation], certain types of discrimination have been denominated \u2018reasonable\u2019 and, therefore, not arbitrary.\u201d <em>(Koire </em>v. <em>Metro Car Wash </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 24, 30 [219 Cal.Rptr. 133, 707 P.2d 195].) Thus, for example, \u201clegitimate business interests may justify limitations on consumer access to public accommodations.\" <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Capital Growth Investors XIV, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 1162 [discussing examples].)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">El Torito claims that its policy was reasonable and justified by its concerns about sanitation, a compelling societal interest. <em>Without any citations to the record </em>(in violation of rule 15(a) of the California Rules of Court), El Torito claims that, \u201c[t]o use the employee restroom, guests would have to pass through the area where large containers of fresh, partially prepared ingredients are kept (sliced cheese, sliced tomatoes, guacamole, pots of beans, soup stocks, etc.). Defendants are concerned that a guest returning from using the restroom would be tempted to sample food from the preparation bins which could result in widespread contamination among diners. The societal interest in avoiding contamination in areas where bulk foods are prepared is obvious and compelling.\u201d Even after Hankins pointed out El Torito\u2019s failure to identify any evidence supportive of this argument, El Torito declined to supply the requisite record support. In any event, we decline to find that an unsubstantiated and totally speculative concern that El Torito would be unable to prevent a patron from surreptitiously sampling food on the way to or from the rest room justifies denying a handicapped patron access to the only first floor restroom on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In sum, the record supports a finding that El Torito intentionally discriminated against Hankins in violation of section 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">2. <em>Section 54.1(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Section 54.1(a) provides that disabled persons \u201cshall be entitled to full and equal access, as other members of the general public, to accommodations, advantages, facilities . . . and privileges of all . . . hotels, lodging places, places of public accommodation, amusement, or resort, and other places to which the general public is invited, subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law, or state or federal regulation, and applicable alike to all persons.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u201cTo give meaning to the public accommodation law prohibiting discrimination against the handicapped, the Legislature enacted Government Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>section 4450 et seq. providing for the establishment of standards for buildings constructed with public funds designed to insure accessibility by the handicapped. A year later, the Legislature expanded these requirements to facilities constructed with private funds ([Government Code,] \u00a7 19955 et seq.) and, with certain limited exceptions, required conformance with the same standards set forth within Government Code section 4450 et seq.\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Deukmejian </em>v. <em>CHE, Inc. </em>(1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 123, 133 [197 Cal.Rptr. 484] <em>(CHE).) </em>To clarify the parties\u2019 contentions and our conclusions, we refer to these statutory provisions and related regulations as California\u2019s \u201cstructural access standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">El Torito contends it is not liable to Hankins under section 54.1(a) because (1) the trial court expressly found that, on the day of the incident, the restaurant was in compliance with California\u2019s structural access standards, and (2) a plaintiff cannot prevail under section 54.1(a) unless it proves a violation these standards. Hankins responds that (1) the trial court did not hold that El Torito was in compliance with all relevant disability access standards, and (2) El Torito was in violation of a relevant standard, section 19955 of the Health and Safety Code, on the day of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Although the statement of decision is vague in several respects, it clearly confirms El Torito\u2019s contention that the trial court made a finding of fact and law that the restaurant was not in violation of California\u2019s structural access standards on the day of the incident. In its statement of decision, the court posed the following question: \u201cWas the El Torito Restaurant in Burlingame in violation of the requirements of the California Disability Access Laws and Regulations on October 23, 1991?\u201d The court answered \u201cno.\u201d After further explanation, the court concluded \u201cthe El Torito Restaurant in Burlingame was, in fact, not in violation of the applicable Laws of California at the time of the Plaintiff\u2019s incident on October 23, 1991.\u201d Thus, the issue is whether that finding by the trial court precluded it from imposing liability under section 54.1(a). El Torito so contends; Hankins avoids the issue by arguing there was a violation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Certainly, the owner of a public accommodation whose violation of a structural access standard results in the denial of access to a handicapped individual is liable under Civil Code section 54 et seq. <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Edwards Theaters Circuit, Inc. </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 881 [134 Cal.Rptr. 844] <em>(Marsh), </em>superseded by statute on another ground; <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Grant Co. </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 1085 [227 Cal.Rptr. 154]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>CHE, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d 123; <em>Donald </em>v. <em>Sacramento Valley Bank </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1183 [260 Cal.Rptr. 49] (Donald); <em>Cafe Royale, supra, </em>218 Cal.App.3d at p. 183.) But the issue we address is whether violation of a disability access standard is a prerequisite for imposing liability under Civil Code section 54 et seq. We have found no case which squarely addresses this issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Leading the cases upon which El Torito relies is <em>Marsh, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.3d 881. <em>Marsh </em>held that \u201cCalifornia law which prohibits discrimination against the physically handicapped in access to public accommodations\u201d does not \u201crequire the operator of such accommodations, absent specific legislation mandating it, to make structural modifications in order to facilitate access.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 886.) The court recognized that concern about the impact of the design and construction of a building on accessibility led to the enactment of Government Code section 4450 and Health and Safety Code sections 19955 through 19956, statutes which led to the establishment of standards designed to ensure handicap accessibility. However, according to the court, these statutes evidence a clear legislative intent \u201cthat affirmative conduct [by the building owner] is required only when directed by those sections dealing with construction of new facilities or with the repair and alteration of existing facilities.\u201d (64 Cal.App.3d at p. 888.) The <em>Marsh </em>court further concluded that \u201cthe operator of a business of a type enumerated in Civil Code Section 54.1 is not required by the force of that section <em>alone </em>to modify its facilities to allow for their use by handicapped persons.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 892.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>Marsh </em>may establish a rule that a structural impediment to access does not violate Civil Code section 54.1 unless the impediment also violates a structural access standard. But any such rule and the reasoning that may sustain it is inapposite when the basis of a section 54.1(a) claim is the <em>policy </em>of the proprietor of a public accommodation rather than the <em>design </em>of the accommodation itself. Thus, <em>Marsh </em>and cases following it are irrelevant to the issue we address.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In the present case, El Torito admitted it had a policy of refusing to permit disabled individuals to use a restroom that already existed and was physically accessible. As a direct result of this policy, Hankins was forced to relieve himself in a public parking lot. Thus, the question we face is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>a defendant violates section 54.1(a) by maintaining a policy, unrelated to any structural impediment, which results in the denial of full and equal access by a disabled individual to a public accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">In answering this question, \u201c[o]ur primary task is to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d <em>(Cafe Royale, supra, </em>218 Cal.App.3d at p. 176.) \u201c \u2018[A] statute should be construed with reference to the entire statutory system of which it forms a part in such a way that harmony may be achieved among the parts [citations] . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 177.)  Many courts have recognized that California\u2019s disability \u00e1ccess laws manifest a legislative intent to afford broad protection and maximize the incentive for compliance in order to achieve access for disabled individuals. (See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at pp. 176-178; <em>Isbister </em>v. <em>Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz, Inc. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 72, 75-76 [219 Cal.Rptr. 150, 707 P.2d 212]; <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1994) 866 F.Supp. 433, 437-439.) The broad language of section 54.1(a) et seq. reflects that legislative intent and leads us to conclude that policies which deny disabled individuals full and equal access to public accommodations are easily encompassed by this broad statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Section 54.1(a) entitles disabled individuals to \u201cfull and equal access\u201d subject only to limitations established by law. Further, \u201c[liability under section 54.3 extends not only to those who violate section 54.1 but also to those who \u2018interfere[] with the rights of an individual with a disability\u2019 under section 54.1.\u201d <em>(Aikins </em>v. <em>St. Helena Hosp. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1994) 843 F.Supp. 1329, 1340, quoting Civ. Code, \u00a7 54.3.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Civil Code section 54.3 contains an example of what constitutes \u201cinterfer[ance]\u201d under the statute: \u201cpreventing or causing the prevention of a guide dog, signal dog, or service dog from carrying out its functions in assisting a disabled person.\u201d Although we address a different disability, the quoted example manifests a legislative intent to eliminate <em>policy impediments </em>as well as <em>structural impediments </em>to access.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In 1996, section 54.1 was amended to state that a \u201cviolation of the right of an individual under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336) also constitutes a violation of this section . . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 54.1, subd. (d) as amended by Stats. 1996, ch. 498, \u00a7 1.5.) We interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>this amendment as an acknowledgment by the Legislature of its intent that Civil Code section 54.1 impose at least the same requirements as are imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (the ADA). Therefore, authority regarding the scope of the ADA is probative of the intended scope of section 54.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Under the ADA, owners and operators of places of public accommodation are required to make \u201creasonable modifications\u201d in their practices, policies, or procedures or to provide \u201cauxiliary aids and services\u201d for people with disabilities unless such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations offered or would result in an \u201cundue burden.\u201d (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), (iii).)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The United States Department of Justice has issued illustrative examples of what the ADA requires. We find one example particularly relevant: \u201cAn individual requires assistance in order to use toilet facilities and his only companion is a person of the opposite sex. Permitting a person of the opposite sex to assist an individual with a disability in a toilet room designated for one sex may be a required reasonable modification of policy.\u201d (Dept, of Justice, Americans with Disabilities Act, title III Technical Assistance Manual, \u00a7 4.2100, p. 24 (1994 supp.).) This example strongly suggests that a <em>policy </em>of denying disabled individuals access to the employee restroom may well violate the ADA and, therefore, Civil Code section 54.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In sum, we hold that Civil Code section 54.1 et seq. apply to policies as well as structural impediments. The statute is violated by policies, not otherwise compelled by law, which deny disabled individuals full and fair access to public accommodations. Thus, the trial court\u2019s finding that El Torito\u2019s Burlingame restaurant was in compliance with relevant structural access standards did not preclude it from finding a violation of section 54.1(a). The judgment against El Torito is sustained under section 54.1 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">B. <em>The Lift Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The trial court ruled that \u201cthere continues to exist a clear violation of the applicable disabled access laws and regulations with respect to the [wheelchair] lift which was installed between the elevated entrance area and the bar area, in that the lift must be actuated by management and is not thereby sufficiently accessible to disabled persons, and Plaintiff is entitled to an injunction with respect thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The judgment states that defendants \u201cshall be and hereby are enjoined from keeping the \u2018lift\u2019 (installed between the elevated entrance area to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>subject restaurant and the bar area) locked in such a manner as to require the lift to be unlocked or actuated by Defendants management or other employee personnel. Such locked lift a) is in violation of disabled access laws and regulations requiring disabled persons to have unassisted entry, operation, and exit from such lifts and b) is in violation of the requirement of Civil Code Section 54.1 mandating \u2018full and equal access.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">El Torito contends this ruling must be reversed because (1) the trial court did not have jurisdiction to rule as to the adequacy of the wheelchair lift, (2) the wheelchair lift was constructed to comply with structural access standards, and (3) there is insufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">1. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">El Torito maintains that \u201clift issues\u201d were not put in issue by Hankins\u2019s complaint and, thus, the court did not have jurisdiction to consider them. It contends the complaint does not mention the wheelchair lift, the lift was not even installed until after the complaint was filed, and Hankins failed to file a supplemental complaint to raise the issue of lift compliance. Citing a First District opinion, El Torito contends that \u201c \u2018evidence cannot determine an issue that the parties have left out of their pleadings.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Hughes </em>v. <em>Blue Cross of Northern California </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 832, 858 [263 Cal.Rptr. 850].)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The present case is not analogous to <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Blue Cross of Northern California, </em>where appellant was precluded from raising a <em>new </em>issue on appeal. <em>{Hughes </em>v. <em>Blue Cross of Northern California, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at p. 858.) Hankins\u2019s complaint clearly sought to enjoin El Torito\u2019s continuing unlawful denial of full and equal access for disabled individuals to the bar and main restaurant area. The complaint expressly alleged that the three steps leading from the entrance to the bar/cocktail lounge area denied Hankins and other disabled individuals access to the restaurant. The complaint sought \u201cinjunctive relief. . . requiring that each aspect of the Defendants\u2019 restaurant which denies full and equal access to disabled persons be modified to properly allow handicap access as required by both California and federal law.\u201d Hankins also alleged that El Torito (1) violated applicable disability access laws by \u201cblocking access to the \u2018sports bar\u2019 area and primary dining area with three more steps,\u201d (2) \u201cknowingly and willfully refused ... to provide full and equal access for disabled persons to the main (lower) dining area and the entire bar area,\u201d and (3) willfully and wrongfully excluded him and other disabled individuals \u201cfrom full and equal access to . . . public areas of the El Torito Restaurant which require the climbing of stairs in order to use.\u201d Hankins asked the court to \u201cenjoin any continuing refusal by Defendants to grant such access to Plaintiff . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Thus, the complaint put at issue whether disabled individuals were denied full and equal access to the lounge area of the restaurant and sought to enjoin El Torito\u2019s <em>continuing </em>violation of the law. By the time of trial, El Torito had installed a wheelchair lift affording some measure of access to this area. Whether this lift gave the full and equal access required by the statutes upon which Hankins relied, or whether El Torito continued to unlawfully deny access in violation of section 54.1(a), was an issue encompassed by Hankins\u2019s pleading and properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">El Torito argues it was unfair and prejudicial to admit evidence regarding the adequacy of the lift because El Torito was not on notice that Hankins would raise any issues relating to the lift until Hankins presented the testimony of its expert, Peter Margen. However, our review of the record reveals that El Torito argued, in both its trial brief and its motion for judgment on the pleadings, that Hankins\u2019s claim for injunctive relief was moot because, among other things, El Torito had installed a wheelchair lift. In response to this argument, Hankins admitted that El Torito had belatedly installed access features on the eve of trial, but maintained the new features still did not comply with state and federal requirements. Indeed, in opposing El Torito\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, Hankins expressly argued that El Torito\u2019s lift policy violated the law. El Torito cannot now claim that it was surprised when Hankins contested mootness at trial by attempting to establish that the lift was not in compliance with applicable standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Finally, El Torito contends Hankins did not suffer an injury entitling him to injunctive relief because he did not visit the restaurant after the lift was installed and attempt to use it. The injunction was sought and granted pursuant to Civil Code section 55 which states: \u201c[a]ny person who is aggrieved <em>or potentially aggrieved </em>by a violation of Section 54 or 54.1 of this code . . . may bring an action to enjoin the violation.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 55, italics added.) Hankins was actually aggrieved when he visited the restaurant prior to the installation of the lift, and he continued to be at least potentially aggrieved to the extent the lift and El Torito\u2019s maintenance thereof did not comply with applicable access laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">2. <em>Structural Access Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">During trial, the parties stipulated that \u201cthe lift was in compliance with Title 24 [of the California Code of Regulations] when it was constructed and that the lift is currently now kept locked.\u201d Relying on this stipulation, El Torito employs the same argument it used to defend its restroom policy, i.e., that its compliance with structural access standards governing design and construction of a public accommodation precludes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>finding that its wheelchair lift policy violates section 54.1(a). We have already rejected this argument. As discussed above, section 54.1(a) applies to <em>policy impediments </em>as well as <em>structural impediments. </em>In fact, the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding the lift policy provides additional support for this conclusion since it is based on a disability access regulation which does not pertain to structure or design.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The trial court found that the lift policy violates section 4.11.3 of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (the ADAAG).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 4.11.3 of the ADAAG provides \u201c[i]f platform lifts are used then they shall facilitate unassisted entry, operation, and exit from the lift in compliance with 4.11.2.\u201d (36 C.F.R. \u00a7 1191.2, p. 301 (1997).) The trial court found that a policy requiring that the lift be unlocked or actuated by a restaurant manager or other employee violates section 4.11.3 because such a policy precludes unassisted entry, operation and exit from the lift.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">El Torito does not squarely address ADAAG section 4.11.3. Nor do we find any basis in its reasoning for distinguishing between structural access requirements and nonstructural requirements (such as the one contained in section 4.11.3) or for excluding the latter from the scope of Civil Code section 54.1. Instead, El Torito simply contends it was compelled by law to install a wheelchair lift that would be controlled by a key.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">El Torito specifically relies on section 4.11.2 of the ADAAG and Uniform Building Code, former section 5107, subdivision (a), of title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But these regulations do not, as El Torito implicitly contends, undermine the trial court\u2019s ruling. Assuming that El Torito was required to install a key lock in the lift, any such requirement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>not inconsistent with section 4.11.3 of the ADAAG, which requires the facilitation of unassisted entry, operation, and exit from the lift. <em>(Delil </em>v. <em>El Torito Restaurants, Inc. </em>(NJD.Cal. 1996) 1996 WL 807395 <em>(Delil).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">In <em>Delil, </em>the Honorable Charles Legge denied El Torito summary judgment in a similar case involving the wheelchair lift at an El Torito restaurant in Monterey. <em>(Delil, supra, </em>1996 WL 807395.) The plaintiff, a disabled wheelchair user, alleged, among other things, that El Torito violated the ADA and Civil Code sections 51 and 54 by keeping its wheelchair lift locked. The court denied El Torito\u2019s motion for summary judgment notwithstanding the fact that El Torito had complied with federal and state regulations by installing a key lock on the lift. The court concluded that keeping the lift locked when not in use did not violate applicable laws. (1996 WL 807395 at pp. 9-11.) Nevertheless, the court found that triable issues of fact remained as to whether El Torito complied with section 4.11.3 of the ADAAG by facilitating unassisted entry, operation and exit from the lift. (1996 WL 807395 at pp. 9-11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The <em>Delil </em>court rejected the contention that the ADAAG section 4.11.3 requirement of unassisted entry, operation and exit conflicts with the key lock requirement contained in section 4.11.2 of the ADAAG. It noted that the drafters of the ADAAG had expressly reconciled these requirements in their supplementary information section which states: \u201c \u2018The technical specification in 4.11.3 also has been revised in response to comments regarding independent operation to specifically require that platform lifts or wheelchair lifts provide for unassisted operation. <em>This requirement does not preclude the use of a key to operate a lift as long as the key is readily available and allows for unassisted </em>operation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Delil, supra, </em>1996 WL 807395 at pp. 9-10, quoting 36 C.F.R., pt. 1191, appen. A, \u00a7 4.11 (1991), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Implicitly adopting this reconciliation, the <em>Delil </em>court concluded that \u201cEl Torito can facilitate independent, unassisted access to a key-locked lift.\u201d <em>(Delil, supra, </em>1996 WL 807395 at p. 11.) We agree with Judge Legge\u2019s conclusion and the quoted regulatory reconciliation upon\" which it is based. We thus reject El Torito\u2019s contention that its compliance with regulations requiring that it install a key-locked lift precluded the trial court from finding that its <em>policy regarding the use of that lift </em>violated section 54.1(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>3. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">El Torito contends the finding that its lift policy violates the access laws is not supported by the evidence. El Torito concedes that it is its policy to keep the lift locked, but contends that this policy does not, by itself, establish a section 54.1 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Both Hankins and amicus curiae Disability Rights Advocates would have us hold that an admitted policy of keeping the lift locked violates California law. The <em>Delil </em>court rejected this contention, but the issue is not properly before us and we expressly <em>do not </em>address it. This record does not adequately present for consideration issues, such as child safety, which are surely relevant in determining the legality of a locked lift policy. Further, the trial court never addressed whether (a) this particular wheelchair lift is subject to regulations requiring that it be kept locked when not in use (see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, former \u00a7 5107, subd. (a)(6)), (b) keeping the lift unlocked when not in use violates any law or regulation, or (c) compliance with one regulation might excuse compliance with another arguably conflicting regulation. These are not issues which, given the state of this record, we are inclined to address in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The trial court enjoined El Torito from maintaining a policy requiring that the lift be actuated or unlocked only by an El Torito employee. Thus, the question is whether there is sufficient evidence establishing such a policy exists at El Torito\u2019s Burlingame restaurant. Aside from the parties\u2019 stipulation that the lift is kept locked, the only relevant evidence brought to our attention is the testimony of Hankins\u2019s expert, Peter Margen.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Margen works for a consulting firm specializing in advising entities regarding compliance and conformance with disability access laws and regulations. Mar-gen inspected El Torito\u2019s Burlingame restaurant on July 20 and 22, 1994, to, among other things, determine whether it was accessible to disabled individuals. Margen opined that a disabled patron could not use the wheelchair lift unassisted. He observed that the wheelchair lift was key locked in the \u201coff\u2019 position. He testified that an individual using a wheelchair would have to seek out an employee to obtain information about how to obtain a key to unlock the lift. He did not find any information posted, anywhere in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>restaurant that \u201calert[ed] an individual with mobility impairment how to get access to the lift if they came into the restaurant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In its opening brief, El Torito provides a detailed description of the lift, how it is used and its safety features, and contends that the operating controls are \u201ckept keylocked to avoid children tampering with the lift and to avoid children being caught underneath the lift.\u201d El Torito also discusses the alleged location of the key and how it can be accessed by disabled individuals. However, this self-serving narrative is, once again, not supported by any reference to the record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Though Hankins pointed out this omission in his brief, El Torito\u2019s reply brief completely ignores this issue. Instead, El Torito argues, for the first time in its reply brief to this court, that the trial court committed reversible error by qualifying Margen as an expert and permitting him to testify as to legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">El Torito cannot challenge the admissibility of Margen\u2019s testimony for the first time in a reply brief. <em>(American Drug Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stroh </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 432]; <em>Stoll </em>v. <em>Shuff </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 22, 25 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 249].) In any event, this argument is meritless. El Torito relies primarily on <em>Burkhart </em>v. <em>Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1997) 112 F.3d 1207 [324 App.D.C. 241] <em>(Burkhart), </em>a federal case which held a trial court abused its discretion by permitting an expert on police department compliance with the ADA to offer legal conclusions and misstate relevant principles of disability law to a jury. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1212-1214.) The error was prejudicial because substantial portions of the testimony were inaccurate and contained impermissible legal conclusions directing the jury to find liability in an otherwise thin case. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In contrast to <em>Burkhart, </em>in the present case the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply, there was no jury which may have been misled, and there is no basis for concluding that the trial court relied on Margen\u2019s alleged legal conclusions or misstatements. Indeed, as discussed above, the relevant portion of Mar-gen\u2019s testimony is his percipient testimony: his observations of the restaurant and the wheelchair lift. Nevertheless, the question remains whether the record (e.g., Margen\u2019s testimony) establishes that El Torito\u2019s lift policy violates the law. We find that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Missing from this record is evidence which sufficiently describes (1) what this particular lift looks like (e.g., whether the platform and lift travel area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>are enclosed), (2) how the lift is accessed and operated (e.g., whether an employee must operate the lift, where the key is kept and who may obtain it), and (3) how El Torito\u2019s lift access policy affects the handicapped patron (e.g., how much time and effort is spent obtaining a key and getting to the lounge area). Indeed, this record does not contain sufficient evidence for us to draw <em>any </em>conclusions as to the nature and adequacy of El Torito\u2019s lift policy. Therefore, this case must, regrettably, be remanded to the trial court to take evidence and make the necessary findings as to how the wheelchair lift is in fact accessed, operated and used at the Burlingame restaurant, and whether El Torito\u2019s policy regarding its access, operation and usage violates the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">C. <em>Expert Witness </em>Fees*</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">IV. The Cross-appeal<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">V. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The portion of the judgment enjoining El Torito from \u201ckeeping the \u2018lift\u2019 . . . locked in such a manner as to require the lift to be unlocked or actuated by Defendants management or other employee personnel\u201d is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Should the trial court determine, after considering El Torito\u2019s past and present policies regarding access to and operation and usage of the lift, that an injunction should not issue, it may reconsider the amount of attorney\u2019s fees previously awarded. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.

(See <em>Kirsh </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

It is difficult to excuse these errors especially in light of El Torito\u2019s other numerous violations of rule 15(a) of the California Rules of Court by, e.g., its failure to record citations for a veritable host of its factual assertions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\">El Torito also contends Hankins stipulated that El Torito denied Hankins access to the employee rest room because it believed former Health and Safety Code section 27626 prohibited it from allowing patrons to travel through the kitchen to use the employee facilities.

El Torito, Hankins and the trial court all appear to presume that the ADAAG contains relevant guidelines applicable to the wheelchair lift. We note that evaluating the lift under the ADAAG to determine whether El Torito has violated section 54.1(a) may not be consistent with the trial court\u2019s separate ruling that Hankins does not have standing under the ADA.
