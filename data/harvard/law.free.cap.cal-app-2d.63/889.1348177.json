This question arises within the context of the appeal by Frontier Pacific Insurance Company (Frontier) from the denial of its motion to vacate forfeiture and exonerate bail. We hold that where the record of the actual proceedings fails to disclose that the court had sufficient cause for a continuance, the court has lost jurisdiction to later declare a forfeiture of bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">On September 10, 1996, Alfonso Magana waived preliminary hearing and entered a plea of guilty in his criminal case. He waived time for imposition of sentence and was ordered to appear in superior court on September 27, 1996. Magana was remanded to custody, and bail was reduced to $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">On September 27, 1996, Frontier posted bail bond No. CS100-00141716 for Magana\u2019s release from custody pending sentencing. The bond stated the date of appearance as \u201c9-27-96 9AM.\u201d The \u201cOfficial Receipt\u201d issued by the jail upon Magana\u2019s release on bail indicated the appearance date was \u201c09-27-96.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>On September 27, 1996, Magana did not appear. At that hearing the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\">\u201cThe Court: ... In the matter of People versus Magana, record should reflect the presence of Ms. Woo on behalf of the People, Mr. Prieston on behalf of the defendant, who is not present. [H] This is a matter that had had [\u25a0ric] been set for probation and sentencing. The defendant not being present, the court is going to issue a bench warrant to stay it to October 25th at 9:00 a.m. for probation and sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">\u201cThe Clerk: How much, Judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">\u201cThe Court: Bail in the sum of $25,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">\u201cMr. Prieston: Judge, do you want to keep jurisdiction and forfeit the bail and I\u2019ll get a resumption from the bail bondsman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-8\">\u201cThe Court: No. Stay the forfeiture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-9\">\u201cMr. Prieston: No. Stay the forfeiture, stay on the warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-10\">\u201cThe Clerk: Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">Neither the minutes<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nor the transcript of proceedings indicated any reason or explanation for Magana\u2019s failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">On October 25, 1996, the date to which the case had been continued, Magana failed to appear, and the bail was declared forfeited. A bench warrant was issued and bail was set at $5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">On April 11, 1997, Frontier noticed a motion to vacate the forfeiture and exonerate bail. In opposition to the motion, the district attorney submitted a declaration from the deputy who was present at the proceedings on September 27, 1996. In the declaration the deputy states that in an in camera discussion with the judge and defense counsel on September 27, 1996, she explained that Magana was currently acting as a confidential informant. She stated that she informed the judge that there may have been some confusion as to whether Magana was aware of the court date and/or whether Magana was aware that his appearance was necessary. She told the judge that a task force agent with the drug enforcement administration had spoken with Magana within the preceding week. The agent had told Magana that he still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>had to make his next court date which was coming up in the next weeks. The deputy told the judge that there may have been confusion as to whether Magana was aware of the court appearance, since the agent had mentioned the court dates in \u201cthe next weeks.\u201d From these events the deputy district attorney concluded that based on information that the agent \u201chad recent contact with the Defendant, the confirmation that the Defendant was a confidential informant and the confusion concerning the court date, the Court found good cause to stay a bench warrant for the Defendant\u2019s nonappearance. Because the Defendant was a confidential informant, the Court did not state on the record the reasons for the stay on the warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The court denied Frontier\u2019s motion and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\"> \u201cWhere the evidence before the appellate court is not in dispute, the issue is one of law, in this case, statutory construction. The legal conclusions drawn by the trial court are not binding on appeal. ... In interpreting a statutory scheme, we apply these rules: \u2018Our function is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. ... To ascertain such intent, courts turn first to the words of the statute itself . . . , and seek to give the words employed by the Legislature their usual and ordinary meaning. . . . When interpreting statutory language, we may neither insert language which has been omitted nor ignore language which has been inserted. . . . The language must be construed in the context of the statutory framework as a whole, keeping in mind the policies and purposes of the statute . . . , and where possible the language should be read so as to conform to the spirit of the enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Amwest Surety Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 915, 919-920 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 29], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">The two pertinent statutes in this case are sections 1305 and 1305.1. Section 1305, subdivision (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA court shall declare forfeited the undertaking of bail or the money or property deposited as bail if, without sufficient excuse, a defendant fails to appear for any of the following: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (4) Any other occasion prior to the pronouncement of judgment if the defendant\u2019s presence in court is lawfully required.\u201d Thereafter, section 1305.1 states in pertinent part: \u201cIf the defendant fails to appear . . . upon any other occasion when his or her appearance is lawfully required, but the court has reason to believe that sufficient excuse may exist for the failure to appear, the court may continue the case for a period it deems reasonable to enable the defendant to appear without ordering a forfeiture of bail or issuing a bench warrant.\u201d In order to properly construe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>these forfeiture statutes it is first necessary to consider the nature and development of the law regarding the forfeiture of bail bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Sections 1305 through 1309 govern the forfeiture of bail bonds. Because the law disfavors forfeitures, including the forfeiture of bail, these statutory provisions must be strictly construed in favor of the surety to avoid the harsh results of forfeiture. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ranger Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1305 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 343].) Moreover, section 1305, like other forfeiture statutes, has been held to be jurisdictional in a variety of circumstances. Thus, the provisions of the statute must be strictly followed or the court acts without or in excess of jurisdiction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Topa Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 296, 300 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 167]; <em>People </em>v. <em>American Bankers Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 348, 354 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 620].)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>United Bonding Ins. Co. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 898 [98 Cal.Rptr. 57, 489 P.2d 1385], our Supreme Court was called upon to consider whether there is a jurisdictional although no express time limit within which an order of forfeiture must be made after a bailee\u2019s default. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 904.) The Supreme Court held that former section 1305 required that a court must declare a forfeiture of bail immediately on the day the defendant fails to appear if the failure to appear is \u201c \u2018without sufficient excuse.\u2019 \u201d (5 Cal.3d at p. 906.) The court concluded that \u201cthe court\u2019s failure to declare a forfeiture upon a nonappearance without sufficient excuse, either where no excuse is offered or where the finding of an excuse constitutes an abuse of discretion, deprives the court of jurisdiction to later declare a forfeiture.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 907.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The high court finally held that: \u201cCourt minutes which fail to disclose that the court has expressly excused a nonappearance on a record which is silent as to a defendant\u2019s reasons therefor, will require a reviewing court to conclude that a nonappearance was without sufficient excuse and that the right to declare a forfeiture not having been exercised was foreclosed. An excused nonappearance, accordingly, should be expressly reflected in the minutes.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>United Bonding Ins. Co., supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 907.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">When the Supreme Court decided <em>United Bonding, </em>it made no reference to the 1969 amendment which added subdivision (b) to section 1305 (now section 1305.1). However, the court used language remarkably similar to that of the amendment when it held: \u201cThe failure to so declare an immediate forfeiture upon the nonappearance of a defendant bailee can be justified only where there is some rational basis for a belief at the time of his nonappearance that there exists sufficient excuse therefor.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>United Bonding Ins. Co., supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 906.) As one court observed, \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s language and reasoning on this issue [immediate forfeiture] in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number><em>United Bonding </em>appear equally applicable to an interpretation of the language added to the statute in 1969, as it would be impossible for a trial court, in the exercise of sound judicial discretion, to have \u2018reason to believe that sufficient excuse may exist\u2019 for a nonappearance if there were not some basis in <em>fact </em>for such a conclusion. (\u00a7 1305, subd. (b).) There could be no good faith \u2018belief to support a delay in ordering forfeiture that was not grounded in \u2018some rational basis.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>United Bonding Ins. Co., supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 906.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Surety Ins. Co. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 22, 27 [211 Cal.Rptr. 204], italics in original) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Surety Ins. Co., </em>the court held that the \u201ctest is not mere <em>possibility </em>of sufficient excuse, but some rational basis for belief of sufficient excuse.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Nevertheless, the 1969 amendment to section 1305 abolished the requirement that the existence of an excuse must be set forth in the minutes. Subsequent decisions to <em>United Bonding </em>have held that the entire record of the hearing where the defendant failed to appear may be considered, and the excuse no longer need be expressly set out in the minutes. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Amwest Surety Ins. Co., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 922; <em>People </em>v. <em>National Automobile &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 302, 304, 306 [142 Cal.Rptr. 98]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Surety Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 197, 199, 201 [127 Cal.Rptr. 451]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilshire Ins. Co. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 256, 258-261 [125 Cal.Rptr. 529].) Thus, the reviewing court may look to the reporter\u2019s transcript, as well as the minutes, to supply a sufficient record of sufficient excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Given this evolution of the forfeiture statutes we address the case at bench. The first obstacle we encounter is that neither the minutes nor the court\u2019s transcript of the proceedings on September 27, 1996, offer any evidence of sufficient excuse for defendant Magana\u2019s failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>American Bankers Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1363 [264 Cal.Rptr. 152], the defendant did not appear at the probation and sentencing hearing and the matter was twice continued. When the defendant again did not appear, the court ordered bail forfeited. The surety argued, and the Court of Appeal agreed, that the trial court\u2019s failure to declare the bond forfeited on the first day the defendant failed to appear deprived the court of jurisdiction over the bond, because there was no showing on the record that the trial court had reason to believe that sufficient excuse may have existed for the defendant\u2019s absence. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1365-1366.) The same reasoning is equally applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The district attorney\u2019s belated explanation for a silent record does not alter our view. Even if we take the deputy district attorney\u2019s declaration as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>something more than mere speculation, the declaration fails to explain why the court did not merely state, either on the record or in the minutes, that as a result of an in camera conference, it had reason to believe that sufficient excuse existed for Magana\u2019s failure to appear. In the absence of such a statement, we are left with the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that \u201cCourt minutes which fail to disclose that the court has expressly excused a nonappearance on a record which is silent as to a defendant\u2019s reasons therefor, will require a reviewing court to conclude that a nonappearance was without sufficient excuse and that the right to declare a forfeiture not having been exercised was foreclosed.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>United Bonding Ins. Co., supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 907.)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The order is reversed, and the trial court is directed to vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the undertaking. Costs awarded to Frontier Pacific Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Cottle, P. J., and Bamattre-Manoukian, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-13\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b778-14\">Despite the fact that the minutes indicate that the bond was forfeited, the parties agreed that a forfeiture was mistakenly reflected in the minute form.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
