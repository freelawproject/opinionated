(Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 5141.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They challenged the decision of the Santa Cruz Assessment Appeals Board (AAB) to tax certain rate protection provisions included as part of the cable operators\u2019 franchise agreements with local governments. The trial court determined that the rate protection provisions were enforceable restrictions and therefore not subject to taxation. It excised the rate protection provisions from the AAB\u2019s calculations but left the rest of the AAB\u2019s determination intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>On appeal, the County of Santa Cruz argues that (1) the cable operators did not exhaust their administrative remedies; (2) the rate protection provisions were not enforceable restrictions but \u201cin kind\u201d payments; and (3) the trial court erred in failing to remand the matter to the AAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">We will conclude that (1) the exhaustion requirement was satisfied; (2) the rate protection provisions were enforceable restrictions; (3) the trial court did not err in failing to remand the matter to the AAB. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">This case concerns the cable television system serving the Cities of Santa Cruz and Scotts Valley and certain unincorporated portions of Santa Cruz County (the cable system). The cable system reaches customers by transmitting television signals via cable from a central distribution point, commonly referred to as a headend, to each customer\u2019s home. About two-thirds of the cable is located on public land, and about one-third is situated on private land.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The cable system operator must obtain permission from the local government to operate the cable system within the local government boundaries and to place its cable on public land. (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 541; Gov. Code, \u00a7 53066.) Both authorizations are set forth within the franchise agreement between the local government and the cable system operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">The Santa Cruz County cable television market is unique due to limited over-the-air television reception. Because of this limitation, there have been significantly higher than average penetration rates since the system\u2019s construction. In fact, in an unrelated judicial proceeding, it was determined that the Santa Cruz area constituted a \u201ccaptive market\u201d and that the Santa Cruz cable operator therefore possessed a monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">The uniqueness of the Santa Cruz market prompted the local government to attempt to quantify the profitability of the Santa Cruz cable franchises by comparing them with franchises serving communities with viable over-the-air reception. The local government sought to obtain a portion of the economic surplus for itself and for subscribers by implementing rate controls as part of the franchise agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">With this in mind, the local government solicited bids for a cable provider. Negotiations with Group W, the prior cable operator, had disintegrated. In 1986, Greater Santa Cruz Cable TV Associates (GSCC) was awarded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>franchise. As part of the franchise agreement, GSCC agreed to controls on the rates it could charge for its cable service.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">On June 18, 1987, respondent CAT Partnership acquired the cable system. Respondent Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) was one of three partners in CAT Partnership. On September 9, 1989, the cable system was acquired by its current owner, respondent UACC Midwest, Inc. (UACC). UACC is a subsidiary of TCI. When UACC assumed ownership of the cable system franchise, it also agreed to restrictions (the rate protection provisions) on the rates it could charge for cable service.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The Santa Cruz County Assessor calculated the property tax owed by the cable operator for the possessory interest in the cable system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Respondents disagreed with the assessor\u2019s decision. CAT and UACC appealed the assessor\u2019s property tax determination to the Santa Cruz County Assessment Appeals Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">The AAB used an income approach to determine the fair market value of the cable operator\u2019s possessory interest in the cable system. The AAB based its determination upon the annual rent which it interpreted as the economic rent. The AAB found that economic rent constituted the amount that would be <em>paid in money or in kind </em>for the right to use the real property which constituted the possessory interest. (Property Tax Rule, \u00a7 21, subd. (g).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to the amounts offered in kind for the franchise, the AAB considered a number of concessions and services. Among others, these included subscriber rate protection provisions and senior citizen and handicapped rate protections (collectively the rate protection provisions).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">In its decision, the AAB recognized that the tax owed could be reduced by enforceable restrictions upon the property. However, the AAB found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>in-kind concessions or services were not enforceable restrictions. The AAB reasoned that the concessions and services were not required by regulation but were offered by bidders as part of the franchise bidding process. The AAB also found that the concessions and services listed were not \u201cland use restrictions\u201d needed to implement a public policy of encouraging and maintaining effective land use planning. The AAB concluded that only these types of land use restrictions were excludable in its calculation of the economic rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The cable operators disagreed with the AAB\u2019s decision. They alleged multiple errors by the AAB, including the alleged erroneous taxation of the rate protection provisions. In 1995, CAT Partnership and UACC filed a refund claim with the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors. In 1996, TCI filed a virtually identical claim for a refund. The claim for refund was denied by the board of supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">CAT Partnership and UACC filed a complaint in superior court seeking a property tax refund. (\u00a7 5141.) TCI filed a similar action and the two claims were consolidated. CAT Partnership, UACC and TCI all argued that it was improper to tax the rate protection provisions because the provisions constituted enforceable restrictions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">After considering the evidence, the trial court ruled that the assessment of the rate protection provisions was erroneous, void and illegal in its entirety. Since the AAB had assigned a separate taxable value to the rate protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>provisions, the trial court subtracted that value from the AAB\u2019s calculation of the in-kind portion of the economic rent and adjusted the figures with the rate protection provisions excised. The trial court left the rest of the AAB property tax determination intact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">The County of Santa Cruz appeals the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">We review questions of fact resolved in an administrative proceeding under the substantial evidence standard. Questions of law are subject to de novo review. <em>(Bret Harte Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 14, 23 [127 Cal.Rptr. 154, 544 P.2d 1354].)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">The AAB is required to use a reasonable method in estimating the value of property. (Property Tax Rule, \u00a7 3; <em>De Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Diego County </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 546, 563-564 [290 P.2d 544]; <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 60 [186 Cal.Rptr. 16]; <em>Shubat </em>v. <em>Sutter County Assessment Appeals Bd., supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 794.) The AAB\u2019s decision about which valuation methodology to use is a question of law subject to challenge if the valuation method is arbitrary, in excess of discretion, or in violation of specific standards imposed by law. <em>{Bret Harte Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 14, 23.) Accordingly, the selection of a valuation method must be sustained unless it is arbitrary, in excess of discretion, or in violation of law. <em>(GTE Sprint Communications Corp. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 992, 1002 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 882].)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">I. <em>Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Appellant argues that respondent TCI failed to exhaust its administrative remedies because TCI was not an applicant in the AAB proceeding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we explain below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>Section 1603 permits \u201cthe party affected or his or her agent\u201d to prosecute an appeal before the AAB.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> TCI argues that CAT Partnership and UACC were \u201cparties affected\u201d and therefore it was permissible for CAT and UACC to be applicants before the AAB even though TCI was not. We need not determine whether CAT and UACC may be characterized as \u201cparties affected\u201d pursuant to 1603. This is because we conclude that the exhaustion requirement is satisfied in these particular circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies is a fundamental prerequisite of judicial jurisdiction in all California administrative agency matters. <em>(Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 292 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715]; <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 977, 982\u2019 [88 Cal.Rptr. 533]; <em>County of Contra Costa </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 62, 77 [222 Cal.Rptr. 750].) The rule prevents premature judicial interference with the actions of the legislative branch, acting through statutorily authorized administrative agencies. It also permits disputes to be reviewed in the first instance by agencies presumably specially equipped to consider the matters consigned to them and more expert in such matters than courts of general jurisdiction. (See, e.g., <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Department of Fair Employment &amp; Housing </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1414, 1416-1417 [239 Cal.Rptr. 908]; <em>Yamaha Motor Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1232, 1240 [230 Cal.Rptr. 382].)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">The exhaustion doctrine is favored because it facilitates development of a complete record drawing on administrative expertise and also fosters a preliminary administrative sifting process which in turn fosters judicial economy. <em>(Yamaha Motor Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at p. 1240; <em>Bozaich </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 688 [108 Cal.Rptr. 392].) Accordingly, it follows that the more comprehensive the administrative remedy, the more useful the agency findings and determinations will be if judicial enforcement proves necessary. Similarly, the more comprehensive the administrative remedy, the more clear it is that the Legislature intended that the agency have precedence.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">In this case, the policies underlying the exhaustion requirement were fully satisfied even though TCI was not a formal applicant in the proceeding before the AAB. The underlying issues were thoroughly litigated before the AAB. The AAB undertook an extensive evaluation of the evidence. There was never any question that the evaluation applied equally to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>TCI, as well as to CAT Partnership and UACC. Indeed, TCI was one of three partners in CAT and also a successor in interest to CAT. Thus, this case does not implicate premature judicial interference with the AAB\u2019s jurisdiction or disclose a failure to fully utilize administrative expertise. Quite clearly, the issue of the property tax owed by the cable system owners was extensively and completely examined by the AAB. Moreover, in the proceeding before the AAB, the AAB treated TCI as if it were an applicant. The AAB decision listed TCI in the caption and designated TCI as one of the applicants, along with CAT and UACC. In fact, appellant itself referred to TCI as an applicant. Given this situation, to conclude that TCI failed to exhaust its administrative remedies would exalt form over substance and require that we ignore the reality of what happened before the AAB. For these reasons, appellant\u2019s argument that TCI failed to exhaust its administrative remedies is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">II. <em>Taxation of Rate Protection Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Having rejected appellant\u2019s exhaustion argument, we next determine whether the rate protection provisions are \u201cin kind\u201d payments to the local government or enforceable restrictions. We will conclude the provisions are enforceable restrictions and therefore they should not have been considered in the AAB\u2019s economic rent calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">A. <em>Background Tax Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">We begin with the applicable tax law principles.  The franchise right to do business is a valuable but nonassessable portion of the franchise. (\u00a7 107.7; <em>County of Stanislaus </em>v. <em>Assessment Appeals Bd. </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1445, 1454 [262 Cal.Rptr. 439]; <em>Shubat </em>v. <em>Sutter County Assessment Appeals Bd., supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 794, 802.) The franchise right to locate cable on public streets and rights of way is a possessory interest in real property. (\u00a7 107.7; <em>Cox Cable San Diego, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 368 [229 Cal.Rptr. 839].) Because the possessory interests are interests in real property, their assessment is governed by principles set forth in the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">The California Constitution provides that all property \u201cshall be assessed at the same percentage of fair market value.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 1, subd. (a).) \u201cFair market value\u201d or \u201cfull cash value\u201d is the \u201cappraised value of real property when ... a change in ownership has occurred after the 1975 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>assessment.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 2.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cFull cash value\u201d or \u201cfair market value\u201d is defined as \u201cthe amount of cash or its equivalent that property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market under conditions in which neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies of the other and both with knowledge of all of the uses and purposes to which the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used and of the enforceable restrictions upon those uses and purposes.\u201d (\u00a7 110; see also <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1019, 1026 [263 Cal.Rptr. 887]; <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 715, 722 [268 Cal.Rptr. 294].)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">In determining the fair market value of the possessory interest for purposes of assessing property tax, the AAB may utilize three methods. These are: (1) the comparable sales method; (2) the income method (including but not limited to, capitalizing rent); or (3) the cost method. (\u00a7 107.7, subd. (a); see also <em>De Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 546, 563-565; <em>Bret Harte Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Under the comparable sales method, the assessor analyzes and correlates the sales prices of other transactions involving comparable properties. <em>{Bret Harte Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>City and City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 23.) If the income method is used, then the assessor capitalizes the sum of future income of the property, subject to an allowance for the risk of receiving partial income or no income. <em>(De Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 546; <em>Bret Harte Inn, Inc., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 23.) The cost method requires the assessor to subtract depreciation from a figure that reflects cost. (See Property Tax Rule, \u00a7 6; <em>Bret Harte Inn, Inc., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">The preferred method of valuing a cable television possessory interest is the income method, capitalized to the <em>annual rent, </em>using an appropriate capitalization rate. (\u00a7 107.7, subd. (b)(1).) \u201cAnnual rent\u201d is defined as either \u201cthat portion of the franchise fee received by the franchising authority that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>determined to be payment for the cable television possessory interest for the actual remaining term or the reasonably anticipated term of the franchise or license; or <em>the appropriate economic rent.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 107.7, subd. (b)(2), italics added.) \u201cEconomic rent\u201d is defined as \u201cthe amount that would <em>be paid in money or kind </em>for the right to use real property if (1) the contract rent were currently negotiated under the conditions which exist in a free and competitive market, and (2) the fee owner property taxes on the value of the fee.\u201d (Property Tax Rule, \u00a7 21, subd. (g), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">In determining fair market value, enforceable restrictions upon the property may be taken into account. As already noted, section 110 defines \u201cfull cash value\u201d or \u201cfair market value\u201d as \u201cthe amount of cash or its equivalent that property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market under conditions in which neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies of the other and both with knowledge of all of the uses and purposes to which the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used <em>and of the enforceable restrictions upon those uses and purposes.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 110, italics added.) Similarly, section 402.1 directs the assessor to consider \u201cthe effect upon value of <em>any enforceable restrictions </em>to which the use of the land may be subjected.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Italics added.) Property Tax Rule section 2 provides that in determining \u201cfair market value\u201d one must take into account <em>\u201clegally enforceable governmental restrictions\u201d </em>(italics added) applicable to the subject property. Finally, in discussing the income approach, the Property Tax Rules provide that \u201c(c) The amount to be capitalized is the net return which a reasonably well informed owner and reasonably well informed buyers may anticipate on the valuation date that the taxable property existing on that date will yield under prudent management <em>and subject to such legally enforceable restrictions as such persons may foresee as of that date.\u201d </em>(Property Tax Rule, \u00a7 8, subd. (c), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>The types of restrictions that constitute enforceable restrictions have been described as virtually any government restriction designed to serve the interest of public health, safety, morals and/or general public welfare. (Cal. State Bd. of Equalization, Assessors Handbook 501, General Appraisal Manual (1975) pp. 501t506.) As one commentator stated, \u201cGenerally, any sort of binding agreement with a government agency should qualify [as an enforceable restriction], whether or not recorded. . . . Most agreements between the owner and other private persons probably do not qualify.\u201d (2 Ehrman &amp; Flavin, Taxing Cal. Property (3d ed. 1997) \u00a7 25:11, p. 19.) Courts have interpreted the term \u201cenforceable restrictions\u201d to refer to government restrictions. <em>(Carlson </em>v. <em>Assessment Appeals Bd. I </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1010 [213 Cal.Rptr. 555]; see also <em>Dominguez Energy </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 839, 854 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 766].) In <em>Dominguez Energy </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>the court said there is an enforceable restriction when \u201cthe land is subject to restrictions imposed by government which affect its value.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 854.)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">B. <em>AAB\u2019s Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">The AAB decided that section 402.l\u2019s reference to \u201cenforceable restrictions\u201d only applied to land use restrictions needed to implement a public policy of encouraging and maintaining effective land use planning. We disagree with the AAB\u2019s determination. First, section 402.l\u2019s plain language provides that its listed restrictions are not exclusive. In particular, it provides that \u201cThese restrictions shall include, <em>but are not limited to, </em>all of the following . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Second, no court has limited section 402.l\u2019s reference to \u201cenforceable restrictions\u201d to the meaning utilized by the AAB. Third, an Attorney General opinion interpreted section 402.1 to apply to rent controls, thereby expressly contradicting the interpretation relied upon by the AAB. (59 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 293 (1976).)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">In the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, the federal government subsidized a private housing project. The project mortgage was federally insured and HUD (Housing and Urban Development) paid the mortgagee all interest on the mortgage loan in excess of one percent per annum. In return, the owner of the project executed a regulatory agreement with the federal government which imposed several restrictions upon the owner. Most importantly, the agreement restricted the maximum rental that the owner could charge tenants and curtailed the owner\u2019s power to transfer the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">The Attorney General decided that the restrictions constituted \u201cenforceable restrictions\u201d within the meaning of section 402.1: \u201cThere is nothing in the overall context of section 402.1 nor in its legislative history which would suggest that the words \u2018any enforceable restrictions to which the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>of the land may be subjected\u2019 used therein should not be given their natural significance. This being so, it is clear that an enforceable rent limitation would constitute such a restriction upon what would otherwise be a permissible use to which the land may be subjected, to wit: the rental of the property at the maximum rates the open market would allow.\u201d (59 Cal.Ops.Atty.Gen., <em>supra, </em>293, 295.)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">The reasoning of the Attorney General opinion is recognized by the State Board of Equalization. In its Assessors Handbook on the income method, it is stated: \u201cIf, however, the rent is artificially low because of rent control, it is by government action that the rent is low and it cannot be ignored. <em>Rent control is a restriction on property as certainly as a zoning ordinance is a restriction, and it must be recognized.\u201d </em>(Cal. State Bd. of Equalization, Assessors Handbook 501A, The Income Approach to Value (1989) p. 501A-9, italics added.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Similarly, in the Appraisers Handbook 568, Appraisal of Cable Television, prepared in 1977, it is noted that price controls were the norm. According to the handbook, in using the income valuation approach, the assessor must use the cable operator\u2019s actual charges for monthly service because they are \u201cusually limited by the franchiser.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 568-27 to 568-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">These authorities demonstrate that the AAB misinterpreted section 402.1 when it decided that section 402.1 was limited to land use restrictions. Besides misapprehending section 402.1, the AAB also overlooked the fact that the enforceable restriction principle is not limited to section 402.1.  A general tenet of property tax law is that when land is subject to a restriction which affects its value, then that restriction should be considered in determining the property\u2019s fair market value. (\u00a7 110, subd. (a); see also Property Tax Rule, \u00a7 8.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This principle is related to the requirement that the land be valued at its highest and best use subject to the condition that the use be one which is <em>legally permissible. </em>(2 Ehrman &amp; Flavin, Taxing Cal. Property, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 18:07 p. 12; see also <em>County of Riverside </em>v. <em>Palm-Ramon Development Co. </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 534 [47 Cal.Rptr. 377, 407 P.2d 289].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A use which is forbidden because of an enforceable restriction is generally not a use that is legally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>The AAB also erred in basing its decision upon the fact that respondents were awarded the cable franchise as part of a free and competitive process. Our review of the record reveals that the rate protection provisions were, in effect, a required part of the franchise agreement. The county was not going to award the franchise to a cable operator unless the cable operator agreed to controls on the rates it could charge. In fact, the county\u2019s expressed objectives during the franchising process included obtaining affordable pricing of basic cable television services. The AAB\u2019s emphasis upon a free and competitive process ignores this fundamental reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The AAB\u2019s focus upon the free and competitive franchise bidding process seems tied to a belief that the rate protection provisions were not enforceable restrictions because the cable system operators voluntarily entered into the franchise agreements. In this respect, we think the AAB confused the property tax treatment of property subject to a private agreement with the property tax treatment of property subject to an. agreement with the government. For example, if two private parties enter into a lease and the rent is lower than what might be market supported, then the property tax calculation will generally be based upon the market-supported rent, rather than the rent required under the lease. (See, e.g., <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 390 [102 Cal.Rptr. 687]; see also <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Assessment Appeals Bd. I, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1010-1011.) The same rule, however, obviously does not apply here since the agreement was with the local government. After all, it is only <em>governmental </em>enforceable restrictions which affect fair market value. <em>(Carlson </em>v. <em>Assessment Appeals, Bd. I, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d at p. 1011.) In fact, the opinion of the Attorney General specifically rejected a similar argument. It stated that \u201c. . . the fact that the 236 project owner voluntarily entered into the regulatory agreement with the federal government does not dictate a contrary conclusion. The reference in subdivision (b) [of section 402.1] to \u2018contracts\u2019 with governmental agencies makes it clear that restrictions voluntarily assumed were intended to come within the scope of section 402.1.\u201d (59 Cal.Ops.Atty.Gen., <em>supra, </em>at p. 295.)</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">The AAB\u2019s reliance upon the free and competitive franchise bidding process also seems tied to the definition of economic rent. As noted, \u201ceconomic rent\u201d is \u201cthe contract rent [which would be] currently negotiated under the conditions which exist in a free and competitive market . . . .\u201d (Property Tax Rule, \u00a7 21, subd. (g).) Evidently, the AAB believed this definition validated its emphasis upon the free and competitive franchise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>bidding process. But the fact that the local government accepted bids from cable operators does not change the fact that the rate protection provisions were a required part of the franchise agreement package nor does it mean that the AAB was free to ignore the enforceable restriction principle in figuring the cable operators\u2019 economic rent. (See, e.g., <em>El Tej\u00f3n Cattle Co. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 428 [50 Cal.Rptr. 546, 413 P.2d 146] [lease restrictions on use of government property properly taken into account in figuring economic rent].)</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">C. <em>Appellant\u2019s Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Appellant argues the rate protection provisions were \u201ctransfer\u201d payments made by respondents to the local government as a valuable part of the consideration for receiving the franchise rights. This argument rests upon the fundamentally unworkable premise that an enforceable restriction, which is in essence a negative covenant, can somehow be transformed into a transfer payment. In trying to support its position, appellant states that \u201c[o]ne would assume that the buyers paid less for the Santa Cruz system based upon the inclusion of price controls than it would have paid had rates been deregulated and the operator was able to fully exploit the market conditions associated with Santa Cruz\u2019s \u2018captive market\u2019 . . . .\u201d But this argument simply ignores the relation between the rate protection provisions and what the cable system operators actually received. Although appellant maintains that the cable system was more valuable because it was directed at a captive market, the fact is that the rate protection provisions represented the precise way in which the cable operators were prevented from unduly exploiting that captive market. Appellant\u2019s argument improperly focuses upon what the cable system owners \u201cgave up\u201d to obtain the franchise instead of focusing on what they \u201cgot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Appellant\u2019s entire brief is filled with statements which simply ignore the reality of what happened. For example, appellant states: \u201cFirst, absent the price control mechanism contained in the Consent Judgment, did the Respondents possess the legal ability to charge rates in excess of those allowed by the Consent Judgment? The undisputed answer to this question is yes. Second, absent the rate control provisions in the Consent Judgment, did the Respondents possess the practical or market receptive ability to charge rates in excess of the Consent Judgment? The Assessor and the AAB said \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201d These hypothetical questions are not particularly useful in advancing appellant\u2019s position. This is because the rate controls did exist, were part of an agreement with the <em>local government, </em>and therefore the cable system owners did <em>not </em>have the ability to charge rates in excess of the rate protection provisions. As already noted, it does not matter that the agreements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>entered into voluntarily. Further, if we were to accept appellant\u2019s position, then similar hypothetical questions could just as easily be applied to zoning restrictions, hazardous waste land use restrictions, or any government-imposed restrictions on the use of real property. The upshot would be to excise the enforceable restriction principle from property tax law.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Accordingly, we conclude the rate protection provisions constitute enforceable restrictions. Just as the rent control provisions restricted the rent the landlord could charge its tenants, so do the rate protection provisions restrict what the cable operators may charge their cable customers. The rate protection provisions constitute a \u201crestriction\u201d on the property, resulting in rates which are lower than what might be market supported absent the government regulation. As such, the AAB should not have included the rate protection provisions in its calculation of the in-kind portion of the economic rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">III. <em>Whether to Remand to AAB</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court should have remanded the matter to the AAB so that the AAB could recalculate the property tax owed based upon the determination that the rate protection provisions were enforceable restrictions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">A remand to the AAB is generally required if the refund determination depends upon an exercise of valuation functions and does not simply involve mathematical computations. <em>(Union Pacific Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 983, 1001 [282 Cal.Rptr. 745].) The \u201ccases establish that the key question concerning remand is whether there remain factual determinations to be made in establishing market value.\u201d <em>(Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.3d 1142, 1161.) Under section 5144, \u201c[i]f the court finds that an assessment is void in whole or in part, it shall render judgment for the plaintiff for the amount of the taxes paid on that portion of the assessment that is found to be void.\u201d (See also <em>Parr-Richmond Industrial Corp. </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 157, 168 [272 P.2d 16].)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">In this case, the valuation method used by the AAB was proper. The error was in the AAB\u2019s decision to include the rate protection provisions in its calculation of the economic rent. Because the AAB assigned a separate value to the rate protection provisions, the trial court simply excised that value from the AAB determination and recalculated the economic rent accordingly. Because this recalculation did not involve factual questions, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>essentially just involved subtracting a sum from the total in-kind portion of the economic rent and adjusting the resulting figures, we do not believe remand to the AAB is required. Appellant contends that if the rate protection provisions are enforceable restrictions then the valuation methodology used by the AAB was fundamentally flawed. But there is no dispute that the income and economic rent approach used by the AAB was proper. Appellant simply seeks to reargue what has already been determined and what it had previously agreed to. Considerations of fairness and judicial economy also support not permitting appellant to reargue its position under the rubric of seeking a different valuation method. (See, e.g., <em>Union Pacific Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d 983, 1001; <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.3d at p. 1161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Premo, Acting P.

To calculate the monetary portion of the economic rent, the AAB utilized 5 percent of gross revenues and calculated the revenue stream over a 20-year term. The AAB then discounted the amounts to a current value. With respect to the amounts offered in kind for the franchise, the AAB figured the undiscounted value of the applicable concessions and services. It then calculated the discounted present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>value of the in-kind concessions and services. The AAB next totaled the in-kind concessions and added that total to the sum calculated as the monetary portion of the economic rent. The result was the capitalized economic rent valuation. The AAB allocated 50 percent of the capitalized economic rent to the nontaxable right to do business. The other 50 percent of the capitalized economic rent the AAB assigned to the taxable possessory interest. (See, e.g., <em>Shubat </em>v. <em>Sutter County Assessment Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 794, 807-808 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 1].) Accordingly, the AAB divided the capitalized annual rent for each period by two. The result was the AAB\u2019s determination of the fair market value of the possessory interest. Pursuant to section 51, the adjusted base year value for the possessory interest is limited to a 2 percent annual adjustment. The AAB adjusted the figures accordingly to result in the taxable fair market values of the possessory interest. The adjusted figures were as follows: June 18, 1987 March 1, 1988 March 1, 1989 April 7, 1989 March 1, 1990 March 1, 1991 March 1, 1992 March 1, 1993 $8,665,559' $8,786,639 $8,962,372 $19,888,459 $20,266,610 $20,671,942 $21,085,381 $21,507,089</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b930-18\">Respondents did not challenge the propriety of including the other in-kind concessions and services in the calculation of the economic rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b931-11\">The trial court did correct a math error in the calculation of the possessory interest values.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b931-12\">CAT Partnership and UACC were applicants in the proceeding before the AAB.
