In the published portion of this opinion, we explain that this indorsement is both restrictive (the check must be deposited and cannot otherwise be negotiated) and blank (to the extent that it does not identify the person for whose benefit the check must be deposited). \u201cX, for deposit only\u201d is to a deposit as is a blank payee to a signed check. For this reason (and others explained in the unpublished portion of this opinion), we affirm an order of dismissal entered after a demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">On December 6, 1993, Max Wolf died. Within days, Sherri Spencer (later appointed Wolf\u2019s executrix) hired Angela Wallace, a lawyer, to initiate probate proceedings. Instead, Wallace allegedly converted assets from Wolf\u2019s estate, \u201cforging [Wolf\u2019s] signature ... to obtain funds held in deposit accounts located\u201d at three banks, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">On December 13, 1993, Home Savings of America issued \u201ca cashier\u2019s check . . . payable by . . . Home [Savings] to \u2018Max or Katherine Wolf\u2019 in the amount of $75,926.90 . . . .\u201d On December 15, Wallace deposited this cashier\u2019s check to her client trust account at Sterling Bank. The check (issued after Wolf\u2019s death) purports to be indorsed (by hand) by Max Wolf, \u201cFor Deposit Only,\u201d then indorsed again (by indorsement stamp) by Wallace for deposit to her Sterling Bank client trust account. On December 16, Home Savings paid \u201cthe full amount of its cashier\u2019s check\u201d to Sterling Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">On December 21, 1993, American Savings Bank issued a cashier\u2019s check payable by American Savings to Max Wolf in the amount of $79,747.80. On December 22, Wallace deposited this cashier\u2019s check to her client trust account at Sterling Bank. This check was indorsed in the same manner as the Home Savings check. On December 23, American Savings paid \u201cthe full amount of its cashier\u2019s check\u201d to Sterling Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">On December 22, 1993, Great Western Bank issued a cashier\u2019s check payable by Great Western to Max Wolf in the amount of $51,264.39. On December 22, Wallace deposited this cashier\u2019s check to her client trust account at Sterling Bank. This check was indorsed in the same manner as the Home Savings and American Savings checks. On December 23, Great Western paid \u201cthe full amount of its cashier\u2019s check\u201d to Sterling Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>Based on these transactions, Spencer (as Wolf\u2019s executrix) sued Wallace, Sterling Bank, the issuing banks and others, alleging that \u201cDefendants have failed and refuse[d] to account to [her] for the monies taken . . . .\u201d As against Sterling Bank (the only defendant before us on this appeal),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Spencer alleged causes of action for conversion, \u201cdamages due to unauthorized or forged drawer\u2019s and endorser\u2019s signature,\u201d \u201cbreach of restrictive endorsement\u201d and a common count for money had and received.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Over Spencer\u2019s opposition, Sterling Bank\u2019s demurrers were sustained without leave to amend. Spencer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Spencer contends that, in light of the indorsements (\u201cMax Wolf \u2018for deposit only\u2019 \u201d), she has a cause of action for \u201cbreach of a restrictive indorsement\u201d against Sterling Bank. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Checks, including cashiers\u2019 checks, are \u201cnegotiable instruments\u201d covered by Division Three of the California Commercial Code, section 3101 et seq.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7 3104, subds. (c), (f).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A \u201ccashier\u2019s check\u201d is a draft<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with respect to which the drawer<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and drawee<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are the same bank or branches of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>bank. (\u00a7 3104, subd. (g).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A check is \u201cissued\u201d when the drawer first delivers it \u201cfor the purpose of giving rights on the instrument to any person.\u201d (\u00a7 3105, subd. (a).) For our purposes, a \u201cdepositary bank\u201d is \u201cthe first bank to take an item . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 4105, subd. (2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">As relevant, an \u201cindorsement\u201d is a signature that alone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (1) negotiating<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the instrument or (2) restricting payment of the instrument. (\u00a7 3204, subd. (a).) An \u201cindorser\u201d is a person who makes an indorsement. (\u00a7 3204, subd. (b).) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument and the indorsement identifies a person to whom it makes the instrument payable, it is a \u201cspecial indorsement.\u201d When specially indorsed, an instrument becomes payable to the identified person and may be negotiated only by the indorsement of that person. (\u00a7 3205, subd. (a).) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument and it is not a special indorsement, it is a \u201cblank endorsement.\u201d When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to the bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially indorsed. (\u00a7 3205, subd. (b).) The holder may convert a blank indorsement that consists only of a signature into a special indorsement by writing, above the signature of the indorser, words identifying the person to whom the instrument is made payable. (\u00a7 3205, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">According to paragraph 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code comment to section 3205, \u201c[a] blank indorsement is usually the signature of the indorser on the back of the instrument without other words. ... A \u2018restrictive indorsement\u2019 described in Section [3206] can be either a blank indorsement or a special indorsement. \u2018Pay to T, in trust for B\u2019 is a restrictive indorsement. It is also a special indorsement because it identifies T as the person to whom the instrument is payable. <em>\u2018For deposit only\u2019 followed by the signature of the payee of a check is a restrictive indorsement. It is also a blank indorsement because it does not identify the person to whom the instrument is payable.\u201d </em>(Com., 23B West\u2019s Ann. Cal. U. Com. Code, <em>supra, </em>par. 2, foil. \u00a7 3205, p. 31, italics added.) As to a \u201cblank indorsement,\u201d the \u201cresult is analogous to that of a check in which the name of the payee is left blank by the drawer. In that case the check is payable to bearer.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">The plain language of this statutory scheme compels the conclusion that the indorsements in Wolf\u2019s name \u201cfor deposit only,\u201d while restrictive, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>also blank indorsements because they did not specify where or for whose benefit the checks were to be deposited. (Cf. <em>Nordin </em>v. <em>Eagle Rock State Bank </em>(1934) 139 Cal.App. 584, 593-594 [34 P.2d 490]; and see <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Security First Nat. Bank </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 450, 457-458 [59 Cal.Rptr. 563]; contra <em>LaJuntaState Bank </em>v. <em>Travis </em>(Colo. 1986) 727 P.2d 48,54-55.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, Sterling Bank\u2019s acceptance for collection of the three cashiers\u2019 checks from Wallace for deposit to her trust account was not a violation of a restrictive indorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">We reject Spencer\u2019s contention that Sterling Bank\u2019s acceptance of the cashiers\u2019 checks was \u201cinconsistent with the indorsement\u201d within the meaning of section 3206. Under subdivision (c)(2) of section 3206, \u201c[i]f an instrument bears an indorsement <em>... in blank or to a particular bank using the words \u2018for deposit, \u2019 for collection, \u2019 or other words indicating a purpose of having the instrument collected by a bank for the indorser or for a particular account, </em>... [a] depositary bank that . . . takes it for collection when so indorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid by the bank with respect to the instrument is received by the indorser or <em>applied consistently with the </em>indorsement.\u201d (Italics added.) Wolf\u2019s indorsements did not use any words \u201cindicating a purpose of having the instruments] collected by a bank for the indorser or for a particular account\u201d as required to create liability under subdivision (c)(2) of section 3206. The restriction was in blank, permitting a deposit to any account, at any bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Spencer cannot state a cause of action for breach of a restrictive indorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The order of dismissal is affirmed.
