The specific question on appeal is whether the California Life and Health Insurance Guarantee Association Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the Act) excludes from its coverage all guaranteed investment contracts. Respondent California Life and Health Insurance Guarantee Association (CLHIGA) contends that it does.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant Unisys Corporation (Unisys) asserts that the Act excludes only those guaranteed investment contracts that are \u201cunallocated annuity contracts\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We hold that the Act, by its plain language, excludes all guaranteed investment contracts from coverage. We therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of CLHIGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">A guaranteed investment contract, or GIC, is an investment device. Pursuant to the terms of the investment contract, the purchaser deposits a premium with the issuer and, in return, is paid a guaranteed rate of interest for a specified period. At the end of the contract period, the issuer, in this case Executive Life, repays the purchaser\u2019s premium. <em>(In re Unisys Sav. Plan Litigation </em>(3d Cir. 1996) 74 F.3d 420, 426.) It is undisputed for purposes of this appeal that the GIC\u2019s in question are group annuity contracts within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">In 1987 and 1988, the trustee of the Unisys plans purchased four separate GIC\u2019s from Executive Life. The claimed value of the Executive Life GIC\u2019s as of March 31, 1991, was approximately $178 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">In 1990, the Legislature enacted the predecessor of the Act, the California Life Insurance Guaranty Association Act. (Former \u00a7\u00a7 1067-1067.18 as enacted by Stats. 1990, ch. 1356, \u00a7 1, pp. 5970-5987.) In 1993, that act was repealed, reenacted with various changes, and given its current name.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1067 as enacted by Stats. 1993, ch. 974, \u00a7 1.7.) The stated purpose of the statutory scheme, as originally enacted and in its current form, is to provide certain limited guarantees for beneficiaries, holders, assignees, or payees of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>life insurance policies and annuity contracts in the event the issuing insurer becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to fulfill its contractual obligations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7\u00a7 1067.01, subd. (a), 1067.04, subds. (f), (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Executive Life was seized by the Insurance Commissioner in 1991, and insolvency proceedings began.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It defaulted on millions of dollars in principal and interest due on the four Unisys GIC\u2019s. In the wake of Executive Life\u2019s failure, Unisys brought this action to obtain declaratory and equitable relief requiring CLHIGA to provide coverage under the Act. CLHIGA moved for, and was granted, summary judgment. The trial court ruled that the Executive Life contracts were excluded from coverage by statute on the dual grounds that they were both unallocated annuity contracts and GIC\u2019s. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">I. <em>Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Summary judgment is proper only if the suit presents no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) On appeal from a grant of summary judgment, the trial court\u2019s determination of a question of law is subject to independent review. <em>(Ruoff </em>v. <em>Harbor Creek Community Assn. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1624, 1627 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 755]; <em>Wu </em>v. <em>Interstate Consolidated Industries </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1511, 1514 [277 Cal.Rptr. 546].)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">II. <em>The Act Expressly Excludes All GIC\u2019s From Coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Statutory interpretation is a question of law. <em>(Ruoff </em>v. <em>Harbor Creek Community Assn., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 1629.)  Here, clear statutory language compels the conclusion that the Legislature intended to exclude all GIC\u2019s from coverage under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Section 1067.02, subdivision (b)(1) outlines the policies, annuity contracts, and certificates covered under the Act. \u201cThis article shall provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>coverage to [specified persons] for direct, nongroup life, health,, annuity, and supplemental policies or contracts and for certificates under direct group life, health, annuity, and supplemental policies and contracts, <em>except as limited by this article. </em>Annuity contracts and certificates under group annuity contracts include, but are not limited to, structured settlement agreements, allocated annuity contracts, and any immediate or deferred annuity contracts, <em>and unallocated annuity contracts except those expressly excluded pursuant to subparagraph (D) of paragraph (2) of this </em>subdivision.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Section 1067.02, subdivision (b)(2) sets forth the limitations on coverage alluded to in subdivision (b)(1). In relevant part, it states: \u201cThis article shall not provide coverage for any of the following: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (D) <em>Guaranteed investment contracts, </em>guaranteed interest contracts, funding agreements, deposit administration contracts, <em>and all other unallocated annuity contracts . . . </em>(Italics added.) GIC\u2019s are, thus, expressly excluded from coverage. The Legislature would have been hard pressed to make this point more clearly.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Unisys concedes, for purposes of this appeal, that the contracts at issue here are GIC\u2019s within the meaning of the Act. It argues, however, that section 1067.02, subdivision (b)(2)(D) does not exclude from coverage <em>all </em>GIC\u2019s, but only those that are <em>also </em>\u201cunallocated annuity contracts.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is because \u201c[i]f the word \u2018other\u2019 in Section 1067.02(b)(2)(D) is accorded any significance, as it must be, it is only \u2018unallocated\u2019 GIC\u2019s which are expressly excluded from coverage. Therefore, even if the four Executive Life contracts are GIC\u2019s, they are excluded from coverage <em>only </em>if they are \u2018unallocated.\u2019 If a GIC is \u2018allocated,\u2019 it is clearly covered under Section 1067.02(b)(1) because <em>all </em>allocated annuity contracts are covered without exception.\u201d (Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The argument fails with its premise that the Legislature did not mean what it said when it listed GIC\u2019s among the items specifically excluded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>coverage.  In interpreting a statute, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he court turns first to the words themselves for the answer.\u201d [Citation.] We are required to give effect to statutes \u201caccording to the usual, ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.\u201d [Citations.] \u201cIf possible, significance should be given to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.\u201d [Citation.] \u201c[A] construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Woosley </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 758, 775-776 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 838 P.2d 758], final brackets added; <em>Ruoff </em>v. <em>Harbor Creek Community Assn., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 1629.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Unisys\u2019s construction is a remarkably convoluted way for the Legislature to make a point that could readily be stated with utmost clarity. Had the Legislature intended to limit its exclusion of GIC\u2019s to those that are unallocated, it certainly could have said so. The statutory language, however, supports a much more straightforward interpretation. Taken in its usual, ordinary sense, the Act excludes all GIC\u2019s, unallocated or otherwise. In addition, it excludes all other annuity contracts that are unallocated. Nothing in the statutory language suggests that the general exclusion of unallocated contracts was intended as qualifying the explicit exclusion of GIC\u2019s.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, Unisys\u2019s interpretation runs afoul of the rules of statutory interpretation in reducing to surplusage the specific reference to GIC\u2019s. Had the Legislature meant to exclude only unallocated GIC\u2019s from coverage, there would be no point in including GIC\u2019s as well as \u201call other unallocated annuity contracts\u201d in its list of excluded financial products.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Unisys\u2019s remaining argument is no more persuasive. It maintains section 1067.02, subdivision (b)(1) \u201cexpressly extends coverage to <em>all allocated </em>contracts, and excepts from coverage <em>only unallocated </em>contracts. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) As we understand the argument, Unisys contends the exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>for GIC\u2019s contained in section 1067.02, subdivision (b)(2)(D) applies only to <em>unallocated </em>contracts because subdivision (b)(1) references that exception only in relation to unallocated contracts: \u201cAnnuity contracts and certificates under group annuity contracts include, but are not limited to, structured settlement agreements, allocated annuity contracts, and any immediate or deferred annuity contracts, and unallocated annuity contracts <em>except those expressly excluded pursuant to subparagraph (D) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 1067.02, subd. (b)(1), italics added.) The reasoning is unpersuasive. One could posit that the italicized language qualifies only \u201cunallocated annuity contracts,\u201d the phrase immediately preceding it. (See <em>White </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 676, 680-681 [183 Cal.Rptr. 520, 646 P.2d 191].) Under that view, subdivision (b)(l)\u2019s definition of \u201cannuity contracts\u201d would include all allocated annuity contracts. That does not mean, however, that all allocated annuity contracts are covered. To the contrary, the first sentence of subdivision (b)(1) expressly contemplates coverage of annuity contracts or policies, without reference to allocation, <em>\u201cexcept as limited by this article.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Section 1067.02, subdivision (b)(2)(D) provides the pertinent limitation. Assuming arguendo that the Executive Life GIC\u2019s could be classified as allocated annuity contracts, they fall within the express exception for GIC\u2019s thus anticipated in section 1067.02, subdivision (b)(1) and set forth in subdivision (b)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Unisys suggests that only its analysis is congruent with the legislative directive to construe the Act liberally to effect its remedial purpose. (See \u00a7 1067.03.) The rule of liberal construction does not permit us to stand clear statutory language on its head. We conclude the Act excludes from coverage all GIC\u2019s, whether allocated or unallocated. Accordingly, we do not reach Unisys\u2019s further contention that the trial court erred in finding, as a matter of law, that the GIC\u2019s at issue are unallocated annuity contracts within the meaning of the Act. Nor need we dwell at any length on Unisys\u2019s assertion that the order granting summary judgment fails to refer to the evidence demonstrating a lack of any triable issue of fact. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (g).) First, the ruling that GIC\u2019s are excluded by operation of statute is a conclusion of law not dependent on an evidentiary basis. Second, even assuming such a deficiency, reversal would not be required. <em>(Goldrich </em>v. <em>Natural Y Surgical Specialties, Inc. </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 772, 782 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 162]; <em>Ruoff </em>v. <em>Harbor Creek Community Assn., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1627-1628; Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 1997) \u00b6 10:331:9, p. 10-103.)  \u201c \u2018It is the validity of the ruling which is reviewable and not the reasons therefor.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ruoff </em>v. <em>Harbor Creek Community Assn., supra, </em>at p. 1628.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Phelan, P.

Plan Litigation, supra, </em>74 F.3d at pages 425-432.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\">An unallocated annuity contract is defined as \u201cany annuity contract or group annuity certificate which is not issued to and owned by an individual, except to the extent of any annuity benefits guaranteed to an individual by an insurer under that contract or certificate, and except to the extent allowed in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 1067.02.\u201d (\u00a7 1067.04, subd. <em>(o).) </em>Considerable argument below and on appeal is devoted to whether the Executive Life GIC\u2019s are, as a matter of law, \u201cunallocated\u201d and, as such, excluded even under Unisys\u2019s interpretation of section 1067.02, subdivision (b)(2). We are aware of authority from other jurisdictions bearing on this issue. (See, e.g., <em>Bennet </em>v. <em>VA Life, Acc. &amp; Sickness Ins. </em>(1996) 251 Va. 382 [468 S.E.2d 910]; <em>Oklahoma Life &amp; Health </em>v. <em>Hilti Retirement </em>(Okla. 1997) 939 P.2d 1110.) In light of our conclusion that all GIC\u2019s are excluded from coverage whether allocated or not, we need not and do not reach that further question. From the same reason, we do not decide whether the GIC\u2019s are to any extent excluded from the Act\u2019s definition of unallocated annuity contracts because they assertedly guarantee benefits to individuals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\">By way of a simple analogy, we posit a statute that excludes from coverage \u201ccars, motorcycles, vans, . . . and all other red vehicles.\u201d This language, taken in its usual, ordinary sense, plainly excludes the specifically identified objects, no matter what color, as well as all red vehicles. It would take a feat of rhetorical acrobatics to interpret the phrase \u201cand all other red vehicles\u201d as limiting the express exclusion of cars to only red cars. Unisys\u2019s construction suffers the same flaw.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">This point assumes, as Unisys maintains, that some GIC\u2019s are in fact allocated or, at least, are not \u201cunallocated\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Another plausible interpretation of the statutory language is that the Legislature viewed all GIC\u2019s as a category of unallocated annuity contracts and, taking a \u201cbelt and suspenders\u201d approach, excluded them both specifically by name and genetically by the term \u201cunallocated annuity contracts.\u201d This is the position taken by NOLHGA. Under this view, of course, Unisys\u2019s position that its GIC\u2019s are covered because they are allocated would necessarily fail.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
