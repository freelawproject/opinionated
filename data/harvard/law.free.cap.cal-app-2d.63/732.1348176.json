J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Petitioner, while undergoing voir dire by a judge, was asked the following question: \u201cAnybody in your immediate family or yourself been arrested?\u201d Petitioner answered: \u201cOne of my boys was arrested.\u201d It was true that one of petitioner\u2019s sons had been arrested. However, petitioner failed to reveal that he, too, had at one time been arrested. Later, the judge asked a \u201ccatchall\u201d question which asked the potential jurors to disclose whether they knew anything which would cause them to be biased. Petitioner did not respond.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Petitioner was charged by information with perjury. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 118.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Later, petitioner filed a section 995 motion to set aside the information. Relying on <em>Bronston </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1973) 409 U.S. 352 [93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568] (Bronston) and <em>In re Rosoto </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 939 [112 Cal.Rptr. 641, 519 P.2d 1065, 69 A.L.R.3d 980] <em>(Rosoto), </em>petitioner asserted that a charge for perjury cannot be based on a statement which is literally true, even if the statement is misleading, unresponsive or leaves a false impression. The prosecution, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Meza </em>(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1631 [234 Cal.Rptr. 235] <em>(Meza), </em>argued that prospective jurors may be prosecuted for peijury based on an \u201comission\u201d to the court during voir dire. When the trial court denied petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss, this petition for writ of mandate followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">II. Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Petitioner contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the perjury charge because, while his answer to the court\u2019s question during voir dire may have been misleading, it was literally true.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">The People contend that petitioner may be prosecuted for perjury based on his \u201cmisleading response\u201d to the court during voir dire since \u201cjury selection is not an adversarial proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>HI. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">A. <em>Elements of Perjury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In order to lawfully hold a person to answer on the charge of perjury under section 118,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> evidence must exist of a \u201cwillful statement, under oath, of any material matter which the witness knows to be false. [Citation.]\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 999, 1004 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 676] ,)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">B. <em>The Law of Perjury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">1. <em>Perjury During Adversarial Hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">In <em>Bronston </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a witness may not be \u201cconvicted of perjury for an answer, under oath, that is literally true but not responsive to the question asked and arguably misleading by negative implication.\u201d <em>(Bronston, supra, </em>409 U.S. at p. 353 [93 S.Ct. at p. 597].)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">The defendant, Samuel Bronston, was the president and sole owner of Samuel Bronston Productions, Inc., a movie production company. He had personal as well as company bank accounts in various European countries. The company petitioned for bankruptcy. At a bankruptcy examination, the following colloquy occurred between the lawyer for a creditor and Bronston:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">\u201cQ. Do you have any bank accounts in Swiss banks, Mr. Bronston?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\">\u201cQ. Have you ever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\">\u201cA. The company had an account there for about six months, in Zurich.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-15\">\u201cQ. Have you any nominees who have bank accounts in Swiss banks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-16\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>\u201cQ. Have you ever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\">\u201cA. No, sir.\u201d <em>(Bronston, supra, </em>409 U.S. at p. 354 [93 S.Ct. at p. 598].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In actuality, Bronston had once had a large personal bank account in Switzerland for about five years. However, Bronston\u2019s answers were literally truthful. Bronston did not at the time of questioning have a Swiss bank account. Bronston Productions, Inc., did have the account in Zurich described by Bronston. Neither at the time of questioning nor before did Bronston have nominees who had Swiss accounts. <em>(Bronston, supra, </em>409 U.S. at pp. 354-355 [93 S.Ct. at pp. 597-598].)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Bronston was tried for perjury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The government\u2019s theory at trial was that in order to mislead his questioner, Bronston answered the second question with literal truthfulness but unresponsively addressed his answer to the company\u2019s assets and not to his own\u2014thereby implying that he had no personal Swiss bank account at the relevant time. <em>(Bronston, supra, </em>409 U.S. at p. 355 [93 S.Ct. at p. 598].)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The trial court concluded that Bronston\u2019s answer could form the basis of a perjury charge, and instructed the jury that Bronston could be convicted if he gave an answer \u201c \u2018not literally false but when considered in the context in which it was given, nevertheless constitute^] a false statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bronston, supra, </em>409 U.S. at p. 355 [93 S.Ct. at p. 598].) Bronston was convicted, and the appellate court affirmed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 356 [93 S.Ct. at p. 599].)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The United States Supreme Court reversed. It found that Bronston had answered the second question nonresponsively, and also found that a negative implication arose, from the answer that Bronston himself did not have any Swiss accounts. Nonetheless, the court held this was not perjury. \u201cBeyond question [Bronston\u2019s] answer to the crucial question was not responsive if we assume, as we do, that the first question was directed at personal bank accounts. There is, indeed, an implication in the answer to the second question that there was never a personal bank account; in casual conversation this interpretation might reasonably be drawn. But we are not dealing with casual conversation and the statute does not make it a criminal act for a witness to willfully state any material matter that <em>implies </em>any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>material matter that he does not believe to be true.\u201d <em>(Bronston, supra, </em>409 U.S. at pp. 357-358 [93 S.Ct. at p. 599], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The <em>Bronston </em>court could \u201cperceive no reason why Congress would intend the drastic sanction of a perjury prosecution to cure a testimonial mishap that could readily have been reached with a single additional question by counsel alert\u2014as every examiner ought to be\u2014to the incongruity of petitioner\u2019s unresponsive answer.\u201d <em>(Bronston, supra, </em>409 U.S. at p. 358 [93 S.Ct. at p. 600].) The court noted that \u201ctestimonial interrogation, and cross-examination in particular, is a probing, prying, pressing form of inquiry. If a witness evades, it is the lawyer\u2019s responsibility to recognize the evasion and to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth with the tools of adversary examination.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 358-359 [93 S.Ct. at p. 600].) And, the court noted, \u201c[i]t does not matter that the unresponsive answer is stated in the affirmative, thereby implying the negative of the question actually posed; for again, by hypothesis, the examiner\u2019s awareness of unresponsiveness should lead him to press another question or reframe his initial question with greater precision. Precise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury, [\u00b6] It may well be that [Bronston]\u2019s answers were not guileless but were shrewdly calculated to evade. Nevertheless, . . . any special problems arising from the literally true but unresponsive answer are to be remedied through the \u2018questioner\u2019s acuity\u2019 and not by a federal perjury prosecution.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 362 [93 S.Ct. at pp. 601-602].)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The <em>Bronston </em>holding was applied by the California Supreme Court in <em>Rosoto. </em>There, a hearing was held on a habeas corpus petition wherein an investigator for the prosecution (Frank Oxandaboure) was asked questions under oath concerning a key prosecution witness, Michael Rosoto. Oxandaboure stated that he had not given Rosoto immunity if he testified at an upcoming trial, and had not given a guarantee that Rosoto would not be prosecuted for unrelated crimes. <em>(Rosoto, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 947.) The truth of the matter was that Oxandaboure had given Rosoto conditional guarantees that he would receive immunity and not face further prosecution if he told the truth when he testified at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 947, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In a subsequent habeas corpus case the petitioners claimed Oxandaboure had lied during the previous habeas corpus hearing. The California Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Court held that although Oxandaboure had testified in a manner that left the impression that no guarantees of any kind had been given to Rosoto, Oxandaboure did not commit perjury. <em>(Rosoto, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at pp. 949-950.) \u201cInsofar as appears from the record before us Oxandaboure\u2019s denials at the hearing on the prior reference of guarantees or assurances of immunity were literally true. The questions put to him asked whether he had guaranteed or assured Michael [Rosoto] immunity if he testified. The guarantee conversation occurred during investigation before charges were brought against petitioners, and the guarantee of immunity was conditioned not on merely testifying but on telling the truth. Oxandaboure was not required to volunteer testimony as to a guarantee other than the one of which he was asked, and although his answers to the questions asked may have left a misleading impression that not even a conditional guarantee was made, he was never asked whether a conditional guarantee of any kind was made.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 950.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The court, citing <em>Bronston, </em>concluded that \u201c. . . when, as here, a witness\u2019 answers are literally true he may not be faulted for failing to volunteer more explicit information. Although such testimony may cause a misleading impression due to the failure of counsel to ask more specific questions, the witness\u2019 failure to volunteer testimony to avoid the misleading impression does not constitute perjury because the crucial element of falsity is not present in his testimony.\u201d <em>(Rosoto, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 949.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Earp </em>(4th Cir. 1987) 812 F.2d 917, during grand jury proceedings, a prosecutor investigating certain hate crimes asked the defendant whether he had ever committed a specific crime. The defendant answered truthfully in the neg\u00e1tive, because he had only aided others in the commission of the crime. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 918.) The defendant was convicted of perjury under 18 United States Code section 1623.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (812 F.2d at p. 919.) He appealed on the ground that his statement was literally true, and thus, under <em>Bronston, </em>he could not be convicted of making a false statement. In reversing the conviction, the court held that \u201ca literally true but unresponsive answer is to be remedied through the \u2018questioner\u2019s acuity\u2019 and not the federal perjury statute.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Echoing <em>Bronston, </em>the court emphasized that \u201ceven if the witness evades, it is the duty of the questioner to spot that evasion and \u2018to flush out the whole truth with the tools of adversary examination.\u2019\u201d (Ibid.; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lighte </em>(2d Cir. 1986) 782 F.2d 367, 374; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Eddy </em>(6th Cir. 1984) 737 F.2d 564, 569; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tonelli </em>(3d Cir. 1978) 577 F.2d 194, 199-200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>2. <em>Perjury in a Nonadversarial Setting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Although the United States Supreme Court implied in <em>Bronston </em>that silence can never constitute perjury, California rejected this proposition in <em>Meza, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d 1631.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Meza was a prospective juror in a burglary trial. Before voir dire commenced the court clerk administered an oath to all the potential jurors. The court then introduced the defendant and asked whether any of the potential jurors knew him. One raised his hand and another orally responded. The court inquired if there was anyone else. Meza remained silent and did not raise his hand. The court then asked a further series of questions, specifically directing jurors to raise their hands to indicate an affirmative response. One of the questions was whether there was any reason a juror could not be fair and impartial. Meza did not speak or raise his hand, and was selected as a juror. <em>(Meza, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d at p. 1634.) The trial court subsequently learned that Meza was the defendant\u2019s brother-in-law, and discharged him. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1635, 1639.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The district attorney\u2019s office brought a perjury charge against Meza for his failure to inform the judge that he was related to the defendant. Meza, arguing that failure to respond to questions could not constitute perjury, moved to set aside the information. The motion was granted. <em>(Meza, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1639-1640.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">On appeal, the order dismissing the perjury charge was reversed. The court noted that the collective questioning of prospective jurors is a proper voir dire method, and held that a juror\u2019s silence under those conditions is tantamount to a negative answer. <em>(Meza, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1641-1642.) In reaching its conclusion that silence can be construed as a statement, the court referred to Evidence Code section 125, which defines \u201cconduct\u201d as, inter alia, passive and nonverbal behavior, and Evidence Code section 225, which defines \u201cstatement\u201d as nonverbal conduct. (188 Cal.App.3d at p. 1646.) The <em>Meza </em>court concluded, \u201cWhen the trial judge asked if anyone on the jury panel knew the defendant... did Meza intend his silence to mean \u2018No\u2019 ? We think this is a question for the trier of fact.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1647.) Thus, if the trier of fact found Meza\u2019s silence meant \u201cNo,\u201d then Meza committed peijury.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>C. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Perjury Charge Must Be Dismissed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">1. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Response was Unresponsive, but Literally True</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Petitioner was asked the following imprecise, compound question: \u201cAnybody in your immediate family <em>or </em>yourself been arrested?\u201d (Italics added.) His answer\u2014that one of his sons had been arrested\u2014was partially unresponsive, but literally true. We conclude, therefore, that <em>Bronston </em>and <em>Rosoto </em>apply, and that no perjury charge is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The People argue, in essence, that <em>Bronston </em>and <em>Rosoto </em>are inapplicable because petitioner did not give a \u201ctrue and complete\u201d answer to the second part of a two-part question. According to the People, the court asked petitioner whether anyone is his immediate family had been arrested, <em>and </em>whether petitioner had ever been arrested. The People claim that petitioner answered the first question fully and completely by stating that his son had been arrested, but failed to answer the second question. According to the People, only one conclusion is possible, i.e., that petitioner intended by his silence to convey the message that he had never been arrested. This being so, the People argue, <em>Meza </em>is applicable, and petitioner can be prosecuted for intentionally communicating a specific message through silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\"><em>Meza </em>stands for the proposition that in some cases perjury convictions may be based on silence. Because it is consistent with the rule set forth in <em>Bronston </em>and <em>Rosoto, </em>we fully concur with the <em>Meza </em>holding. <em>Meza </em>cannot, however, be applied to the facts of this case. In <em>Meza </em>the judge, during collective questioning, told the potential jurors that failure to raise a hand in response to a question would constitute a negative answer. Meza\u2019s inaction was, therefore, reasonably understood to signal a negative response to the questions posed by the judge. Petitioner\u2019s prosecution for perjury is not based on the lack of an answer during collective questioning. Petitioner gave a literally true answer to a compound question which implied a negative implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">2. <em>Bronston and Rosoto Apply in Nonadversarial Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">The People contend that even if petitioner\u2019s answer can be construed as both true and complete, the rules set forth in <em>Bronston </em>and <em>Rosoto </em>are inapplicable because they apply only during adversarial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">The People argue that at the heart of both <em>Bronston </em>and <em>Rosoto </em>is the role of the adversarial process as a truth-finding mechanism, and that both cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>assume an adversarial proceeding which requires the examiner to ask proper questions. The People point out that in the voir dire setting potential jurors have an obligation to be cooperative because they take an oath under penalty of perjury to truthfully answer questions concerning their qualifications to serve as jurors. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 232, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Judges conducting voir dire\u2014as they are now required to do in criminal cases under Proposition 115\u2014must remain neutral and cannot become an advocate for either side. In reaching its conclusion that <em>Meza </em>could be tried for perjury, the Court of Appeal noted that the purpose of voir dire is to determine bias or prejudice of potential jurors, and that the right to an impartial jury is an inalienable part of the right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Constitution. <em>(Meza, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d at 1643.) \u201cThe existence of a trial juror\u2019s actual bias, if not discovered early, furnishes grounds for a new trial.\u201d <em>(Ibid/, People </em>v. <em>Blackwell </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 925 [236 Cal.Rptr. 803].) \u201cThe rule which affords a criminal defendant a fair and impartial jury is of constitutional dimension, firmly planted in this nation\u2019s heritage, and is indisputably compelling.\u201d <em>(Meza, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d at p. 1645.) The <em>Meza </em>court noted that a deceitful witness is distinct from a deceitful juror, because one who lies and later is accepted as a juror makes the trial a mere futility. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1643.)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">There is no question that the prosecution, the defense and the trial court rely on the voir dire responses in making their respective decisions, and that if potential jurors do not respond candidly the jury selection process can be rendered meaningless. \u201cFalsehood, or deliberate concealment or nondisclosure of facts and attitudes deprives both sides of the right to select an unbiased jury and erodes the basic integrity of the jury trial process.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Blackwell, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.3d at p. 929; see also <em>In re Hitchings </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 97, 110 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 74, 860 P.2d 466]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Diaz </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 926, 932 [200 CalRptr. 77].)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">There is also no question that jurors are required to be cooperative, and should volunteer information about any matter which could be construed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>rendering them biased. However, the judge has a corresponding duty. He or she is required first to ask direct and specific questions. In <em>Meza, </em>for example, the court asked a direct question which called for a single response. Although we are aware that the rules of evidence do not apply during voir dire, we believe the evils of the compound question are just as real during voir dire as they are during adversarial proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The court can, and should, bring the witness \u201cback to the mark\u201d when the witness fails to respond fully to a question. Here, for example, petitioner failed to respond fully to the court\u2019s compound question. According to the People, there was nothing in petitioner\u2019s answer which could have alerted the court or the parties that petitioner\u2019s answer was misleading. We disagree. His answer, that \u201cone of his boys\u201d had been arrested could have meant that he had not been arrested, or could have meant that he was refusing to answer the question completely. Because the court phrased the question in the way in which it did, we believe the court had a duty to \u201cpin down\u201d the potential juror so that the answer was clear. Had petitioner refused to answer, the court could then have resorted to other remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The People claim that if we adopt petitioner\u2019s view of jury selection, \u201cthe court would be required to cross-examine potential jurors and ferret out evasive answers,\u201d and that \u201c[j]ury service would become an ordeal to be feared.\u201d In our opinion, if we adopt the People\u2019s view, we may cause jurors to avoid jury service for fear of being prosecuted for the criminal offense of perjury because of a failure to volunteer information, or because of a failure to fully and completely answer a poorly crafted question which invites a misleading and/or incomplete answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We conclude that the <em>Bronston/Rosoto </em>rule applies during the questioning of potential jurors because, in our view, a judge must be an \u201calert questioner\u201d who can bring a potential juror \u201cback to the mark\u201d when necessary. This is especially true since both the prosecutor and defense counsel are available to suggest follow-up questions should they believe the answer given was misleading or nonresponsive.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">IV. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The petition for writ of mandate is granted. The superior court is directed to set aside its order denying petitioner\u2019s section 995 motion, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>enter a new and different order granting the motion.
