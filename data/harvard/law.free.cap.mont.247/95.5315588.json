He appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The issue is whether the District Court properly enhanced Longneck\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, for the use of a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">On November 6, 1989, the body of Winchell Birdtail was found lying in an alley on the south side of Billings, Montana. He had been shot once in the head. His body had apparently been dragged from a motor vehicle and placed in the alley. An autopsy revealed that he had died in the late evening hours of November 5 or early in the morning of November 6, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Witnesses at trial testified that Birdtail and the defendant left the Arcade Bar in Billings at about 8:00 p.m., November 5, in defendant\u2019s car. One witness testified that several days earlier, defendant had stated that he was trying to obtain a gun. Another testified that defendant told her he had a gun. After leaving the Arcade Bar, defendant and Birdtail visited the homes of several acquaintances, trying to borrow money to continue drinking. They were both described as intoxicated at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">An acquaintance in whose basement defendant had been staying testified that the defendant returned to his home alone about 10:00 or 10:30 p.m. The witness observed defendant wetting a rag on an outdoor faucet and then \u201cmess[ing] around\u201d in the front seat of defendant\u2019s car. During the police investigation, rags and pieces of clothing stained with blood consistent with Birdtail\u2019s were found in the yard and basement of that house. The front passenger side of defendant\u2019s car was heavily bloodstained.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The defendant testified in his own behalf. He stated that he and Birdtail were sitting in the car after their last attempt to borrow money failed, and Birdtail indicated that he wanted to commit a robbery to get money. He testified that when he refused to go along with this, Birdtail produced a gun, they struggled over the gun, and Birdtail was shot when it went off. Defendant testified that, \u201cscared,\u201d he had put Birdtail\u2019s body in an alley. He testified that he did not know what had happened to the gun because he had blacked out after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Defendant was charged with deliberate homicide. The jury found him guilty of the lesser included offense of negligent homicide. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>was sentenced to ten years in prison plus an additional ten years, to run consecutively, for the use of a deadly weapon in the commission of the offense, under \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Montana\u2019s weapon enhancement statute, \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201c[a] person who has been found guilty of any offense and who, while engaged in the commission of the offense, knowingly displayed, brandished, or otherwise used a firearm, destructive device, as defined in 45-8-332(1), or other dangerous weapon shall, in addition to the punishment provided for the commission of such offense be sentenced to a term of imprisonment in the state prison of not less than 2 years or more than 10 years, except as provided in 46-18-222.\u201d Defendant argues that the \u201cknowingly\u201d state of mind required under \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, has not been established and that application of the weapon enhancement statute is therefore improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The weapon enhancement statute may be applied in a negligent homicide. <em>State v. Redfern </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 311, 741 P.2d 1339; <em>State v. Stroud </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 58, 683 P.2d 459; <em>State v. Hubbard </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 106, 649 P.2d 1331. By its own terms, the enhancement statute applies to \u201cany offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The defendant\u2019s testimony concerning the events surrounding the shooting was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">\u201cI started back towards my door, and he told me to wait. And he turned around and looked back towards the back, and that\u2019s when I grabbed for the gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">\u201cQ. Okay. This was while you were parked someplace on the south side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">\u201cQ. All right. When you grabbed for the gun, will you tell the jury what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-12\">\u201cA. We struggled over it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-13\">\u201cQ. Please continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-14\">\u201cA. And it went off, and he flew back \u2014 or I thought he jumped back at first, but I guess he flew back from the bullet wound. The bullet hit him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">The defendant\u2019s assertion that the shooting of Birdtail was accidental does not negate his admission that he voluntarily grabbed for the gun being held by Birdtail. We hold that, under the facts of this case, defendant\u2019s voluntary act of grabbing for the gun is sufficient to meet the \u201cknowingly\u201d requirement of the enhancement statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Defendant\u2019s counsel states in bis reply brief that he has been instructed to bring to this Court\u2019s attention defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction. Attached to the reply brief is a typewritten sheet containing defendant\u2019s argument on that issue. Issues first raised in a reply brief are not properly before this Court and will not be considered on appeal. Rule 23(c), M.RApp.R; <em>Downs v.
