McColley appeals from the District Courts denial of his petition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-17\">The only issue raised by McColley on appeal is whether the District Court erred by denying his petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-18\">McColley was charged with one count of felony criminal sale of dangerous drugs alleged to have been committed on or about April 1 and April 28, 1988. Trial commencedinDistrict Court onFebruaryl, 1989, andMcColley was convicted by juiy and sentenced to a term of twenty years in the Montana State Prison, with ten years suspended. McColley appealed from this conviction to this Court where we upheld the conviction on October 24,1989. <em>State v. McColley </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 466, 781 P.2d 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>On May 7,1990, McColley filed a petition for post-conviction relief with the District Court. The District Court denied McColley\u2019s petition by an order entered on June 20,1990, and McColley now appeals from the denial of his petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The factual background leading up to McColley\u2019s conviction is set forth in <em>McColley, </em>239 Mont. 466, 781 P.2d 280, and will not be repeated here except as is necessary to dispose of the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">McColley presents four arguments in support of his claim that the District Court erred when it denied his petition for post conviction relief. They are: (1) the denial of the constitution right to representation by a competent lawyer at every critical stage of the proceeding; (2) the unconstitutional use by the State of peijured testimony; (3) the lack of sufficient evidence upon which to base a conviction; and (4) prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">McColley argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel throughout the proceedings and has thereby been denied his constitutional right to representation. He argues that his counsel failed to adequately prepare for the trial, failed to make proper objections during the trial, failed to call any defense witnesses, and filed an appeal in which no meritorious grounds for appeal were presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">There is a heavy burden of proof on an appellant who seeks to reverse a judgment on grounds of incompetency of counsel. <em>State v. LaValley </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 393, 398, 661 P.2d 869, 872. To prevail on such a claim McColley must show specific acts or omissions by his counsel which prejudiced his case and resulted in the denial of a fair trial. <em>State v. Stewart </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 239, 241, 767 P.2d 296, 297. As we stated in <em>Stewart, </em>the two-part test this Court applies in judging a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is, first, whether the defendant can show deficient performance of counsel in that \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment..., [and second,] the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Stewart, </em>235 Mont. at 241, 767 P.2d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">McColley contends his counsel failed to adequately investigate the facts, specifically an alleged statement by Matt Andre, a \u201cmiddle man\u201d involved in the drug transactions, made at the time of his arrest. McColley further argues that his counsel failed to discuss the case with him and did not even interview him until the week before the trial. Although these general allegations may in some way indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>insufficient trial preparation, there has been no indication of how this alleged unpreparedness prejudiced appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial. McColley does not present any reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different but for his counsel\u2019s alleged unpreparedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">McColley also asserts that his counsel neglected to object to hearsay testimony by police officers and did not make any specific objections during the trial in order to preserve any error for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The record shows that the hearsay testimony to which McColley refers was properly admissible at trial and his counsel was aware of this fact. As to the general complaint about the lack of other objections, we have previously stated that \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s use of objections is within his discretion as trial tactics.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Hurlbert </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 115, 122, 756 P.2d 1110, 1114. And it is well established that it is not our function to second guess the trial tactics of defense counsel when evaluating counsel's representation. See <em>LaValley, </em>203 Mont. at 397, 661 P.2d at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u201cDefense counsel's use of objections during trial fie within his or her sound discretion and failure to object must, in addition to being error, also prejudice the defendant.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\"><em>Hurlbert, 232 </em>Mont. at 120, 756 P.2d at 1113. The defendant has presented no evidence showing he has been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">McColley claims that his counsel failed to call any defense witnesses to testify on his behalf. This argument is factually unfounded. Several of the witnesses called by the State, including Matt Andre, were defense witnesses. At trial Andre continually denied having ever made any statement that would connect McColley to the drug transactions. Defense counsel's decision in this regard is one of trial tactics and strategy and McColley fails to indicate how this alleged deficient performance may have in any way deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Finally, McColley claims that his counsel filed a frivolous appeal. The appeal to which Mccolley refers was decided on the merits by this Court in <em>McColley, </em>supra. A review of that case disproves such a claim. Effective assistance of counsel does not mean that the defendant is guaranteed assistance of counsel that will result in acquittal. <em>LaValley, </em>203 Mont. at 398, 661 P.2d at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be grounded in facts found in the record, not on mere conclusory allegations. <em>Hurlbert, 232 </em>Mont. at 120, 756 P.2d at 1113. McColley has failed to meet the burden ofproofnecessaiy to establish his claim ofineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>McColley\u2019s second argument in support of his claim that the District Court erred by denying his petition is the allegation that the State used peijured testimony. The District Court refused to address this issue based upon the fact that this was a matter which could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal. We agree with the District Court. Where a defendant has been afforded a direct appeal of his conviction, any grounds for relief which reasonably could have been raised on direct appeal may not be subsequently raised in a petition for post-conviction relief. See <em>Duncan v. State </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 232, 794 P.2d 331, and \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA. McColley failed to raise this issue and could have reasonably done so on direct appeal. He is procedurally barred from doing so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">McColley\u2019s last two arguments will be addressed concurrently. He alleges that there was an insufficiency of evidence on which to base a conviction and that there existed prosecutorial misconduct which denied him a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">As with the previous argument both of these arguments could have been raised on appeal and were not so raised. McColley is therefore procedurally barred from raising these arguments in his petition for post-conviction relief. In addition to failing to raise these claims on direct appeal, McColley also has failed to raise these claims in his original petition for post-conviction relief before the District Court. He attempts to raise these arguments for the first time in this appeal of his petition and may not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Although we do not address the merits of the prosecutorial misconduct issue, we take this opportunity, as we did in <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 323, 330, 787 P.2d 329, 334, to again remind prosecuting attorneys that Rule 3.4(e) of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct prohibit a lawyer from, in trial, stating a personal opinion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The standard of review for denial of post-conviction relief is whether there is substantial evidence to support the findings and conclusions of the district court. <em>State v. Coates </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 331, 336, 786 P.2d 1182, 1185. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-9\">JUSTICES HARRISON, TRIEWEILER, MCDONOUGH and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
