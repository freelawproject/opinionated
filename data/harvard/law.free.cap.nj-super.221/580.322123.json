Levin (Levin). A pathway over the slope had been created by pedestrians walking from the parking lot to a public sidewalk contiguous to defendants\u2019 property. The slope area was owned by the State of New Jersey. In <em>Stewart v. 104 Wallace St., Inc., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>146, 157 (1981), our Supreme Court held that commercial landowners have a duty to maintain in reasonably good condition the sidewalks abutting their property and are liable to pedestrians for injury as a result of the breach of that duty. The issue raised by this appeal is whether the pathway over the grassy slope is a \u201csidewalk\u201d abutting defendants\u2019 commercial property. The trial judge found that the pathway was not a \u201csidewalk\u201d and granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b). We agree with the trial judge and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Plaintiff instituted the present personal injury action against Adam Corp., Levin and defendant Township of Old Bridge. At trial, plaintiff produced evidence that she departed from a bus at the intersection of Route 9 and Throckmorton Lane in Old Bridge. She then walked westerly along Throckmorton Lane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>on a concrete sidewalk adjacent to the shopping center owned by Adam Corp. and Levin. To her right was a guard rail separating the sidewalk from the shopping center parking lot. At the end of the guard rail, plaintiff turned and began walking on a worn 20-foot long pathway through a grassy slope area which separated the sidewalk from the parking lot. She intended to pick her car up in the parking lot which had been left for her by a family member. While on the pathway, plaintiff tripped over a protruding object, fell and struck the parking lot pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">According to plaintiff, the pathway was \u201ckind of barren and worn away from the constant track of people going through it.\u201d Plaintiff testified that she had used the pathway since 1964 when she moved to Old Bridge. The sidewalk along continued beyond the pathway to a driveway which entered the parking lot. Plaintiffs expert, a safety engineer, testified that the pathway was \u201chazardous\u201d and was not designed for use as a means of access to the parking lot. Defendants\u2019 maintenance supervisor acknowledged in his deposition that he had been aware of the pathway and its use by the public for several years prior to plaintiff\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">At the conclusion of the first day of trial, it was determined that the State of New Jersey owned the grassy slope area where plaintiff fell. The trial judge thereupon granted defendant Township of Old Bridge\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint against it. At the end of plaintiff\u2019s case defendants also moved for a dismissal; Plaintiff resisted the motion citing, <em>Stewart v. 104 Wallace St., Inc., supra, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>146, arguing that defendants were responsible to maintain the pathway since the pathway was \u201ctantamount\u201d to a sidewalk. The trial judge rejected this argument, finding that \u201c[tjhis is a slope wherein people took it upon themselves to use that slope, whether right or wrong ... [bjut this is not property that belonged to the shopping center.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Until <em>Stewart, </em>an abutting property owner was not liable for the condition of a sidewalk caused by the elements or by wear and tear incident to public use, but only for negligent construction, or repair by the owner or his predecessor in title, or by the owner\u2019s direct use or obstruction of the sidewalk in such a manner as to render it unsafe. <em>See Yanhko v. Fane, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>528, 532 (1976); <em>Murray v. Michalak, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>220, 222 (1971); <em>Moskowitz v. Herman, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>223, 225 (1954). <em>Stewart </em>rejected this \u201cno liability rule\u201d as it applied to commercial landowners, holding that such owners \u201care responsible for maintaining in reasonably good condition the sidewalks abutting their property____\u201d <em>Stewart, supra, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 157. The purpose of this \u201cnew rule\u201d was to provide a remedy to innocent plaintiffs injured by improper maintenance of sidewalks, to give abutting commercial landowners \u201can incentive to keep their sidewalks in proper repair\u201d and to eliminate the \u201carbitrariness\u201d of the \u201cold rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157-158. A further rationale for the rule was that commercial landowners retain considerable interest in and rights to the use of the abutting sidewalks, including the right to prevent obstruction of the public\u2019s view of the commercial property from the sidewalk, use of the sidewalk for \u201cstoops ... and other domestic and trade conveniences\u201d and the benefit of the sidewalk providing commercial owners with \u201ceasy access to their premises____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151-152. The court also reasoned that sidewalks \u201cincrease the value of [commercial] property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">In our view the extension of liability under <em>Stewart </em>is clearly limited to abutting \u201csidewalks,\u201d and does not impose a duty upon commercial landowners to maintain contiguous lands owned by others simply because the public chooses to use the lands as a means of access to the commercial property. A sidewalk is defined as \u201c[t]hat part of a public street or highway <em>designed for the use of pedestrians, </em>being exclusively reserved for them____\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1238 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis supplied); <em>see also Davis v. Pecorino, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>1, 5 (1975). Here, the pathway, created by the trespassing public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>for their own convenience, was neither designed nor intended for pedestrian use.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Moreover, the public policy underpinnings to the <em>Stewart </em>rule simply do not apply to a private pathway over property that is not owned by the commercial landowner. <em>Stewart\u2019s </em>concern that the \u201cno liability\u201d rule will leave innocent parties without recourse, <em>Stewart, supra, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 155, is inapplicable since the injured party may seek redress against the owner of the private property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the <em>Stewart </em>rule gives the commercial landowner \u201cincentive to repair deteriorated sidewalks and thereby prevent injuries[,]\u201d <em>ibid., </em>here there was no such incentive, or indeed even a legal right, on the part of defendants to assume control and maintenance over property owned by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Further, defendants, as commercial landowners, had no right to an unobstructed public view over the State\u2019s property, or the right to use the property for \u201cstoops ... and other domestic and trade conveniences____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151. Moreover, the public sidewalk on Throckmorton Lane provided \u201ceasy access\u201d to defendants\u2019 shopping center without the presence or use of the pedestrian-created pathway. <em>Id. </em>at 152. Finally, it can hardly be said that the pathway \u201cincreased the value of [defendants\u2019] property.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Plaintiff further cites <em>Warrington v. Bird, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>611 (App.Div.1985), certif. den. 103 <em>N.J. </em>473 (1986) for the proposition that the holding in <em>Stewart </em>should apply to \u201ca non-sidewalk situation.\u201d In <em>Warrington, </em>we held that a restaurant operator owes a duty to provide reasonably safe passage for its patrons across a public roadway passing between the restaurant and its parking lot. <em>Warrington, supra, </em>204 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 617. We reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>... the critical element should not be the question of the proprietor\u2019s control over the area to be traversed but rather the expectation of the invitee that safe passage will be afforded from the parking facility to the establishment to which they are invited. Commercial entrepreneurs know in providing the parking facility that their customers will travel a definite route to reach their premises. The benefiting proprietor should not be permitted to cause or ignore an unsafe condition in that route which it might reasonably remedy, whether the path leads along a sidewalk or across a roadway. <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\"><em>Warrington </em>is distinguishable since here defendants provided safe passage to their parking lot through existing entrances from Throckmorton Lane and Route 9. It was reasonable for defendants to expect that their invitees would use these \u201cdefinite route[s],\u201d designed for that purpose, to reach the shopping center.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">We conclude that the <em>Stewart </em>rule is limited to \u201csidewalks\u201d abutting commercial lands and does not extend to impose liability against defendants in the present case. We, of course, as an intermediate appellate court, \u201care not free to deviate from what we regard as the Supreme Court\u2019s presently articulated view[.]\u201d <em>Liptak v. Frank, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 338-339 (App.Div.1985), certif. den. 103 <em>N.J. </em>471 (1986). We therefore decline plaintiff\u2019s invitation to extend the <em>Stewart </em>rule to the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Plaintiff raises for the first time on appeal the argument that the Old Bridge Commercial Maintenance Code imposed upon defendants the duty to maintain the pathway free of any hazards. We decline to consider the issue since it was not fully presented at trial and does not raise a jurisdictional question, or, in our view, concern matters of great public interest. <em>See Matter of Board of Educ. of Town of Boonton, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>523, 536 (1985), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. Kramer v. Public Employment Relations Commission, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1072, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1388, 89 L.Ed.2d 613 (1986); <em>Nieder v. Royal Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234 (1973). In any event, the municipal ordinance referred to proscribes certain conditions and activities on \u201ccommercial premises.\u201d It does not make a commercial landowner liable for conditions or activities on a third-party\u2019s land. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>also Yanhko v. Fane, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 536-537 (municipal ordinances requiring landowners to repair or maintain abutting sidewalks do not create a duty from the property owner to the injured party, absent a statute establishing liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Presumably, plaintiff did not institute an action against the State of New Jersey because she did not determine the State owned the pathway until trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
