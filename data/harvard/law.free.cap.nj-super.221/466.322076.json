A penalty of $1,025 payable to the Violent Crimes Compensation Board was also imposed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">Defendant is 25 years of age. He met codefendant Renee Nicely (Nicely) when they were both about 14 years of age. Although unmarried, they had an ongoing relationship which produced five children. Their first child, Davell, was born in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>December 1977, and their second, Shawn, was born on February 19, 1979.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 26, 1982, Shawn was brutally beaten to death. Defendant and Nicely<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were charged with his murder. In addition, defendant was charged with having, on or about September 26, 1982, caused Shawn harm that would make him an abused or neglected child, defendant having a legal duty to care for him <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Testimony at the joint trial of defendant and Nicely revealed a variety of acts of mistreatment of Shawn by Nicely. During a period when Nicely and her two children were residing with defendant\u2019s mother, Nicely conceived the idea, upon the suggestion of defendant\u2019s mother, that Shawn was not her child. It was suggested that the wrong child had been delivered to her by the Division of Youth &amp; Family Services (DYFS). There was substantial testimony from friends and neighbors that Nicely abused Shawn and had a conception that she could treat him as she saw fit. However, the friends and neighbors also indicated that, before the murder, defendant treated Shawn as he did the other children and was not cruel or abusive to him. One exception was testimony<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that defendant burned Shawn on his buttocks sometime between April and July 1982. In addition, Davell testified that defendant killed his brother. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATA\">He (defendant) took him (Shawn) by his hand and jumped on him and then stepped on his back with 2 feet. He took one foot then put his other foot, stepped on him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Davell also testified that defendant punched Shawn in the eye and \u201cthen he throwed him in the tub with full of water trying to drown him.\u201d Davell further testified that defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>injured Shawn on a prior occasion when pushing him through a door on \u201ca little horsey\u201d with wheels. Furthermore, according to Davell, defendant got Shawn drunk on occasions by giving him liquor and beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">On the day of his death, Shawn was beaten unmercifully. The extensive injuries which he suffered were testified to by the medical examiner and included subcutaneous hemorrhage on the back of the head, hemorrhage on both sides of the head, ecchymosis of the left eye, lacerations and cuts involving both ears and subcutaneous hemorrhage involving the chin. Shawn\u2019s brain was swollen as a result of concussion. There was hemorrhage on both sides of his buttocks, recent injuries of his left shoulder and left upper back, right middle back, lesions of the exterior chest, left shoulder, middle area of the chest, right upper chest, abrasions of the right side of the abdomen, bruise of the anterior portion of the left thigh, contusion and abrasion of the left genital, three burn marks on the chest and a burn mark on the. left shoulder. He had sustained a painful fracture of the distal end of the elbow, between six days and 24 hours before his death. There were many internal injuries, as well as a recent fracture of the eighth rib. Due to the substantial number of injuries Shawn sustained, it was impossible to accurately pinpoint the particular blow that caused his death. The medical examiner described it as a homicide by assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">After defendant\u2019s indictment on December 20, 1982, a number of proceedings were conducted by the trial judge, productive of an extensive record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is only necessary for us to refer to those proceedings involving the issues raised on this appeal, which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>POINT I THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION TO PROHIBIT DEATH QUALIFICATION OF PROSPECTIVE JURORS AS VIOLATIVE OF THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED BY THE COURT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">POINT II THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR SEVERANCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED BY THE COURT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">POINT III THE ADMISSION OF THE TESTIMONY OF A WITNESS TAKEN OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE OF THE DEFENDANT AND THE JURY DENIED THE DEFENDANT HIS RIGHT OF CONFRONTATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">POINT IV IT WAS ERROR FOR THE COURT TO ADMIT THE TESTIMONY OF DOLORES MORTON AND LYNNE LEIBERMAN PURSUANT TO <em>EVID.R. </em>63(4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">POINT V THE TESTIMONY OF JANIE BENNETT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">POINT VI THE TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTOR DETECTIVES CONCERNING PRIOR STATEMENTS OF DAVELL NICELY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">POINT VII THE JURY CHARGE CONCERNING ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY AND OMISSION TO ACT WAS ERRONEOUS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">POINT VIII THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTIONS FOR JUDGMENT N.O.V.

COMPOSITION, DEATH QUALIFICATION AND SELECTION OF JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b505-17\">Initially, by order dated February 12, 1986, we suspended decision on the issues raised in Point I as to \u201cdeath qualification\u201d of prospective jurors and Point X concerning the alleged unrepresentative composition of juries in Essex County, pending resolution of those issues by the Supreme Court. However, by order of February 5,1987, we vacated our order of February 12, 1986, and directed the State to file a responding brief as to those issues, which it has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Among the pretrial motions filed by defendant was an application to have the court preclude \u201cdeath qualification\u201d of prospective jurors. In a written opinion, the trial judge denied defendant\u2019s motion. <em>State v. Bass, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461 (Law Div.1983). The issue has since been decided adversely to defendant\u2019s position by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 248-261 (1987), <em>see also Lockhart v. McCree, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>162, 163-65, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1758, 1760, 90 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>137, 142 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Defendant filed his notice of appeal on October 27, 1983. On his motion we remanded the case, by order dated August 8, 1984, for a ruling on his challenge to the jury composition. Defendant was one of 13 defendants who joined in Thomas Ramseur\u2019s motion challenging the jury selection system in Essex County. Defendant sought to reverse his conviction. After a lengthy evidentiary hearing, Judge Richard Newman denied the motions. <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>565 (Law Div.1984). Defendant\u2019s motion to the Supreme Court for direct certification to join in the appeal in <em>State v. Ramseur </em>on the sole issue of jury selection was denied by the Supreme Court on March 5, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The Law Division decision in <em>Ramseur </em>was affirmed by the Supreme Court on March 5, 1987. <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>at 212-239. There is no merit to defendant\u2019s contention concerning excuses to students and teachers which were based largely on statutory requirements. The decision of the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Ramseur </em>is dispositive of Points I and X urged by defendant on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">B. SEVERANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Defendant\u2019s motion for severance from prejudicial joinder under <em>R. </em>3:15-2(b) was denied. Such a motion is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>See State v. Scioscia, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 42 (App.Div.1985), and the cases cited therein. We will not reverse the denial of such a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>unless there is a clear showing of abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Moriarty, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>563, 569 (App.Div.1975), certif. den. 68 <em>N.J. </em>172 (1975). Relying upon <em>State v. Pickles, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>542 (1966), defendant contends that his incrimination of Nicely in order to exculpate himself caused the jury to react unfavorably to him. In addition, he contends that the substantial evidence of Nicely\u2019s repeated abusive conduct towards Shawn and the court\u2019s repeated admonition to the jury that such testimony could only be used against Nicely was prejudicial to him. Further, he contends the prejudice to him was greatly enhanced by Nicely\u2019s defense of diminished capacity, since the psychiatrists attributed much of her conduct to her isolation and despair which reflected unfavorably upon defendant. For this proposition he relies upon <em>State v. Sinclair, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>525 (1967), where, although the Court found that the trial judge had not abused his discretion in denying a severance, it nonetheless concluded that on retrial justice would be better served by a severance, if requested by either defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 550. We have thoroughly reviewed defendant\u2019s contentions concerning the denial of his motion for severance in light of the applicable law and affirm the denial substantially for the reasons given by Judge Edwin H. Stern in his oral opinion of May 16, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">C. CONFRONTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">As noted, the victim\u2019s five year old brother, Davell, was an eyewitness to the murder. After hearing the testimony of a clinical psychologist who examined Davell at the request of the defense, and Davell\u2019s treating psychologist, the trial judge made findings based upon those opinions and concluded that the testimony of Davell should not be given in the presence of his parents, the defendant and Nicely. He further concluded that the jury need not, in all instances, physically observe the witness. Therefore, the trial judge held that a video observation is constitutionally adequate and there is no constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>right to face-to-face confrontation between the witness and the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The procedure ultimately used was that Davell testified on closed circuit television in the judge\u2019s chambers, in the presence of his foster mother, the trial judge, counsel for defendant, and one of Nicely\u2019s attorneys. This live testimony was simultaneously transmitted audibly and visually to both the jury and defendants, with the camera focused on the witness. Defendant and Nicely, and Nicely\u2019s second attorney, were located in the chambers library with a two-way telephone communication system to secure the right of cross-examination. At the request of defendant, the jury was given the impression that defendants were physically present in chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Defendant contends that this procedure violated his right to be confronted with the witness, as guaranteed by both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1, par. 10 of the New Jersey Constitution. We disagree, substantially for the reasons given by Judge Stern in his oral opinion of May 13, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">At a pretrial competency hearing, Dr. Edward Arnow, a psychologist called by the defense, testified that it would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for Davell to testify in the presence of his parents. Dr. Walter Duryea, the treating psychologist, agreed that confronting his parents in court would have \u201ca serious negative effect\u201d on Davell, although he may be able to do it. Not only did the murder involve extensive physical abuse to Shawn, but the psychologist\u2019s testimony revealed substantial psychological trauma suffered by Davell in witnessing this tragic event. The trial judge\u2019s decision, based upon the opinion of the psychologists, was clearly warranted. To the extent that <em>United States v. Benfield, </em>593 F.2d 815 (8th Cir.1979), and <em>Herbert v. Superior Court of California, </em>172 <em>Cal.Rptr </em>850, 117 Cal.App.3d 661 (Cal.Ct.App.1981), relied upon by defendant, are inconsistent with our ruling, we disapprove of them in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">We held recently that admission of an \u201cunavailable\u201d witness\u2019 videotaped deposition in a criminal trial did not violate defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ant\u2019s right of confrontation under the United States and New Jersey Constitutions. <em>See State v. Washington, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187 (App.Div.1985), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">The right of an accused \u2018to be confronted with the witnesses against him\u2019 is protected in New Jersey not only by the application of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, but by a parroting of that language in the Constitution of New Jersey. <em>N.J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. I, par. 10. Distilled in the relatively recent case of <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>56, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>597 (1980), the purposes of the constitutional protection afforded by the confrontation clause are \u2018a preference for face-to-face confrontation at trial\u2019 and a securing of the right of cross-examination. 448 <em>U.S. </em>at 63, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2537. At the outset we observe that the United States Supreme Court thereby distinguishes between the desirability, expressed in terms of \u2018preference,\u2019 of face-to-face courtroom confrontation and the \u2018secured\u2019 right of cross-examination. This alone suggests that the confrontation guaranteed by the clause is not necessarily one in a courtroom. <em>But see California v. Green, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>149, 157-158, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1930, 1934-1935, 26 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>489 (1970). But the matter was not left to inference in <em>Ohio v. Roberts. </em>There it is expressly held that \u2018competing interests, \u201cif closely examined,\u201d [citation omitted], may warrant dispensing with confrontation at trial.\u2019 448 <em>U.S. </em>at 64, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2538.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">... We hold there was no error in granting leave to take the deposition and no error, insofar as the confrontation clauses of the Constitutions of both the United States and New Jersey are concerned, in the admission of the deposition in evidence. A case bearing a remarkable similarity to the matter before us in the respect with which we are here concerned reached the same result. <em>United States v. Tunnell, </em>667 <em>F.2d </em>1182 (5 Cir.1982). [202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 191-193.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">We further note <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4, adopted by the Laws of 1985, <em>c. </em>126, \u00a7 1, effective April 11, 1985, authorizes a similar procedure to that used in this case in prosecutions for aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual contact, or child abuse, or in any action alleging an abused or neglected child. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21. We perceive no error in the procedure used for Davell\u2019s testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">D. EVIDENTIAL RULINGS</p>\n<p id=\"Art\">(1) <em>Testimony of Dolores Morton</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADE\">Points IV, V and VI concern evidential rulings. The first deals with the testimony of Dolores Morton. Shawn had lived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>with Mrs. Morton from May 1981 until April 1982 and a close relationship developed between them. Shawn returned to the Nicely household in April 1982 where Mrs. Morton visited with him occasionally. In July 1982, Mrs. Morton, her husband and a girlfriend, went to Paterson where Mr. Morton was going to repair Mrs. Morton\u2019s bible instructor\u2019s refrigerator. Nicely granted permission for Shawn to go with them. In Paterson while helping Shawn go to the toilet, Mrs. Morton observed \u201cwhat appeared to be burns on his buttocks.\u201d In response to her question, \u201cShawn, tell Momma what happened to your heiney,\u201d Shawn replied, \u201cAllah (defendant) burned me with the light Momma.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Not long after, Shawn climbed on to Mrs. Morton's lap. When she flicked a lighter to light a cigarette he asked her \u201cto please not burn him with the lighter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">After a Rule 8 hearing, the trial judge ruled this testimony admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(4). He explained the reasons for his ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">I do so because there was apparently a very close strong relationship with Ms. Morton on the one hand and Shawn Nicely on the other. Shawn remained in the Morton home for approximately 11 months, and that relationship was fostered and developed in that context.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">Shawn had no such marks on him when returned to the Nicely home in April, and we\u2019re talking about a period of approximately three months or so. Ms. Morton did have an opportunity to talk to Shawn once between April and July, but it was in the Nicely home and there of course was no physical observations of the buttocks area or questions relating to the buttocks at that time and, in any event, it was in the hearing or proximity of Ms. Nicely and within her home. On Friday afternoon of last week, I cited the annotation concerning the declarant\u2019s age as affecting admissibility of a <em>res gestae </em>statement,____ I at that time cited a good number of cases indicating that the tender age of the declarant has been noted as a basis for relaxing traditional rules concerning contemporaneous statements. This because of the fact that children are less likely to employ reflective powers to fabricate.. And it seems to me that under the circumstances, given the relationship between Ms. Morton and Shawn Nicely, their lack of opportunity to talk and any prior observations between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>April, when Shawn was returned in good condition to the Nicely home, and in July, when the observations were made, that the exception to the hearsay rule under <em>Bvid.R. </em>63(4) is applicable, and I will allow admissibility of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Defendant claims that the admission of this testimony was error. He argues that it was highly prejudicial since it was the only evidence of his purported abuse of Shawn, whereas \u201call of the other evidence clearly demonstrated Mr. Bass loved and cared for Shawn.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The State responds that the evidence was offered by it \u201cunder three different theories: (1) as an excited utterance pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>63(4); (2) pursuant to the fresh complaint rule, and (3) to demonstrate the culpability or intent of defendant pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>55.\u201d Clearly, the evidence was not admissible as a \u201cfresh complaint.\u201d That rule is applied widely in rape and morals cases and permits proof that the violated victim complained within a reasonable time to someone he or she would ordinarily turn to for sympathy, protection and advice. <em>State v. Balles, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>331, 338 (1966), <em>cert. </em>den. and appeal dismissed 388 <em>U.S. </em>461, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>2120, 18 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1321 (1967). The rationale of that rule was explained in <em>Bailes </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">If no testimony were offered with respect to the complaint the jury might naturally assume that none was made and that it is only just that the prosecution be permitted to forestall this natural assumption by showing that a complaint was in fact made. <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">In response to an objection that testimony of the fresh complaint was given before the testimony of the victim, the <em>Bailes </em>court noted that the only significant question is whether in fact the complaining witness does give testimony at the trial. <em>See Bailes, supra </em>at 340-341; <em>see also State v. Hummel, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412, 422 (App.Div.1975), certif. den. 67 <em>N.J. </em>102 (1975). In this murder case the victim obviously did not testify. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Thus, the rationale for the admissibility of fresh complaint testimony is not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">This testimony did constitute \u201cother crimes evidence\u201d to which the exception as to admissibility to prove some other fact in issue such as intent, or absence of mistake or accident may apply. However, such testimony may not be admitted if otherwise excludable as hearsay. It must be proven by direct evidence, not incompetent hearsay. <em>See State v. Ingenito, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>204, 224 (1981) (Schreiber, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The only basis upon which this evidence could be properly admitted is <em>Evid.R. </em>63(4) upon which the trial judge based his decision. The rule reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">A statement is admissible if it was made (a) while the declarant was perceiving an event or condition which the statement narrates, describes or explains, or (b) while the declarant was under the stress of a nervous excitement caused by such perception, in reasonable proximity to the event, and without opportunity to deliberate or fabricate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">From the evidence and the fact that the burns had healed, it is obvious that substantial time had elapsed between the alleged event <em>(i.e., </em>when defendant burned Shawn) and the statement by Shawn to Mrs. Morton as to how he received the burns. The trial judge recognized that the event occurred some time between April 1982, when Shawn was returned to the Nicely household without these marks, and July 1982, when they were observed by Mrs. Morton. The questions then presented are: (1) whether Shawn was still under the stress of a nervous excitement caused by perceiving the event, and (2) whether the statement was in reasonable proximity to the event such as to be without opportunity to deliberate or to fabricate. The trial judge, relying upon a series of out-of-state cases, recognized that \u201cthe tender age of the declarant has been noted as a basis for relaxing traditional rules concerning contemporaneous statements.\u201d However, as we noted in <em>State in the Interest of C.A., </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 33 (App.Div.1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">A court may make allowances for a child\u2019s youth and naivete in extending the time during which the nervous excitement continues to enhance the reliability of the statement. <em>State v. Padilla, </em>110 Wis.2d 414, 417, 329 <em>N.</em>W.2d 263, 266 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>(Wis.Ct.App.1982). A child\u2019s youth and naivete, however, are not substitutes for the stress of a nervous excitement, which is the basis for the hearsay exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">We have recently expanded the hearsay exceptions contained in our Rules of Evidence to include a \u201cnaivete\u201d or \u201ctender years\u201d exception in sexual abuse cases when a child relates events of the abuse to a parent, health professional, or other confidant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State v. D.R., </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>278 (App.Div.1986), certif. granted 107 <em>N.J. </em>104 (March 3, 1987). We there noted that in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.46a, the Legislature enacted an evidential rule for application in proceedings for the termination of parental rights. In such hearings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">... previous statements made by the child relating to any allegations of abuse or neglect shall be admissible in evidence; provided, however, that no such statement, if uncorroborated, shall be sufficient to make a fact finding of abuse or neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">We conclude that in this case the evidence was properly admitted under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(4), as enhanced by a specific tender years or naivete concept. Although the sequence of the two events testified to by Mrs. Morton are reversed, it is evident that Shawn\u2019s reaction when she took out her cigarette lighter preparatory to lighting a cigarette was an excited utterance while Shawn was perceiving the event. Such a reaction demonstrated that the stress of the nervous excitement of being burned by defendant previously was still present in the mind of this three and one-half year old child when he made the statement, \u201cAllah burned me with the light Momma.\u201d By itself, testimony as to Shawn\u2019s reaction when Mrs. Morton took out her lighter would be irrelevant, except that it was tied in to defendant through Shawn\u2019s answer when Mrs. Morton asked him how he got the burn marks on his \u201cheiney.\u201d Shawn\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>reaction to the lighter and his statement to Mrs. Morton were in close proximity to each other and reflect continuance of the stress of nervous excitement sufficient to enhance the reliability of Shawn\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Furthermore, we conclude that, even if the statement was improperly admitted, it was harmless error in view of Davell\u2019s testimony as to defendant\u2019s conduct towards Shawn, both before and on the day of his death. <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>see State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 337-338 (1971). We recognize that, as between defendant and Nicely, testimony from the other witnesses revealed that Nicely substantially abused Shawn, but that defendant was pictured as treating Shawn with love and affection. Mrs. Morton testified that, although Nicely did not visit Shawn while he was living with her, defendant did visit and displayed affection to, and received affection from, Shawn. Defendant even brought him a present at Christmas. Nevertheless, we cannot conceive that any error in admitting this testimony was so prejudicial as to bring about an unjust result. By their verdict, the jury appears to have clearly recognized the difference in the way Shawn was treated by Nicely as opposed to his treatment by defendant. Furthermore, the testimony was admitted as going to defendant\u2019s intent, <em>i.e., </em>that he acted purposely or knowingly, whereas he was convicted of aggravated manslaughter, <em>i.e., </em>acting recklessly. The trial judge specifically told the jury that the evidence was admitted only as it related to defendant\u2019s conduct on September 26, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">(2) <em>Testimony of Lynn Lieberman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The second evidential ruling about which defendant complains concerns the admission of the testimony of Lynn Leiberman, a casework supervisor for DYFS, who first saw Davell on the day of the murder at approximately 11:30 a.m. His demeanor at that time was described as quiet and withdrawn. Subsequently, when Davell and the other children were brought to the hospital, upon entering the lobby, Davell stiffened, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>backed into the windows and would not move, as he was \u201creally terrified.\u201d When Ms. Leiberman attempted to persuade him to go into the emergency room, she asked Davell if he was afraid that the same thing would happen to him. He shook his head and said \u201cand, anyway, Allen walked on Shawn\u2019s back.\u201d The trial judge admitted this testimony under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(4) as a spontaneous and contemporaneous statement. Noting that the interval from perception to declaration was approximately six hours, he found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">Under the circumstances, I have no doubt by any standard or any burden of proof that Davell Nicely was under nervous excitement as a result of what he perceived approximately six hours earlier and that the stress caused by his perception or the nervous excitement caused by the perception continued until the time he made the declaration, including the declaration concerning being asleep, and that he had no opportunity to deliberate or fabricate, and, therefore, I will allow the statement to be introduced as an exception to the hearsay rule and, therefore, substantively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">We agree. This statement by Davell was truly spontaneous and made solely under the stress of the nervous excitement of having observed his younger brother brutally beaten to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">(3) <em>Testimony of Janie Bennett</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">The next evidential ruling about which defendant complains is the admission of testimony by Janie Bennett, a neighbor, as to statements made by defendant approximately two to two and one-half years before trial. At a Rule 8 hearing, the witness testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">A. I asked Allen (defendant) why would he allow Renee (Nicely) to treat Shawn like that, and he said she can do what she want to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">Q. Now, did you ask at that time either Renee or Allen if you could do anything with Shawn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">A. I asked them if I could have him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-13\">Q. And who did you ask that of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-14\">A. I asked Renee, and I also asked Allen, and he said it\u2019s up to Renee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">Before the jury, the witness testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-16\">A. I asked\u2014I had asked Renee about letting me have Shawn and I\u2014Allen come and I asked Allen why do you let Renee do that to Shawn, and he said\u2014he said Renee do what she want to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Q. And did you ask Renee Nicely at that time whether you could have Shawn, keep Shawn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">A. I asked both of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">Q. What did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">A. Allen say something to Renee, and Renee say yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Defendant concedes that, on its face, the statement attributable to defendant is admissible under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(7), but contends that the trial judge should have excluded it under <em>Evid.R. </em>4. As one of the arguments in support of exclusion he contends that Ms. Bennett\u2019s testimony at the Rule 8 hearing was dissimilar to her testimony before the jury. He argues, \u201cthe use of the different words, vastly altered the meaning conveyed to listeners.\u201d We disagree with this factual contention by defendant. Moreover, we agree with Judge Stern that the evidence was not so remote as to require exclusion under <em>Evid.R. </em>4.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Whether the probative value of evidence is outweighed by the potential for prejudice is a decision left to the discretion of the trial judge. <em>See Stoelting v. Hauck </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>87 (1960). The party seeking to preclude the admission of evidence must convince the court that the factors favoring exclusion substantially outweigh its probative value. <em>Cf. State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127 (1978) (whether prior convictions may be excluded as prejudicial). On appellate review, the decision of the trial court must stand unless it can be shown that the trial court palpably abused its discretion, that is, that its finding was so wide of the mark that a manifest denial of justice resulted. <em>See State v. Rogers, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>218, 229 (1955); <em>see State v. Carter, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>86, 106 (1982). We find no abuse of discretion in the admission of Janie Bennett\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">(4) <em>Prior Consistent Statements of Davell Nicely</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">The last evidential ruling complained of deals with the admission of prior statements made by Davell through testimony of prosecutor\u2019s detectives. Davell testified that his younger brother Shawn was killed when defendant stepped on his back and Nicely hit him across the head with a broom. Davell went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>on to explain that defendant also punched Shawn in the eye and threw him in a tub of water. During cross-examination of Davell by defendant\u2019s attorney, the following testimony was elicited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">MR. GLAZER: Did you tell\u2014Davell, did you tell the big guy with the beard [apparently referring to Investigator Gold] that only Renee hit Shawn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">D. NICELY: I forgot to tell\u2014I forgot to tell them that Allen did it, too. MR. GLAZER: Oh. When you forgot, did the detective help you remember that Allen hit him, too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">D. NICELY: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">MR. GLAZER: Did Mr. Monaco, the man here, Shawn\u2014Davell, did he help you remember that Allen hit him, too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">D. NICELY: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">MR. GLAZER: But Mr. Gold did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-12\">(Witness nodding.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-13\">D. NICELY: He did. Because he told me that he forgot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-14\">MR. GLAZER: Did you say to someone that one time that only Allen hit Shawn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-15\">D. NICELY: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-16\">MR. GLAZER: Did you ever say that only Allen hit Shawn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-17\">D. NICELY: I told the man what you had said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-18\">MR. GLAZER: Did you say only Renee hit Shawn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-19\">D. NICELY: I told the Gold that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-20\">MR. GLAZER: You told the Gold only Renee hit Shawn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-21\">D. NICELY: Because I forgot to tell him that Allen did it, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-22\">MR. GLAZER: When you saw\u2014when they put you on television, Davell\u2014 D. NICELY: I was on the television.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-23\">MR. GLAZER: Well, remember they had a camera? And you were talking to the black man (apparently referring to Investigator Thompson)? Who did you tell him hit Shawn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-24\">D. NICELY: I didn\u2019t tell him nothing. I didn\u2019t tell him nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-25\">MR. GLAZER: You didn\u2019t tell him anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-26\">(Witness shaking head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-27\">D. NICELY: Only told him and that\u2014there\u2019s another man, another man, he got hair like you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-28\">MR. GLAZER: Got hair like me? Nice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-29\">D. NICELY: And he said\u2014he said he might take me fishing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-30\">MR. GLAZER: He might take you fishing? And, Davell, when you forget things about what happened at the apartment, did they help you remember? They do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-31\">(Witness nodding.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>It is clear that this cross-examination of Davell was an attack on his credibility and was calculated to imply that Davell fabricated his account of the murder of his brother pertaining to defendant at the urging of the prosecutor\u2019s investigators. In order to rebut this charge of recent fabrication, it was therefore proper for Detectives Gold and Thompson to testify regarding prior statements made to them by Davell under <em>Evid. R. </em>20.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In <em>State v. King, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>140, 146 (App.Div.1971), certif. den. 59 <em>N.J. </em>268 (1971), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">A \u2018charge\u2019 of recent fabrication can be effected through implication by the cross-examiner as well as by direct accusation of the witness. In fact that is the usual way in which the charge is made. For present purposes, it is the impression the cross-examiner makes upon the jury in the heat of the trial rather than what an appellate court would discern from a coldly analytical study of the testimony which must control review of the somewhat discretionary exercise of judgment made by the trial judge in the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">We find no merit to defendant\u2019s contentions concerning the various evidential rulings referred in Points IV, V and VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">E. JURY CHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Defendant contends in Point VII that the charge as to accomplice liability and omission to act were erroneous and deprived him of a fair trial. It is claimed that the charge on accomplice liability was erroneous in two areas: (1) \u201cthe court failed to charge that defendant must share a community of purpose for accomplice liability,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe court mistakenly charged the defendant had a duty imposed by law to prevent the homicidal act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">A shared intent is a prerequisite to accomplice liability under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6(b)(3). <em>See State v. White, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>122, 129 (1984). In <em>State v. Fair, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>77, 95 (1965), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">To render both defendants guilty it is essential that they shared in the intent which is the crime\u2019s basic element, and at least indirectly participated in the commission of the criminal act. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>While each participant may be guilty \u2018as a principal\u2019 <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:85-14, he is not necessarily guilty in the same degree. If both parties enter into the commission of a crime with the same intent and purpose each is guilty to the same degree; but each may participate in the criminal act with a different intent. Each defendant may thus be guilty of a higher or lower degree of crime than the other, the degree of guilt depending entirely upon his own actions, intent and state of mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">While defendant correctly states the necessity for a shared intent, he incorrectly contends that the jury was not so instructed. The trial judge charged the jury in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">In this case, it is unnecessary for you, the jury, to determine which defendant actually caused each of the injuries to Shawn Nicely. Rather, you must decide whether each of the defendants actively participated in the events leading to the death of Shawn Nicely. In the event that you are unable to determine which of the two defendants caused the death, but you are satisfied that it was one of the two and that both defendants actively participated in injuring or striking Shawn with a common purpose to cause him serious bodily injury or to kill him, then you must find both defendants guilty of murder by their own conduct. If you find that only one defendant so acted or actually caused the death, you may find the other guilty of murder as well if you find that he or she was an accomplice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">A person is guilty of an offense if it is committed by his own conduct or by the conduct of another for which he is legally accountable or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when he is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of an offense. A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if <em>for the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense </em>he aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or committing it, or, if having a legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense, he fails to make a proper effort to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">I\u2019ve already defined for you the term with purpose or purposely. An attempt to aid occurs <em>when acting with the same type of culpability or state of mind required for the offense ... </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">This charge was repeated in the context of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">A reading of the charge clearly refutes defendant\u2019s contention. The trial judge\u2019s charge as to accomplice liability was in the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6 and clearly enunciated the shared intent requirement. <em>See e.g., State v. Hakim, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 387 n. 1 (App.Div.1985). As recognized by the judge at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, defendant has ignored the clear and plain language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>charge as to accomplice liability. At that hearing, the judge pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">What you find to be missing I believe was included in the charge at the outset with respect to accomplice liability, I think in the murder section and then restated and incorporated in the aggravated manslaughter section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Next, defendant argues that the trial judge instructed the jury that if a defendant purposely did nothing to stop the other from beating the decedent, his inaction alone was sufficient to constitute culpability for murder or aggravated manslaughter. He contends the court never addressed the jury regarding the requirement of shared intent with the actual perpetrator. According to defendant, the judge informed the jury that purposely \u201cdoing nothing,\u201d without more, was sufficient for a finding of guilt of murder or aggravated manslaughter. An examination of the charge in its entirety, <em>State v. Wilbely, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>420, 422 (1973), reveals the inaccuracy of defendant\u2019s contentions. As to omission to act, the trial judge charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">Ladies and gentlemen, I also instruct you that if only one person committed the acts causing Shawn\u2019s death, the other can be deemed an accomplice to murder if you find that he or she <em>was a natural parent or person having custody or control of the child or who otherwise assumed responsibility for him and that he or she purposely did nothing to stop the beating and did nothing with purpose or knowledge that the beatings by the other would result in Shawn\u2019s death or in serious bodily injury resulting in death.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">Moreover, if you find that Renee Nicely caused Shawn\u2019s death but Allen Bass was a father or a person who assumed responsibility for Shawn with the purpose of <em>[sic </em>] knowing that the result would lead to his death or seriously <em>[sic </em>] bodily injury resulting in death, he must be found guilty of murder as an accomplice even if you find that Miss Nicely was not capable of forming the requisite state of mind or did not have the requisite intent to commit murder herself. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Defendant contends that an omission to act cannot form the basis of a murder or manslaughter conviction. This argument is untenable. Initially, the trial judge observed that he included omissions because of the definition of \u201cconduct\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-14d which includes an omission, but that it must be coupled with the requisite state of mind. The judge also noted that the definition of a criminal attempt in <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>2C:5-la(3) refers to purposely doing or omitting to do something. Moreover, a person is accountable as an accomplice if, having a legal duty to prevent the commission of an offense, he fails to make a proper effort so to do. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6c(l)(c). Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-lb(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary, we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence in the record to infer that defendant was the father of Shawn,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or at least that on the fatal day he had assumed responsibility in part for the care of Shawn. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">Any person having a legal duty for the care of a child or who has assumed responsibility for the care of a child ... who causes the child harm that would make the child an abused or neglected child as defined in <em>R.S. </em>9:6-1, <em>R.S. </em>9:6-3 and [N.J.S'.A] 9:6-8.21 is guilty of a crime of the third degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 in pertinent part reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">Cruelty to a child shall consist in any of the following acts: (a) inflicting unnecessarily severe corporal punishment upon a child; (b) inflicting upon a child unnecessary suffering or pain, either mental or physical; (c) habitually tormenting, vexing or afflicting a child; (d) <em>any willful act of omission or commission whereby unnecessary pain and suffering, whether mental or physical is caused or permitted to be inflicted on a child; (e) </em>or exposing a child to unnecessary hardship, fatigue or mental or physical strains that may tend to injure the health or physical or moral well-being of such child. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">In light of our holding in <em>State v. Muniz, </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>436 (App.Div.1977), certif. den. 77 <em>N.J. </em>473 (1978), it is clear that pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1, 9:6-3 and 9:6-8.21, defendant had a duty to prevent Shawn\u2019s painful death. In <em>Muniz </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af4\">Within these definitions and within the framework of the evidence it was appropriate for the jury to consider whether under the circumstantial evidence adduced before it either one or both defendants were guilty of cruelty or neglect as defined for them and whether the evidence was sufficient to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the jury to determine that either one or both inflicted the injuries upon the child, or, if only one was responsible, <em>that the other either permitted the same to be done without sufficient effort to prevent the assault or failed \u2018to do or permit to be done any act necessary for the child\u2019s physical </em>* * * <em>well-being.\u2019 </em>This latter definition could include a failure to complain to the proper authorities, failure to call the hospital and ask for emergency help or even failure to have sought medical care sooner. It could also include neglect as indicated by the physical conditions in addition to or separate from the traumatically initiated physical condition of the child. <em>[Id. </em>at 444.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">We find no merit to defendant\u2019s contention as to the accuracy or sufficiency of the judge\u2019s charge concerning accomplice liability and omission to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">F. MOTIONS FOR ACQUITTAL OR NEW TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"AQf\">Defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal at the end of the State\u2019s case and his motion for a judgment n.o.v., on the basis of insufficiency of evidence, as well as his motion for a new trial, were properly denied by the trial judge. Defendant based his motion for a new trial on essentially the same grounds as are presented on this appeal, in addition to a contention that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. We have heretofore discussed the other points raised by defendant and are satisfied that the trial judge appropriately dealt with the sufficiency and the weight of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. <em>See State v. Martinez, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>567, 571-572 (1984), and <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454 (1967). <em>See also State v. Martin, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426 (App.Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Davell clearly testified that defendant stepped on Shawn\u2019s back, punched him in the eye and threw him into a tub full of water. Davell consistently implicated defendant in his various statements, specifically that defendant stepped on Shawn\u2019s back. This was consistent with the findings of the pathologist that Shawn had suffered two recent lesions on the upper back and right middle portion of the back. Likewise, ample evidence was produced by the State to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict of endangering the welfare of a child. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a). In denying defendant\u2019s first acquittal motion, the trial judge properly found sufficient evidence that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>either had a legal duty to care for Shawn or had assumed that responsibility as required under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a). Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was properly denied. It does not clearly appear that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law. <em>R. </em>2:10-1; <em>see State v. Sims, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>359, 373-374 (1974). Appellate review is limited to the correction of injustice resulting from a plain and obvious failure of the jury to perform its function. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 134 (App.Div.1985), certif. den. 102 <em>N.J. </em>312 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">G. MERGER</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Defendant contends that his conviction for endangering the welfare of a child under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a should have merged into his conviction for aggravated manslaughter under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4a. Although expressing some reservations initially,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the trial judge ultimately concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">I think that as part of a single prosecution, there is no merger either constitutionally or statutorily required. I do not believe that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8a(4) applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">However, for reasons which he expressed, the trial judge imposed a concurrent sentence on the endangering conviction. The State notes that the endangering count charged that the offense was committed \u201con or about\u201d September 26, 1982. Proofs at the trial established that on September 25, 1982, the day before Shawn\u2019s death, defendant had taken responsibility for watching the children while Nicely underwent an abortion at the hospital. Although defendant took Nicely to the hospital, Shawn was left at home alone where he was to be looked in on by Kerry White, the child who lived upstairs. When defendant returned from the hospital he noticed that Shawn\u2019s arm was swollen. Shawn told him that he had fallen and his arm hurt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Defendant rubbed alcohol on the arm. Defendant also observed belt marks on Shawn\u2019s back and bruises on his chest. The autopsy revealed that Shawn had sustained an extremely painful fracture of the distal end of his left elbow, by the infliction of a tremendous amount of force estimated to have occurred between six days and 24 hours before his death. Yet, when defendant returned to the hospital to pick up Nicely after her abortion, with Shawn in the car, he made no effort to obtain medical attention for these injuries. When he returned from the hospital with Nicely, he went out with his friends and remained out until the early morning hours. As the prosecutor noted in his summation, \u201cA loving father tends to the medical needs of his son. Allen Bass let Shawn suffer with a broken and swollen arm for a whole day while he went joyriding.\u201d This failure to provide medical attention for the child\u2019s injuries was harm sufficient to make Shawn an abused or neglected child within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(a), quite apart from the testimony as to the events on September 26 resulting in Shawn\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In <em>State v. Hofford, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>377, 386-387 (App.Div.1979), we rejected the view that child cruelty, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 and 9:6-3, is a lesser included offense of manslaughter. We held, however, that the cruelty and manslaughter convictions and sentences, based upon defendants giving paregoric to their children, should have merged \u201csince the same conduct resulted in both convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385. In this case, unlike <em>Hofford, </em>defendant cannot claim the benefit of the so-called \u201csame transaction\u201d test. He committed two separate and distinct crimes, notwithstanding their proximity to each other. <em>Cf. State v. Fraction, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>532, 536-540 (App.Div.1985). Although the treatment of Shawn by defendant on September 26, 1982, or his omission to act in the face of Nicely\u2019s conduct toward Shawn that day, might also be sufficient for conviction on the endangering count and may have warranted merger, we cannot say that the trial judge erroneously concluded that there was no merger either constitutionally or statutorily required. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>Compare State v.
