The Spring Lake Board of Zoning Adjustment ruled against the application for a year-round operation by plaintiff Cos-Lin, Inc. The Law Division judge reversed the Board. We conclude that the proposed extension of this summer seasonal restaurant and hotel use to a substantially year-round operation in the Borough\u2019s most restricted residential zone violates the strong public policy expressed in our case law to limit and discourage the extension of nonconforming uses. We reverse the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The Borough of Spring Lake is an upper-middle-class to upper-class suburban residential community, extending about 2.1 miles, or 27 blocks north to south, and 1.5 miles, or six blocks east to west. Spring Lake is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, the New York and Long Branch Railroad on the west, the Boroughs of Belmar and South Belmar on the north, and the Borough of Sea Girt on the south. The permanent population is about 4,200 and the summer population is about 7,500. The land distribution is: 46% single-family detached residential, 27.6% public, quasi-public (parks, tennis courts) and lakes, 20% street network, 2% commercial, 3% hotels and guest houses, and 1.4% vacant land. <em>Spring Lake Hotel Ass\u2019n v. Spring Lake, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>201, 204 (App. Div.), certif. den. 101 <em>N.J. </em>267 (1985). The 35 existing hotels and guest houses are preexisting nonconforming uses, 17 of which have been open only seasonally from Memorial Day to Labor Day. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u201cThe Breakers\u201d, an old Victorian-style hotel, fronts on the Atlantic Ocean; Ocean Avenue and a boardwalk separate the hotel from the dry sandy beach. The boardwalk is undeveloped, commercially or otherwise. The area around \u201cThe Breakers\u201d is zoned R-l, the highest residential zone in the Borough. The hotel\u2019s neighborhood is completely residential except for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>adjacent 25-room guest house, \u201cThe Kenilworth,\u201d which also fronts on Ocean Avenue. The houses in the surrounding area ranged in value from $150,000 to $600,000 in 1983-1984. \u201cThe Breakers\u201d has 70 rooms and is a four-story structure, about 100 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The Borough\u2019s ocean front was originally zoned for hotels in 1929. The area was rezoned R-l in 1957 when the townspeople recognized the trend from a resort town to essentially a single-family year-round residential community with the advent of the Garden State Parkway and other local highway improvements. The zoning has remained residential during the past 30 years. The town was originally a rural fishing and farming village which developed into a vacation resort during the late 1800\u2019s with the onset of railroad accessibility to the New York metropolitan area. The original large beachfront hotels, The Monmouth and the Essex and Sussex, no longer exist. The Monmouth has been demolished and replaced by residences; the Essex and Sussex apparently has been converted to summer seasonal condominiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u201cThe Breakers\u201d operated as a hotel with a restaurant for guests and the general public until its sale to the plaintiff Cos-Lin in 1979. Until then the hotel and restaurant had operated only from Memorial Day to Labor Day. After Cos-Lin bought \u201cThe Breakers,\u201d the restaurant eventually remained open into the fall months, apparently through the end of November, without official approval. In 1983 Cos-Lin\u2019s principal, Cosmo Scardino, applied to upgrade the heating capacity for year-round use. This application precipitated the applications to the Board for variance and interpretive relief and then this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The dining room seats about 150 and has about 30 tables. During the off-season months when Scardino hopes to be open, he anticipates serving a minimum of 400 people a week, about 200 of them on Saturday night. He plans to close during January, and apparently part of February, for vacations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>renovations. In his testimony of October 24, 1985, Seardino said he planned a \u201cten and one-half month operation a year.\u201d He actually only had seven hotel rooms heated and available for occupancy in the off-season during 1983-1985 when the Board\u2019s hearings were held. He anticipated only about a 10% occupancy rate in the hotel through the \u201coff-season\u201d if his application was granted. During the summer season, occupancy of the hotel is essentially 100% and the restaurant is \u201cbusy.\u201d When Seardino testified in mid-November 1983 he said the \u201chotel was now closed for the winter\u201d but the restaurant was open. There is no off-street parking available to patrons on \u201cThe Breakers\u201d property. There is no liquor license; customers usually bring their own alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">This is the procedural and factual background of this litigation. In 1983 Cos-Lin made an application to David Miller, Spring Lake\u2019s construction official, for a building permit to install heating equipment in the dining rooms and hotel rooms in \u201cThe Breakers\u201d to facilitate a year-round operation in contrast to the previous Memorial Day to Labor Day operation. After denial of this building permit, Cos-Lin applied to the Board for an interpretation that in essence would have permitted the proposed temporal extension as a <em>de minimis </em>expansion of the pre-existing nonconforming hotel and restaurant use under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(b) or for a use variance under <em>N.J. S.A. </em>40:55D-70(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statement of \u201creason for relief\u201d presented by the applicant said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Applicant is seeking relief from the decision of the building inspector denying a building permit to install heat in the west area of the first floor of the hotel covering between 6,000 and 8,000 square feet, and ultimately, to heat the entire hotel area. It is the position of the applicant that the heating of the hotel is a mere intensification of a legally existing non-conforming use. There is no enlargement of use and no change in the current structure of the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">The applicant intends to install a gas-driven base board hot water heating system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The Board found as a fact that Scardino \u201ccandidly testified that on November 17, 1983 the hotel was closed,\u201d that the restaurant was open and \u201cthat he wanted to operate his facility primarily ... as a restaurant ... on an all year-round basis.\u201d The Board also found \u201cas a fact that the restaurant use [and hotel] use have been utilized on a \u2018seasonal basis\u2019 from on or about Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend for an extensive period of time ... prior to applicants extending the time of the use commencing in 1983,\u201d after it acquired the property. After extensive hearings in late 1983 and early 1984, at which the Board heard testimony from four experts (two for applicant; two for objectors), affected local residents, and Cos-mo Scardino for Cos-Lin, the Board denied the request in June 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The Board\u2019s resolution of denial specifically relied on our case law on the extension or expansion of nonconforming uses, citing <em>Belleville v. Parrillo\u2019s Inc., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>309 (1980); <em>Grundlehner v. Dangler, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>256 (1959), and <em>Hantman v. Randolph Township, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127 (App.Div.1959), certif. den. 31 <em>N.J. </em>550 (1960). The Board specifically found that the \u201cproposed change from a seasonal to an all year-round restaurant constitutes a substantial enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use,\u201d would \u201chave a detrimental effect on the neighborhood,\u201d and \u201cwould substantially impair the Zone Plan.\u201d The Board found that the extended restaurant use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u201cadds to pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the residential neighborhood, parking problems, significant inconveniences to the adjoining residential users, <em>i.e., </em>noise, pollution, littering, odors, etc.\u201d and that the \u201cdeleterious effect\u201d of a restaurant in a residential area should not be aggravated. The Board concluded that \u201calthough the hotel probably preexisted all the residences in the area, the residential property owners purchased their homes with the knowledge that the hotel was a seasonal operation and that it would be unfair to these residential users to permit a more intense restaurant operation to be conducted from the site.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Cos-Lin then began this prerogative writ action seeking to set aside the Board\u2019s denial of relief. Apparently without objection, on May 30, 1985 the Law Division judge remanded the case to the Board for a decision on an amended application whether plaintiff\u2019s plan \u201cto add heat to various hotel rooms and to utilize [them] on an all year-round rather than seasonal basis\u201d and the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s request to convert its accessory seasonal hotel restaurant into an all year-round public restaurant\u201d was permissible. In the amended application Cos-Lin requested this relief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">This application is being made pursuant to an Order of the Superior Court of New Jersey dated May 30, 1985 and seeks the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">(1) to reverse the decision of the Zoning Officer which held that the placement of heat in the hotel rooms and restaurant and its subject operation on a year round basis constitutes an illegal expansion of a non-conforming use; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">(2) in the alternative, for a use variance to enable the aforesaid placement of heat and operation on a year round basis of both the hotel and restaurant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">This application sought relief from \u00a7 402 of the local ordinance which does not include hotels and restaurants as a permitted use in any residential zone and \u00a7 504B(4) which states in pertinent part on nonconforming uses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">4. No use and no structure containing a non-conforming use shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed or structurally altered in any manner without an appeal for variance relief____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>After further extensive hearings in late 1985 and early 1986, the requested relief was denied in a detailed 17-page resolution, the Board finding that \u201cthe proposed intensification of the hotel restaurant use is substantial rather than insubstantial, ... and would have a deleterious effect upon surrounding residential users living in the highest residential zone in the Borough, ... would have an adverse impact upon the surrounding property values and the quality of life of those living in the neighborhood\u201d and that the essentially unanswered testimony of the neighboring property owners \u201chas shown overwhelmingly that the illegal year-round operation of the dining room alone is a substantial intensification and expansion of a nonconforming use.\u201d The Board also rejected Cos-Lin\u2019s contention that the \u201cpublic trust doctrine\u201d encouraging the general public access to the dry sand beaches of this State, <em>see Matthews v. Bay Head Improvement Ass\u2019n., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>306 (1982), should be \u201cexpanded to include ... public accommodations [and] restaurants as special reasons for a use variance.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">At trial of this prerogative writ, the Law Division judge reviewed the testimony before the Board at both hearings. He affirmed the denial of a use variance application under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d). <em>See Medici v. BPR Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>1 (1987). There is no cross-appeal from this ruling. The judge also ruled that the seasonal nonconforming hotel and restaurant use of \u201cThe Breakers\u201d was a valid nonconforming use which included the right to operate a year-round public restaurant and hotel, so long as the hotel remained open during the ten and one-half months proposed. He said: \u201cThere is an annoyance feature and the annoyance feature is not enough to interpose itself to tilt the balance in this case to favor sustaining the Board in their legal conclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">A leading land use law authority has recently observed that: \u201cIn dealing with proposed changes of nonconforming uses, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>courts have divided along the familiar lines.\u201d <em>Williams, American Land Planning Law, </em>\u00a7 112.02 at 109 (1986). \u201cThose courts which usually show special concern for developers\u2019 rights are more likely to step in and permit nonconforming users to change to other nonconforming uses; others tend to follow a stricter policy generally, and normally do not permit proposed changes among nonconforming users.\u201d <em>Ibid. Williams </em>notes that New Jersey is one of the states \u201cwith the most restrictive judicial policy\u201d towards nonconforming uses. <em>Id. </em>at n. 2; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 6.04.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">Many decisions give no indication one way or the other of a basic attitude towards nonconforming uses. However, in several important states, the courts have taken the opportunity in such cases to emphasize the general rule against continuation of nonconforming uses; and in those states the decisions generally find a reason not to permit such change. The basic policy in these decisions was announced by a California court in the early days of zoning: \u201cThe ultimate purpose, however, is plainly that nonconforming uses or premises shall gradually be eliminated.\u201d <em>[Williams, supra </em>\u00a7 112.07 at 115 n. 20, citing <em>Sitgreaves v. Board of Adjustment of Town of Nutley, </em>136 <em>N.J.L. </em>21, 54 A.2d 451 (Sup.Ct. 1947), and <em>Rupprecht v. Draney, </em>137 <em>N.J.L. </em>564, 61 A.2d 220 (Sup.Ct.1948) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">This attitude of our courts toward nonconforming uses was confirmed in the first leading case on the subject in the modern era, <em>Grundlehner v. Dangler, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>256 (1959). This case involved an application for a 26-foot one-story extension to the building and the expansion of the garage of a funeral parlor located in a residential zone. Over the opposition of neighboring property owners, the Board of Zoning Adjustment and then the Law Division, approved the expansion of the nonconforming use. This court reversed the Law Division and the Supreme Court affirmed the reversal. In refusing to permit the expansion of the nonconforming use the Supreme Court agreed with this court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe burden is on the applicant to prove the insubstantial nature of the construction\u201d and that \u201c[i]f there is any doubt that the construction is of an insubstantial nature,\u201d the application must be denied. 51 <em>N.J.Super. </em>53, 60 (App.Div.1958). Justice Jacobs, for the Supreme Court related that: \u201cShortly after the passage of the zoning act our courts stated that the spirit of the law was to restrict noncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>forming uses and that while [then-pertinent] <em>R.S. </em>40:55-48 permitted them to continue as of right it did not permit the enlargement of that right. [Citations omitted]. Since the nonconforming uses were generally discordant to their surroundings it was the fervent hope that they would in time wither and die and be replaced by conforming uses.\u201d <em>Grundlehner v. Dangler, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>at 263. Justice Jacobs reviewed the pertinent authorities and concluded that \u201cour courts have continued with their application of the doctrine that nonconforming uses may not be enlarged as of right except where the enlargement is so negligible or insubstantial that it does not fairly warrant judicial or administrative notice or interference.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>He concluded the point by stressing that \u201cwhere there is doubt as to whether the enlargement is substantial, rather than insubstantial, it is to be resolved against the enlargement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 264, citing <em>Heagen v. Borough of Allendale, </em>42 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 482 (App.Div.1956) (Clapp, S.J.A.D.) and <em>Martin v. Cestone, </em>33 <em>N.J.Super. </em>267, 271 (App.Div.1954) (Goldmann, S.J.A.D\u2014\u201cThe community\u2019s interest in the advancement of its own welfare through the medium of a zoning project is to this extent favored over the individuals\u2019 interest in his nonconforming use.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Shortly after the <em>Grundlehner </em>case, this court considered our state\u2019s first case involving a temporal expansion of a nonconforming use in <em>Hantman v. Randolph Twp., </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127 (App.Div.1959), certif. den. 31 <em>N.J. </em>550 (1960). This case involved an attempt to extend the use of a summer bungalow colony business use, which was nonconforming in a residential district, into a year-round use. Because the change was substantially deleterious to the community, we affirmed the Law Division\u2019s \u201cdenial of relief to the plaintiffs applicants\u201d who had sought declaratory relief from the local zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In <em>Hantman </em>the plaintiffs disputed \u201cthe existence of any municipal power to restrict occupancy in terms of a time dimension,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 135, as an unconstitutional taking. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>rejected this contention stating that \u201c[protection will not be accorded unless the use is substantially the same kind of use as that to which the premises were devoted at the time of the passage of the zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded on the legal point presented</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">Our judgment is that an increase in the time period during which a nonconforming use is operated may justifiably be the basis for a finding of an unlawful extension thereof, just as changes in the functional use of land or increases in the area of use have been. <em>[Id. </em>at 137].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The change from seasonal use, May 1 through September 30, was thus held a \u201csubstantial, ... unlawful extension of the nonconforming use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138. <em>Hantman </em>has been cited authoritatively in 4 <em>Rathkopf, The Law of Zoning and Planning, </em>\u00a7 51.07 at 51-126 n. 100 (1987). The author states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">The exercise of a nonconforming use at seasons of the year additional to those at which that use was exercised at the time of adoption of an ordinance has been held to be an unlawful extension or enlargement of the use. Similarly, an increase in the number of days per week, or hours per day, of operation has been held to be an unlawful extension or enlargement of use, especially where those increased times of operation resulted in quasi-nuisance impacts upon the neighborhood. <em>[Id. </em>\u00a7 51.07 at 51-126],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>See </em>8A <em>McQuillan, Municipal Corporations, </em>\u00a7 25.206 at 107 n. 24 (3rd ed. 1986), which states: \u201cExtension in point of time, as by conversion of a non-conforming use from seasonal to year-round operation, may also be prohibited,\u201d citing <em>Beerwort v.

Parrillo\u2019s, Inc., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>309 (1980). There the defendant was found guilty of violating a municipal ordinance because it \u201cextended a nonconforming use when it changed its operation from a restaurant to a discotheque without having first obtained approval of the local board of adjustment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311-312. The restaurant turned disco was in a B residential zone. The Appellate Division was corrected for erroneously reversing the convictions; Justice Clifford said \u201cthe focus in cases such as this must be on the quality, character and intensity of the use, viewed in their totality and <em>with regard to their overall effect on the neighborhood and the zoning plan.\u201d Id. </em>at 314 (emphasis supplied). We note with emphasis \u201cthe neighborhood\u201d and not the entire municipality as the focus of the Supreme Court\u2019s concern. But an entire community can be affected ultimately because applications for conversions of other seasonal commercial uses to year-round uses in residential zones in Spring Lake and similar communities could be prompted by approval of \u201cThe Breakers\u201d application and thus affect other neighborhoods and further contribute to the erosion of the integrity of a town\u2019s zoning plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Justice Clifford adhered to our established doctrine that \u201c[bjecause nonconforming uses are inconsistent with the objectives of uniform zoning, the courts have required that consistent with the property rights of those affected and with substantial justice, they should be reduced to conformity as quickly as is compatible with justice.\u201d 83 <em>N.J. </em>at 315. He reiterated that where there is doubt as to whether a change is substantial, \u201cthe courts have consistently declared that it is to be resolved against the enlargement or change.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316. Noting that courts have \u201cproceeded with a caution approaching suspicion\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>in this evaluation of whether the change is substantial, he cites seven examples of denials and three of approval. <em>Id. </em>at 316-317. One of the examples of a denial is the <em>Hantman </em>case. The Supreme Court expressly approved our holding in <em>Hantman </em>denying a temporal expansion of a seasonal nonconforming use, stating that <em>Hantman </em>\u201cwell illustrates the proper analysis for examining changes in nonconforming uses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317. In <em>Belleville </em>the Court, by Justice Clifford, reviewed our holding in <em>Hantman </em>and commented</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFj\">... Reviewing the facts the court established that the plaintiffs\u2019 bungalows were in fact nonconforming uses. It then proceeded to address the question of whether permitting fulltime occupancy would effect a substantial change in the premises. Answering in the affirmative, the court declares, \u201can increase in the time period during which a nonconforming use is operated may justifiably be the basis for finding an unlawful extension thereof, just as changes in the functional use of the land or increases in the area of use have been.\u201d <em>[Hantman, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 137], Recognizing that nonconforming uses are disfavored, the Appellate Division emphasized the deleterious effect that year-round operation of the bungalows might have upon the general welfare of the municipality. [83 <em>N.J. </em>at 317-318],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The Supreme Court concluded the analysis by saying: \u201cWe fully approve of and adopt the approach and analytical framework of the <em>Hantman </em>court,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We here conclude that the Law Division erred in reversing the Board. As all the authorities make clear, the burden of proof on the issue of substantial change is on the applicant and doubts are to be resolved against the enlargement or change. Here the judge appears to have resolved any doubt in favor of the change rather than against it when he said that \u201cthe annoyance feature is not enough to interpose itself to tilt the balance in this case to favor sustaining the Board.\u201d We conclude that this is not simply a case of \u201ctilting the balance\u201d but a case where the law disapproves the change if any doubt on the issue of substantiality is generated.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Moreover, there was very substantial evidence, basically unrefuted, that this change from summer use, Memorial Day to Labor Day, to ten and one-half months a year, adversely and deleteriously affected this R-l neighborhood. Public bodies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>such as this Zoning Board are allowed wide latitude in the exercise of their delegated fact-finding discretion because of their peculiar knowledge of local conditions. <em>Kramer v. Bd. of Adj., Sea Girt, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>268, 296 (1965). We cannot substitute our independent judgment for the Board\u2019s in such areas of factual dispute. Here substantial evidence and common sense supported the conclusion that a year-round commercial use like this restaurant is a substantially greater annoyance to people in their neighboring homes than is a seasonal use. In fact, the judge himself said \u201cthere will be a deleterious effect on the adjoining owners\u201d from the extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Finally, the Law Division judge here seemed to conclude that the extension of the nonconforming use had to be a threat to the \u201cgeneral welfare of the community\u201d, not just the neighborhood, before it could be denied. He said that <em>Hantman </em>was decided against the applicants \u201cbecause of the effect on the municipality not the effect on the neighbors.\u201d But in <em>Belleville v. Parrillo\u2019s, Inc., </em>where the restaurant was converted to a discotheque, Justice Clifford clearly noted for the Court that the focus must be on the \u201cquality, character and intensity of the use\u201d viewed \u201cwith regard to their overall effect <em>on the neighborhood </em>and the zoning plan,\u201d 83 <em>N.J. </em>at 314 (emphasis added), and also on whether \u201cthe <em>general welfare of the neighborhood </em>has been demonstrably affected,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318 (emphasis added). We conclude that there was ample credible evidence before the Spring Lake Board to support the denial of the temporal expansion of this nonconforming commercial use in a residential zone and no good or special reason to grant relief. Indeed, the test for the extension of a nonconforming use analytically may be the same test used for grant of a \u201cspecial reasons\u201d subsection (d) variance. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d) (\u201cin particular cases and for special reasons\u201d the Board may grant a variance to allow\u201d (1) a restricted use or (2) an expansion of a nonconforming use.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70 states in pertinent part</p>\n<p id=\"A1a\">The board of adjustment shall have the power to: ********</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">(b) Hear and decide requests for interpretation of the zoning map or ordinance or for decisions upon other special questions upon which such board is authorized to pass by any zoning or official map ordinance, in accordance with this act;</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>(d) In particular cases and for special reasons, grant a variance to allow departure from regulations pursuant to article 8 of this act to permit: (1) a use or principal structure in a district restricted against such use or principal structure, (2) an expansion of a nonconforming use,____</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
