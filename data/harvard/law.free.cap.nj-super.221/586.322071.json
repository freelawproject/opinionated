Defendant shot her in his van. The gunshots were heard by Peter Rice as he waited in his automobile for the victim to return from defendant\u2019s van. After the shooting, defendant went to the home of his former wife, Joyce Coburn. Defendant told Joyce he had killed his girlfriend with a gun which was in his van. Joyce called Carole Stavola, one of defendant\u2019s sisters, to ask her to come over. Stavola and her friend, Claire Tyluki, went to Joyce\u2019s home. Joyce then drove her son to her parent\u2019s home which was about five minutes away. Upon arrival, she told her parents what the defendant had confided to her. Unbeknownst to Joyce her father called the Ocean Township Police Department. He reported to the police that someone had been killed at his daughter\u2019s home at 18 Brown Place.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">In response to the phone call Ocean Township Patrolman Neil Ing\u00e9nito was dispatched to 18 Brown Place. He testified at the <em>Miranda </em>hearing that upon his arrival he observed a van in the driveway and thereupon entered the home through the kitchen door. A male, later identified as defendant, was sitting at the kitchen table with Claire Tyluki; Carole Stavola was standing nearby. Twice the patrolman asked \u201cwhat happened\u201d but there was no response. He got the impression that those in the room did not know what he was talking about or why he was there. Officer Ing\u00e9nito telephoned headquarters for supplemental instructions. Patrolman Thompson advised Ing\u00e9nito to speak to or locate an individual named \u201cCoburn\u201d because that person had told his ex-wife, \u201cI just killed my girlfriend, now, I\u2019m going to kill\u2014.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Ing\u00e9nito then asked the only male in the room if he was Coburn and defendant said yes. Ing\u00e9nito described his questioning of defendant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>After I got off the phone with Patrolman Thompson, I asked Mr. Cobum if he had been talking to his ex-wife and he said yes. I then asked him, \u201cDid you tell your ex-wife that you just killed your girlfriend.\u201d And his response was, \u201cI did it.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou did what, you talked to your wife or killed your ex\u2014talked to your ex-wife and killed your girlfriend?\u201d He said, \u201cI killed my girlfriend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Ing\u00e9nito then asked defendant \u201cWhere did this happen?\u201d Defendant said that he did not remember. Ing\u00e9nito asked defendant where was the gun and defendant said it was in the van. The officer testified that he asked where was the gun just to make sure it was not within the reach of defendant. Ing\u00e9nito further testified that defendant made a statement that was not in response to a question. Defendant said that \u201che was going to take his kids to the movies that day but he decided to go over his girlfriend\u2019s house and they had an argument and he shot her and he said when he shot her she fell into the well of his van.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">A .22 caliber gun containing two spent shells was seized from inside the van in a brown leather holster. Blood stains were observed inside the van. The body was not found in the van because defendant disposed of it in a wooded area. Defendant was then arrested and taken to police headquarters. At the police station defendant was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings which he said he understood. During the questioning that ensued, defendant was visibly upset, but gave responsive, coherent answers to many questions. He informed the officers that his girlfriend\u2019s name was \u201cMaria,\u201d that she lived in the Asbury Park projects, building 5, apartment 2, that she was Puerto Rican, and that \u201cI know she\u2019s dead because I killed her.\u201d He said they were sitting in the van in the parking lot at her residence when he shot her. Based on defendant\u2019s statement and his description of the route he had taken to dispose of her body by dragging it into the woods, the officers called the Tinton Falls Police Department to assist in locating the body. The body was found in a wooded area near a reclamation center. An autopsy revealed that the victim died from two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>gunshot wounds caused by bullets fired from the gun removed from defendant\u2019s van.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Meanwhile, Joyce Coburn\u2019s father, Rudolph Wunch, telephoned the police station a second time with additional information concerning marijuana at the home of defendant\u2019s sister, Helen Pohlemus, with whom defendant resided. Detective Miller advised Pohlemus, who was at the police station, that the police were informed there was a large quantity of marijuana under defendant\u2019s bed in her home. The detective told Pohlemus that the police wanted to retrieve the marijuana and that she had the right to refuse. Mrs. Pohlemus consented to admit the officers into her home to seize the marijuana. Patrolman Glenn Harrington accompanied Mrs. Pohlemus to her home, where she took him directly to defendant\u2019s bedroom. The officer looked under the bed and pulled out a brown grocery bag near the foot of the bed. The bag contained 150 clear plastic bags of a substance subsequently determined by laboratory analysis to be 201.6 grams of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Defendant testified on his own behalf at trial. His version of events which led up to the shooting was substantially different from that offered by the State. As to the killing, defendant testified that he went to the victim\u2019s apartment on December 29, 1984, because he wanted to get rid of the marijuana seized from under his bed before his sister found it. He said the marijuana belonged to Lewis. He spoke to the victim\u2019s roommate who told him Lewis was not home. He then asked the roommate to go with him to the movies. The roommate agreed and told him to come back in an hour to allow her time to get ready. While sitting in his van trying to decide whether to go home and change his clothes, he saw Lewis walk out of the building with Peter Rice. He talked with Lewis for a few minutes in his van. Lewis then exited the van, walked over to Rice where she remained for five or ten minutes and returned in a \u201ccompletely different\u201d mood. He said Lewis was angry and told him she did not need this \u201cmess\u201d and he could take back all his money and gifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>According to defendant, Lewis threatened to kill him because he asked her roommate to go to the movies. After she threatened him, he threatened to dispose of the marijuana by throwing it in the garbage. At that point he turned away from Lewis. As he turned towards Lewis again, she was holding his gun in her hands. Defendant grabbed for the gun and it went off. Lewis screamed, \u201cYou fucking bastard.\u201d He pushed her and \u201cboom, it went off again.\u201d Defendant grabbed the gun and immediately sped off to Jersey Shore Hospital. When he arrived at the hospital he realized Lewis was dead. He was unsure what to do next. Defendant stated that he decided to dispose of the body by dragging it from the van and leaving it in a wooded area. He said that he then went to his ex-wife\u2019s home, told her \u201cmy girlfriend\u2019s been shot\u201d and asked her to summon the police. When the police officers arrived, he said that he told the officers that he shot his girlfriend and gave them permission to look in the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Defendant admitted that before the gun would fire, one had to both cock the gun to rotate the chamber and pull the trigger. The same action was required before each firing. He insisted, however, that he did not observe Lewis cock the gun or remember hearing the sound of a rotating chamber. Laboratory evidence presented at the trial indicated that four and one-half pounds of pressure had to be applied to the trigger to make the gun fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Defendant argues in this appeal that his pr <em>e-Miranda </em>statements should have been suppressed because they were given in response to custodial interrogation. Officer Ing\u00e9nito testified at the <em>Miranda </em>hearing that he questioned defendant to find out what, if anything, had occurred. He said defendant was not a target of any investigation because there was nothing yet corroborating the phone call to police headquarters. He wanted to find out if defendant had made the statement and then find out whether it was true. The trial judge held that the pr <em>e-Miranda </em>statements were admissible under <em>State v. Gosser, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>438 (1967), <em>cert. </em>den. 390 <em>U.S. </em>1035, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1434, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>20 L.Ed.2d 295 (1968) because the police were conducting on the scene questioning as to facts surrounding a potential crime. He also found that defendant\u2019s statement regarding the movies was admissible on the ground that it was volunteered and was not in response to questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We reject defendant\u2019s contention that his <em>pre-Miranda </em>statements were given in response to custodial interrogation. <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required only after the person being questioned \u201cis taken into \u2018custody\u2019 or his freedom has otherwise been significantly restrained.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>298, 309, 105 <em>S.Ct </em>1285, 1293, 84 L.Ed.2d 222, 232 (1985). It is \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d rather than the \u201cmere \u2018focus\u2019 upon a particular suspect\u201d which triggers the requirement that <em>Miranda </em>warnings be given. <em>State v. Graves, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>441, 448 (1972); <em>State v. Marks, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>514, 527 (App.Div.1985), certif. den. 102 <em>N.J. </em>393 (1986). <em>See also State v. Downey, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 396-397 (App.Div.1986). The crucial question therefore is whether defendant was in custody at the time he was questioned by Officer Ing\u00e9nito.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Custody in the <em>Miranda </em>sense does not necessitate a formal arrest or that the questioning occur in a police station. Custody may occur in a suspect\u2019s home or a public place. <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 175 (App.Div.1974), aff\u2019d, 67 <em>N.J. </em>267 (1975). In <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 352-353 (App.Div.1977), we stated that the test to be applied in determining whether there has been custodial interrogation was stated by the Supreme Court of California in <em>People v. Stewart, </em>62 <em>Cal.2d </em>571, 43 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>201, 400 <em>P.2d </em>97 (1965), aff\u2019d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">The test which we have described does not propose a determination of the actual intent or <em>subjective purpose of the police in undertaking the interrogations but a determination based upon the objective evidence. </em>Whatever maybe the subjective intent of the interrogators, we must, in order to determine if the police are carrying out \u201ca process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements\u201d [citation omitted], analyze the total situation which envelopes the questioning by considering such factors as the length of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the interrogation, the place and time of the interrogation, the nature of the questions, the conduct of the police and all other relevant circumstances. [43 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 206, 400 P.2d at 102 (emphasis dded)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">This is essentially the same test adopted in <em>State v. Barnes, 54 N.J. </em>1, 6 (1969), <em>cert. </em>den. 396 <em>U.S. </em>1029, 90 <em>S.Ct. 580, 24 </em>L.Ed.2d 525 (1970). The foregoing standard is known as the \u201cobjective reasonable man test\u201d which holds that custody exists if the action of the interrogating officers and the surrounding circumstances, fairly construed, would reasonably lead a detainee to believe he could not leave freely. <em>State v. Godfrey, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 176, n. 1. <em>See also State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 219-220 (1983), <em>cert. </em>den. 465 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, 79 L.Ed.2d 695 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Here, the interrogation took place in the home of defendant\u2019s former wife in the presence of defendant\u2019s sister and her friend. The questioning took only a short time. There was nothing coercive in the environment in which the questioning occurred. Defendant was never restrained in any manner. Nothing was said or done to the defendant to suggest that he was. not free to leave. Even though Ing\u00e9nito had planned to detain defendant, that subjective determination was never communicated to the defendant. The interview lasted only a short period of time in surroundings totally lacking the \u201ccompelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 478, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1630, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 726. <em>See also State v. Zucconi, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>361, 364 (1967). Additionally, an observation by the Supreme Court in <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>492, 495, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>711, 714, 50 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>714, 719 (1977) is applicable to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">* * * Any interview of one suspected of a crime by a police officer will have coercive aspects to it, simply by virtue of the fact that the police officer is part of a law enforcement system which may ultimately cause the suspect to be charged with a crime. But police officers are not required to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to everyone whom they question. <em>Nor is the requirement of warnings to be imposed simply because the questioning takes place in the station house, or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect. Miranda </em>warnings are required only where there has been such a restriction on a person\u2019s freedom as to render him \u201cin custody.\u201d It was <em>that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>sort of coercive environment to which <em>Miranda </em>by its terms was made applicable, and to which it was limited, [emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The limited detention involved here was not a significant restraint upon defendant\u2019s liberty as to invoke the need for the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Also, Ing\u00e9nito inquired as to the whereabouts of the gun for reasons of safety permitted by <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 29, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 911 (1968). We therefore conclude that defendant was not in custody at the time Officer Ing\u00e9nito questioned him. As the court observed in <em>Mathiason, </em>the fact that defendant may have become a suspect before or during questioning did not create the need for <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The State urges that an exception to the <em>Miranda </em>warning requirement in \u201con the scene\u201d investigations should be applied. <em>Miranda </em>states that \u201cGeneral on-the-scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in the factfinding process is not affected by our holding.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 477, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1629, 16 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 725. In <em>State v. Gosser, supra, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>at 445-446 the Court cited this on-the-scene questioning \u201cexception\u201d to the <em>Miranda </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\"><em>State v. Gosser </em>involved questioning that was similar to this case. After defendant in <em>Gosser </em>confided in a friend that something terrible had happened to his wife, the friend called the police. When a patrolman arrived at defendant\u2019s home he was upset and crying when he answered the door. There was caked blood on his pajamas and face. In response to the officer\u2019s question as to the nature of the trouble, defendant said that he had killed his wife. The officer radioed for assistance, and within a few minutes a sergeant and another patrolman arrived. The sergeant asked defendant what had happened. Defendant said he had shot his wife, and when asked where she was, he told them \u201cupstairs.\u201d After the body and the gun were found, defendant was placed under arrest. The Court concluded that defendant\u2019s statements fell within the category of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>\u201cgeneral on-the-scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime.\u201d <em>State v. Gosser, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>438, 446 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Although the question posed by Ing\u00e9nito to defendant in the present case was more pointed\u2014\u201cDid you tell your ex-wife that you just killed your girlfriend?\u201d\u2014the evidence indicates that Ingenito\u2019s purpose was simply to ascertain what was going on rather than to elicit an incriminating response. Despite information that defendant had stated to his ex-wife that he had killed his girlfriend, Ing\u00e9nito had observed nothing which gave him probable cause to believe that a crime had actually been committed because of the absence of any corroborating information. The police officers were directed to 18 Brown Place as the potential scene of a shooting or killing. Under the circumstances, the State argues that the police officers were entitled to conduct limited questioning pursuant to <em>Gosser </em>without\u2019 having to first advise defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Because the <em>pre-Miranda </em>statements did not result from custodial interrogation, we find it unnecessary to decide whether <em>Gosser </em>is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The statement by defendant that instead of taking his children to the movies as planned, he went to his girlfriend\u2019s house and \u201cthey had an argument and he shot her ...\u201d was volunteered by defendant and was not made in response to any questioning by Ing\u00e9nito. The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that this statement was volunteered is amply supported by the record and we will not disturb it. <em>Miranda </em>does not apply to volunteered statements. <em>State v. DeLane, </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>45, 49 (App.Div.1986); <em>State v. Elysee, </em>159 <em>N.J.Super. </em>380, 387 (App.Div.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">We are also persuaded that defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>statements were properly admitted as evidence. Defendant raises the issue for the first time on this appeal that his distraught mental state precluded an effective waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Even though the failure to assert this claim in the trial court should bar our consideration of the issue, we nonetheless reach the merits of the claim. Based on our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>careful study of the record, this issue is clearly without merit. Defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>statements were made after a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his Fifth Amendment rights. <em>State v. Hartley, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>252, 260 (1986). There was no coercive police activity connected with defendant\u2019s statements. <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>515, 521-524, 93 L.Ed.2d 473, 484-487 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Defendant also contends that the court erred in denying his motion for a new trial on the basis of receipt of a toxicological report subsequent to the trial which indicates that Lewis was under the influence of a large amount of drugs at the time of her death. He argued that such evidence would support his theory that Lewis was a \u201cwild woman\u201d when she returned to the van and that it was important that the jury have this information in evaluating his testimony regarding the scuffle leading to her death. During the trial the jury was informed the autopsy revealed fresh needle marks on the victim\u2019s left wrist. The fact of the needle marks was pursued to some extent on cross-examination of the pathologist, Dr. Sinha. In response to defense counsel\u2019s questions, Dr. Sinha admitted she did not have the benefit of a toxicological report and could not say what type of drug, if any Lewis had injected, although she noted that heroin was the most common drug to inject.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">In summation defense counsel argued to the jury that Lewis may have been under the influence of drugs which may have affected her behavior. However, at a later point in his summation when he said \u201cand she, with the drug in her\u2014,\u201d the prosecutor objected. The trial judge sustained the objection and advised the jury that \u201cthere is no proof that I heard that there was drugs in the body of Magda Lewis. All we have is testimony that there was a fresh puncture wound. Whether that is an appropriate piece of evidence to lead to a reasonable inference is up to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The prosecutor in his summation referred to the defense theory that Lewis had injected drugs and pointed out that \u201cDr. Sinha told you there is no toxicological report that shows that.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>He then proceeded to discredit the idea that Lewis could have cocked the gun the second time even if she had been on drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In ruling on the motion for a new trial, the trial judge concluded that the toxicological report, which showed that Lewis had several types of drugs in her blood at the time of her death, constituted evidence which was \u201cpotentially material.\u201d He was satisfied that it was evidence which was not available to defendant at the time of trial. On the issue of whether the new evidence would probably change the jury verdict, the judge reviewed the evidence and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">Drugs were in the case. Credibility was before the jury. Certainly the drugs as I referred to them were not in the case with the precision that they should have been. But having all that it did before them, including the defendant\u2019s admissions, his conduct after the act, the operability factor of the gun, would the fact that there were drugs in the system of the victim and would testimony as to the amount and the effect of the actual drugs in the victim\u2019s body have probably altered the guilty verdict? I think not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">... There was independent testimony that the shots were discharged in relative rapid succession, within five or ten seconds of each other. There was also a description that the second shot came immediately after the first shot. There was a scream after the first shot. The shot went through the chest into the heart ventricles and aorta and this militates against any reasonable conclusion that the victim herself shot the second bullet after pulling the hammer and after being struck in the chest with that type of wound. And all within seconds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\"><em>State v. Carter, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>300, 314 (1981) establishes a three-pronged test for determining when a new trial is to be granted based on newly discovered evidence: \u201cthe new evidence must be (1) material to the issue and not merely cumulative or impeaching or contradictory; (2) discovered since the trial and not discoverable by reasonable diligence beforehand; and (3) of the sort that would probably change the jury\u2019s verdict if a new trial were granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">We agree with the trial judge that it is highly improbable that the toxicological report would have altered the jury\u2019s verdict. Also, the evidence presented at trial is cumulative. The jury was permitted to infer that the presence of fresh needle marks indicated recent injections of drugs, probably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>heroin. The jury\u2019s verdict was most likely based on its rejection of the defense theory that the shooting was accidental. The defense theory was rendered implausible by evidence that the gun had to be cocked and required four and one-half pounds of pressure to pull the trigger and that it was unlikely that Lewis shot herself because one bullet entered her left chest and exited the right shoulder and the other entered her skull from the back of the head. Defendant\u2019s case was also undermined by his admissions to his ex-wife and police that he shot Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">We have considered the other contentions raised in light of the record and find they are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). We note, however, that the nine month sentence for possession of handgun without a permit is an illegal sentence. The judge mistakenly assumed the offense was fourth degree. It is a third degree offense and the sentence must be fixed between three years and five years. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6a(3). The sentence must be corrected. <em>State v. Womack, </em>206 <em>N.J. Super. </em>564, 570 (App.Div.1985), certif. den. 103 <em>N.J. </em>482 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed except as to the sentence imposed on Count Three. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for resentencing on Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Affirmed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\"><em>Miranda v.
