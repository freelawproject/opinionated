Defendant was then unemployed. He moved back to Tennessee where his parents lived. He failed to gain reemployment and fell far behind in his support payments. The amounts of arrears owed by him were twice reduced to judgment in this State upon plaintiff\u2019s motions to enforce litigant\u2019s rights, both times with defendant represented or participating <em>pro se: </em>a $5,768.63 judgment in April 1984 and a $6,300 judgment in April 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s complaint under URESA, dated September 1985, was transmitted to Knox County, Tennessee, where defendant resided. The Assistant District Attorney of Knox County represented plaintiff. The Circuit Court Judge, after reciting that \u201cthe State and the Defendant were now in agreement as to the appropriate findings of fact and the appropriate relief to be granted,\u201d reduced defendant\u2019s \u201ccurrent ongoing support obligation\u201d to $30 per week, reduced the total arrears then owed to $4,639.63 with a credit or off-set to defendant \u201cdue to a period of diminished ability to pay support during unemployment,\u201d and ordered defendant to pay an additional $10 per week towards the accumulated arrears.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Subsequently, in July 1986 and November 1986, the Chancery Division, Family Part in this State entered orders enforcing defendant's support obligation of $150 per week under the divorce judgment and fixing the total arrears owed by him at $38,000<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, notwithstanding the Tennessee URESA order. Appeal is brought from the November 1986 order, which obligated defendant to convey by deed to plaintiff his one-half interest in the former marital home in full satisfaction of all his \u201cdebts and liabilities\u201d to plaintiff as of that date. There is no cross-appeal by plaintiff from the valuation of the parties\u2019 net equity in the former marital home at $76,000, although at oral argument plaintiff\u2019s attorney suggested that valuation was too high.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument mistakes the URESA legislative scheme of nonsupersession. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4-30.53 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">A support order made by a court of this state pursuant to this act does not nullify and is not nullified by a support order made by a court of this State pursuant to any other law or by a support order made by a court of any other state pursuant to a substantially similar act or any other law, regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>priority of issuance, unless otherwise specifically provided by the court. Amounts paid for a particular period pursuant to any support order made by the court of another state shall be credited against the amounts accruing or accrued for the same period under any support order made by the court of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The comparable nonsupersession provision in Tennessee, <em>Tenn.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 36-5-226, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">Any order of support issued by a court of this state when acting as a responding state shall not supersede any previous order of support issued in a divorce or separate maintenance action, but the amounts for a particular period paid pursuant to either order shall be credited against amounts accruing or accrued for the same period under both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">According to <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>472 <em>F.Supp. </em>14, 16 (E.D.Tenn.1979), aff\u2019d w.o. op., 659 F.2d 1083 (6th Cir.1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">The Reciprocal Enforcement statute, Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 36-901 <em>et seq., </em>under which Cecelia Stephens appeared before the Fourth Circuit Court, simply does not empower a Tennessee court to render void the valid orders of a foreign jurisdiction. See <em>Hester v. Hester, </em>59 <em>Tenn.App. </em>613, 443 <em>S.</em>W.2d 28 (1968). Pursuant to the Act, a Tennessee court may modify a foreign support judgment for the limited purposes of its own enforcement, see <em>Koehler v. Koehler, </em>559 S.W.2d 944 (Tenn.Ct.App.1977), but such action by the court does not affect the underlying validity of the foreign decree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Concurring that the order of a responding state, such as Tennessee on the appeal before us, may modify a support judgment or order of an initiating state solely for the purpose of enforcement in the responding state, without affecting the validity or enforceability of that judgment or order in the initiating state which entered it: <em>Sheres v. Engelman, </em>534 <em>F.Supp. </em>286 (S.D.Texas, 1982); <em>Armstrong v. Armstrong, </em>83 <em>Ill.App.2d </em>1062, 39 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>417, 404 <em>N.E.2d </em>1008 (App.Ct.1980); <em>Nichols v. Bardua, </em>74 <em>A.D.2d </em>566, 424 <em>N.</em>Y.S.2d 288 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">A factual complication on this appeal is that the Tennessee court not only reduced defendant\u2019s support obligation <em>in futuro </em>but also reduced the amount of arrears owed by him, notwithstanding the entry of two judgments for arrears in this State which were entitled to full faith and credit in Tennessee. The Tennessee order recites an agreement between defendant and the Assistant District Attorney representing plaintiff to fix the arrears at a substantially lesser figure than the total of the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>judgments. That agreement would be effective, if at all, solely, for the purpose of enforcement in Tennessee. Under the legislative scheme of nonsupersession, the arrears under this State\u2019s support order of $150 per week were not vacated by the Tennessee order but remained an enforceable liability, subject to a credit for amounts paid by defendant pursuant to the Tennessee order.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\">That figure includes interest on the arrears at 12%; a differential of $3,300 in the value of the car plaintiff received and the value of the car defendant was ordered under the divorce judgment to turn over to her; and a counsel fee of $5,000 together with interest at 12%, which plaintiff would become obligated to pay upon the conveyance to her of defendant\u2019s one-half interest in the former marital home.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
