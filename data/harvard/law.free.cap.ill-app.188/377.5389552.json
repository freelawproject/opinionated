Pleading, \u00a7 466<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when defective count in declaration sufficient after verdict.

Railroads, \u00a7 583*\u2014when evidence of wanton or toilful negligence sufficient to go to fury. In an action against a railroad company to recover for the death of a pedestrian alleged to have been struck by one of defendant\u2019s through trains while the deceased was attempting to cross defendant\u2019s tracks near its depot, evidence held sufficient to go to the jury on the question whether the defendant was guilty of wanton and willful negligence, it appearing that at the place where deceased attempted to cross the tracks the defendant had constructed a cinder path leading up to its tracks, and that the engine was running at a high and dangerous rate of speed, without a headlight or a hell being rung.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b399-6\" pgmap=\"399\">3.

In an action against a railroad company to recover for the death of a pedestrian alleged to have been caused by being struck by one of defendant\u2019s trains while deceased was attempting to cross defendant\u2019s railroad tracks, an instruction directing the jury to find for plaintiff if they believed from the evidence that the defendant carelessly and negligently operated its train in the manner and form as charged in the declaration and that such negligence amounted to wanton and wilful negligence, held erroneous as not confining the jury to a count in the declaration in which wanton and wilful negligence was charged and also objectionable as not stating the facts that constitute wanton and wilful negligence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b399-8\" pgmap=\"399(67) 400(31)\">5.

In an action for death resulting from wrongful act, an instruction stating that the plaintiff is not required \u201cto furnish, in the proofs, any definite or specific basis for the computation of, said damages, hut that such question is for the jury to determine as practical men according to the evidence and all the facts and circumstances proven in the case,\u201d held objectionable as not limiting the pecuniary injuries resulting to the widow and next of kin, and the giving of the instruction held reversible error.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
