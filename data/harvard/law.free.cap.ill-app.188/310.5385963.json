In an action hy a wife for damages resulting from her husband\u2019s intoxication produced by a sale of liquor to him by the defendants, where the declaration alleged that the husband died of delirium tremens, held that there was evidence tending to show that he died of such affliction, where it was undisputed that he was in a highly delirious state and was seeing and doing things commonly supposed to attend an attack of delirium tremens; but also held that under such conditions it was immaterial \u2022whether the delirium was properly named in the declaration or not, the proofs plainly showing a case in which plaintiff was entitled to recover.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\" pgmap=\"330\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Marion county; the Hon.
