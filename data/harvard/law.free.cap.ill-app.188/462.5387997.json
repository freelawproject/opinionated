Giesenschlag and others on an appeal bond. In a suit for an accounting between Marcus Sachs and Simon Sachs, copartners, a money decree in favor of the former was entered, and in default of payment thereof a receiver was appointed to hold the property until sold and disposed of under the orders of the court. An appeal taken by Simon Sachs from the decree having been dismissed, this suit was brought upon the appeal bond.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-5\" pgmap=\"483\">To the cause of action it was pleaded below that the receiver took possession of property belonging to Simon Sachs sufficient in value to pay the decree, costs and interest, and that said decree gave plaintiff a first lien thereon. From a judgment entered against the defendant Charles F. Giesenschlag, one of the sureties on the bond, he appeals.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-6\" pgmap=\"483\">It is contended on appeal that the possession of the receiver under the circumstances was a satisfaction sub modo the same as a levy by virtue of an execution on property sufficient to satisfy the judgment upon which it is issued.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b483-8\" pgmap=\"483\">Charles Daniels and Sumner C.
