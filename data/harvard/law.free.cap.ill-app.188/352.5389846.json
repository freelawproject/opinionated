In an action to recover on an assignment of wages, a copy of a notice of the assignment claimed to have been served on the defendant by mail held properly excluded, for the reason there was no proper foundation laid for its introduction, where there was no evidence offered to show that the copy of the notice was inclosed in an envelope directed to defendant with a proper amount of postage thereon and deposited in a place for the receiving of United States mail.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b373-6\" pgmap=\"373\">3.
