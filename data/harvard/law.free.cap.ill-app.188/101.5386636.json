In an action to recover attorneys\u2019 fees permitting plaintiff to testify as to the value of services which had been rendered and paid for under an express contract, and permitting him to testify that a claim was made for further compensation for the services and that defendant had made an offer to give $1,500, held error, for the reason that defendant had settled for such services and that the offer to pay a further sum was a promise to malte a gift for which there was no consideration.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-9\" pgmap=\"122\">2. Attorney and client, \u00a7 127*\u2014when amount of compensation not excessive. In an action for attorneys\u2019 fees, a verdict for $1,750 held not excessive where the amount involved was large, and the questions in issue were bitterly contested and a clear preponderance of the evidence would have justified a larger verdict.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-10\" pgmap=\"122\">3.

In an action to recover attorneys\u2019 fees, the admission of impropper evidence which was afterwards excluded, held not prejudicial as influencing the jury to allow an excessive verdict where it appears that the jury on a consideration of the proper evidence could not have returned a verdict for a less amount.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-4\" pgmap=\"122\">Stone, Oglevee &amp; Franklin, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-5\" pgmap=\"122\">Herrick &amp; Herrick, for defendant in error.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b122-11\" pgmap=\"122\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
