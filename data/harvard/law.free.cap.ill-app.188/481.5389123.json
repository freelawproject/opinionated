Butler against George Kirby, Helena C. Kirby (wife of George Kirby) and William Muhlenfeld to set aside a conveyance. The bill alleged, inter alia, that on November 13, 1912, Butler recovered a judgment in the Municipal Court of Chicag'o against said George Kirby in the sum of $1,598.59, upon which execution was issued and returned unsatisfied; that previous to the rendition of said judgment George Kirby was the owner of an undivided one-half interest, as joint tenant with said Helena C. Kirby, in certain premises in Cook county; that on February 2, 1912, previous to the rendition of said judgment but after the indebtedness upon which the same was rendered had accrued, Helena C. Kirby and George Kirby, with the intention of defrauding complainant and other creditors of George Kirby out of their just demands, conveyed said premises to said William Muhlenfeld for the consideration of $10, and that on the same day said Muhlenfeld conveyed the premises for a like consideration to said Helena C. Kirby. \u2018 The bill prayed, inter alia, that as to the complainant said conveyances be set aside and declared null and void. The defendants, George Kirby and Helena C. Kirby, filed their joint and several answer, denying that complainant was entitled to the relief sought, and subsequently the case was heard by the chancellor in open court, resulting in the entry of a decree dismissing the bill for want of equity, from which decree this appeal is prosecuted.</p><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A8r9\" pgmap=\"502\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-9\" pgmap=\"502\">FsAtrDTrLENT conveyances, \u00a7 270<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence insufficient to show.
