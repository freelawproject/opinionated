From a judgment in favor of plaintiff for sixty-five hundred dollars, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\" pgmap=\"523\">The defendant contends on the record that the verdict and judgment on the issue of liability are manifestly contrary to the preponderance of the evidence; that the damages are grossly excessive on any theory of the injury; that plaintiff\u2019s counsel made many improper and incurably prejudicial statements on the trial; that the court erred in giving an improper instruction; and also erred in admitting incompetent evidence.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-6\" pgmap=\"523\">Charles LeRoy Brown, for appellant; Leonard A.
