O\u2019Byrne, executor of the estate of Jessie S. Donley, deceased, to recover money which the deceased had deposited in a bank and which plaintiff claims he is entitled to by virtue of a gift causa mortis. Plaintiff recovered a judgment for $1,924.04. To reverse the judgment, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-11\" pgmap=\"621(59) 622(54)\">The case was tried upon an agreed state of facts, in substance, that on November 13,1908, Jessie S. Donley had on deposit to her credit with the Citizens State Bank of Big Rapids, Michigan, the sum of $1,924.04; that on that day she had been informed that she was about to die and could not recover, and she believed she was about to die; that the plaintiff, Clark Aubrey, was her nephew and her only heir at law, except her husband, William E. Donley; that she did not then know the exact amount of money she had in the said bank and she thereupon, on said date, executed her check in these words:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-5\" pgmap=\"622\">\u201cNo.-Big Rapids, Mich., Nov. 13, 1908.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-6\" pgmap=\"622\">Citizens State Bank, Pay to Clark Aubrey or order $5,000 Dollars.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-7\" pgmap=\"622\">Jessie S.

Evidence, \u00a7 33<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014presumption in the absence of proof of the laws of another State. In the absence of any proof in support of a special plea averring the law of another State, it will be presumed that the common law prevails in that State and that the decisions of the courts of this State embody a correct exposition of the common law as it prevails in that State.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b623-5\" pgmap=\"623\">2. Banks and banking, \u00a7 126*\u2014when drawing of check operates as assignment of funds on deposit. Under the common law in this State the drawing of a check upon a banker by a drawer having funds in his bank operates as an assignment to the drawee of the legal title to so much of the fund on deposit as is named in the check, as between the drawer and drawee; but in order to charge the bank with the amount of the check, it is necessary that the check be presented for payment, or some other act equivalent thereto, and that it be shown that the drawer had at the time of presentment sufficient funds to pay the check.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b623-6\" pgmap=\"623\">3. Gifts, \u00a7 32*\u2014when delivery of check constitutes gift causa mortis of deposit. A delivery by a donor of a check for a greater sum than was on deposit in the bank with intent to transfer and deliver the deposit and no more, held to constitute a completed gift causa mortis of the amount of the deposit, and to entitle the donee to maintain an action against the executor to recover the same where the latter wrongfuly withdrew it from the bank.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b623-7\" pgmap=\"623\">4. Gifts, \u00a7 36*\u2014authority to revoke gift causa mortis. After a delivery of a gift causa mortis to the donee by the donor, and after the death of the donor without revoking the gift, the legal representatives and heirs have no power or authority to revoke the gift.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
