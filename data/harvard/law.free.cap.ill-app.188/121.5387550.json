Railroads, \u00a7 696<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014sufficiency of declaration, in action for death of child in care of father. In an action for the death of a child who was killed at a highway crossing hy one of defendant\u2019s trains while riding in a buggy with her father, failure of the declaration to allege the age of the deceased child, how and with whom she was riding, and that the father was in the exercise of due care, held not to render the declaration insufficient to sustain a verdict on account of variance between its allegations and the proof, since the child\u2019s age, how and with whom she was riding are simply evidentiary facts which need not he pleaded, and any negligence of the father which might he imputed to the child was sufficiently negatived by the averment of due care and caution on her part, as such averment would also necessarily imply due care and caution on the part of the father.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b142-5\" pgmap=\"142\">2. Negligence, \u00a7 250*\u2014when giving of instruction requiring due care only on the part of child\u2019s father harmless. In an action for the death of a child while in care of its father, where the case was tried on defendant\u2019s theory of the law that the father was negligent and that his negligence was imputed to the child, the giving of a modified instruction requiring the exercise of due care on the part of the father and not requiring due care on the part of the deceased child, held harmless where all the evidence showed that the child was in the exercise of due care.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b142-6\" pgmap=\"142\">3. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1241*\u2014when adversary\u2019s instructions cannot he complained of. Appellant cannot complain that the court modified appellee\u2019s instructions to conform to the theory of the law as presented by his own instructions.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b142-7\" pgmap=\"142\">4. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1238*\u2014when appellant cannot complain of court\u2019s adoption of his theory of case.
