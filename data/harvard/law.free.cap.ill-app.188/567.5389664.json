Ebbert paid the rent for May, June and July, 1910, in cash, and thereafter until December 12, 1910, at his solicitation, the defendant accepted coal for the rent accruing to February 1, 1911. This coal was procured by Ebbert from Thos. W. Gfilmore &amp; Co. and delivered at the building. In the latter part of January, 1911, defendant directed Ebbert to fill up the basement of the building with coal, and Ebbert communicated this order to the bookkeeper or local manager of the plaintiff and plaintiff delivered the coal in question during February and March, 1911. During this time Robert F. Schenck, or Robert F. Schenck &amp; Co., were the rental agents of defendant for the apartment building, and the charges for the coal so delivered were entered upon the books of the plaintiff against R. F\u2019 Schenck &amp; Co., and the two invoices for said coal, bearing date March 1, 1911, and April 1, 1911, respectively, were made out as follows :</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-10\" pgmap=\"587\">\u201cSold to......................R.

In an action for the purchase price of coal delivered and consumed at defendant\u2019s apartment building, where defendant claimed that he directed a tenant in his building to procure the coal on his own credit under an agreement with him that he should pay his rent in coal, held that a finding that defendant was primarily liable for the coal was sustained by the evidence, it appearing that the tenant was not indebted to defendant at the time he ordered the coal and that the amount of the coal ordered was too great to apply on rents to become due, but held that the further finding that defendant was entitled to a deduction of a sum due him from the tenant for rent which accrued after the coal was ordered, could not be sustained for the reason there was no proof tending to show that plain- . tiff consented to or acquiesced in the allowance of the deduction.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-11\" pgmap=\"588(24) 589(43)\">2. Sales, \u00a7 285*\u2014what not an election to discharge person for whose benefit coal was purchased. The fact that a seller of coal gave credit in the first instance to an agent of the person to whom the coal was delivered and the fact that the plaintiff first commenced an action against the agent, held not conclusive of an election by the seller to discharge the principal.</headnotes><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b588-3\" pgmap=\"588\">Statements of the coal delivered were sent by the plaintiff to Schenck and by him were sent to the defendant. Ebbert vacated the apartment at the end of his term on May 1, 1911, without having paid the rent for February, March and April, amounting to $180.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b588-4\" pgmap=\"588\">Upon a trial of the cause by the court without a jury there was a finding and judgment against defendant for $499.11, the full amount of plaintiff\u2019s claim, less $180, being the amount of rent due from Ebbert to the defendant. To reverse this judgment, the defendant prosecutes a writ of error and the plaintiff assigns cross-errors questioning the propriety of the action of the court in allowing to defendant, as a credit upon plaintiff\u2019s claim, the rent due from Ebbert.</p><attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b588-5\" pgmap=\"588\">Robert B.
