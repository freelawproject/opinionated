In an action against a street railway company to recover for a malicious assault by defendant\u2019s conductor in ejecting plaintiff from one of its cars, plaintiff swore that she gave the conductor a transfer and she was corroborated as to such fact by another passenger who also swore that she told the conductor before ejecting plaintiff that she had paid her fare, and plaintiff also testified as to what said passenger told the conductor but the court struck out the testimony as hearsay evidence, held that the court erred in striking out the testimony for the reason it tended to show what information the conductor had before ejecting plaintiff, and was material and direct evidence bearing on the question of malice and the character of his subsequent conduct.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
