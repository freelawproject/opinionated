These lands, together with others, were incumbered with mortgages. After the bill of sale was executed and delivered, the agreement above set out was executed. Plaintiff began to remove timber from the land and cut timber therefrom for nearly a year, when a bill was filed to foreclose the mortgage and plaintiff was enjoined from removing any timber from the premises. Plaintiff procured a modification of the injunction to the extent of permitting him to remove from the premises the timber remaining thereon which had been cut. The case was tried before the court, without a jury, who found the issues in favor of plaintiff and assessed his damages at $2,522.70. This amount includes the original purchase price together with interest thereon, the attorney\u2019s fees and expenses paid by plaintiff in procuring the modification of the injunction in the foreclosure suit.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"APdW\" pgmap=\"166\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-9\" pgmap=\"166\">1.
