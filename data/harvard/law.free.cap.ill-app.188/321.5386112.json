Mines and minerals, \u00a7 148<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014burden of proof in suit for death of miner. In an action against a mining company to recover for the death of a miner resulting from the fall of a stone from the roof of a mine, held under the averments of the declaration the burden was upon the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the deceased while in the exercise of due care and caution was injured by defendant\u2019s failure to use reasonable care to furnish deceased with a reasonably safe place to work; that at the time of the accident he was acting under and in obedience to a special order; that the danger was known to defendant or could have been known by the exercise of reasonable care; that deceased did not know of the danger and that he was free from the negligence which contributed to the injury.</headnotes><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b342-5\" pgmap=\"342\">All of said counts charged that the deceased while he was in the exercise of due care was killed hy and through the negligence of defendant to the damage of the plaintiff in the sum of ten thousand dollars.

Mines and minerals, \u00a7 173*\u2014when recovery for death of miner not sustained by the evidence. In an action against a mining company to recover for the death of a miner resulting from\" the fall of a rock from the roof of a mine, where the declaration alleged defendant was guilty of common-law negligence in failing to prop the roof, held that a verdict in favor of plaintiff could not be sustained for the reason that the .evidence showed that the deceased was not in the exercise of due care for his own safety, it appearing that deceased was taken from the place where he was injured to a place of safety and directed to keep out, and that he returned to the place he was injured in violation of the directions.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b343-6\" pgmap=\"343\">3. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1411*\u2014when verdict may be set aside. A verdict on conflicting testimony may be set aside as against the weight of the evidence where the verdict is based on the testimony of one witness, which was denied by three others, and all the circumstances and inferences to be drawn from the evidence corroborated the three witnesses.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b343-7\" pgmap=\"343\">4. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1802*\u2014when judgment may be reversed without remandment. Where a verdict upon which a judgment was entered is without sufficient evidence to support it and the case has been tried twice in the lower court, and it appears from the record that all the facts material to the issue have been brought forward to both parties and that a new trial would serve no good purpose, the case will he reversed with a finding of fact.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
