The suit was originally brought before a justice of the peace, from whose judgment an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court where plaintiffs had judgment. To reverse the judgment, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\" pgmap=\"351\">The facts show that Thomas Still owned the premises in his lifetime and that on his death devised the same to his wife, Ann Still; that the defendant at the time of the death of Thomas Still was occupying the premises and had occupied them for twenty-five years prior thereto under some arrangement, and that after the probate of the will continued to occupy them; that Ann Still.brought a forcible detainer suit against him for possession and rent and recovered a judgment; that afterwards the defendant desiring to keep the farm agreed upon a settlement of the judgment and his mother, Ann Still, executed a lease to him for a year, which failed to properly describe the land; that defendant paid one-half the rent and refused to surrender possession at the end of the year, whereupon this suit was brought.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-6\" pgmap=\"351\">Defendant urges as ground for reversal: First, that the lease was procured by threats and intimidation; second, that the description in the lease does not describe the land occupied by defendant; and third, that Ann Still never had possession or the right of possession to the premises in controversy.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-7\" pgmap=\"351\">John J.

Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 42*\u2014when lease not avoided by threats or intimidation. To avoid a lease on the ground it was procured by threats or intimidations, the threats or intimidation must be present and operative at the time of signing the instrument and such as to destroy the complaining party\u2019s free agency and make his act not his own but the act of another.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b352-5\" pgmap=\"352\">2. Forcible entry and detainer, \u00a7 24*\u2014when misdescription in lease no defense. A misdescription of the premises in a lease is properly explained as a mistake and will not defeat recovery in an action of forcible detainer, where the tenant says the premises he occupied were the same as involved in the suit.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b352-6\" pgmap=\"352\">3. Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 132*\u2014when tenant estopped to deny landlord\u2019s title or right to possession. A tenant who has taken a lease and paid rent to the lessor as landlord is estopped from either questioning his title or right to possession so long as he remains his tenant.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
