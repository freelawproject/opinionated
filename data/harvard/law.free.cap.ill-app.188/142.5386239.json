A verdict was rendered finding defendant guilty and assessing plaintiff\u2019s damages at $3,545. To reverse a judgment entered on the verdict, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-6\" pgmap=\"163\">The declaration consists of four counts. The first, third and fourth charge defendant with common-law negligence. The second count is predicated upon the wilful violation of section 21, paragraph \u201ca\u201d of the Mines and Miners\u2019 Act of 1907 (corresponding section of Act of 1911, J. &amp; A. 7489), which was in force at the time of the injury. The second count, in substance, charges that on February 4, 1911, the defendant was operating the coal mine in question and plaintiff was in the employ of defendant as a coal digger; that in the performance of his duties it was necessary for him in going to and from his work t\u00f3 pass through the second southeast main entry in said mine, which was used as a single track haulage road on which the trains of pit cars were moved by machinery; that plaintiff and others traveled on foot to and from their work through said entry; that defendant wilfully failed to cut in the said walls of said haulage road places of refuge not less than three feet in depth, four feet wide and five feet high and not more than twenty yards apart, or to provide a clear place of at least three feet between the sides of the cars traveling on said haulage road and the side of the road; that while traveling on foot to his work in said entry a train of cars, or trip, struck him by reason of defendant\u2019s wilful failure to comply with the statute and plaintiff was unable to escape from said cars or trip and was crushed between the same and the side of the entry and had his hip broken and was otherwise permanently injured. The defendant filed the plea of general issue to all the counts.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A9I\" pgmap=\"164\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-8\" pgmap=\"164\">1.

Evidence held to show that a posted rule of the mining company prohibiting employees to travel on a haulage road of the mine had abandoned and was not in force at the time of an injury to an employee, where it was the habit of the employees to walk to and from work through the haulage way and the company itself had abandoned the rule.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-11\" pgmap=\"164(57) 165(46)\">4. Mines and minebals, \u00a7 181*\u2014when question whether violation of Miners Act was proximate cause of injury is for jury. In an action by a miner to recover for personal injuries alleged to have resulted from a wilful failure of defendant to provide places of refuge in compliance with paragraph \u201ca\u201d of section 21 of the Mines and Miners\u2019 Act of 1907 (corresponding section of Act of 1911, J. &amp; A. If 7489), hel\u00f3 under the facts of the case that the question whether the violation of the statute was the proximate cause of the injury was a question for the jury.</headnotes><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b164-3\" pgmap=\"164\">It is conceded that at the time of the accident no places of refuge were constructed and maintained in this haulage way as required by section 21 of the statute, and that there was not a clear space of three feet wide on either side of the entry between the sides of the cars and the entry, but it is contended that the failure to provide said place of refuge was not the proximate cause of the injury.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-4\" pgmap=\"164\">Charles Troup, for appellant; Mastin &amp; Sherlock, of counsel.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-5\" pgmap=\"164\">Thomas A.
