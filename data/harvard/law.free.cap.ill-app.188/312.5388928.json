Hahn against Pauline Schnell and Carlyle Schnell in trespass. The declaration charged the defendants with turning on the dwelling Louse of plaintiff and into the open doors and windows thereof large streams of water with great force and violence thereby injuring the plaintiff, disturbing his peace of mind and damaging his property. There was a plea of not guilty and a verdict in favor of plaintiff for nine hundred dollars followed by a judgment for a like amount. To reverse the judgment, Pauline Schnell alone appeals.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-10\" pgmap=\"332\">The facts show that Pauline Schnell owned the house in which the plaintiff was living as a tenant at Carlyle, Illinois; that there had been some difficulty over the rent and that she and her son, Carlyle Schnell, resided in Missouri. The son and the mother returned to Carlyle and the son had a conversation with'one Shade and one Thalls about a little job he wanted done. They went into a saloon and after taking several drinks Shade and Thalls agreed to \u201ctake the chance,\u201d and on the night in question secured a hose from the city hose house and attached it to a city hydrant near where plaintiff resided and the three men directed the hose towards the windows causing a dirty stream of water to be thrown into the house.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-11\" pgmap=\"332(18) 333(17)\">Appellant claims that the proofs failed to show she was in any way connected with the offense complained of; that there was error in. plaintiff\u2019s third instruction and in the courts ruling on certain evidence.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\" pgmap=\"333\">The third instruction complained of is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\" pgmap=\"333\">\u201cThe court further instructs that if you believe from a preponderance of the evidence in this case that David Shade and Thomas Thalls wilfully and maliciously entered the premises occupied by the plaintiff in the nighttime, and turned a stream of water from a hose, connected with the city hydrant, upon the dwelling house occupied by the plaintiff and through the open window of said house upon the person of the plaintiff, as charged in the declaration, and if you further believe, from the evidence, that said David Shade and Thomas Thalls were procured or employed to do said unlawful act by the defendant Carlyle Schnell, and that he stood by and aided and abetted them in the perpetration of the same, and if you further believe from the evidence that the defendant, Pauline Schnell, was the owner of the dwelling house in question, and that with a view of procuring possession of the same or forcing the plaintiff and his family to vacate the dwelling house, she was present or stood by and aided, abetted or encouraged the said Carlyle Schnell in the commission of said unlawful acts, or if you believe from the evidence that the said Pauline Schnell not being present had knowledge of what was about to be done, and had advised, encouraged, aided or abetted the said Carlyle Schnell to attempt to dispossess the plaintiff and secure possession of said dwelling house by the commission of the act done, then both the defendants, Carlyle Schnell and Pauline Schnell, are liable for the unlawful acts of the said David Shade and Thomas Thalls.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-6\" pgmap=\"333\">Ford &amp; Jones and William Johnston, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-7\" pgmap=\"333\">Noleman &amp; Smith and H.
