S., J. &amp; A. 9700, for the obstruction of a highway. The charge is that the defendants built a fence in the middle of the road covering one-half of the road and extending about three hundred feet parallel with the road, and that the defendants had been verbally notified, and the defendant Fred Weber notified in writing, to remove the obstruction. It further appeared that the defendants had promised to remove the obstruction in ten days, but that they had failed to do so.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-10\" pgmap=\"425\">The case was tried before a jury and a verdict was returned finding the defendants not guilty.
