Weinstein against Pete Garcinski, to recover the sum of $100 claimed to be due from defendant to plaintiff. The claim arose out of a transaction regarding checks received by plaintiff from defendant. It appeared that defendant brought a number of checks which he had cashed for other parties to plaintiff\u2019s place of business and told the plaintiff that he needed more funds to cash checks and that the plaintiff took the checks, which he claims amounted to $452.45, and defendant claims amounted to $552.37; that plaintiff gave to defendant at that time $300 in cash; that later the wife of defendant called for the balance and plaintiff informed her that he had not obtained the cash on the checks and at her request gave her $245.12 in checks and $7.33 in cash. Plaintiff claims the understanding was that she was to return and pay him in cash the sum of $100, but this is denied by defendant.</p><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A3M\" pgmap=\"374\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-10\" pgmap=\"374\">1. Evidence, \u00a7 390<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when question ashed of party not objectionable as calling for conclusion. In. an action to recover a certain sum claimed to be due to plaintiff from defendant, where the defendant was permitted to be asked the question, \u201cDo you owe plaintiff anything now?\u201d and defendant answered, \u201cI don\u2019t owe one penny,\u201d held that the question was' not objectionable as calling for a conclusion of the witness on the issue, since it is proper for defendant as a party to the suit to deny the claim of plaintiff in as broad terms as the plaintiff made his claim.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-11\" pgmap=\"374\">2. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1523*\u2014when error in instruction will not reverse.

Appeal and error, \u00a7 1401*\u2014when verdict will not be disturbed. The Appellate Court will not set aside a verdict on the ground that the jury have reached a wrong conclusion as to the facts or a different conclusion than that entertained by the court, unless the record shows that the verdict is against the clear preponderance of the evidence.</headnotes><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b374-5\" pgmap=\"374\">The suit was originally commenced before a justice of the peace and plaintiff had judgment.
