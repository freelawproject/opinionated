There was a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $300, but a remittitur was ejntered by plaintiff and judgment was given for $213.60.

The last amended declaration filed omitted the former allegations of negligence and in lieu thereof charged that a servant of defendant negligently dropped or threw the end of a rope from the top of a telegraph pole or electric light pole.</p><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aqrt\" pgmap=\"312\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-10\" pgmap=\"312\">1.
