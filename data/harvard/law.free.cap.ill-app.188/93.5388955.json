Bastards, \u00a7 34*\u2014when instruction as to effect of change of name of relatrix properly refused. In a prosecution for bastardy where it appeared the relatrix had procured a divorce under a different name, the refusal of a requested instruction telling the jury that if they believed such was her correct name they should find the defendant not guilty, held not error, where the evidence shows that she was known under the name in which she made the complaint, that she was known by such name and the proof corresponded with the complaint.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b114-6\" pgmap=\"114\">5.
