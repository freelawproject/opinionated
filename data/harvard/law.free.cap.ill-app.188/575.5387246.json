Koch, John A. Bichert and Arnold Brautigam, trading as Koch &amp; Company, against John H. Suderwski. Plaintiffs filed a declaration consisting of the common counts, and attached thereto their affidavit of claim. Plaintiffs also filed a bill of particulars. Defendant filed an affidavit of merits and a verified claim of set-off, to which plaintiff pleaded the general issue, accord and satisfaction and the Five-Year Statute of Limitations. A jury was impaneled and before the introduction of any evidence, and again at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence and at the close of all the evidence, plaintiffs called the attention of the court to the fact that defendant had neither pleaded the general issue nor replied to plaintiffs \u2019 pleas of accord and satisfaction and the statute of limitations filed to defendant\u2019s plea of set-off. The trial court overruled plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a peremptory instruction upon the pleadings filed and submitted the case to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for defendant on his plea of set-off and assessed his damages against plaintiffs at $245. To reverse a judgment entered on the verdict, plaintiffs appeal.</p><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AeC\" pgmap=\"596\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-8\" pgmap=\"596\">Pleading, \u00a7 462<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when rule that proceeding to trial waives nonjoinder of issues inapplicable.
