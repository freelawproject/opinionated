Franke to recoyer the sum of twenty-five hundred dollars deposited by plaintiff with defendant pursuant to the terms of a lease. Plaintiff on March 11, 1912, leased certain premises of defendant for a term ending February 28, 1917, at a rental , of three hundred and fifty dollars per month.

To reverse the judgment, defendant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AOou\" pgmap=\"478\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-9\" pgmap=\"478\">1.
