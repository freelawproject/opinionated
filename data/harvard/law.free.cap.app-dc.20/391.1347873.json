Roberts, and the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of the- District, where the appeal was tried <em>de novo </em>before a .jury.

Barton Key has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">This motion to dismiss is controlled and must abide the decision just made by this court in the case of <em>Groff </em>v. <em>Miller (ante, </em>p. 353), in which it is held that section 82 of the new code is in full force and operation, and not nullified by section 226 of the code.
