The first paragraph of the petition for removal fully meets, as we believe, all the requirements of these decisions, even though they do require a law of constitutional amendment to justify the removal.

The passions thus created have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>since that time been stimulated and fed by the political contests which have since followed, and are still in existence, in this county and Bourbon County. Affiant says that, at a special term of this court in July, 1900, he was put on trial in this county, charged with being an accessory before the fact to the killing of said William Goebel, and was by the jury found guilty. From the judgment of the court at that term, the affiant appealed to the Appellate Court, the appeal being taken in the eferly part of September in said year; that at the subsequent October term of said court, jury commissioners for this county were selected whose duty it was to select a large number of-names and place them in the jury wheel for service during the year 1901.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The three commissioners appointed were John Bradford, Ben Mallory and H. H. Haggard, all three of whom were partisan supporters and allies, in the contest referred to, of the said William Goebel, deceased. The said jury commissioners discharged the work assigned to them by placing in said jury wheel the names of two hundred citizens of Scott County for purposes of said jury service; that at the February term, 1901, of the Circuit Court of this county and at the May term of the said year, seventy-five or more names were drawn from the jury wheel for said service; that at the' present term there were drawn from the said jury wheel for the purpose of securing a jury in this case about one hundred and twenty-five names, that being the entire number of names placed in the wheel. Affiant further states that at the regular state election of 1900, in the county of Scott, there were cast for the Democratic candidate, in round numbers, 2,500 votes, and for the Republican candidate 2,100 votes; that of these 2,100 votes not less than 1,300 were white voters of equal character, standing and intelligence with the white voters who cast their votes for the Democratic party at said election.</p>\n<p id=\"AqK\">Affiant says that, despite these conditions, which were shown to exist in this county, that of the 200 names placed in the jury wheel by the aforesaid commissioners and drawn out as herein described, only five were supporters of the Republican party, and the other 195 being active partisan friends and supporters of the party with which William Goebel was identified as its leader and whose minds and passions had .been inflamed against this affiant by continued political agitation.</p>\n<p id=\"AzV\">The affiant further says that of the five Republicans whose names were placed in the jury wheel for jury service by said commissioners, as before stated, one man was drawn for service at the February term of this court, 1901, and another at the May term; of the remaining three, two of them at the present term disqualified themselves herein by previously formed opinions, and the fifth and last, after qualification and acceptance on the <em>voir dire, </em>was peremptorily challenged by the Commonwealth. The affiant says that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>it will be impossible under these circumstances for him to avoid being tried at this term of this court except by a jury composed entirely of his political opponents and exclusively made up of those who were the adherents and admirers of said Goebel, and it will be impossible for him to' obtain a fair and impartial trial before any jury so constituted and formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The affiant further states that the officers of this county who went to Bourbon County to summon the men for jury service sent directly to the sheriff of Bourbon County, who, together with his deputies, were earnest and ardent adherents, supporters and friends of the said William Goebel and opposed politically to this affiant; that the officers of this county consulted and advised with the said officers of Bourbon County as to the selection of the men summoned, and that Wallace Mitchell, deputy sheriff of said county; James Burke, another deputy sheriff of said county; Joseph Williams; a constable of Bourbon County, and James A. Gibson, a guard for county prisoners in Bourbon County, all of whom are the political adherents of said Goebel and politically opposed to this affiant, acted with them in making the selection and summoning said men.</p>\n<p id=\"Azp\">He says that the political complexion of Bourbon is almost equally Democratic and Republican, there being a slight majority in favor of the Democratic party; that of the Republicans, about three-fifths are colored, but there are many conscientious; fair-minded and respectable citizens of Bourbon County, qualified for jury service, of the same political faith of this affiant, a great many of whom could have been as readily and conveniently summoned and who would give to both sides herein a fair and impartial trial; but that none of such persons were summoned with the exception of two men, and with these exceptions 91 of the 93 names appearing upon the list furnished this affiant as a correct list of the men summoned from Bourbon County are the names of the supporters and adherents of said Goebel, and opposed politically to this affiant, and were summoned for jury service herein by reason of such fact, as this affiant believes.</p>\n<p id=\"At\">Affiant further states that said Wallace Mitchell, the deputy sheriff of Bourbon County is now a candidate for sheriff of said county, seeking an election at the hands of the supporters and adherents of said William Goebel, and is their nominee for said office. Said Mitchell, in the fall of 1900, acted in summoning for jury service in this court in the case of the <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Youtsey, </em>indicted for the same offense of this affiant, and in making the selection of men to serve as jurors therein, made the statement that he would not summons a single Brown Democrat or Republican for such service, and he did not summons any such.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b46-9\">Mr. Justice Harlan,</author>\n<p id=\"A3\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Powers, the accused, was indicted in the Circuit Court of Franklin County, Kentucky, for the crime of having been an accessory before the fact to the murder of William Goebel, who was assassinated in that county on the thirtieth day of January, 1900. Thp prosecution was removed by change of venue to the Circuit Court of Scott County. In the latt\u00e9r court the accused was found guilty and his punishment fixed by the jury at confinement in the state penitentiary for life. Upon appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky the judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>110 Kentucky, 386.

Upon appeal, that judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>114 Kentucky, 239. A third trial occurred, which resulted in a verdict of guilty, with the punishment fixed at death. This judgment was also reversed and the case sent back for a new trial. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>83 S. W. Rep. 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">When the case came on for trial the fourth time the accused tendered and offered to file in the state court his petition praying, upon grounds therein stated (and which appear in the above statement) that the prosecution be removed for trial into the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Kentucky. 'But the state court would not allow the petition to be filed. Subsequently, a partial transcript of the record was filed in the Federal court, and the case was docketed in that court. The Commonwealth objected to the filing of the transcript from the state court and to the docketing of the case in the Federal court, and moved to vacate the order of filing and docketing, That motion was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Thereupon the accused, by his counsel, presented to the Federal court an application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>in order that he might be discharged from the custody of the state authorities. For the reasons set forth in the opinion of that court the application was granted and a writ ordered to issue commanding the jailer of Scott County, who held the accused in custody for the State, to deliver him into the custody of the marshal of the Federal court, which was done, that officer being directed to keep the accused confined in the county jail of Camp.bell County, Kentucky, until th\u00e9 further order of the Federal court. <em>Commonwealth v. Powers, </em>139 Fed. Rep. 452. From-that order the Commonwealth of Kentucky has prosecuted the above appeal (No. 393), the sole ground of such appeal being that the Federal court was without jurisdiction to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>order allowing the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>and taking the accused from the custody of the state authorities. The accused has moved to dismiss the appeal because the remedy of th\u00e9. Commonwealth was by a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The Commonwealth also asked leave to file a petition for mandamus to compel the Federal court to remand the case to the state court and to restore the custody of the accused to the state authorities. Leave to file was granted and the Federal judge, having made his return, submitted the rule upon th\u00e9 record of the case, including the opinion filed by the court below when the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>was awarded to take the accused from the custody of the state authorities. \u2022 This is case No. 15, Original.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The fundamental question to be determined is whether the removal of this criminal prosecution from the state court into the Federal court was authorized by any statute of the United States. We say, by any statute, because the subordinate judicial tribunals of the United States can exercise only such jurisdiction, civil and criminal, as may be authorized by acts of Congress. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for this court, has said that \u201c courts which originate in the common law possess a jurisdiction which must be regulated by their common law, until some statute shall change their established principles; but courts which are created by written law, and whose jurisdiction is defined by writt\u00e9n law, cannot transcend that jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Ex parte Bollman &amp;c., </em>4 Cr. 75, 93; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>7 Cr. 32, 33; <em>Cary </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>3 How. 236, 245; <em>McIntire </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>7 Cr. 504, 506; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Eckford, </em>6 Wall. 484, 488; <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Sill, </em>8 How. 441, 449; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>137 U.

When any civil suit or criminal prosecution is com- - menced in any state court, for any cause whatsoever, agairist \u2022 any person <em>who is denied or cannot enforce in the judicial tribunals of the State, or in the part of the State where such suit or prosecution is pending, any right secured to him by any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the' jurisdiction of the United States, . . . </em>such suit or prosecution may upon the petition of such defendant, filed in said state, court at any time before, the trial or final hearing of the cause, stating the facts and verified by oath, be removed, for trial, into the next Circuit Court to be held in the district where it is pending. Upon the filing of such petition-all further proceedings in the state courts shall cease, and shall' not be resumed except as hereinafter provided. But all bail and other security given in such suit or prosecution shall continue in like force and effect as if the same had proceeded to final judgment and execution in the state court. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">\u201c Sec. 642. When all the acts necessary for the removal of any suit of prosecution, as provided in the preceding section, have been performed, and the defendant petitioning for such removal' is in actual custody on process issued by said state court, it shall be the duty of the clerk of. said Circuit Court to issue a writ of <em>habeas corpus cum causa, </em>and of the marshal, by virtue of said writ, to take the body of the defendant into his custody, to be dealt with in said Circuit Court according to law and'the orders of said court, or, in vacation, of any judge thereof; and the marshal shall file with or deliver to the clerk of said state court a duplicate copy of said. writ. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">The contention of the Commonwealth is that the decisions of this court wholly preclude the suggestion that section 641 authorized the removal of this case into the Federal court. In view of this contention we must see what has been heretofore decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Among the cases to which our attention has been called, the first one, in point of time, involving the construction of section 641, is <em>Ex parte Wells, </em>3 Woods, 128, 132, determined in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana,' Mr. Justice Bradley presiding. The accused there sought to remove the prosecution from the state court, upon the ground, among others, that such vindictive prejudice existed against them on the part of the law-making and law-administering authorities of the State that they would be denied their rights as citizens in the state court, as well as before any jury that might be impanelled therein under the then existing jury law of the State; consequently, they would not be able to enforce their rights in said court. It was also alleged that the state court and its officers had so manipulated the local law as to deprive the accused of an impartial jury, and that they would be deprived of the full and equal benefit of the laws and proceedings for the security of their persons. The court, having found that there was nothing in the constitution or laws of the State that was hostile to the equal rights of the accused, in any particular, said: \u201cThe allegations with regard to the manipulation of the law in- such manner as to secure a jury inimical to the petitioners, and with regard to the existence of a general prejudice against them in the minds of the court, the jurors, the officials and the people, are not within the purview of the statute authorizing a removal. The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees the equal benefit of the laws on which the present application is based, only prohibits state legislation violative of said right; it is not directed against individual infringements thereof. The civil rights bill of 1866 was broader in its scope, undertaking to vindicate those rights against individual aggression; but, still, only when committed under color of some \u2018law, statute, ordinance, regulation or custom/ And when that provision in this law, which is transferred to section 641 of the Revised Statutes, gave the right to remove to the United States courts a cause commenced in a -State court against a person who is denied or cannot enforce any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>of the rights secured by the act, it had reference to a denial of those rights or impediments to their enforcement, arising from some state law, statute, regulation or custom. It is only when some such <em>hostile state legislation </em>can be shown to exist, interfering with the party\u2019s right of defense, that he can have his. cause removed to the Federal court. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">In <em>Strauder </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>100 U. S. 303, 309, 312, which. was an indictment in a court of West Virgin\u00fc against a person of the African race for the crime of murder, the accused, before the trial commenced, presented his petition for the removal of the case into the United States court upon the ground that the laws of the State, in relation to both grand and petit juries, discriminated against colored citizens, because of their race, in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States. The petition for removal was denied, and The accused was forced to a trial in the state court, found guilty, and sentenced. That judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State, and the case was brought here upon writ of error. This court held the state statute to be unconstitutional, as making an illegal discrimination against negro\u00e9s, because of their race. After referring to. what was said in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>92 U. S. 214, to the effect that rights and immunities created by or dependent upon the Constitution of the United States can be protected by Congress, and that the form and manner of the protection may be such as Congress in the legitimate exercise of its legislative discretion shall provide, the court said: \u201cThere is express authority to protect the rights and immunities referred to in the Fourteenth Amendment, and to enforce observance of them by appropriate Congressional legislation. And one very efficient and appropriate mode of extending such protection and securing to a party the enjoyment of the right or immunity, is a law providing for the removal of his case from a state court, in -which the right is denied <em>by the state law, </em>into a Federal court, where it will be upheld. This is an ordinary mode of protecting rights and immunities conferred by the Federal Constitution and laws: Section 641 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>such a provision. \u201d Adverting to the act from which sections 1977 and 1978 of the Revised Statutes were taken the court further said: \u201cThis act puts in the form of a statute what had been substantially ordained by the constitutional amendment. It was a step towards enforcing the constitutional provisions. Section 641 was an advanced step, -fully warranted, we think, by the fifth section of the Fourteenth Amendment. \u201d Observe that this was the case of a state statute held to prevent the enforcement in the judicial tribunals of the State of rights secured to the accused by the Constitution of the United States. Upon that point this court said: \u201cThat the petition of the plaintiff' in error, filed by him in the state court before the trial of his case, made a case for removal into the Federal Circuit Court, under section 641, is very plain, if, by the constitutional amendment and section 1977 of the Revised'Statutes, he was entitled to immunity from discrimination against him in the selection of jurors, because of their color, as we have .endeavored to show that he was. It set forth sufficient facts to exhibit a denial of that immunity, and <em>a denial by the statute law of the State. </em>There was error, therefore, in proceeding to the trial of the indictment against him after his petition was filed, as also in overruling his challenge to the array of the jury, and in refusing to quash the panel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Rives, </em>100 U. S. 313, 321, which was an indictment in a court of Virginia against colored persons charged with the crime of murder, the accused moved that the venire, which was composed entirely of white men, should be modified so as to allow one-third of the jury to be composed of colored men. That motion was overruled. Thereupon the defendants, before the trial, sought by petition to have the prosecution removed into the Federal court, upon the ground that the right secured to them by the act of Congress providing for the equal civil rights of all citizens of the United States was denied to them in <em>the judicial tribunals of the county in which the prosecution was pending; </em>also, upon the ground that the grand jury finding the indictment had been organized in discrimination against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>colored race because of their race. The application to remove the case was denied, and the defendants were tried in the state court and convicted. The case at that stage of the trial was docketed, at the motion of the accused, in the Federal court, and upon writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>sued out from that court they were taken from the custody of the State and placed in the custody of the United States marshal. The Commonwealth of Virginia obtained from this court a rule against the judge of the Federal court to show cause why the accused should not be redelivered to the authorities of the State to be dealt with according to the laws of that Commonwealth. The judge made his return to the rule, averring that the indictments were removed into the Federal court by virtue of section 641 of the Revised Statutes. It is important to notice that there was no claim in that case that either the Constitution or laws of Virginia denied the civil rights of colored people or stood in the way of their enforcing the equal protection of the laws. The law, this court said, made no discrimination against them because of their color, nor any discrimination at all. And further, referring to the officer charged with the duty of selecting jurors, this court said: \u201cHe made himself liable to punishment at the instance of the State and under the laws of the United States. In'one sense, indeed, his act was the act of the State, and was prohibited by the constitutional amendment. But, <em>inasmuch as it was a criminal misuse of the state law, </em>it cannot be said to have been such a \u2018 denial or disability to enforce in the judicial tribunals of the State\u2019 the rights of colored men, <em>as is contemplated by the removal act. </em>Section 641. It is to be observed that act gives the right of removal only to a person\u2018who is denied, or eannot enforce, in the judicial tribunals of the State his equal civil rights. \u2019 And this is to appear before trial. <em>When a statute of the State </em>denies his right, or interposes a bar to his enforcing it, in the judicial tribunals, the presumption is fair that they will be controlled by it in their decisions; and in such a case a defendant may affirm on oath what is necessary for a removal. <em>Such a case </em>is clearly within the provisions of section 641. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>when a subordinate officer of the State, in violation of state law, undertakes to deprive an accused party of a right which the statute law accords to him, as in the case at bar, it can hardly be said that he is denied, or cannot enforce, \u2018 in the judicial tribunals of the State\u2019 the rights which belong to him. In such a case it ought to be presumed the court will redress the wrong. If the accused is deprived of the right, the final and practical denial will be in the judicial tribunal which tries the case, after the trial has commenced. If, as in this case, the subordinate officer, whose duty it is to select jurors, fails to discharge that duty in the true spirit of the law; if he excludes all colored men solely because they are colored; or if the sheriff to whom a <em>venire </em>is given, composed of both white and colored citizens, neglects to summon the colored jurors only be'cause they are \u25a0 colored; or if a clerk Whose duty it is'to take the twelve names from the box rejects all the colored jurors for the same reason\u2014 it can with no propriety be said the defendant\u2019s right is denied by the State and cannot be enforced in the judicial tribunals. The court will correct the wrong, will quash the indictment or the panel, or, if not, the error will be corrected in a superior court. <em>We cannot think such cases are within the provisions of sectioji </em>641. <em>Denials of equal rights \u25a0in the action of the judicial tribunals of the State are left to the revisory powers of this court. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The question as to the scope of section 641 of the Revised Statutes again arose in the subsequent cases of <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>103 U. S. 370, 386; <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>107 U. S. 110, 116; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>162 U. S. 565, 581, 584, and <em>Charley Smith </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>162 U. S. 592, 600. In each of these cases it was distinctly adjudged, in harmony with previous cases, that the words in section 641 \u2014 \u201cwho is denial or cannot enforce in the judicial tribunals of the State, or in the part of the State where such suit or prosecution is pending, any right secured to him by any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States \u201d \u2014 did not give the right of <em>removal, </em>unless \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the constitution or the laws of the State in which the criminal prosecution was pending denied or prevented the enforcement in the judicial tribunals of such State of the equal rights of the accused as secured by any law of the United States. Those cases, as did the prior ones, expressly held that there was no right of <em>removal </em>under section (141, where the alleged discrimination against the accused, in respect of his equal rights, was due to the illegal or corrupt acts of administrative officers, unauthorized by the constitution or laws of- the State, as interpreted by its highest court. For wrongs of that character the remedy, it was'held, is in the state court, and ultimately in the power of this co\u00fcrt, upon writ of error, to protect any right secured or granted to an accused by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and which has been denied to him in the highest court of the State in which the decision, in respect of that right, could be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>162 U. S. 565, 581, 584, the words of this court as to the scope- of section 641 were very emphatic. In . that ease there was <em>&amp; </em>conviction in a state court of a negro for the crime of murder, and in which one. of the questions, upon writ of error to the highest court of that State, was as to the action of the trial court in denying a petition for the removal of the prosecution to .the Federal court. This court, said: \"When the constitution and laws of a State, as interpreted by its highest judicial tribunal,\" do not stand in the way of the enforcement of rights secured equally to all citizens of the United States, the possibility that during the trial of a particular case the- state court may not respect and enforce the right to the equal protection of the laws, .constitutes no ground, under the statute, for <em>removing </em>the prosecution into the Circuit Court of the United States in advance of a trial. We may repeat here what was said in <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>namely, that in thus construing the statute 'we do not withhold from a party claiming that he is denied, or cannot enforce in the judicial tribunals of the State, his constitutional equality of civil rights, all opportunity of appealing to the courts of the United States for the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>dress of his wrongs. For if not entitled, under the statute, to the removal of the suit or prosecution, he may, when denied, in the subsequent proceedings of the state court, or in the execution of its judgment, any right, privilege or immunity given or secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, bring the case here for review.\u2019 We therefore held in <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Delaware </em>that Congress had not authorized a removal of the prosecution from the state court/ where jury commissioners or other subordinate officers had, <em>without authority derived from the constitution and laws of the State, </em>excluded colored citizens 'from juries because of their race.\u201d Again<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>: \u201cThe application was to remove the prosecution from the state court, and a removal, as we have seen,,could not be ordered upon the ground simply that citizens of African descent had been improperly excluded, because of their race, and without the sanction of the constitution and laws of the State, from service on previous grand juries, or from service on the particular grand jury that returned the indictment against the accused. We do not overlook in this connection the fact that the petition for the removal of the cause into the Federal court alleged that the accused, by reason of the great prejudice against him on account of his color, could not secure a fair and impartial trial in the county, and that he prayed an opportunity to subpoena witnesses to prove that fact. Such evidence, if it had been introduced, and however cogent, could not, as already shown; have entitled the accused to the <em>removal </em>sought; for the alleged existence of race prejudice interfering with a fair trial was not to be attributed to the constitution and laws of the State. It was incumbent upon the state court to see to it that the accused had a fair and impartial trial, and to set aside any verdict, of guilty based on prejudice of race. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The cases to whieh.we have adverted had reference, it is true, to alleged discriminations against negroes because of their race. But the rules announced in them equally apply where the accused is of the white race. Section. 641, as well, as the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, is lor the benefit of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>of every race whose cases are embraced by 'its, provisions and not alone for the benefit of the African race.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">We have not overlooked the suggestion, earnestly pressed upon our attention, that it is impossible for the accused to obtain a fair trial in the locality where the prosecution is pending. Indeed, the suggestion is, in effect, that there was a deliberate purpose on the part of those charged with the administration of justice in that locality to take his life, under the forms of law, even if the facts did not establish his guilt of the crime charged. It is true that looking alone at the petition for removal, the trials of the accused disclose such misconduct oh the part of administrative officers connected with those trials as may well shock all who love justice and recognize the right of every human being, accused of crime, to be tried according to law. The case as made by the record, it must be conceded; tends to show, if it does not justify the belief, that administrative'officers, having connection with the trial of the accused, had it in mind, at each trial, to exclude from the jury, so far as it was possible to do so, every person, however competent, .who belonged to the same political party as the accused. In his separate opinion in <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>83 S. W. Rep. 146, 149, Judge Barker, of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, referring to the third trial of the accused, said: \u201cIt is clear that the trial judge was of opinion that it was not an offense against the Fourteenth Amendment or a denial of the equal, protection of the laws to the defendant to exclude Republicans [the accused being a Republican in politics], from the jury, solely because they were Republicans, provided the selected Democrats [the deceased Goebel being a Democrat in politics] were possessed of the statutory qualifications required ,for jury service. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">It is appropriate here to recall that the Circuit Court, referring to the petition for removal, said: \u201cThe Commonwealth of Kentucky has not filed a reply to said petition for removal, or in any way taken issue with the defendant as to any of the alle- ' gations- thereof. Said allegations must, therefore; be accepted' as true,- save in so far as Jthey may be contradicted by the tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>script on file herein. In the case of <em>Dishon </em>v. <em>C., N. O. &amp; T. P. Ry. Co., </em>133 Fed. Rep. 471, 66 C. C. A. 345, Judge Richards, in discussing the affirmative allegations of a petition for removal in a civil suit under the jurisdictional acts of 1887-88, said: \u2018If these averments were not true, the plaintiff should have denied \u25a0 them, and an issue would then have been made for the court below to try and determine. No answer was filed; no issue in any other way was taken. The plaintiff contented himself with making a motion to remand, and which only raised a legal question, namely, whether, upon the facts stated in the petition for removal, taken in connection with the record, a case for removal was made out. \u2019 In the case of <em>Whitten </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>160 U. S. 231, Justice Gray, in referring to a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>under sections 751-755, Rev. Stat. U. S., said: \u2018In a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>verified by oath of the petitioner, as required by Rev. Stat. U. S. \u00a7 754, facts duly alleged may be taken to be true, unless denied by the return or controlled by other evidence. But no allegation of fact in the petition can be assumed to be admitted, unless distinct and unambiguous.\u2019 The allegations of the petition for removal are not borne out by the transcript in all their detail. They are, however, borne out to a substantial degree, and are not contradicted in any substantial particular. It establishes the discrimination complained of in the selection of the jurors by the subordinate officers having to do therewith on the second and third trials, and that on both trials the Scott Circuit Court held that such discrimin\u00e1tion was not illegal and the defendant had no right to complain thereof, it not being claimed that the jurors selected did not possess the statutory qualifications. As to the first trial, all that the transcript shows is that it was one of the grounds of defendant\u2019s motion for new trial that the Circuit judge, after the regular panel was exhausted, had refused to draw from the wheel the names of jurors placed there in the fall of 1899, before any motive for discrimination had arisen, concerning which Judge Du Relie had this to say in the opinion delivered by him on behalf of the majority of the Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>peals on the first appeal: \u2018In the grounds relied on in the motion for new trial it is stated that the court overruled the motion of appellant, after the regular panel was exhausted, to draw the remaining names necessary to complete the jury from the jury wheel. It is to be regretted that, in a case concerning which so much feeling existed, the simple and easy mode was not adopted, which would have put beyond cavil the question of the accused having a trial by jury impartially selected. This will doubtless be done upon the succeeding trial. \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Taking then the facts to be as represented in the petition for removal, still the remedy of the accused was not to have the prosecution removed into the Federal court \u2014 that court not being authorized to take cognizance of the case upon removal from the state court. It is not contended, as it could not be, that the constitution and laws of Kentucky deny to the accused any rights secured to him by the Constitution of the United States or by any act of Congress. Such being the case, it is impossible, in view of prior adjudications, to hold that this prosecution was .removable into the Circuit Court of the United States by virtue of section 641 of the Revised Statutes. Such a case as the one before us has not been provided for by any act of Congress; that is, a Circuit Court of the United States has not been authorized to take cognizance of a criminal prosecution commenced in a state court for an alleged crime against the State, 'where the constitution and laws of such State do not permit discrimination against the accused in respect of such rights as are specified in the first clause of section 641. This court, while sustaining the subordinate courts of the United States in the exercise of such jurisdiction as has been lawfully conferred upon them, must see to it that they do not usurp authority not affirmatively given to them by acts of Congress. In <em>M. C. &amp; L. M. Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>111 U. S. 379, 382, we said that \u201cthe rule,- springing from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the United States, is inflexible and without exception, which requires of this court, of its own motion, to deny its own jurisdiction, and, in the exercise of its appellate power, that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>all other courts of the United States, in all cases .where such jurisdiction does not affirmatively appear in the record on which, in the exercise of that power, it is called to act. On every writ of error or appeal the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction, first, of this court, and then of the court from which the record comes. This question the court is bound to ask and answer for itself, even when not otherwise suggested, and without respect to the relation of the. parties to it. \u201d This principle has been again and again reaffirmed. <em>Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>177 U. S. 449, 453, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Now, it affirmatively appears of record that the Circuit Court has taken jurisdiction of this case on removal from the state court, when, as we hold, no act of Congress authorized it to do so. We cannot, in fidelity to the law, as declared in former cases, overlook this defect of jurisdiction in the court below or fail to express our inability to concur in the views of the learned court below upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The Circuit Court said: \u201c I,- therefore, conclude that the prior action of the. Scott Circuit Court denying the defendant the equal protection of the laws is a real hindrance and obstacle to his asserting his right thereto in a future trial therein \u2014 just as real as an unconstitutional statute would be \u2014 and that the defendant is denied, the equal protection of the laws in said court, within the meaning of said section, and entitled to a removal on account'thereof. He is denied in said court the equal protection of the laws because he has been denied, and such denial has . never been set aside, but remains in full force and effect. . . . By an \u2018inability to enforce in the judicial tribunals of the State\u2019 is meant, as I construe the statute, any judicial tribunal of the State that may have jurisdiction of the prosecution.\u201d This view is met by what has been said in former cases, namely, that the words in section 641 \u2014 \u201cwho is denied or cannot enforce in the judicial tribunals of the State\u201d \u2014 have no application to any case where the rights secured to an accused \u201cby any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States, \u201d are recognized or are not denied by the constitution or laws of the State in which the prosecution is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Under this holding, the accused is not deprived of opportunity to have his rights, of whatever nature, which are secured or guaranteed to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, fully protected by a Federal court. But it is said that the action of the trial court in refusing to quash the indictment or the panel of petit jurors, although the motion to quash was based on Federal grounds, cannot, under the laws of Kentucky, be reviewed by the Court of Appeals, U&gt;e highest court of that Commonwealth. If such be the law Kentucky, as declared by the statutes and by the Court of Appeals of that Commonwealth, then, after the case is disposed of in that court by final judgment, in respect of the matters of which, under the local law, it may take cognizance, a writ of error can run from this court <em>to the trial court </em>as the highest court of Kentucky <em>in which a decision of the Federal question could he had; </em>and this court in that event, upon writ of error, reviewing the final judgment of the trial court, can exercise such jurisdiction in the case as may be necessary to vindicate any right, privilege or immunity specially set up or claimed under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and in respect of which the decision of the trial court is made final by the local law; that is, it may reexamine the final judgment of the trial court so far as it involved and denied the Federal right, privilege or immunity asserted. This must be so, else it will be in the power of a State to so regulate the jurisdiction of its courts as to prevent this court from protecting rights secured by the Constitution, and improperly denied in a subordinate state court, although specially set up and claimed. What we have said is clear from section 709 of the Revised Statutes, which declares that \u201cA final judgment or decree in any suit in the highest court of a State, in which a decision <em>in </em>the suit could be had, . . . where any title, right, privilege or immunity is claimed under the Constitution, . . . and the decision is <em>against </em>the title, right, privilege or immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>specially set up or claimed, by either party, under such Constition, . . - . may be reexamined .and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court upon a writ of error. \u201d Looking at the object of that section it must be held that this court has jurisdiction, upon writ of error to reexamine, the final judgment of a subordinate state court denying a Federal right, specially set up or claimed, if, under the local' law, that court is the highest court of the State entitled to pass upon such claim of Federal right. The great case of <em>Cohens </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>6 Wheat. 264, which was a criminal prosecution for a misdemeanor, was brought to this court, upon writ of error, from the Quarterly Session Court' for the Borough of Norfolk, Virginia, and our jurisdiction was sustained upon the ground that such' court was the highest court of the State in which, under the laws of Virginia, that case was cognizable. In <em>Downham </em>v. <em>Alexandria, </em>9 Wall. 659, which was a suit for taxes against a dealer in liquors, the court said: \u201cThe legislature, then, having thought fit to make the judgment of the District Court in this case final and without appeal, that court is, for this case, the highest court in which the decision could be made; and the writ of error is, therefore, warranted by the act of Congress, and regular. \u201d In <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>23 Wall. 294, 306, which was a writ'of error to the Corporation Court of Alexandria, Virginia, and in which' there was a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, this court said: \u201cThe Court of Appeals is the highest court in the State of Virginia. If a decision of a suit could be had in that court, we must wait for such a decision before we can take jurisdiction, and then can only examine the judgment of that court. If, however, the suit is one of which that court cannot take jurisdiction, we may reexamine the judgment of the highest court which, under laws of the State, could decide it. . . . We think, therefore, that the judgment of the Corporation Court of the city of Alexandria is the judgment of the highest court of the State in which a decision of the suit could be had, and that we may reexamine it upon error.\u201d In <em>Bergemann </em>v. <em>Backer, </em>157 U. S. 655, 659, a criminal prosecution for murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>in a subordinate court of New Jersey, this court said: \u201cIf the . proceedings in the Court of Oyer and Terminer could not, under the laws of New Jersey, be reviewed in a higher court of that State, except upon the allowance of a writ of error by such court or by some judge, and if such allowance was refused, then the judgment of the court of original jurisdiction was, within the meaning of the acts of Congress, the judgment of the highest court of the State in which a determination of the case could be had, and such judgment could have been, upon writ of error, reexamined here, if it had denied any right, privilege, or immunity specially set up and claimed under the Constitution of the United States.\u201d So, in <em>Missouri, Kansas &amp;c. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>184 U. S. 530, 539, in which the defendant made a claim of immunity in virtue of an authority exercised under the United States, it was held that our writ of error ran, not to the Supreme Court of Missouri, but to the Kansas Gity Court of Appeals, the highest court in which, under the law.of that State, the question as to that immunity could be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">It is necessary to notice one other point made in behalf of the accused. At each of the trials he pleaded in bar of the prosecution a pardon granted to him on the tenth day of March, 1900, . by William S. Taylor, who was alleged to have been, at the time, the duly elected, qualified, actual and acting Governor of Kentucky, having in his possession and under his control all the books, papers, records and archives, as well as the Executive Mansion, belonging to the office of Governor. That pardon, it is alleged, was accepted by the accused. It is further alleged that at the time said pardon was issued Taylor had been recognized, regarded and treated as the lawful Governor of Kentucky by the Executive power and Executive Department of the Government of the United States, including the President, the Attorney General, and the Postmaster General, and by the postmaster at Frankfort, the capital of Kentucky. The petition for removal alleged that the court in which the accused was tried, as well as the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, had refused to recognize said pardon as having any legal effect, and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>thereby denied to him the equal civil rights and the equal protection of the laws secured to him by the above provisions of the Constitution and laws of the United States; consequently, it was contended, he was denied and could not enforce in any judicial tribunal of Kentucky the rights which said pardon gave him.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Manifestly, in view of what has already been said, this question as to the pardon of the accused, does not make a case of removal on the ground of the denial or inability to enforce in the judicial tribunals of Kentucky of a right secured to the accused \u201cby any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d Whether the non-recognition by the courts of the State of the validity of the alleged pardon involved a denial of any right secured to the accused by any other law or by the Constitution of the United States, we need not now consider. As the Circuit Court could not, in virtue of section 641, take cognizance of this prosecution or removal, we cannot properly pass upon the merits of any question of Federal right which might arise in the case. It is sufficient to say that if the accused, by reason of the Taylor pardon, acquired any right under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and if at the next trial of his case that right, having been specially set up and claimed, should be denied by the highest court of the State in which a decision of that question could be had, such action of that court, in respect of that pardon, can be reviewed here upon writ of error. We do not perceive that any question arising out of the pardon could make a case under- section 641 for the removal of the prosecution from the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">We.are all-of opinion that the order awarding the writ of <em>habeas corpus cum causa </em>must be reversed, with directions to set aside that order as well as the order docketing the case in the Circuit Court of the United States; also, that the rule in relation to mandamus must be made absolute, the prosecution remanded to .the state court, and the custody of the accused surrendered to the state authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
