The plaintiff immediately gave the defendant notice of the accident and of the fact that Nellie Heideman made a claim against the plaintiff for damages on account of .the bodily injuries she had suffered from the accident and that Henry Heideman, her husband, also made a claim for damages against it bn account of the loss of the services of his wife and of the expenses of physicians and nurses which resulted to him from her bodily injuries. On August 16, 1901, the defendant notified the plaintiff that it denied that it was hable to it on account of the damages resulting-from the accident under its policy because, as it alleged, the driver of the plaintiff\u2019s wagon was not an employe of the plaintiff, but the fact was that this driver was an employ\u00e9 of the plaintiff and the accident and the damages were covered by- the policy. On November 23, 1901, Nellie Heideman sued the plaintiff for $10,000 damages on ac-. count of the bodily injuries to her caused by the negligence of the plaintiff\u2019s driver and by the accident, and Henry Heideman brought an action' against it for $3,000 damages which he alleged he sustained from the same cause. On November 29, 1901, the plaintiff in writing notified the defendant of the commencement of these suits and requested it to-undertake the .defense of said suits as its.said policy provides it would do. But the defendant declined to undertake the defense upon the alleged ground that its policy did not cover the accid\u00e9nt or the. claims, while the fact was\u2019that it covered both. The injuries to Mrs. Heideman were, among others, the breaking of her right hipjoint socket bone, were serious and permanent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>the plaintiff was liable for damages in each of the suits. It feared heavy judgments if the actions were permitted to proceed to trial. Thereupon, on April 15, 1902, it compromised the suits and paid Mrs. Heideman $2,000 damages and her husband $500 damages on account of the injuries caused by the accident and the negligence of its driver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-4\">\u201cThe petition also contained the following averments: \u2018The plaintiff served, on defendant a written notice notifying it of the terms of settlement offered by said Nellie Heideman and Henry Heideman for the injuries sustained and damages suffered by them respectively, as aforesaid, and that plaintiff proposed- to accept said settlements and pay said amounts, and to hold defendant responsible for such payment under its aforesaid policy; that defendant interposed no objection to said proposed settlements, relying upon its disclaimer\u25a0 of any.liability under said policy by reason of its alleged claim that the driver of said wagon was not in the employ of the plaintiff herein; and that said defendant by reason of the said denial. and disclaimer of any liability waived all the conditions of the said' policy as herein set forth. Plaintiff further states that by reason of defendant\u2019s failure and refusal to defend said actions brought by Nellie Heideman and Henry Heideman against plaintiff, and by reason of the waiver aforesaid, it was obliged to and did defend said actions and employed counsel for that purpose, at an expense of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00), and that said employment of counsel was reasonably-necessary, and that said sum of $250.00 is the reasonable value of said services so performed.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">' \u201cAnd the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit further certifies that the following questions of law are presented by the assignment of errors in this case, that their decision is indispensable to \u00e1 decision of this case and that to the end that this court may .properly decide the issues of law presented it desires the instruction of the Supreme Court of the United States upon the following questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">\u201c1. Did the denial of all liability by the assurer and its re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>fusal to defend the suits in the name and on behalf of the assured as provided by paragraph 2 of the policy constitute such a breach of the contract on its part that.it released the assured from its agreement in paragraph'3 that it .would not settle any claim except at its own cost without the consent of the assurer previously given in writing, and from the provision of paragraph 8 that no action should he against the assurer as respects any loss unless for loss actually sustained and paid by the assured in satisfaction of a judgment after trial of the issue?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Were the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 8 of the policy that the assured should not settle any claim except at its .own cost, without the consent of the assurer, previously given in writing, and that no action should, lie against the assurer as respects any loss under the policy unless brought by the assured to reimburse it for loss actually sustained and' paid b'y it in satisfaction, of a judgment after trial of the issue, waived' by the assurer\u2019s denial of liability under the policy and by its failure and refusal to defend the suits against the assured according to the provision in paragraph 2?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-7\">\u201c3.

A judgment against an indemnitee, after notice to the insurer to defend suit/is conclusive of the amount and liability. 16 Am. &amp; Eng.

There is a clear distinction between a contract against \u201cliability for damages\u201d and a contract of indemnity against \u201closs from liability for damages.\u201d Under the latter clause no liability arises until payment by the assured of a judgment after a trial. <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Wiman, </em>1 N.

The form of the declaration does not appear, but we may suppose a count upon the Casualty Company\u2019s refusal fb defend the suit against the plaintiff. If the defendant\u2019s contention is right, that breach made it impossible for the plaintiff to entitle itself to the payment promised in the policy according to its terms. But the defendant could not set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>itself free by so simple a device. In general, when one party by his fault prevents the other party to a contract from entitling himself to a benefit under it according to its terms, the former is liable for the value of that benefit less the value or cost of what the plaintiff would have had to do to get it. In this case the plaintiff had nothing more to do or to pay after it had been compelled to satisfy the claim against it. Ahd therefore, on general principles, it would be entitled to demand the whole amomit which the jury might find that it would have received had the contract been performed. <em>Hinckley </em>v. <em>Pittsburg Bessemer Steel Co., </em>121 U. S. 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">It is suggested, to be sure, that the plaintiff should have defended the suit against it. But not only was that not one of the plaintiff\u2019s undertakings, but if'was expressly forbidden to the plaintiff by the contract, as no doubt the defendant would have pointed out had that course been taken. Moreover, the defendant, by its refusal, cut at the very roQb of the mutual obligation and put an end to its right to demand further compliance with the supposed term of the contraction the other side. The only concern of the plaintiff was to establish reasonable ground for believing that if the defendant had not-broken its contract it would have been called on to make a payment to the plaintiff, and how much that payment would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Looking at the substance of the.matter, it makes no .practical difference, no difference in the amount of the defendant\u2019s liability, whether we say that the defendant by its conduct made performance of the conditions by the plaintiff impossible, and therefore was chargeable for the sum which it would have had to pay if those conditions'had\u201ebeen performed, or answer,, in the language of the questions, that performance of the conditions was waived. The sole difference would be in the form of the declaration. In either case the plaintiff would declare upon the policy, only the breaches assigned would not be the same. In the former the breach would be the refusal to defend, in the latter the refusal to pay. If it is necessary to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>sider the question in a technical aspect, we think that the plaintiff was entitled to treat the contract as on foot, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s act, and go on with it <em>cypres. </em>Under the circumstances it could not comply literally with the words, and was justified in doing the best thing that could be done for the interest of both. The defendant by its abdication put the plaintiff in its place with all its rights. To limit its liability as if its only promise was to pay a loss paid upon a judgment is to neglect the meaning and purpose of the reference to a judgment, and even the words of the promise. The promise in form is to indemnify against loss by certain kinds of liability. The judgment contemplated in the condition is a judgment in a suit defended by the defendant in case it elects not to settle. The substance of the promise is to pay a loss which the plaintiff shall have been compelled to pay, after such precautions and with such safeguards as the defendant may insist upon. It saw fit' to insist upon none.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We assume that the settlement was reasonable, and that the plaintiff could not expect to escape at less cost by defending the suits. If this were otherwise no doubt the defendant would profit by the fact. The defendant did not agree to repay a gratuity,' or more than fairly could be said to have been paid upon compulsion. But a sum paid in the prudent settlement of a suit is paid under the compulsion of the suit as truly as if it were paid upon execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">But there is an'other aspect of the eighth condition of the slip which requires a few words more. It is said that this condition expressly contemplates a breach of contract by the company and defines the plaintiff\u2019s rights in that case. The words \u201cno action shall lie against the company as respects any loss under this policy unless, \u201d etc., certainly do contemplate a case in court in which the company may turn out to be in the wrong, and therefore technically guilty of a breach of contract. But notwithstanding the contrary suggestion in <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Frankfort Marine, Accident &amp; Plate Glass Ins. Co., </em>72 N. H. 485, 498, 499, we.think that the only breach which that condition has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>in view is a refusal b.y the company to pay after the decision in a c\u00e1se of which it has taken charge, , when, notwithstanding the judgment, it conceives itself to have a defense. The action referred to is an action for money alleged .to be due under the policy. Contracts rarely provide in detail for their nonperformance. It wbuld be stretching the words quoted to a significance equally hurtful to both parties, and probably equally absent from the minds of both, to read them as having within their scope an initial repudiation of liability by the de- ' fendant' and a requirement that in that event the plaintiff should be bound to try the case against .itself, although it should be plain that by a compromise it could reduce its .claim on the defendant as well as its own loss. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">If there is anything in the doubt whether the defendant, by assuming the defense of'the original suit, would not lose its right to deny that the policy applied, even if fit purported to save that right, it does not change our opinion. 'The requirement of a trial-and judgment would not accomplish the object suggested, to'make collusion impossible. The objections-to thus hampering the <em>dominus litis </em>have been touched upon, and . there would be presented the anomaly, if not the monstrosity, of a party attempting to provide by contract that if he should do what by general principles of contract forfeited his right to make further requirements of the other side, his conduct, on the contrary, should impose new obligations on the other side. If the defendant kept its contract, it would defend the suit, and the plaintiff would have no duties. If it refused to do as it had promised, we cannot think that it was entitled to complain that the plaintiff did not do it when the interest of both was the other way. Before a policy should be construed to have such an extraordinary effect honesty requires that the assured-should be notified of his duties in unmistakable words.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We answer the first, second, fourth and fifth questions in the affirmative, the third in the negative and the sixth in the affirmative, so far as the question is warranted by the facts set. forth. <em>It will be so certified.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
