McReynolds, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for the United States:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-11\">Under sundry provisions of the tariff law use is made the test of classification, and it is necessary to determine whether in order to be included therein the enumerated articles must be completely prepared for the ultimate use specified or whether it suffices to show that as imported they can have, no useful purpose except the one named notwithstanding something further may be required for their perfection. See <em>Dingelstedt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>87 Fed. Rep. 190; <em>S. C., </em>91 Fed. Rep. 112; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>99 Fed.

The' articles were manifestly similar in material, quality and use to finally completed carbons for el\u00e9ctric lighting. Similarity in one of the particulars mentioned is sufficient to subject an unenumerated article to the duty levied on an enumerated one. <em>Pickhardt </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>132 U.

The collector of customs of the port of New York held them to be dutiable at ninety cents per one hundred sticks, under paragraph 98 of the act of 1897, which provides as follows: \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">\u2022 \"Gas retorts, three dollars each; lava tips for burners, ten cents per gross and fifteen per centum , ad. v\u00e1lorepi; carbons for electric lighting, ninety cents per hundred;, filter tubes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>forty-five per centum ad valorem; porous carbon pots for electric batteries without metallic connections, twenty per centum ad valorem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">On protest and review by the board of appraisers the decision of the collector was affirmed. The board of appraisers, however, held that the sticks were not within the terms of paragraph 98, basing the ruling on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reisinger, </em>94 Fed. Rep. 1002, nor within paragraph 97, under the rule in the <em>Gabriel </em>case, 99 Fed. Rep. 716. And held further, that while the articles in question were not enumerated in the act of 1897; they were \u201csimilar in material, texture and use to carbons for electric lighting,\u201d and dutiable under paragraph 98 by virtue of the similitude clause (sec. 7) of the act of 1897. The Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York held that the articles were dutiable under paragraph 97 and reversed the ruling of the board of appraisers' upon the authority of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reisinger, supra, </em>and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">It appears from the evidence that the carbon sticks are from twelve and a half to twenty inches, in length, and to render them ready for use one-half inch must be cut off from the shorter ones and their, ends burnished or smoothed/ the process costing about one-tenth of one per cent. The longer sticks must be cut in two and sharpened at both ends, .and it i\u00e1 stipulated that those steps for their completion' being done the only use for the sticks \u201cis as carbons for electric lighting.\u201d They are undoubtedly \u201ccarbons\u201d and their use is \u201c.for electric lighting.\u201d In a general sense they come within the description of paragraph 98. It is contended, however, that they are not covered by that paragraph, because they must undergo a process of manufacture, though slight that process need be. The contention-virtually is that \"the articles imported are-not \u201ccarbons,\u201d, either in the trade or popular sense, and do not become such until fit for use in lamps. In other words, it is the finished stick that constitutes, the entity contemplated and made dutiable at ninety cents .per hundred under paragraph 98, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>and that the articles imported are accurately described and enumerated only in paragraph 97, as articles composed of carbon, not specially provided for. Paragraph 97 is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u201cArticles and wares composed wholly or in chief value of earthy or mineral substances, or carbon, not specially provided for in this act, if not decorated in any manner, thirty-five per centum ad .valorem; if decorated, f\u00f3rty-five per centum ad valorem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">There is much to justify the contention of respondents as to paragraph 98. The act of 1897 recognizes in many places the difference between finished and unfinished articles of manurfacture, but it also recognizes in many places use as determining the duty. The words \u201celectric lighting\u201d are very general and it is the effect of the stipulation of the parties that the imported articles have no useful purpose except for electric lighting, though something further may be required for exact adaptation. However, we may put our decision on another ground, which will be best developed in considering the contention of respondents under paragraph 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The contention encounters a serious difficulty. As was decided in <em>Dingelstedt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>91 Fed. Rep. 112, the paragraph covers articles which are susceptible of decoration aftd not, as contended by respondent, articles decorated or not decorated, irrespective of their capability of being decorated. If the articles in question do not fall within paragraph 98, because-not finished, and do not fall within paragraph 97, because not susceptible of decoration, where do they fall? They would seem necessarily to fall under that part of section 6, which provides that \u201con all articles manufactured, in whole or in part, not provided for,\u201d and subject to a duty of twenty per cent ad valorem. But there is a circumstance to be considered that arrests this effect. Section 7 provides \u201c that each and every imported article, not. enumerated in this act, which is similar, either in material, quality, texture, or the use to which it may be applied, to any article enumerated- in this act as chargeable with duty, shall pay the same rate of duty which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>is levied on the \u00bfnumerated article which it most resembles in any of the particulars before mentioned; . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The imported merchandise are undoubtedly manufactured articles and do not miss by a great deal being identical with \u201ccarbons for electric lighting\u201d in the most restricted sense of that description. They have, therefore, similarity in all the particulars mentioned in section 7 to such carbons.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\n<em>The judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals and of the Circuit Court are reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court with directions to sustain the decision of the Board 'of General Appraisers.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
