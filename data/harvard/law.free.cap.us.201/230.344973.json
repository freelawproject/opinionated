Stat., against a stockholder by a suit in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill on behalf of himself and all other creditors, a case is presented under the laws of the United States giving the Circuit Court jurisdiction independently of diverse citizenship, and the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is not final but an appeal therefrom will lie to this court.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b254-12\">It is not necessary in order to maintain such a suit that the creditor should first obtain judgment on the notes.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b254-13\">A national bank finding itself embarrassed though possessed. of a large amount of assets apparently in excess of its obligations is not prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>by the national banking act from borrowing, and it has the power to borrow, money to meet pressing demands, which it has not the cash to meet, and to give its time obligations therefor, secured by all of its assets; and if it subsequently goes into liquidation, and the collateral is insufficient to meet the obligations, the stockholders, both assenting and non-assenting to the liquidation are subject to the additional liability to the extent imposed by'\u00a7 5151, Rev. Stat., and the holder of the notes can enforce the same by creditor\u2019s bill.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-5\">Prior to December 21, 1895, the American National Bank and the Union National Bank, hereinafter called respectively the American Bank and the Union Bank, were each engaged in business in the city of Omaha, Nebraska. During that month the American Bank was in such financial condition that it became necessary for it to provide for the payment of a large amount of deposits on or about January 1,1896, for though possessed of abundant nominal assets it did not have sufficient cash to make such payment. It knew that a neglect to pay would precipitate a run and bring on a failure of the bank. Thereupon in order to obtain the money necessary therefor its officers and leading stockholders entered into negotiations with the Union Bank for the payment of its immediate obligations and thus enabling it to secure an opportunity to realize upon its assets. As a result of such negotiations a contract was entered into by and between the two banks through their boards of directors. By its terms the Union Bank was to' assume the payment of all the liabilities of the American Bank, receiving therefor cash and such bills receivable as it was willing to accept at par and without recourse. The difference between the amounts so received and the liabilities assumed was to be represented by three non-negotiable promissory notes of the American Bank, the payment of which was to be secured by a pledge of all its remaining assets to Thomas L. Kimball, as trustee. This contract was carried out. The Union Bank moved into and took possession of the offices of the American Bank. Upon adjustment, as above indicated, the difference was found to fee- $201,000, for which the American Bank executed!.\u00edo/the Union Bank three non-negotiable promissory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>notes, each being for $67,000, and payable in one, two and three years, respectively. In accordance with the contract the remaining assets of the American Bank'were placed in .the hands of the trustee, Thomas L. Kimball, who proceeded' to collect them and apply the proceeds on the notes until his death during the pendency of this suit. Subsequently a successor was appointed, who continued in performance of the trust until the entry of the decree. The execution of the contract of. December 21,1895, by the president and cashier of the American Bank was directed by resolution of its board of directors. On January j4, 1896, at an annual meeting of the shareholders of that bank, at which was represented l,665f shares out of a total of 2,000, a resolution was adopted instructing the directors to .take action looking to the liquidation of the bank. On February 25, 1896, another meeting of the shareholders was held, at which 1,696 shares were represented, and a resolution for voluntary liquidation was adopted by an affirmative vote of 1,639| shares. The Union Bank fulfilled its obligations under the contract, having taken up all the liabilities assumed by it. The trustee meeting with littlfe success in collection of the assets, this suit was, after the first note had matured, instituted in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Nebraska by Sumner Wallace, a citizen of New Hampshire, to whom the note had been transferred, against the Union Bank,\"Thomas L. Kimball the trustee, the American Bank and its stockholders, \"including the appellants. By an amended bill the complainant sought on behalf, of himself and all other creditors of the American Bank the winding up of the affairs of that bank, the determination of the amount due upon his note, the ascertainment of all the creditors and the amounts of their claims, the subjection of the remaining assets to the payment of those claims and the enforcement of the liability of the stockholders. He had not reduced the note to judgment prior to the commencement of this suit. Upon a final hearing a decree was entered ascertaining the amounts due the complainant and the Union Bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>(they being the only creditors), after the application of all credits, the number of shares of stock held by each shareholder of the American Bank and directing a recovery of $97.23 on account of each share of stock. This decree was affirmed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals' for the Eighth Circuit, 68 C. C. A. 40; 135 Fed.

Stat., has a definite meaning and presupposes the existence of assets to be- liquidated in the manner provided. But there remained -under- the control of the American National Bank or of its directors nothing to liquidate. All the assets of the American had been turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>over to the Union and Kimball, for them to collect and apply \u2022to the payment of the three notes, and they had proceeded to do this and were still engaged in the process of liquidation at the time the vote was taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-6\">The complainant has not filed \u201ca bill in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill,\u201d as positively required by said sec. 2; for neither of his bills alleges and 'his proof does not show, any action at law upon his note. But a creditor\u2019s bill presupposes two things: (1), that the creditor has been able to establish his claim to be a valid and honest claim before the proper court at law; and (2), that he needs-the assistance of a court of equity in order to realize upon it. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Green, </em>1 Wall. 330; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>99 U.

Those cases establish that the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>borrow money is incidental and limited to occasions when borrowing is necessary to' carry on ,the business of \u2022 banking, and that all borrowing must- be of a temporary nature. <em>First Nat.

Sec.' 5151, Rev. Stat., is the only provision imposing liability upon shareholders of national banks; and the cases show: that the hability imposed by \u00a7 5151 is a means of' securing the payment of a bank\u2019s debts at the time when \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>it is no longer able to continue business;, that the purpose'of the section is to secure the effectual winding up of the bank\u2019s' affairs; that such liability cannot be prolonged; and that there can be no liability on the part of shareholders unless the contracts, debts and engagements of the bank have been, contracted duly, and in the- ordinary course of the business of banking. They further show that the fact, that the 'new obligation takes the place of an old obligation for which the shareholders may have, been liable, does not make them liable for such new obligation. <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Irons, </em>121 U.

The note, which \u2022 is the foundation of plaintiff\u2019s suit,- is-one made by the, American Bank to the Union Bank, both located in. Nebraska, and under the statute, for the purpose of jurisdiction, to be considered citizens of Nebraska. 25 Stat. 436; sec. 4.. The plaintiff is a citizen of New Hampshire. He could not main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>tain an action against the maker of the note, although a citizen of a State other than that of the maker and payee. 25-Stat. 434; sec. 1. But if. diverse citizenship, was the sole basis of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the-decision of the Court of Appeals would be final and there would be no appeal to this court. 26,Stat. 828, \u00a7 6. The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, however, was not invoked on the ground of diverse citizenship \u2014 at least, not on that, alone. The case presented- was one arising under the laws of the United States. It-was \u00e1 suit to. enforce a special right given by -those laws. Section 5220, Rev. Stat., reads: \u201cAny [national banking] association may go into -liquidation and be closed by the vote. of its shareholders owning two-thirds of its stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">By section 5151, Rev. Stat., stockholders, in national banks are made liable for \u201call contracts, debts and engagements of such association, io the extent of the .amount of their stock therein, at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount invested in' such shares.\u201d Section 2 of the act of June 30, 1876, 19 Stat. 63, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u201cSec. 2. That when any national banking association shall have gone into liquidation .und\u00e9r the provisions of section five thousand two hundred and twenty of said statutes, the individual liability of the shareholders provided for by section fifty-one hundred and fifty-one - of. said statutes may be enforced by any creditor of. such association, by bill in equity, in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill, bro\u00fcght by such creditor on behalf of himself and of all other \u2022 creditors of the association, against the shareholders thereof, in any court of the. United States having' original jurisdiction in equity for the district, in which such association may have been located or established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">More than two-thirds of the stock voted, \u2022 on February 25,' 1896, for a voluntary liquidation, and on April 27, 1896, the Comptroller of the Currency formally approved the liquidation and notified the cashier of the American Bank to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">In proceeding, therefore, by this suit to enforce in behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>of himself and all other creditors of the American Bank the extra liability imposed by Rev. Stat. \u00a7 5151, a case was presented arising under the laws of the United States, and of which, independently of the matter of diverse citizenship, the Circuit Court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The bill is not multifarious. \u201c The two subjects of applying' the assets of the bank and enforcing the liability of a stockholder, however otherwise distinct, are by the statute made connected parts of the whole series of transactions which constitute the liquidation of the affairs of the bank.\u201d <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Irons, </em>121 U. S. 27, 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">It is suggested that no judgment had been obtained upon the note prior to this suit in equity, but as one object of the suit was to subject to the satisfaction of the debt certain property, conveyed to a trustee as security therefor, no judgment at law was a prerequisite. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>24 How. 352; <em>Case </em>v. <em>Beauregard, </em>101 U. S. 688, 691, in which the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u201cWithout pursuing this subject further, it may be said that whenever a creditor has a trust in his favor, or a lien upon property for the d\u00e9bt due him, he may go into equity without exhausting legal processes or remedies. <em>Tappan </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>11 N. H. 311; <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Bancroft, </em>30 Alabama, 193.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">.We come then to the final question in the case, and that is whether the notes- executed by the American Bank were its valid obligations. And in reference to this question these are the significant facts: The demands against the American Bank were pressing. It had not the money with which to meet them. It arranged with the Union Bank to advance the money for the payment of all its outstanding obligations. When the Union Bank paid these obligations of the American ' Bank it was the same as though it advanced money to that bank to pay them. To reimburse and secure the former the latter bank turned over\" certain-property, and executed these notes for the balance, securing them by a pledge of all its other assets which were placed in the hands of its president; as trustee,</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>All the stipulations and agreements made by the directors of the two banks were carried out in good faith; and, with full knowledge of what had been done, the stockholders voted for a voluntary liquidation. The borrowing of the money by the American Bank did not necessarily put it into liquidation. It had a large amount of assets, and if the real had equaled the nominal value of these assets it would have been enabled after discharging its obligation to the Union Bank to continue business. But on an examination the stockholders felt that it was wiser to stop at once. But that decision did not at all impugn the wisdom or <em>bona fides </em>of the transaction by which the money was obtained to pay off the pressing demands of the American Bank. The question, therefore, is, whether a national bank,, finding itself embarrassed, with a large amount of assets, much in excess of its obligations, yet without the cash to make payment of those which are due and urgent, can borrow to meet those pressing demands. A very natural answer is, why not? It is not borrowing money to engage in new business. It simply exchanges one creditor for others. There may be wisdom in consolidating all its debts into the hands of one person. At least such a consolidation cannot be pronounced beyond its powers. When time is obtained by the new indebtedness (in this case a year) it gives the borrowing bank and its officers and stockholders time to consider and determine the wisdom of attempting a further prosecution of business. In the case of an individual it would be a legitimate and often a wise transaction. It is not in' terms prohibited by the national banking act. <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Chemical National Bank, </em>176 U. S. 618, is very clearly in point. The opinion'in that case is \u2022 quite lengthy and considers many authorities, but the gist of the decision is expressed in these words (p. 635):</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u201cWithout further citation of cases we adjudge, both upon principle and authority, that as the money of the. Chemical Bank was obtained under a loan negotiated by the vice president of the Fidelity Bant who assumed to represent it in the transaction, and as the latter used the money so obtained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>its banking business and for its own benefit, that bank having enjoyed the.fruits of the transaction cannot avoid accoimtability to th\u00bf Chemical Bank-, even if it were true, as contend\u00e9d, that the Fidelity Bank could not consistently with the law. of its- creation have itself borrow\u00e9d the money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u2022We are of the opinion that the notes given by the American Bank for the money advanced by the Union Bank were its valid obligations and can, therefore, be enforced against its stockholders. The decree of the Circuit. Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
