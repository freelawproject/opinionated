This is a direct burden upon interstate commerce, and is such a regulation of commerce between the States as is vested in Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-4\">The statutes should have been construed as intended to apply only to intrastate shipments, but the state .courts declined to so limit them; and of course this court is bound by the interpretation of the statutes by the state court and must consider them as having been intended by the legislature to apply to .interstate commerce.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\">The power of Congress to regulate commerce among the States is exclusive. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>12 Wheat. 419, 446; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>97 U.

One of the chief objects of the Constitution was to rid commerce of the conflicting, vexatious and burdensome restrictions, which, under the Articles of Confederation, had been imposed by the various States. <em>Gibbons v.

In the absence of legislation by Congress, it would be going very' far to hold that such an enactment as the one complained of in this case was in itself a regulation of interstate commerce. It was for the State to take into consideration all the transactions affecting freight traffic within its limits, and as far as practicable, make such regulations as were just to all who might have occasion to ship over the road. It was entitled, of course, to .provide for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the convenience of shippers desiring to have freight transported on domestic trains, and this the statutes in question undertook to do, by requiring carriers to furnish cars promptly upon \u25a0 proper demand. But the State- was not bound to' ignore the convenience of those who desired to have freight transported to points beyond the limits of the State. <em>Cherokee Nation </em>v. <em>Southern Kansas R.

Revised-Statutes of Texas, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>material requirement of which is that when the shipper of freight shall make a requisition in writing for a number of cars to be furnished at any point indicated within a certain number of days from the receipt of the application, and shall deposit one-fourth of the freight with the agent of the company, the company failing to furnish them shall forfeit $25 per day for each car failed to be furnished, the only proviso being that the law \u201cshall not apply in cases of strikes of other public calamity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">. The defense was that this statute was not applicable to demands made for cars to be sent out of the State and to be used iii interstate commerce; and as the shipment was intended for Oklahoma, the act did not apply, and the. defendant was not liable. The question is whether the statute, applied'as it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>by the Texas court to interstate shipments, is an infringement upon the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">That, notwithstanding the exclusive nature of' this power, the States may, in the exercise of their police power, mak\u00e9 reasonable rules with regard to the methods of carrying on interstate business; the precautions that shall be used to avoid danger, the facilities for the comfort of passengers and the safety of freight carried, and, to a certain extent, the stations at which stoppages shall be made, is settled by repeated decision's of this court. \u25a0 Of course, such rules are inoperative if conflicting with regulations upon the same subject enacted by Congress, and can be supported only when consistent with the general requirement that interstate commerce shall be free and unobstructed, and not amounting to a regulation of such commerce. As the power to build and operate railways, and to acquire land .by condemnation, usually rests upon state authority, the legislatures may annex such conditions as they please with regard to mfrastate transportation, and.such other rules regarding \u25a0mierstate commerce as ar\u00e9 not inconsistent with the general right of such Commerce to be free and unobstructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The exact limit of lawful legislation upon this subject cannot in the nature of things be defined. It can only be illustrated from decided cases, by applying the principles therein enunciated, determining from these whether in the particular case the rule be reasonable or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">That States may not burden instruments of interstate commerce, whether railways or telegraphs,\u2019 by taxation, by forbidding the introduction'into the State of articles of commerce generally recognized as lawful, of by prohibiting their sale after introduction, has been so frequently settled that a citation of authorities is unnecessary. Upon the other hand, the validity of local laws designed to protect passengers or employ\u00e9s, or persons crossing the railroad tracks, as well as other regulations intended for the public good, are generally recognized. An analysis of all the prior important cases upon this point will be found in the opinion of the court in <em>Cleveland &amp;c. R. R. Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>Illinois, </em>177 U. S. 514, wherein a requirement that express trains intended only for through passengers should stop at every county seat, when ample accommodations were provided by local trains, was held to be an unreasonable burden. Other similar cases regulating the stoppage of trains are <em>Illinois Central R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>163 U. S. 142; <em>Gladson </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>166 U. S. 427; <em>Lake Shore &amp;c. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>173 U. S. 285. In the same line is the more recent case of <em>Wisconsin &amp;c. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>179 U. S. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">While there is much to be said in favor of laws compelling railroads to furnish adequate facilities for the transportation of both freight and passengers, and to regulate the general subject of speed, length and frequency of stops, for the heating, lighting and ventilation of passenger cars, the furnishing of food and water to cattle and other live stock, we think an absolute requirement that a railroad shall furnish a certain number of cars at a specified day, regardless of every other consideration except strikes and other public calamities, transcends the police power of the State and amounts to a burden upon interstate commerce. It makes no exception in cases of a sudden congestion of traffic, an actual inability to furnish cars by reason of their temporary and unavoidable detention in other States, or in other places within the same State. It makes no allowance for interference of traffic occasioned by wrecks or other accidents upon the same or other roads, involving a detention of traffic, the breaking of bridges, accidental fires, washouts or other unavoidable consequences of heavy weather.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">A dereliction of the road in this, particular, which may have occurred from circumstances wholly beyond the control of its officers, is made punishable not only by damages actually incurred by the shipper in the detention of his stock, but in addition thereto by an arbitrary penalty of $25 per car for each day of detention. The penalty wfi\u00edch was assessed in this case, though the detention was only for one day, amounted to nearly as much as the damages, and might in another case amount to far more.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>While perhaps the road may have no right to complain of that portion of the statute which assumes to provide for its own protection, it is illustrative of its general spirit that, if the shipper does not fully load his cars within forty-eight hours after their arrival, he shall forfeit $25 for each car, or if the consignee shall fail to unload them within forty-eight hours after their delivery, at the place of consignment, which in the case of interstate shipments would be in another State, he shall also forfeit $25 per day for each car unloaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In this connection the recent case of <em>Central &amp;c. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Murphey, </em>196 U. S. 194, is instructive. In that case we held that the imposition by a state statute, upon the initial or any connecting carrier, of the duty of tracing the freight and informing the shipper, in writing, when, where or how, and by which carrier the freight was lost, damaged or destroyed, and of giving the names of the parties and their official position, if any, by whom the truth of the facts set out in the information could be established, is, when applied to interstate commerce, a violation of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution; and an act of the legislature of Georgia imposing such a duty on common carriers was held void as to shipments made from points in Georgia to other States.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">- Although the statute in question may have been dictated by a due regard for the public interest of the cattle raisers \u00f3f the State, and may have been intended merely to secure promptness on the part of the railroad companies, in providing facilities for speedy transportation, we think that in its practical operation it is likely to work a great injustice to the roads, and to impose heavy penalties for trivial, unintentional and accidental violations of its provisions, when no d\u00e1mages could actually have resulted to the shippers.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">It should be borne in mind that the act does not apply to cattle alone, but to all cases \u201cwhen the owner, manager or shipper <em>of any freight of any kind </em>shall make application in writing,\u201d etc. The duty of the railroad company to furnish the cars within the time limited is peremptory and admits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>no excuses, except such as arise from strikes and other public; calamities. If, for instance, the owner of a large quantity of cotton should make a requisition under the act7 for a number of cars, the railway company would be bound to furnish them upon the day named, or incur a penalty of $25 for each car, though the detention of the cotton involved no expense to the owner, or may even have resulted in a benefit to him through a rise in the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">While railroad companies may be bound to furnish sufficient cars for their usual and ordinary traffic, cases will inevitably arise where by reason of an unexpected turn in the market, a great public gathering, or an unforeseen rush of travel, a pressure upon the road for transportation facilities may arise, which good management and a desire to fulfill all its legal requirements cannot provide for, and against which the statute in question makes no allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Although it may be admitted that the statute is not far from the line of proper police regulation, we think that sufficient allowance is not made for the practical difficulties in the administration of the law, and that, as applied to interstate commerce, it transcends the legitimate powers of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\"><em>The'judgment of the'Court of Civil Appeals is, therefore, re- . versed, and the cause remanded </em>fo <em>that court for further proceedings.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b355-8\">Mr. Justice White, not having heard the argument, took no part in the decision of this case. \u25a0</judges>\n<judges id=\"b355-9\">The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice McKenna dissented.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-10\"> \u201cArt. 4497.
