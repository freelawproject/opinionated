Nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment hinders a State from enacting that in future the doing of such overt acts of ownership as are possible on wild lands, under a recorded deed showing that the actor claims title coupled with the payment of taxes, the owner not paying any meanwhile or doing any act indicative of ownership, shall constitute a disseisin which if continued long enough shall bar an action for the land; nor is such an act unconstitutional because it fixes the period at twenty years and allows it to become operative as to suits commenced five years after its enactment as it would be within the power of the legislature to fix the entire period of limitation at five years, and the owner would have an opportunity to defeat the disseisin by asserting ownership within that time; such a statute would not be construed as permitting suit to be barred by a period of twenty years\u2019 inactivity prior to the enactment of the statute, if acts of ownership were exercised thereafter.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b383-12\">If a state statute, as construed by the state court, is constitutional, this court follows that, construction.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-13\">The facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>Mr. William Frye White, </em>with whom <em>Mr. Taber D.

At the trial the plaintiff proved a <em>primet feme </em>title to an undivided interest in the land. The defendant relied upon the Maine Public Laws of. 1895, c. 162, \u00a71.

But the court, adverting to the question, decided the contrary, and the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>judgment. 98 Maine, 268. The case then was brought to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The material sections of the act of 1895 are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u201cSec. 1. When the State has taxed wild land, and the state treasurer has deeded it, or part of it, for non-payment of tax, by deed purporting to convey the interest of the State by forfeiture for such non-payment and his records show that the grantee, his heirs or assigns, has paid the State and county taxes thereon, or on his acres or interest therein.as stated in the deed, continuously for the twenty years subsequent to such deed; and when a person claims under a recorded deed describing wild lands taxed by the State, and the state treasurer\u2019s record shows that he has, by himself or by his predecessors under such deed, paid the state and county taxes thereon, or on his acres or interest therein as stated in the deed, continuously for twenty years subsequent to recording such deed; and whenever, in either case, it appears that the person claiming under such a deed, and those under whom he claims, have, during such period, held such exclusive, peaceable, continuous and adverse possession thereof as comports with the ordinary management of wild lands in Maine, and' it further appears that during such. period, ho former owner, or person claiming under him, has paid any such tax, or any assessment by the county commissioners, or done any other act indicative of ownership, no action shall be maintained by a former owner, or those claiming under him, to 'recover such land, or to avoid such deed, unless commenced within said twenty years, or before January one, nineteen hundred. Such payment shall give such grantee or person claiming as aforesaid, his heirs or assigns, a right of entry and seizin in the whole, or such part, in common and undivided, of the whole tract as the deed states, or as the number of acres in the deed is to the number of acres assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u201cSec. 4.\u2019 This act shall not apply to actions between co-tenants, nor to actions now pending in court, nor to those commenced before January one, nineteen hundred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>The defendant and its licensors claimed under the second branch of the statute. They held under recorded warranty deeds describing wild lands taxed by the State, running back for more than twenty years, and, although it must be taken that the first deed of the series was executed by owners of a part interest only, that deed naturally was held by the state courts to be a repudiation of the tenancy in common and to lay a foundation for the working of the act. With that question we have nothing to do. The state treasurer\u2019s record showed that, the defendant, its licensors and those under whom they claim, had paid the taxes thereon continuously down to the bringing of this suit. The same persons had held such exclusive, peaceable, continuous and adverse possession of the land as comports with the ordinary management of wild lands in Maine, and during the same period no former owner had paid any tax or done any other act indicative of ownership. These facts are admitted or must be assumed to be established by the verdict. This action was brought in 1902 for acts done from 1900 to 1902, -after the time allowed by \u00a7 4 had run. The question is whether the statute is constitutional as applied to such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">before considering the construction of the statute we will deal with an objection which seems to be made to it, even if solely prospective as we subsequently shall explain. Suppose. that, the law gives no effect whatever to acts done before its passage, still it is suggested that when it went into operation the plaintiff but for its provision would have been in constructive possession, and the statute purported at once to \u25a0 disseize- him and to put him to an action to recover the land. But so far as the statute is prospective it merely enacts, subject to the qualification-in \u00a74, of which we shall speak in a moment, that certain acts, if done in the future, shall constitute a disseizin, and that the disseizin if continued for the due time shall ripen into title. The distinction between trespass and disseizin may be modified by statute as properly as it may be established by common law. Also statutes of limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>may be passed where formerly there were none. So far as , the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned there is nothing to hinder a State from enacting that in future the doing of such, overt <em>acts of </em>ownership as are possible on wild land, under a recorded deed which shows that the <em>actor </em>claims <em>title, </em>coupled with payment of the taxes, the owner meantime not paying them, and' doing no act indicative of ownership, shall constitute a disseizin, or that such disseizin if continued long enough shall bar an action for the land. We think it unnecessary to cite the state .decisions .on similar statutes or to' argue that proposition at greater length. See <em>Leffingwell </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>2 Black, 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The main argument for the plaintiff is that if, as was the. fact, the defendant had maintained the statutory occupation for' the twenty years before the passage of the act, the statute purported retrospectively to give it the title, or, if the statute \u25a0 did not go to that length, that at least it counted the fifteen years, preceding the enactment with the five following it to January 1,1900, in.order to make up the twenty years required by \u00a7 1, in any suit brought after that date. The former, more extreme suggestion, is answered by \u00a7 4. By the words of that section the statute did not apply to actions brought before January 1,- 1900. Therefore, if but for the statute, the plaintiff would have had . a constructive seizin and might have, declared in trespass, .he still had it during five years, and might have declared in the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The only matter requiring analysis is the question of the former owner\u2019s position after January 1, 1900, when the act applied. The action then required to be brought by the former . owner is an action <em>\u201cto </em>recover such land, or to avoid- such deed.\u201d An action to recover the land presupposes, that the former owner still is out by a continuance, up to the time when the suit,is brought, of the acts and omissions of the parties concerned respectively which are made to constitute a disseizin. The requirement that the statutory \u25a0 disseizin should continue until the action was brought is further shown, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the word \"said\u201d in the phrase \"unless-commenced within said twenty years/\u2019 to which \u201cor before January one, nineteen hundred,\u201d is the alternative. Said twenty years are the years during which the disseizor has been paying taxes and holding possession. If between 1895 and 1900 the former owner had been paying the taxes and doing acts indicative of ownership he would be seized by the very terms of the statute. He would have no occasion to sue, arid we hardly understand it to be suggested that he could be sued qn the strength of a disseizin satisfying the statute during the twenty years before it was passed, but ending in 1895. If such a suggestion should be made it would be disposed of by recalling again that for fiYe years after the. enactment, for purposes of suit at least, he stood constructively seized by force of \u00a7 4, whenever apart from the statute he would not have been disseized. Of course therefore he was not disseized retrospectively before the date of the act. It is still more absurd to suppose that the act meant that if he had paid the taxes and done acts of ownership, so- that he -was not merely constructively but actually seized during the five years, his title was to vanish when that \u2022time had elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Th\u00e9 discussion is narrowed, then, to the consideration of an action begun, as. this was, after January 1,1900, when the defendant has held that statutory possession for the five years following the act and for fifteen years before. If th\u00e9 plaintiff had brought a real action instead of the present suit, he would have been- barred if the statute is good. The plaintiff says that the counting of the fifteen: years before the enactment -makes the statute bad. But'suppose that the statute had enacted simply that if the conditions;of \u00a7 1 should be maintained from the date of the' act until January 1, 1900, and no action brought, the former owner should be barred, there can be no question that it would have been valid.- It was not and could not be argued that a statute of limitations allowing nearly five years would be unreasonably short. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>New York, </em>168 U. S. 90; <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>95 U. S, 628. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>But,, if such a statute would be constitutional, the requirement of a continuance of similar conditions for a time before the statute long enough to.make twenty continuous years' when taken with the five years following it was a pure advantage to the plaintiff, a further condition which did him only good. It was not argued that th\u00e9 statute was invalid because a less- time was allowed to persons in the plaintiff\u2019s position than to those; whose twenty years should begin to run after the statute went into effect. Similar provisions are common and seem to have been before the court in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Turner v. New York, supra, </em>and in <em>Koshkonong </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>104 U. S. 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Some objection was made <em>to </em>the effect given to a tax deed in the first part of the section. But that is not before us. We see'nothing to indicate an intent to go beyond the law. <em>Marx v. Hanthorn, </em>148 U. S. 172. \u00c1s to the possibility that the taxes may have been assessed unlawfully, or the recorded deed under which the defendant claims forged, it is. admitted that such matters might be proved. As they are public facts, give color to the overt acts done upon the land and must be accompanied by a- necessarily conscious omission of the plaintiff to. pay tajees or do any acts of ownership, we see nothing to hinder the legislature making them sufficient, <em>prima fade </em>at least, to set the-statute running and to put the former owners to a suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The act as we construe it does not infringe' the Fourteenth Amendment. We understand our construction to agree with that adopted by the Supreme Judicial Court of the State..
