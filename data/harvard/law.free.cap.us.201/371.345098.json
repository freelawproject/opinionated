This Code makes a distinction between legitimate succession, which is that which the law has established in favor of the nearest relatives Of the deceased (\u00a7 666 v.) and irregular succession which is that \u00e9stablished in favor of certain persons, or of the people of Porto Rico in the absence of legal heirs or those instituted by will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-5\">See also Code of Louisiana, New Orleans, 1861, Arts. 871-875, where the same distinction is drawn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-6\">It is a peculiar provision of the civil law that, in-view of the fact that an heir is liable for all or a share, of the debts of the deceased, he may refuse the inheritance altogether. In such a case, he is considered as not being an heir, and as never having been an heir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-7\">Thus by collocation of ideas the-words \u201csucesi\u00f3n legitima\u201d are used to designate -those of the, nearest-relatives who take the inheritance: See Resolution of June 25, 1895, in Alcubilla, Diccionario de la Administration Espa\u00f1ola, Madrid, Appendix Volume for 1895, page 795, Tit. \u201cJurisprudencia Hipotecaria y Notarial.\u201d The case is also printed in full in Scaevola,- <em>3 </em>Jurisprudencia del Cpdigo Civil, Madrid, 1901, page 213. See also Century Dictionary, \u201cSuccession.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-8\">The words \u201csucesi\u00f3n legitima\u201d are never used in the Code to designate legitimate issue, except in so far as the \u201csucesi\u00f3n legitima\u201d goes first to the descendants (Art. 930), and, in th\u00e9 absence of descendants, or' of their refusal to take, to the ascendants, and in their absence or refusal to take, to the collateral relatives.- If, therefore, a deed or will provides that the property is to go to the \u201csucesi\u00f3n legitima,\u201d then, if there are children, it necessarily means the children. But, if there be no children, it means.ascendants; and if there be no ascendants, then it means the collateral relatives.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-9\">We have an analogous use of the word \u201cheirs\u201d in our law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>See <em>Ide </em>v. <em>Ide, </em>5 Massachusetts, 500; <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Choate, </em>100 Massachusetts, 345; <em>Heath </em>v. <em>Hewitt, </em>127 N.

This law has been reenacted in the Civil Code, Art. 675.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-5\">The law has been construed in a number of decisions of the Supreme Court of Spain, reported-in the Jurisprudencia Civil.

The plain meaning of the words used in a will is always presumed to be their meaning, and the burden of proof that they are used in another sense is upon the party claiming so. See <em>Aspden\u2019s </em>\u2022Estate, Fed. Cas. No. 589; <em>Daley </em>v. <em>James, 8 </em>Wheat. 534; <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Shrieve, </em>3 Mason, 391.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-7\">It is also invariably, so held in the States where the civil law similar to that of Porto Rico is in force, as, for example, in.Louisiana and California. <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>27 California, 439, 450; <em>Sharpe </em>v. <em>Kleinberter, 7 </em>La. Ann. 264.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\">In construing a will, the words are to be construed according to their -natural import, unless the context evidently points out that in the particular instance there should be some other construction. <em>Sheriff </em>v. <em>Brown, 5 </em>Mackey, 172; <em>In re Hallet, 8 </em>Paige, 378; <em>Puryear </em>v. <em>Edmonson, </em>4 Heisk, 51. A testator must be presumed to have used words in their ordinary primary sense or meaning. <em>In re Woodward, </em>117 N. Y. 522. All doubts are to be resolved in favor of the testator\u2019s having said exactly' what he meant. <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Bunn, </em>46 N. J. Eq. 131. Where the provisions of the will are clear and simple, no reason exists for taking the testator\u2019s words in ahy other than their natural sense. <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Lockwood, </em>86 N.

The question in expounding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>will is, not what the testator meant, but what is the meaning of the words used by him. <em>Barrow\u2019s Appeal </em>(Pa.), 8 Cent.

The will was drawn by a notary public, an officer held in high respect in Porto Rico, and appointed for his knowledge of the law of conveyancing and drafting of wills. The words were therefore used in their technical legal sense.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-7\"><em>Mr. </em>AL <em>B. K.

The rule in our own law is firmly fixed. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Portland Asylum, 123 </em>U. S. 707; <em>Kenaday v. Sinnott, </em>179 U. S. 616.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-9\">There are numerous decisions of the Supreme Court of Spain in which almost the same language is used. <em>Cayetano Codina </em>v. <em>Felipe Codina, </em>Sentence of June 30, 1866, Jurisprudencia Civil, vol. 14, p. 237; <em>Romero </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>Sentence of Dec. 10, 1866, Juris.

War Department translation, arts. 956, 958.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-6\">It would not give due weight and meaning to the use by the testator of the word \u201clegitimate\u201d in connection with the word \u201csucesi\u00f3n,\u201d because in the paragraph in question the word \u201clegitimate\u201d would be superfluous as modifying the general term \u201cheirs,\u201d while it becomes important as a limiting word if it modifies \u201cissue.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-7\">That these trust provisions under the term \u201cfideicomiso\u201d were common in the Spanish law were recognized as valid when not creating a perpetuity and their meaning and construction well determined, see the Sentencia of.the Supreme Court of Spain in <em>Moya </em>v. <em>Moya, </em>April 22, 1865, Juris. Civ., vol. 11, p, 534.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b399-8\">Mr. Justice Holmes</author>\n<p id=\"AAg\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">This is a bill for the partition of real estate in which the female plaintiff claims one undivided eighth as heir to her daughter Felipa Benicia, who died an infant without issue. This df-:ghter got her title under the will of Thomas Jos\u00e9 Ramirez, and the question is whether, in the event which happened, her share went to her mother by descent or to her fellow devisees by the terms of the will. The other devisees all were living at her death. The case was heard upon a plea setting up the foregoing facts, together with the will, and the bill was dismissed. Thereupon the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The material clause of the will is as follows: \u201cTrece. \u2014 Et remanente de mis bienes, derechos y acciones lo lego con cahdad de fideicomiso y que acrezcan las demas, caso de fallecimiento sin sucesi\u00f3n legitima, .por iguales partes, a mis sobrinas' Do\u00f1a Cornelia y Do\u00f1a Antonia Mart\u00ednez, Do\u00f1a Monserrate, Do\u00f1a Obdulia, Do\u00f1a Encarnaci\u00f3n, Do\u00f1\u00e1 Angela y Do\u00f1a Concesi\u00f3n Ramirez de Arellano y Felipa Benicia mi hija de crianza,\u201d etc. We vary slightly the translation in the record. \u201cThe remainder of my goods, rights and actions I bequeath in the character of fideicommissum and that the other [shares] may [profit \u2019by] accretion, in case of death without <em>sucesi\u00f3n legitima, </em>by equal parts to my nieces [named] and Felipa Benicia my foster child, who shall adopt my surname,\u201d with appointment of a guardian for the last, a provision for her education, and a request that when that is finished she return to live with the said nieces.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">It is agreed that it is possible for \u201csucesi\u00f3n legitima\u201d to mean either issue or. lawful heirs. If it means the latter, the mother inherited, as she was the lawful heir. If it means the former, then, by the terms of the will, Felipa Benicia\u2019s share went to the testator\u2019s nieces when she died. It seems to us too plain to need extended elucidation that \u201c sucesi\u00f3n legitima\u201d here means issue. The argument on the other- side that the purpose is merely to prevent an escheat by making the nieces and Filipa Benicia reciprocal successors, to impose a fetter on free alienation and to enhance th\u00e9 dowry of the nieces, strikes us as fanciful. The natural object of this fideicommissary substitution is that which is said to be its object, to secure accretion among the shares. But that purpose would pretty nearly vanish into thin air if death without heirs'were the event in view. For each of the \"nieces being heir to all the .others, accretion among, them would be excluded. It is argued, to be sure, that they might repudiate- the inheritance and then claim under the will, if any of the nieces died heavily in debt. Whether- this would be true by Spanish law we need not inquire. For such remote explanations must be rejected when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>the will offers a different and more obvious one upon its face. And while if is pressed that substitutions are strictly construed in favor of the first taker, we do not understand that or any other rule of construction to requires perversion of language, or to govern a case where the second taker stands on an equal footing with the first in the testator\u2019s mind, with equal mutual chances, and when the .plainly expressed- purpose is to create an artificial class, with cross limitations in case of death without a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">A suggestion is made by an afterthought, in a. brief filed since the argument, that the testator could not exclude the mother of Felipa from her right, as necessary or forced heir, to two-thirds of Felipa\u2019s share. The suggestion comes too late. No such claim was set up in the bill, or, so far as appears, in the court below. ' Therefore we shall not consider at length whether, in case of a pure gratuity to one to whom the testator was under no legal obligation, the Spanish law entitled a forced heir to claim against the words of a gift like this. The texts cited are no.t sufficient to establish the proposition, and the contrary seems to be shown by Ley 10, Tit. 4, Part. 6, and note 13, Madrid ed. 1848. See also 4 Escriche, 1051, 1052, sub. v. Substituci\u00f3n Fideicomisaria, ad fin. On the whole case the plaintiffs must abide by the construction and the law in which, it would' seem from the bill, they have acquiesced for thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
