His sentence falls at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-17\">We ordinarily review sentences for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence within the guidelines range is afforded a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). However, because Johnson raised no objections to the guidelines range or his sentence in the district court, our review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-22\">Johnson argues that his sentence was greater than necessary and should not be presumed reasonable because the guidelines were not developed using an empirical approach, and because there is an unwarranted disparity between the Guidelines for cocaine base and powder cocaine. This court does not require \u201cdiscarding the presumption for sentences based on non-empirically-grounded guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357 (5th Cir.2009). Johnson\u2019s arguments do not overcome the presumption; it follows that he fails to show plain error. <em>See Puckett v. U.S., </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
