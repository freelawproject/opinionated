The district court enhanced Castillo\u2019s offense level, pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) (enhancement for a prior drug trafficking offense), based upon Castillo\u2019s prior New Mexico conviction for trafficking a controlled substance by possession, with intent to distribute, cocaine. The court imposed a 30-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Castillo contests that enhancement, claiming his New Mexico conviction is not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d for \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B)\u2019s purposes because New Mexico law allows the \u201cintent to distribute\u201d element to be inferred from the drug quantity involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Although post <em>-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guidelines sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">Under the categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), a district court must look to the elements of a prior offense, not the facts underlying the conviction, when classifying that offense for sentence-enhancement purposes. <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273 (5th Cir.2005). In a \u201cnarrow range of cases\u201d, such as when determining whether a prior conviction was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d, a district court may look beyond the elements of the offense. <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Even where the court looks beyond those elements, however, it is \u201cnot free to consider any facts, but may consider the statutory definition of the offense, the charging paper, and the jury instructions\u201d. <em>Id. </em>A district court may not rely solely on the presentence investigation report\u2019s characterization of the prior offense in applying an enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">In <em>United States v. Lopez-Salas, </em>513 F.3d 174, 180 (5th Cir.2008), our court held: to qualify as a drug-trafficking offense under the Guidelines, the relevant statute must include \u201cintent to distribute\u201d as an element; and, that element must be proven and not implied. Castillo\u2019s reliance on <em>Lopez-Salas </em>is misplaced, because the statute at issue includes \u201cintent to distribute\u201d as an element of the offense that must be proven. <em>See </em>N.M. Stat. Ann. 1978 \u00a7 30-31-20(A)(3) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
