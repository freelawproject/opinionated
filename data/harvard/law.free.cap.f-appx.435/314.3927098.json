Liberally construing Ferrari\u2019s pro se brief,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we discern that Ferrari assigns two points of error: (1) the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> failed to thoroughly analyze aspects of Ferrari\u2019s medical record, and (2) the psychologist\u2019s report relied upon by the ALJ contained inaccurate and character-damaging information that biased the evaluation of Ferrari\u2019s disability claim. These arguments were not raised below, however, and this court ordinarily does not consider evidence or arguments that were not presented to the district court. <em>Castillo v. Barnhart, </em>325 F.3d 550, 553 (5th Cir.2003). Ferrari has not alleged any \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d explaining his failure to present these arguments below, which, \u201cin the interests of justice,\u201d would persuade this court to review the issues he now raises for the first time. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-23\">Ferrari also attaches to his appellate brief medical documentation that was not included in the certified administrative transcript. Our review is limited to the record made before the ALJ,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we can only remand<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the taking of new evidence when it is material and there is \u201cgood cause ... shown for the failure to incorporate the evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Bowen, </em>809 F.2d 1054, 1058 (5th Cir.1987); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Having examined Ferrari\u2019s additional evidence, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>it does not satisfy the statutory standard for remand because it is either cumulative of other record evidence, immaterial in that it is unlikely to have changed the ALJ\u2019s decision, or both. <em>See Pierre v. Sullivan, </em>884 F.2d 799, 803 (5th Cir.1989) (citations omitted). Ferrari particularly relies upon a \u201cMedical Source Statement of Ability To Do Work-Related Activities (Physical)\u201d rendered in June 2008, approximately eight months after Ferrari\u2019s October 2007 hearing before the ALJ, but we have rejected as immaterial new evidence that does not relate to a claimant\u2019s condition at the time of the disability application or hearing. <em>See Haywood v. Sullivan, </em>888 F.2d 1463, 1471-72 (5th Cir.1989). Thus, remand in light of Ferrari\u2019s additional evidence is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-18\">. <em>See Abdul-Alim Amin v. Universal Life Ins. Co. of Memphis, Tenn., </em>706 F.2d 638, 640 n. 1 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-19\">. The ALJ\u2019s decision became the Commissioner\u2019s final decision when the Social Security Administration Appeals Council declined to review the ALJ\u2019s determination. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1429 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b336-25\">. <em>Ellis v.

We note that Ferrari does not seek remand for the Commissioner to review his newly presented medical evidence, but asks this court to consider the evidence in the first instance. We are precluded from doing so by statute. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Ellis, </em>820 F.2d at 684.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
