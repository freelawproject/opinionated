The district court sentenced him to 70 months in prison, within the guidelines range of 70 to 87 months. Saenz-Ramirez challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that his sentencing range was greater than necessary to meet 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals of providing just punishment, that it overstated the seriousness of his offense, and that it failed to take into account mitigating factors. Specifically, Saenz-Ramirez argues that his offense of reentry was \u201cat bottom, an international trespass.\u201d He continues that \u00a7 2L1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines places heavy emphasis on a prior conviction, counting it for both criminal history and the 16-level enhancement. He also argues that his disadvantaged background, prison record, cultural assimilation, and desire to be with his family all mitigate the seriousness of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">We review sentences for reasonableness, employing a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, and we presume that a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range is reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). The purported double-counting and lack of empirical basis for \u00a7 2L1.2 do not necessarily render a within-guidelines sentence unreasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). We likewise see no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s rejection of Saenz-Ramirez\u2019s contention that illegal reentry \u2014 a federal felony carrying significant criminal penalties \u2014 is merely an international trespass, nor do we discern any improper weighing of the other factors cited by Saenz-Ramirez, including his personal history and characteristics. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. The district court considered Saenz-Ramirez\u2019s arguments, the facts of the case, and the appropriate statutory sentencing factors before concluding that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. That determination is owed deference, and Saenz-Ramirez\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s assessment of those factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">As Saenz-Ramirez concedes, his contention that because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based, the presumption of reasonableness should not apply, is foreclosed. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 530-31; <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). As he further concedes, his argument that the lack of a \u201cfast-track\u201d disposition program in the Western District of Texas creates an unwarranted sentencing disparity is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-64 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
