Specifically, Jennings claims the clerk\u2019s failure to deliver two documents Jennings requested was deliberate and violated the integrity of the discovery process. After reviewing the record and briefs, we affirm the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-24\">Under Rule 37, \u201cif a party or a party\u2019s officer, director, or managing agent \u2014 or a witness ... fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery ..., the court where the action is pending may issue\u201d orders imposing sanctions. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(A). Rule 37 also provides that, unless the failure was justified, the court must order \u201cthe disobedient party, the at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>torney advising that party, or both\u201d to pay expenses. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 37(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Jennings\u2019s motion for sanctions. Rule 37 does not allow the relief sought by Jennings because the clerk was not a party to the litigation. Furthermore, the record fully supports the conclusion that the clerk complied with the court\u2019s orders and provided Jennings with the requested documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-17\">. Jennings lists several other issues, including a substantive constitutional claim, under the \"Statement of Issues\u201d section in his brief. He fails to argue these issues in his brief and has thus abandoned them for purposes of this appeal. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that \"issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b893-27\">. We review dismissals under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37 for abuse of discretion. <em>Gratton v. Great Am.
