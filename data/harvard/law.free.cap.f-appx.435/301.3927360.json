We need not decide that question, however, because his claim fails under the abuse-of-discretion standard of review applied to properly preserved challenges to the reasonableness of a sentence, as discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-23\">Although <em>post-Booker </em>(2005), the Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). As noted, Juarez does not claim procedural error in calculating his sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">A properly calculated within-guidelines sentence, as in this instance, is presumed reasonable. <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>550 F.3d 382, 405 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 54, 175 L.Ed.2d 44 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). To rebut that presumption, Juarez must show the district court failed to account for a sentencing factor that should have been accorded substantial weight, gave substantial weight to an \u201cirrelevant or improper factor\u201d, or made \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors\u201d. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Juarez has not met this standard. His claims concerning the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors amount to a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of these factors and the appropriateness of his within-guidelines sentence. This disagreement does <em>not </em>suffice to show error in connection with his sentence. <em>See id.; United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008) (upholding presumption of reasonableness of within-guidelines sentence where appellant claimed Guidelines overstated the seriousness of his offense). He has not shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable, nor has he rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Armstrong, 550 F.3d </em>at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
