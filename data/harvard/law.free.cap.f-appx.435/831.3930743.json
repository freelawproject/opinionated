On appeal, Perry does not challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his suit, but instead argues the merits of his complaint that he was denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>his federal civil right to a college education.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), and view the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). <em>Pro se </em>pleadings are construed liberally. <em>Id. </em>at 1160. However, issues not briefed on appeal are deemed abandoned. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">A court shall dismiss a case proceeding <em>in forma paupens </em>\u201cat any time if the court determines that ... the action ... fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the grounds for the court\u2019s jurisdiction, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new jurisdictional support.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Perry has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted by failing to raise that issue in his appellate brief. Moreover, the district court did not err in dismissing Perry\u2019s complaint without prejudice because Perry did not assert any federal constitutional or statutory violation in his complaint. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
