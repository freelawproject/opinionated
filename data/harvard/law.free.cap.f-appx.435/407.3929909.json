He now appeals, arguing that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>erred by ordering that his federal sentence run consecutively to any sentence that might be imposed in a pending state criminal case. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal based on a waiver contained in Castro\u2019s post-plea sentencing agreement, or for summary affirmance on the basis of binding circuit precedent. Alternatively, the Government seeks an extension of time to file a brief. Castro argues that the waiver does not bar the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">We need not reach the disputed waiver issue because, as Castro concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006), in which we held that a district court may order a term of imprisonment to run consecutively to a yet-to-be-imposed state sentence. Despite Castro\u2019s arguments that <em>Brown </em>was incorrectly decided, <em>Brown </em>remains the law of this circuit, as we held in <em>United States v. Setser, </em>607 F.3d 128, 131-32 (5th Cir.2010), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2988, 180 L.Ed. 821, 2011 WL 2297806 (2011). Although the Supreme Court has granted a writ of certiorari in <em>Setser, </em>this court is bound to follow precedent even when certiorari has been granted. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 808 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motions to dismiss and, alternatively, for an extension of time are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
