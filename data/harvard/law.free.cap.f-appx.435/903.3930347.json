Specifically, he alleged that members of the Bolivarian Circles (a militant organization that supports the Venezuelan government), attacked him and his family on two separate occasions. On appeal, Prato-Higuera argues that the IJ and BIA erred by wrongly finding: (1) that he lacked credibility, and (2) that, alternatively, he had not suffered persecution at the hands of the Bolivarian Circles.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">\u201cWhen the BIA issues a decision, we review the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the BIA has expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cInsofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006). Administrative factual findings, including credibility determinations, are reviewed under the highly deferential substantial evidence test. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1230-31. Under that test, we must affirm a factual finding if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">To establish asylum eligibility, an applicant must prove that he or she is a \u201crefugee\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1); <em>see also Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. A refugee must (1) have suffered past persecution on account of his or her social group, political opinion, or any other protected ground, or (2) possess a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his or her social group, political opinion, or any other protected ground will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b), <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cTo establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that []he was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">\u201c[P]ersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations marks omitted). We have held that a detention does not constitute persecution where the applicant suffered only minor injuries as a result of that detention. <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008). When an alien cannot meet the requirements for asylum, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>is generally precluded from qualifying under the more stringent standard for withholding. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33. Moreover, to be entitled to withholding of removal, an alien must establish that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened ... because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Upon a thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Prato-Higuera failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, according to his testimony, Prato-Higuera received only \u201cslight blows\u201d in the first attack, and his car was only slightly damaged in the second attack. Even when coupled with the alleged death threats, these incidents of mild violence do not compel the conclusion that Prato-Higuera suffered persecution that entitles him to asylum. <em>See Djonda, </em>514 F.3d at 1174 (\u201cminor beating\u201d resulting in \u201cscratches and bruises\u201d does not compel conclusion that applicant suffered past persecution); <em>see also Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (\u201cmenacing telephone calls and [verbal] threats ... do not rise to the level of past persecution\u201d). Furthermore, although Prato-Higuera argues that the agency erred by failing to reference the State Department\u2019s Country Report for Venezuela, that report does not support his claim for asylum, but instead states that there were no reports of government-sponsored politically motivated killings or disappearances in Venezuela in 2008. As a result, the agency did not err in its finding that Prato-Higuera was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33 (failure to meet standards for asylum also generally determines failure to meet more stringent standards for withholding of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">For these reasons, we affirm the agency\u2019s denial of Prato-Higuera\u2019s claim for asylum and withholding of removal. As a result, we must also affirm the denial of Ramirez-Molina\u2019s claim for asylum as a derivative beneficiary of her husband\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-7\">. Ramirez-Molina seeks relief as a derivative beneficiary of Prato-Higuera\u2019s asylum application, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3)(A). Luis Alfredo Prato was originally a party to this appeal as well, however a panel of this Court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss Prato after the BIA reopened his removal proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-12\">. The IJ also denied relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u2018\u2018CAT\u2019\u2019), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16. However, Prato-Higuera has waived any argument regarding his entitlement to CAT relief by failing to argue the merits of this issue on appeal. <em>See Estate of McCall ex rel. McCall v. United States, </em>642 F.3d 944, 952 n. 4 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"ALg\"><em>. </em>Although Prato-Higuera challenges the agency's credibility determination, we need not address that finding because we find that, even accepted as true, his testimony fails to establish his eligibility for asylum. <em>See Tang v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1275 n. 3 (11th Cir.2009) (Court may affirm on any ground supported by record, at least where as here \u201cgovernment expressly asked\u201d for affirmance on such grounds).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
