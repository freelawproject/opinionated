The BIA concluded that Straker\u2019s motion, which was his second motion to reopen, was untimely and number-barred. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). He argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010), undermined the grounds for the BIA\u2019s removal order because it established that his prior misdemeanor drug convictions did not qualify as aggravated felonies. Straker also asserts that the state\u2019s classification of his offenses as misdemeanors is controlling and that his convictions were too remote to be the bases for the denial of his request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-23\">Straker does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that his second motion to reopen was untimely or time-barred. Instead, he presents arguments that concern the validity of the BIA\u2019s January 2007 order of removal. Thus, because Straker has not addressed the basis on which his second motion to reopen was denied, he has abandoned the relevant issue for review by failing to brief it. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). His petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
