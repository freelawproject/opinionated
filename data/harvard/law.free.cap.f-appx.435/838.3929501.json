Geer claims his counsel, Ed Shohat, was ineffective for denying his right to testify at trial. We previously remanded this case so that the district court could hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the performance prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test was violated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). After hearing conflicting testimony from both Geer and Shohat, the district court found that Shohat more likely than not followed his normal practice and advised Geer of his right to choose whether he wished to testify. The district court further found that Shohat convinced Geer not to take the stand because of Geer\u2019s prior drug conspiracy convictions. \u201c[I]f counsel believes that it would be unwise for the defendant to testify, counsel may, and indeed should, advise the client in the strongest possible terms not to testify.\u201d <em>United States v. Teague, </em>953 F.2d 1525, 1533 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">After reviewing the record we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s findings of historical facts. <em>See Gallego v. United States, </em>174 F.3d 1196, 1198 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cIt is perfectly legitimate for the district court to find, based on all the evidence in the record, that a defendant\u2019s testimony about his participation in a drug scheme is not credible.\u201d). And we further find no error in the determination by the district court that Geer failed to make a substantial showing that Shohat deprived him of the right to testify in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Geer\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-8\">. <em>Geer v.
