His sentence was enhanced, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), based on a conviction for a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d <em>to-wit, </em>distribution and possession with intent to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). Manzanares argues that the district court plainly erred in applying the enhancement without analyzing the \u201celements of the New Jersey statute ... under which Manzanares was convicted\u201d to determine \u201cwhat elements made it a \u2018drug trafficking\u2019 offense for purpose of the 16 point enhancement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-25\">As he acknowledges, Manzanares failed to object to the enhancement, so review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 351 (5th Cir.2008). To show plain error, Manzanares must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-26\">Manzanares was not convicted under a state statute, but rather a federal statute. The federal court records reflect that Manzanares pleaded guilty to an indictment charging that he \u201cdid knowingly and intentionally distribute and possess with intent to distribute 100 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing heroin.\u201d Manzanares does not argue that his federal conviction does not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d but even if he did, it would be unavailing, because a conviction under \u00a7 841 is a drug-trafficking offense for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). <em>See United States v. Huitron, </em>173 Fed.Appx. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>340, 340-41 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, Manzanares has failed to show that the district court plainly erred in applying the enhancement. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Manzanares also challenges the sentence imposed following the revocation of supervised release regarding his federal heroin-distribution charge in New Jersey, claiming the sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not sufficiently state reasons for selecting the sentence. He also asserts that the life-term sentence of supervised release is unreasonable given the circumstances of his case. As Manzanares acknowledges, this claim is also reviewed for plain error, because he failed to object. <em>See United States. v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Although the district court did not expressly state that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court\u2019s comments implicitly indicate that it considered the \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant ... the need for the sentence imposed ... to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct ... [and] to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B), (C); <em>see also Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-65. Furthermore, Manzanares\u2019s life term of supervised release is authorized by statute, <em>see </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h), so the sentence is \u201cclearly legal.\u201d <em>See United States v. Pena, </em>125 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, there is no plain error with regard to the sentence. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
