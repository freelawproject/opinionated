Portillo, a native and citizen of El Salvador, entered the United States in December 1984, as an alien who had neither been admitted nor paroled. An IJ found Portillo removable as charged, denying his request for withholding of removal and CAT protection. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, finding that there was no established nexus between Portillo\u2019s past experiences and a protected ground, because his experiences in the military did not constitute harm on account of a protected ground. Additionally, the BIA concluded that Portillo was able to avoid further contact with the guerillas who went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>his house twice by living elsewhere in El Salvador, and that his fear of persecution was reduced because his family resided there unharmed. With respect to his application for CAT relief, the BIA found that Portillo failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government, and thus, was not eligible for CAT relief, and denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">On appeal, Portillo argues that the denial of his application for withholding of removal was erroneous based upon the evidence presented, because the nexus between his political opinion and persecution by gangs was not properly considered, given that while he served in the military he made his political opinions known. Alternatively, Portillo argues that former Salvadoran military veterans facing persecution by gangs is a social group deserving of protection because they possess a shared past. Portillo contends that the denial of his application for CAT relief was erroneously denied based upon the evidence of his cousin\u2019s death and the two instances when guerillas came to his home. Lastly, Portillo argues that because he lacked effective assistance of counsel, he should be permitted to argue that he had the requisite ten year physical presence for application of cancellation of removal and that the late filing of his asylum application should be excused as a result of extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In a case where the BIA issues its own opinion, we review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>Under the substantial evidence standard, we view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">To qualify for withholding <em>of </em>removal, an applicant must establish that if returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The burden of proof is on the applicant. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(C). An alien may satisfy his burden of proof for withholding of removal in two ways. First, an alien may establish past persecution based on a protected ground. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006). If the applicant establishes past persecution based at least in part on an enumerated ground, it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to that country, unless the government shows by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom no longer would be threatened; or (2) it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate to another part of the country. <em>Id. </em>Second, an alien may establish that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted upon removal based on a protected ground. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">An alien must also establish a \u201cnexus\u201d between the feared persecution and a statutorily protected ground. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004). An alien cannot show that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted if the agency finds the alien could avoid future threats by safely relocating to another part of his country. <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375 (citing <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003)). We have emphasized that the \u201cparticular social group\u201d language within the INA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>list of protected grounds should not serve as a \u201ccatch all\u201d for all persons alleging persecution who do not fit elsewhere. <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1197-98 (11th Cir.2006). A group may qualify as a particular social group only .if it has both immutability and social visibility, while also accounting for numerosity concerns. <em>See id. </em>at 1194-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">We have held that persecution requires \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u201d and that \u201cmere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005). Dangers faced in the performance of military duties, as a result of that status alone, do not constitute harm or threat of harm on account of a protected ground, because such dangers are perils arising from the nature of the alien\u2019s employment rather than on account of immutable characteristics. <em>See Matter of Fuentes, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 658, 661-62 (BIA 1988). Any claim of future persecution is further diminished when the alien\u2019s family continues to reside in the native country without incident. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258-59 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We lack jurisdiction to consider claims not raised before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider Portillo\u2019s claims pertaining to ineffective assistance of counsel, as he failed to raise these issues before the BIA. In failing to present those claims to the BIA, Portillo did not exhaust his administrative remedies, and as a result, we cannot consider those arguments. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (prohibiting review of unexhausted claims); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that we lack jurisdiction to consider claims not raised before the BIA). Portillo has failed to exhaust any argument relating to persecution based upon his political opinion, because he failed to present this argument to the BIA or identify his specific political opinion. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">With respect to Portillo\u2019s claim based upon membership in a particular social group as a former member of the military, there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s finding that Portillo did not suffer past persecution. The BIA correctly determined that the proposed social group of former Salvadoran military members was too broad, because protection is not afforded to those exposed to risks normally associated with employment in occupations such as the military. <em>See Matter of Fuentes, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. at 662. Additionally, the proposed social group would serve as a catch-all for every former military member who did not fall within one of the five protected groups, creating numerosity concerns, and thus, it is too broad. <em>Castillo-A\u00f1as, </em>446 F.3d at 1197-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">As the BIA correctly found, Portillo failed to establish past persecution, because the two instances when guerillas came to speak with him did not rise to the level of persecution. Persecution requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230. Moreover, Portillo\u2019s testimony and multiple return trips for extended periods of time without further harassment demonstrates his ability to live elsewhere in El Salvador, and thus he cannot demonstrate that he would be persecuted on a protected ground. <em>See Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Portillo did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Portillo returned to El Salvador on numer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>ous occasions without receiving threats from guerillas or gangs. Because the record does not compel a finding that Portillo suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of persecution, the BIA properly denied his claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">To be eligible for relief under the CAT, the applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1239 (11th Cir.2007). The regulations plainly require that such torture be \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">There is substantial evidence in the record to support the BIA\u2019s determination that Portillo did not suffer harm amounting to past persecution based on the guerillas visiting his home, or possess a well-founded fear of future persecution, as discussed above. Further, Portillo did not offer any evidence indicating that he would be tortured by, at the instigation of, or with the acquiescence of the government or a public official. <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1239. Therefore, Portillo has failed to establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to El Salvador. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the BIA did not err in denying Portillo CAT relief. Accordingly, we deny Portillo\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
