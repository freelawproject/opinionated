Cardenas argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to explain why it did not order his federal sentence to run concurrently with any state sentence that might be imposed for pending state charges against him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-22\">We review sentences for reasonableness, which is deferential standard of review for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-23\">Cardenas\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable. At the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that it had considered the parties\u2019 statements, the presentence investigation report, and the statutory factors for sentencing, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court imposed the sentence requested by the parties. Cardenas later requested that the district court provide him credit for time served in state custody awaiting trial on state charges, but Cardenas did not request that his federal sentence run concurrently with any future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>state sentence. The district court\u2018did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
