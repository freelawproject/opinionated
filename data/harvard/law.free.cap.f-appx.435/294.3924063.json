Taylor argues that the district court wrongly concluded that she was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. She asserts that she fully disclosed all relevant information and that she was not required to volunteer or admit affirmatively relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction. She contends that her case is extraordinary, and she therefore should have been granted a reduction for acceptance of responsibility even though she also received an enhancement for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">A defendant\u2019s offense level may be reduced by as many as three levels if the defendant \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1. Conduct resulting in an enhancement for obstruction of justice \u201cordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4). However, a defendant can receive adjustments under both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 in an \u201cextraordinary\u201d ease. <em>Id. </em>We review a determination of acceptance of responsibility with even greater deference than under a clearly erroneous standard; the district court\u2019s ruling on acceptance of responsibility \u201cshould not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2003) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The record supports that Taylor was not fully forthcoming concerning her knowledge of relevant conduct. The record specifically\u2019 shows that Taylor falsely denied knowing that counterfeit bills were being manufactured in her home, disingenuously suggested that the counterfeit bills used in her offense originated from a source other than her home, and refused to elaborate on circumstances surrounding her offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (nn.1 &amp; 3); <em>United States v. Nevarez-Arreola, </em>885 F.2d 243, 246 (5th Cir.1989) (noting that defendant\u2019s failure to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding offense may be considered in evaluating defendant\u2019s sincerity in claiming acceptance of responsibility). <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>237 F.3d 693, 695 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that district court properly denied acceptance of responsibility where defendant falsely denied relevant conduct). The record also indicates that Taylor refused to accept personal responsibility for the circumstances leading to her conviction, and instead attempted to impede her prosecution by attacking Government officials and accusing them of behaving maliciously. Taylor furthermore has not set forth any grounds upon which we can conclude that her case is \u201cextraordinary\u201d and that she should be granted a reduction for acceptance of responsibility despite receiving an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice for her obstreperous conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4). Accordingly, the district court properly determined that Taylor was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">Taylor also argues that the district court plainly erred by using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.1 to determine her base offense level. She asserts that \u00a7 2B5.1 applies only where counterfeited objects have been falsely made in their entirety, and that her of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>fense involved genuine notes that were altered. She therefore asserts that her base offense level should have been determined under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. The Government concedes that the district court should have utilized \u00a7 2B1.1, rather than under \u00a7 2B5.1, and that the district court\u2019s error affected Taylor\u2019s substantial rights. However, the Government argues that this court should decline to exercise its discretion to correct the error because it did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Because this issue is raised for the first time on appeal, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Alvarado-Santilano, </em>434 F.3d 794, 795 (5th Cir.2005). To show plain error, Taylor must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects her substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If Taylor makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The record indicates that the counterfeit bills in this case were false high-denomination notes that began as genuine small-denomination notes, and which were modified through bleaching and reprinting. Thus, because the bills were altered notes rather than notes that were made in their entirety, the district court should have applied \u00a7 2B1.1, rather than \u00a7 2B5.1. <em>See United States v. Dison, </em>330 Fed.Appx. 56, 59-63 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Owen, </em>347 Fed.Appx. 69, 72-73 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s application of the wrong guideline was error that was clear or obvious in light of <em>Dison </em>and <em>Owen. See Dison, </em>330 Fed.Appx. at 59-63; <em>Owen, </em>347 Fed.Appx. at 72-73. Although those cases was decided after Taylor was sentenced, the error need only be plain at the time of appellate consideration. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>293 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Moreover, because the district court\u2019s error caused the imposition of a sentence that was substantially higher than the correct advisory guidelines range, Taylor has shown a reasonable probability that, but for the district court\u2019s misapplication of the Guidelines, she would have received a lesser sentence. <em>See United States v. Jasso, </em>587 F.3d 706, 713 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 365 (5th Cir.2005). Contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, this error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See United States v. John, </em>597 F.3d 263, 285-89 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Villegas, </em>404 F.3d at 364-65. Accordingly, we vacate sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
