California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Nunes has not filed a response. Counsel\u2019s brief fails to comply with <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229, 232-33 (5th Cir.2011), in which we admonished that an <em>Anders </em>brief should address every applicable item on this court\u2019s <em>Anders </em>checklist, with reference to the facts of the proceedings and citation to the record and relevant legal authority. The brief in this case fails to address all relevant issues and glosses over omissions in the rearraignment colloquy. Although <em>Flores </em>teaches that such a facially inadequate brief should be dismissed, we grant the <em>Anders </em>motion in the interest of judicial economy because it is apparent from the record that this appeal does not involve a nonfrivolous issue. The FPD is directed that future <em>Anders </em>filings should comply with <em>Flores. </em>Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
