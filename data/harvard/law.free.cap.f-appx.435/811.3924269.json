Kivisto claims the district court erred when it found his complaint was within the scope of an arbitration agreement he entered into with the NFLPA because there was no \u201cclear and unmistakable evidence\u201d he agreed to arbitrate the expiration of his agent certification, or that the certification expiration clause is valid under the CBA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-19\">\u201cEmployees claiming breach of a collective bargaining agreement ... are bound by that agreement\u2019s terms providing a method for resolving disputes between them and their employer.\u201d <em>Mason v. Continental Group, Inc., </em>763 F.2d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir.1985). When an employee asserts an arbitrable grievance, but has not attempted to utilize the dispute resolution available to him under the agreement, his independent suit must be dismissed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-20\">The district court did not err in dismissing Kivisto\u2019s complaint. When Kivisto signed his Application for Certification as an NFLPA Contract Advisor, he agreed to abide by the arbitration procedures set forth in the NFLPA Regulations. Section 5(A)(4) of the NFLPA Regulations requires arbitration to be the exclusive method for resolving any and all disputes arising out of \u201cany other activities of a Contract Advisor within the scope of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Regulations.\u201d The broad scope of \u00a7 5(A)(4) covers the revocation of Kivisto\u2019s agent certification under \u00a7 2G. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting NFLPA\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-16\">. Kivisto makes several additional arguments regarding the scope of the arbitration clause found in \u00a7 5A(4) of the NFLPA Regulations. Specifically, he claims: (1) Section 5A(4) does not apply to the certification expiration clause, Agent Regulations \u00a7 2G, because \u00a7 2G is not a revocation or suspension within the meaning of the arbitration clause, (2) the arbitration clause concerns a suspension or revocation for cause, where as \u00a7 2G is not for cause, and (3) Section 5A(4) only applies to agent activities, whereas \u00a7 2G deals with agent inactivity. Additionally, Kivisto argues his arbitration appeal did not show consent to arbitrate the dispute, because he specifically reserved all of his rights in his arbitration brief, including his right to have the matters heard by a federal court. We find these claims lack merit and decline to address them here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b833-22\">. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of an agreement to arbitrate, and whether it binds parties to arbitrate de novo. <em>MONY Securities Corp. v. Bornstein, </em>390 F.3d 1340, 1342 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b834-18\">. We note that after the district court entered its order, the NFLPA renounced its collective bargaining rights and no longer regulates NFL agents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
