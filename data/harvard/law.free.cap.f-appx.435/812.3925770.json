In his motion, Parra-Mercado requested the court to compel the government to file a motion for a sentencing reduction based on his substantial assistance, pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(b), even though the government retained the \u201csole and unreviewable\u201d discretion whether to do so under the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court can compel the government to file a substantial assistance motion. <em>See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1993). Generally, the government has the power, but not the duty, to file a motion to reduce sentence when a defendant has provided substantial assistance to the government. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. McNeese, </em>547 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir.2008). The government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion can be reviewed by the district court, and the district court can grant relief, only if it finds that the government\u2019s refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive, such as race or religion. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-23\">In this case, Parra-Mercado did not allege that the government\u2019s failure to file a Rule 35(b) motion was based on his race or religion. Rather, he alleged that the government failed to do so in order to pressure his brother to testify in an unrelated case, which he asserts is a constitutionally-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>impermissible motive. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that such a motive is reviewable under <em>Wade, </em>Parra-Mercado did no more than speculate in his motion that the government \u201cmay\u201d have possessed such a motive. Thus, he has failed to make the requisite \u201csubstantial showing\u201d in this regard. <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1502. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Parra-Mercado an evidentiary hearing, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
