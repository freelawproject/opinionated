The appeal presents the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-5\">Whether the imposition of the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKt\">Nickel\u2019s objection at the sentencing hearing to the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentence required by \u00a7 2422(b) was sufficient to preserve, for appeal, his claim that the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment. The appropriate standard of review is <em>de novo. </em>Because a ten-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to this crime, his Eighth Amendment claim is without merit. For background, see <em>United States v. Brenton Farley, 607 </em>F.3d 1294 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 369, 178 L.Ed.2d 238 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
