The district court imposed a term of imprisonment of 360 months, above the United States Sentencing Guidelines advisory range of imprisonment but not above the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2251(e). Segura argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable. He asserts that the district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence was inadequate to justify the variance, that the stated reasons for the sentence were truisms present in all offenses of the type, that the district court imposed a sentence greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and that the district court ignored mitigating factors such as Segura\u2019s lack of a criminal history, his stable employment record, and the fact that the incident occurred while he was under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">We review the substantive reasonableness of Segura\u2019s non-guidelines sentence for abuse of discretion, in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). We review whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the sentence but give deference to the district court\u2019s determination that the factors justify the varianee. <em>Id. </em>In light of that deference, Segura has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion. The district court stated that the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a), particularly the nature of the offense, which the district court described as \u201cheinous,\u201d supported a sentence of the statutory maximum term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1). Specifically, the district court stated that the sentence was necessary to address Segura\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, and the need to provide an adequate and just punishment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A)-(B). The district court added that the sentence was needed to afford adequate deterrence to further criminal conduct and to protect the community at large, children, and \u201clittle girls in particular\u201d from further criminal activity by Segura. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusions. Segura admitted that he had viewed child pornography in the past, that he committed the instant offense while intoxicated, and that he was addicted to alcohol. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C). Segura also had a prior conviction for driving while intoxicated, suggesting that the alcohol addiction was relatively long-term and ongoing. The information supports the district court\u2019s determination that the sentence was needed to protect children and deter future criminal conduct by Segura. The record also supports the district court\u2019s characterization of the offense. Although the standard adjustments for specific offense characteristics were used to increase Segura\u2019s offense level in calculating the advisory guidelines range, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Crete increases did not truly capture the nature of the specific characteristics or the cumulative resulting nature of the whole offense. Not only was the child under 12, but she was only 3 years of age. Not only did the offense involve sexual contact or a sexual act, but Segura placed his penis in the toddler\u2019s mouth. Not only was the child in his care at that moment, but, as the mother\u2019s live-in boyfriend in the child\u2019s home, Segura held a particular, almost parental, position of trust with the child. Additionally, the district court stated that the offense was \u201cone of the most vile\u201d of all the cases the court had seen in twenty-one years, reflecting the court\u2019s conclusion that the offense was outside of the \u201cheartland\u201d of child pornography cases as addressed by the Sentencing Guidelines and previously seen by the court itself. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Moreover, the upward variance of 37% from the top of the guidelines range of 262 months to a sentence of 360 months of imprisonment is within the range of variances this court has upheld. <em>See Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 348-50 (upward variance resulted in sentence 253% above top of Guidelines range); <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 530-32 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708-10 (5th Cir.2006). Segura has failed to show that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>See Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Segura additionally argues that his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury and his Fifth Amendment rights to proof beyond a reasonable doubt and indictment, but concedes that the issue is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Rhine, </em>583 F.3d 878, 891 &amp; n. 50 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Finding no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s judgment, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
