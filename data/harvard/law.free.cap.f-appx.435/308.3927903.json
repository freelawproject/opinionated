His subsequent application for federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 was denied, the district court holding: the application was untimely and <em>not </em>subject to equitable tolling; and, in the alternative, Wells\u2019 double-jeopardy claim lacked merit and his other claims were procedurally barred. <em>Wells v. Travis, </em>No. 07-8056, 2008 WL 3166805 (E.D. La. 5 August 2008). The court granted a Certificate of Appealability (COA) on only the equitable-tolling issue. Our court refused to grant a COA on the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-21\">Before reaching the issue of equitable tolling, we must examine the basis of our jurisdiction. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A habeas proceeding is civil, not criminal. And, a timely notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional in a civil case. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a); <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 213-14, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Such notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken. Fed.R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-22\">The final judgment denying Wells\u2019 \u00a7 2254 application was entered on 6 Au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>gust 2008. Allowing for the district court\u2019s closure due to Hurricane Gustav, the last day of the 30-day period was 8 September 2008. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(3). Because Wells did not file a notice of appeal or a document that could be construed as a notice of appeal by 8 September 2008, we are without jurisdiction to consider his appeal. <em>See </em>Bowles, 551 U.S. at 213-14, 127 S.Ct. 2360.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Alternatively, we lack jurisdiction because Wells\u2019 appeal is moot. <em>See Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987). Again, the district court rejected his double-jeopardy claim on the merits and held his remaining claims as procedurally barred; and our court refused to expand the COA to consider those claims. Therefore, there is no live case or controversy before us because there is no relief that can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
