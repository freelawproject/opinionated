On appeal, Cooksey first argues that the court erred in finding no evidence in the record to support violations of \u00a7 1985(3), and erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants. Second, Cooksey contends that the district court should have granted him leave to amend his complaint, as the amendments would not have prejudiced the parties. Finally, Cooksey argues that the district court erred in dismissing his remaining claims against the Maxwells for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-16\">Cooksey\u2019s first claim is that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on his \u00a7 1985 and \u00a7 1986 claims. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Cook v. Randolph County, </em>573 F.3d 1143, 1151 (11th Cir.2009). Summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>is appropriate if \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cThe basic issue before the court on a motion for summary judgment is \u2018whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Allen v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">To bring a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) claim, a plaintiff must prove: \u201c(1) a conspiracy; (2) for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws; and (3) an act in furtherance of the conspiracy; (4) whereby a person is either injured in his person or property or deprived of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States.\u201d <em>Park v. City of Atlanta, </em>120 F.3d 1157, 1161 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam). The Supreme Court has held that a \u00a7 1985(3) conspiracy must be motivated by a racial or otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus. <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 102, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 1798, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">\u201cThe only rights the Supreme Court has expressly declared to be enforceable against private conspirators under \u00a7 1985(3) are the right to interstate travel and the right against involuntary servitude. Conversely, the Supreme Court has declared the freedom of speech and the rights protected under Title VII insufficient to form the basis of \u00a7 1985(3) actions against private conspirators.\u201d <em>Jimenez v. Wellstar Health Sys., </em>596 F.3d 1304, 1312 (11th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Bray v. Alexandria Women\u2019s Health Clinic, </em>506 U.S. 263, 278, 113 S.Ct. 753, 764, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 (1993); <em>Great Am. Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Novotny, </em>442 U.S. 366, 378, 99 S.Ct. 2345, 2352, 60 L.Ed.2d 957 (1979)) (internal citations omitted). This Court has held that conspiracies to violate property and contract rights, though protected under \u00a7 1981, are insufficient to form the basis of a \u00a7 1985(3) claim against a private actor. <em>Jimenez, </em>596 F.3d at 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">The court did not err in granting summary judgment against Cooksey because he failed to present sufficient evidence to establish any genuine issues of material fact as to the alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3). Cooksey alleges that the Maxwells conspired with their attorneys to deprive him of access to the easement and to the use of his property, but he has proffered no evidence in support of this allegation. Conclusory allegations of discrimination and conspiracy, without more, are not sufficient to support a civil rights claim at the summary judgment stage. <em>Fullman v. Graddick, </em>739 F.2d 553, 556-57 (11th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, Cooksey has failed to allege the deprivation of a right enforceable under \u00a7 1985(3). He alleges the deprivation of 10 rights, some of which are protected under \u00a7 1981, but none of which are enforceable under \u00a7 1985(3). For all of the foregoing reasons, Cooksey\u2019s \u00a7 1985(3) claim must fail. Because \u00a7 1986 claims are derivative of \u00a7 1985 violations, his \u00a7 1986 claim also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>fails. <em>See Park v. City of Atlanta, </em>120 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Cooksey next argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend his complaint. We review the denial of a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion, but we review <em>de novo </em>the underlying legal conclusion that a particular amendment to the complaint would have been futile. <em>Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1012 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We hold <em>pro se </em>pleadings to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and, therefore, will liberally construe those pleadings. <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2008). At the time that Cooksey filed his motions to amend, Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(1) provided, in relevant part, that \u201c[a] party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course ... before being served with a responsive pleading.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(1) (2007). After a responsive pleading was filed, as was the case here, a party could amend its pleading only after obtaining the opposing party\u2019s written consent or by obtaining the court\u2019s leave to amend. Fed.R.CivJP. 15(a)(2) (2007). \u201cOrdinarily, if the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, leave to amend should be freely given.\u201d <em>Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1262 (11th Cir.2004) (citations and quotation marks omitted). However, a district court may properly deny leave to amend under Rule 15(a) if such amendment \u201cwould be futile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1263. Denial of leave to amend \u201cis justified by futility when the complaint as amended is still subject to dismissal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">As Cooksey concedes on appeal, his first proposed amended complaint was substantially similar to the original complaint, merely rewording the allegations. The new information contained in the first amendment \u2014 namely, the identification of specific rights violated by defendants, the allegations that the Maxwells and the lawyers had participated in a lawsuit against the prior owners of an easement over the Maxwells\u2019 land, and the allegation that the Maxwells\u2019 purpose in installing a fence was to separate Cooksey from the white tenants \u2014 would not have helped Cooksey establish a claim under \u00a7\u00a7 1985(3) and 1986 because he still lacked any evidence demonstrating conduct by private actors that would be actionable under 1985(3), and because his allegations were still merely eonclusory. Likewise, the second proposed amendment, which would have added three new parties, also did nothing to advance Cooksey\u2019s contentions. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cooksey\u2019s motions to amend because his proposed amendments were futile. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Finally, Cooksey argues that the district court erred in dismissing his remaining claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Hall v. U.S. Dep\u2019t Veterans\u2019 Affairs, </em>85 F.3d 532, 533 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam). A federal court may raise the issue of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on its own initiative at any stage of litigation. <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 506, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 1240, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006). If the court determines that subject-matter jurisdiction is lacking, it must dismiss the complaint in its entirety. <em>Id. </em>at 514, 126 S. Ct at 1244. Furthermore, a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim if \u201cthe dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>trict court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">After adjudicating the \u00a7 1985(3) and \u00a7 1986 claims in favor of the defendants, there were no remaining federal claims before the court. Cooksey appears to argue that he asserted other federal claims, but this Court is unable to find specific articulation of any such claims. Thus, the court properly exercised its discretion to dismiss the remaining claims without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Upon a thorough review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-9\">. Cooksey's brief also includes an argument heading challenging the denial of a motion for injunctive relief, but the argument section of his brief fails to provide any argument on the issue. As Cooksey fails to articulate a challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for injunctive relief, we decline to reach the issue. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (holding that an issue is abandoned if it is not raised in a party's initial brief, even if that party is <em>pro </em>se).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-7\">. It should also be noted that Cooksey\u2019s allegations against Attorney Waters and the two law firms do not refute the claims of the lawyers that they were acting within the scope of their legal representation of their clients. We have held that an attorney's conduct within the scope of representation of a client is immune from any allegation of a \u00a7 1985 conspiracy. <em>Farese v. Scherer, </em>342 F.3d 1223, 1232 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
