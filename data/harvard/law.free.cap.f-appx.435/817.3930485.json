On appeal, Wu argues (1) his due process rights were violated because a malfunctioning tape recorder repeatedly interrupted his testimony during the removal proceeding, (2) the adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence, and (3) the BIA erred in finding he had not suffered past persecution and did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>After review, we dismiss Wu\u2019s petition in part and deny it in part.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). We lack jurisdiction to, review claims that a petitioner fails to exhaust before the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). A petitioner\u2019s \u201callegation of a due process violation\u2014that he was denied a full and fair hearing before a neutral factfinder\u2014is precisely the kind of procedural error which requires exhaustion.\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Wu failed to exhaust his claim that problems with the tape recorder deprived him of due process. Although Wu stated in his brief to the BIA that he had to answer certain questions repeatedly because of problems with the tape recorder, he did not argue this deprived him of due process. The BIA did not have an opportunity to address Wu\u2019s due process argument, and we lack jurisdiction to review the claim. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). Under the substantial evidence test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s credibility determinations \u201ccan be reversed only if the evidence \u2018compels\u2019 a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1230-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">The BIA \u201cmust offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). An adverse credibility determination may be based on \u201cthe inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s account, the consistency between the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s written and oral statements ..., the internal consistency of each such statement, [and] the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">The BIA set forth specific, cogent reasons for its adverse credibility determination. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility determination because the BIA (1) accurately identified discrepancies between Wu\u2019s written account of his jailhouse beating and his testimony regarding the beating, and (2) found that Wu\u2019s account of escaping from the hospital was inherently implausible. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). The record does not compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"Apxp\">An alien may establish eligibility for asylum if he shows he has suffered either \u201cpast persecution\u201d or has a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution based on a protected ground. <em>Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1277 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cTo establish asylum based on <em>past </em>persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that [ ]he was persecuted, and (2) that the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>secution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1232 (11th Cir.2007). A well-founded fear of future persecution may be established by showing, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) past persecution that creates a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, or (2) a reasonable possibility of being singled out for persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Wu submitted no credible evidence establishing how or why he was injured and thus failed to show he suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground. Because he did not establish past persecution, Wu is not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). Wu also failed to show there was a reasonable possibility of him being singled out for future persecution that cannot be avoided by relocation. Although Wu offers some evidence that he belonged to a church in China, the only evidence that this church was unauthorized was Wu\u2019s own testimony and written statements. Thus, the record does not compel the conclusion that Wu suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution. Because Wu failed to establish his eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the higher burden of proof with respect to his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93,1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-15\">. Wu also asks us to grant his motion to remand his case for a new hearing. Wu has not filed such a motion with this Court. Although Wu filed a motion to remand with the BIA, he does not argue in his appellate brief that the BIA erred in denying that motion, and has thus abandoned any challenge to the denial of his motion to remand. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>abandons an issue if he fails to offer argument on it).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b841-17\">. We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\">. Wu does not offer any argument that the Chinese government\u2019s harassment of Christians is so systematic or pervasive as to amount to a pattern or practice of persecution, and has thus abandoned the issue. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
