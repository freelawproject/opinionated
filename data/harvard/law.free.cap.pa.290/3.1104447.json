Clarke, </em>with him <em>Wm. Clarke Mason </em>and <em>Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOt\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that he is liable only for his pro rata share of those taxes, including inheritance taxes, \u201cthat may be chargeable against my residuary estate,\u201d and that the determination of his liability in respect of taxes depends upon the proper construction to be placed on the words quoted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-9\">In the absence of any direction to the contrary by a testator, the taxes which are chargeable against any residuary estate would be only those taxes which become so chargeable by operation of state and federal inheritance taxing statutes. Under the Pennsylvania inheritance tax laws, each legatee is liable for the tax on his own particular legacy, and residuary legatees are likewise liable for the tax on their residuary interests. Under federal inheritance tax statutes, no legatees, specific or residuary, are liable to pay the tax on their particular interests; as the federal estate tax is not a tax on the interest to which some person succeeds on a death, but the interest which ceases by reason of death; and the tax is therefore on the transfer of decedent\u2019s net estate: Edwards v. Slocum, 264 U. S. 61; Newton\u2019s Est., 74 Pa. Superior Ct. 361.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-10\"><em>Effingham B.

Testator subsequently added a codicil in which he provided that: \u201cIn my said will in the ninth paragraph I provide that my son, Fisher Corlies Baily, shall receive a sum of money equal to one-fourth (14) of the amount to the credit of my account in the firm of Joshua L. Baily &amp; Company at the termination of the copartnership, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>which would be at the end of the month next following my death. I hereby modify said bequest to the extent that there shall be charged against this bequest unto my said son, Fisher Corlies Baily, a pro rata share of any and all taxes, including inheritance taxes, that may be chargeable against my residuary estate. In all other respects I ratify and confirm my said will as heretofore written.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The sole question before us for determination is whether the direction to charge against the son named his pro rata share of \u201cany and all taxes\u201d includes the federal estate tax. The court below held this tax was properly included. Fisher Corlies Baily appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">It is true, as argued by appellant, that the federal estate tax is not an inheritance tax or a tax on the interest to which a person succeeds on death of the owner, but on the interest which has ceased by reason of such death: Edmunds v. Slocum, 264 IT. S. 61. But to place a strict technical construction on the language used by testator would tend to defeat rather than aid the general expressed intent of testator to treat his four children \u201cas nearly equal as possible.\u201d Having directed in his will that \u201call collateral, inheritance or other succession tax or taxes\u201d should be paid out of the residue, and having made the bequest to his son without mentioning the question of payment of such taxes, and given the residue to his daughters, testator evidently later discovered that the will might reasonably be construed to impose on the daughters all taxes \u201cchargeable against my residuary estate,\u201d hence added the codicil to remove doubt and charge his son\u2019s portion with its pro rata share of \u201cany and all taxes.\u201d This term is sufficiently comprehensive to include the federal tax, and a careful reading of the whole will leads to the conclusion that testator so intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The decree of the court below is affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
