D. Ticknor to said bank and actually discounted by said corporation; provided, however, that in no event shall I be answerable for any sum exceeding three thousand dollars in the whole; it being also understood, that this is to be considered a standing guaranty to said bank, for the time and for the sum aforesaid, notwithstanding said Wm.

Ticknor may have, from time to time, paid or re ceived notes and acceptances or other paper evidences of debt discounted as aforesaid. \u201c In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and seal the first day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty four. S. A. Shurtleff. (Seal.)\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-5\">The case was submitted to the court on the following agreed statement of facts : After the defendant executed the foregoing obligation, the plaintiffs, from time to time, discounted paper for William D. Ticknor therein mentioned, to a large amount. Said Ticknor afterwards failed; and at the time of his failure was indebted to the plaintiffs as indorser of ten notes, amounting in all, without interest, to $3605\u201837, which were discounted by the plaintiffs for him during the time covered by the defendant\u2019s said obligation. The several parties to said notes were duly notified, when the same became due and payable, and the defendant was notified of the default of said Ticknor, as each of said notes became due. All said notes are now in the possession of the plaintiffs, unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-7\">No tender has ever been made by the defendant to the plaintiffs of any sum as the amount due on his said obligation ; but the defendant has been ready and willing and has offered to pay the sum of $ 3000, on the condition that the plaintiffs woulu deliver up to him the same amount of the said notes. This the plaintiffs have refused to do ; and they claim of the defendant the amount of said obligation, with interest from the time of the notice of Ticknor\u2019s defaults. They also claim the right to retain all the said notes, for the purpose of securing to themseLes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the balance due thereon from Ticknor, over and above the said $ 3000 ; said notes being of some value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\">The plaintiffs have always been ready to deliver all said notes to the defendant, on his paying them the amount thereof; but the defendant has declined paying the full amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\">The defendant will receive, on the assignment of said Tick-nor, about <em>20 </em>per cent, of the $ 3000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-7\">It was agreed by the parties, that if the court should be of opinion that the defendant, on paying the sum found due on his said obligation, is entitled in equity to $ 3000 in amount of said notes, or any other portion of them, such notes shall be delivered to him by the plaintiffs ; but that if the court should be of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to hold all the said notes as security for the balance due to them from said Ticknor, over and above the $ 3000, then said notes shall be so retained by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-8\">Judgment to he rendered for the plaintiffs, for such amount of principal and interest, as is legally and equitably due on the defendant\u2019s said obligation.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-9\">Cooke, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-10\"><em>T.

The rights and duties of the parties appear to us to be the same in principle, as if the defendant had been the last indorser on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>several notes, to an amount not exceeding $ 3000. If this had been the precise situation of the parties, and the defendant had paid the notes as they severally fell due, he certainly would have been entitled to a delivery of them for his own benefit. That the plaintiffs gave this construction to the contract, we think is manifest from the notice which they gave to the defendant at the time when the first note became due, and when no other note, discounted for Ticknor and embraced under the defendant\u2019s guaranty, was actually payable ; and also from the subsequent notices. And we do not perceive that the non-payment of the notes by the defendant, at the times, respectively, when he received notice of their dishonor, varies or affects the legal rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">It is said, however, that in such case there will be a difficulty in deciding which notes belong to the defendant, and which to the plaintiffs. But we think such difficulty does not exist. It is true that the plaintiffs might discount notes for Ticknor, during the existence of the contract with the defendant, beyond the sum of $ 3000, and might receive payment therefor; and the plaintiffs could have determined, at the time of making the loans, to which of them the guaranty of the defendant should apply. But we are of opinion, that giving the notice to the defendant, as the notes were severally dishonored, fixed the liability of the defendant to those particular notes, till their amount became equal to $ 3000, and that the notes beyond that amount, and falling due afterwards \u2014 whatever may have been their date \u2014 belong exclusively to the plaintiffs, as well as any security specially appropriated to the payment of those notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Adopting this mode of settling the rights of these parties, a question arises, in what manner interest shall be cast on the guaranty of the defendant. And as to this, we are of opinion that the obligation is, not to pay the round sum of <em>\u00a7 </em>3000, but an amount not exceeding that sum, on notes or acceptances discounted by the plaintiffs, from time to time, for Ticknor; and consequently, that as each note fell due and notice was given to the defendant, he became fixed, under his guaranty, for the pay ment of the same, with interest if the payment should be de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>layed. The plaintiffs will therefore be entitled to cast interest on the several notes, up to the amount of <em>$ </em>3000 of principal, from the times they were payable; and this interest is to be added to the <em>$ </em>3000. For this amount the plaintiffs will be entitled to judgment; first deducting, however, any payments which may have been made, to them upon said notes : And on receiving satisfaction for the same, they will be bound to deliver the said notes to the defendant for his own personal use, without account to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">It appears, on inspecting the schedule of the notes, that, taken in their order, they will not make the precise sum of <em>$ </em>3000. The eight first notes amount to <em>$ 2782-29, </em>and the next note,being <em>$ </em>460, we are of opinion, that on the satisfaction of the judgment now to be rendered in this action, the plaintiffs will be trustees of the defendant, in the sum of <em>$ </em>217-71, part of the note for <em>$ </em>460; and the balance of the note, being <em>$ </em>242-29, will belong to the plaintiffs. Any amount, therefore, recovered by the plaintiffs on that note, will belong to them, to the amount of <em>$ </em>242-29 and interest, and the balance to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Judgment will be entered for the plaintiffs for the amount to be ascertained as above directed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b40-12\"> The chief justice did not sit in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
