On the 12th of July 1839, Bryant &amp; Hapgood called for an account of sales, which the defendants rendered on the 15th of said July. This account showed sales to ten different individuals, extending from September 18th 1838 to July 15th 1839, and among others, a sale on the 5th of July 1839 to Shipman &amp; Co. of Newark, (New Jersey,) of boots, to the amount of <em>$ </em>180, on a credit of eight months. The account, thus rendered, contained the charges upon the property, and showed a balance in favor of Bryant &amp; Hapgood, of <em>$ </em>858-42. Against the balance thus stated, was this memorandum : \u201c Due by average, if collected, September 1st 1839.\u201d The defendants\u2019 letter, which accompanied the account, stated that they had as yet received pay for only two items of sales (naming them, and not including the sale to Ship-man &amp; Co.) and directed Bryant &amp; Hapgood to charge them (the defendants,) u with sales due September 1st, <em>$ </em>858-42.\u201d The defendants, at the same time, remitted to Bryant &amp; Hap-good $220, on account, who, on the 19th of the same July, acknowledged the receipt of the said account and letter. On the 14th of November 1839, the defendants .paid Bryant &amp; Hap-good <em>$ </em>100, and gave them the note now in suit. No agreement was then made, and no conversation had, respecting the sums wmch had not been collected by the defendants on account of sales of Bryant &amp; Hapgood\u2019s property; but an account was stated, referring to the account rendered, as above mentioned ; and the note was given for the balance of the account thus stated, with interest from September 1st 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-5\">Before the expiration of the term of credit given to Shipman &amp; Co., they became insolvent, and have paid no part of said sum of <em>$ </em>180. They were in good credit at the time of the sale, on the 5th of July 1839, and both before and after that day, the defendants had made sale to them of goods belonging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>to themselves, and subsequently took their negotiable promissory note, dated July 5th 1839, which included the amount of the sales of the defendants\u2019 own goods, and the $ 180 due upon the sale of Bryant &amp; Hapgood\u2019s property. This note was payable in eight months from date, and was given soon after said 5th of July. The precise sum, for which this note was given, did not appear ; but it was between $ 800 and $ 1200. The defendants never communicated the fact to Bryant &amp; Hapgood, that they had taken such a note, nor was any evidence introduced tending to show that Bryant &amp; Hapgood had any knowledge of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-5\">The defendants, at the trial, tendered to the plaintiffs a note recently made and signed by Shipman &amp; Co. for $ 180, dated July 5th 1839, payable in eight months to the order of the defendants, and by them indorsed \u201c without recourse.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">The defendants did not receive a guaranty commission on the sales.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-7\">Upon the evidence of these facts, the defendants contended that the consideration of the note, to the extent of $ 180, had failed ; and they proposed to submit the question to the jury, whether it was not the intention of the parties, at the time the note was given, that the defendants should not be held accountable for the $ 180, unless they should receive it of said Shipman &amp; Co., or should fail so to receive it, through their own negligence. But the judge, who presided at the trial, declined to submit this question to the jury, and instructed them that if the foregoing facts were proved to their satisfaction, they should return a verdict for the plaintiffs for the full amount of the note ; which the jury did accordingly. The defendants thereupon alleged ex ceptions to said instructions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-8\"><em>Washburn, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ask\">cited <em>Robertson </em>v.

The plaintiffs had no knowledge of the note of Shipman &amp; Co. ; and they gave up their claim on them, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>took the note of the defendants, on demand, relying wholl)r upon that. The case of <em>Oakley </em>v. Crenshaw, 4 Cow. 250, shows that the instructions to the jury were correct. See also <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>3 Campb. 291. The case in 5 Cow. 473, differs from the present. The court said, in that case, that the circumstances of the settlement repelled the presumption of an intention of the factor to become responsible absolutely. If the defendants did not intend to assume the debt of Shipman &amp; Co., they should have so informed Bryant &amp; Hapgood. <em>Consequa </em>v. <em>Fanning, </em>3 Johns. Ch. 600.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b584-5\">Hubbard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVM\">By the law merchant, it is clearly settled that a factor may sell the goods of his principal on credit, and that if he uses due diligence in regard to the solvency of the purchaser, he is not responsible, in case of loss by reason of the purchaser\u2019s failure before the term of credit expires. 2 Kent Com. (3d ed.) 623. <em>Goodenow </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>7 Mass. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In the present case, the sales by the defendants were made in the usual manner, and the terms of credit were reasonable. And it is made certain by their account rendered July 15th 1839, that the sales were at the risk of the principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The only question which has been raised is, whether the facts, which took place subsequently, made the defendants responsible for the loss incurred on the sale to Shipman &amp; Co. on the 5th of July preceding. And we are of opinion that the account rendered by the defendants, on the 14th of November 1839, is but a further representation of the previous transactions, with some advances for moneys collected, and in no way alters their then existing relations ; and that the giving of the note on demand, for the balance of that account \u2014 which\" note is the subject of the present suit\u2014was no assumption to their account of the outstanding debts. No new consideration passed between the parties. The transaction was in law the same, as if the defendants had advanced the money for the balance of the account, at the request of the principals, which could be recovered back, in whole or in part, if the debts falling due should not be paid. A note given for the balance of an account, though <em>prima facie </em>evidence of payment of the account, may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>explained and rebutted by proof as to the nature of the transaction between the original parties. Nor did the taking of a note from Shipman &amp; Co., and including in it other demands, necessarily vary the relations of these parties. It is a practice well understood among all persons who consign goods for sale, that the commission merchant, for convenience, takes the notes of vendees in his own name, often including the sales for different consignors ; and that he holds such notes in trust for his princi pals. We see nothing in this case to lead to the conclusion that the defendants intended to assume the debt of Shipman &amp; Co., or which altered their situation with their principals from the position in which they stood on the 15th of July, when they rendered their account. Nor do we see any act of theirs, by which the debt due from Shipman &amp; Co. was put at hazard ; nor any thing to show conclusively that they treated it as paid. The case is substantially the same with that of <em>Robertson </em>v. Livingston, 5 Cow. 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We think the presiding justice of the court of common pleas erred in directing the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiffs, on the proof of the facts stated in the report of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">No point was raised at the hearing, in respect to the note of the defendants having been negotiated by the payees shortly after they received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The exceptions are sustained and a new trial ordered at the-bar of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
