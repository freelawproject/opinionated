Sts. c. 97, \u00a7 73, for unreasonably neglecting to pay money collected by him on execution, by retaining the money during the time that the claims of different attaching creditors, or of attaching creditors and the assignees of the judgment debt or under <em>St. </em>1838, c. 163, remain undetermined.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-8\">These were actions upon the case against the sheriff of this county for an alleged default of Charles D. Coolidge, one of his deputies, in not paying to the plaintiffs money collected on executions which issued on judgments recovered by them, respectively, against George W. Bartlett.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-9\">At the triai before the chief justice, the facts which are stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>in the next preceding case, <em>ante, </em>137-141, were proved or admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-5\">A verdict was taken for each of the plaintiffs, by consent, m a sum sufficient to include five times the lawful interest of the money demanded, from the time of the demand made by the plaintiffs upon said Coolidge\u2014subject to be altered, or to be set aside and a new trial granted, or a nonsuit entered, according to the direction of the whole court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-6\"><em>I.

Sts. c. 97, \u00a7 73. To this point he cited <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>French, 2 </em>Pick. 586, and <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>16 Pick. 387.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-7\"><em>F.

The provision of the Rev. Sts. c. 97, \u00a7 73, is this : \u201cIf any officer shall unreasonably neglect to pay any money, collected by him on execution, when demanded by the creditor therein, he shall forfeit and pay to the creditor five times the lawful interest of the money, from the time of the demand until it is paid \u201d\u2014which is a revision of the previous <em>St. </em>of 1783, c. 44, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Without repeating the facts, which have been fully stated in the preceding case, we are of opinion, upon a fair consideration of them, that the officer did not, in the situation in which he was placed, so unreasonably neglect to pay the money collected, as to incur the forfeiture prescribed by the revised statutes, and consequently that simple interest only is to be paid, to be computed from the 15th day of February 1840, on which day all obstructions in the way of paying the money were for the time removed. The verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs are to be altered, and conformed to this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
