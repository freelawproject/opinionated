The said Simpson died at Boston in December 1837. The Middlesex Bank stopped payment on the 17th of January 1838. The said Simpson, at the time of the loan to him on his notes referred to in said account, by an agreement, signed by him, pledged to the bank one share in the capital stock of the bank for every hundred dollars lent, amounting to 72 shares in the whole, as collateral security for the loan. A copy of said agreement is in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> On the 6th of April 1838, the administrator of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>said dui eased\u2019s estate received due notice, by letter put into his hands, that unless the said notes were paid within thirty days, the shares thus pledged as collateral security would be sold at public auction, and the estate of the said deceased be held to pay the balance remaining unpaid after crediting the proceeds. Said notes not being paid within the thirty days, said shares were placed in the hands of Stephen Brown of Boston, auctioneer, who, after advertising them for sale, the usual time, in three or more of the newspapers printed at Boston, sold said shares at auction on the 9th day of May 1838. The said shares were purchased by the president of the bank, he being the highest bidder, for the benefit of the bank. Said administrator had due notice of the time and place of said sale, but never gave his consent to the sale ; nor did he make known his dissent to said sale, until the time when the bank presented its claim, for allowance, before the commissioners of insolvency on the estate of said deceased ; nor had he notice that the sale had been made. The value of said shares was not known at the time of said sale, but they have turned out to be worth something more than they sold for at said sale. Said shares are still held by the officers of the bank, in trust for the bank.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-5\">The parties agreed that if the plaintiffs were entitled to recover, they should have judgment for such sum as the court should direct; otherwise, that a nonsuit should be entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-6\"><em>Buttrick, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9j\">The plaintiffs had a power from the intestate to sell the bank shares. This power was coupled with an interest, and could not be revoked, except by payment of the loan. <em>Hunt </em>v. Rousmanier, 8 Wheat. 203. There is no suggestion of any actual fraud in the sale ; but it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>objected, that the sale was fraudulent in law, as the-bank, being trustee of the shares, could not become the purchaser thereof. This objection rests on a principle of chancery, which is applied in the prevention of fraud, in the case of trustees, <em>eo nomine, </em>executors, &amp;c. but is -not applicable to the present case, which is, substantially, that of mortgagor and mortgagee. <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>6 Pick. 464. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 Pick. 521. <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Rorke, </em>2 Scho. &amp; Lef. 673. A purchase -of the trust property by the trustee is not void, but voidable only ; <em>Campbell </em>v. Walker, 5 Ves. 678 ; 5 Pick, <em>ubi sup. </em>; and if the <em>cestui que trust </em>acquiesce in the sale, he is bound thereby ; and if he would avoid it, he must dissent in a reasonable time. <em>Jenison v. Hapgood, </em>7 Pick. 8. The dissent, in this case, was not manifested for more than two years after the sale ; which rvas not in reasonable time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-5\">The plaintiffs were not bound to take the shares at an appraisement, but had a right to have their value ascertained by a sale ; and it was the duty of the defendant to consent to such sale. By refusing to agree to a sale, he let in the plaintiffs to prove their whole claim. <em>Amory </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>16 Mass. 313. The memorandum check, at least, and interest thereon, should have been allowed by the commissioners, as the principle relied on by the defendant does not apply to that claim.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-6\"><em>W. Minot, Jr. </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJV\">The plaintiffs were pawnees or trustees of the shares, and their being at the same time the vendors and vendees thereof rendered the sale fraudulent in law, and void. 1 Story on Eq. \u00a7\u00a7 321 <em>seq. </em>Story on Bailments, \u00a7 319. <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>9 Ves. 292. Newland on Contract's, <em>c. </em>32. <em>Farnam </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>9 Pick. 212. Jeremy on Eq. Jurisd. 142, 143.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-7\">Where one, who stands in a fiduciary relation, makes a profit out of any transaction within the scope of his authority, that profit belongs to his <em>cestui que trust. </em>The plaintiffs stood in this relation to the defendant. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>6 Mass. 343. The fact that the shares have risen in value, in the plaintiffs\u2019 hands, since the sale, is of itself sufficient ground to set the sale aside. 2 Story on Eq. \u00a7\u00a7 1261 -1265.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>But it is not necessary, in order to show that the sale of the shares was void, to show that the plaintiffs had made a profit thereby. Under the circumstances, the sale was of itself void. <em>Davoue </em>v. <em>Fanning, </em>2 Johns. Ch. 260. <em>York Buildings </em>v. <em>Mackenzie, </em>8 Bro. P. C. (2d ed.) 42. <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>1 Chan. Cas. 190. <em>Ayliffe </em>v.

But they could not be the purchasers. Nothing, therefore, passed by the form of a sale at auction, in which they purchased in the shares ; and they still hold the same under their original title, as collateral se curity for their debt. The shares must either be actually sold, and the proceeds be deducted, or their value, ascertained by a jury or otherwise, must \"first be deducted from the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, as stated, and they will then be entitled to the balance only of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">[After this opinion was given, the parties agreed upon the value of the shares, and that the plaintiffs should have judgment Against the defendant for $ 5664-24, without costs.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
