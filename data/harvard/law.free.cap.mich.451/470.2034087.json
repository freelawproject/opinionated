Ingham Circuit Judge James R. Giddings<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied the Department of Corrections\u2019 motion to disqualify himself. Chief Circuit Judge Peter D. Houk also denied the disqualification motion. The department appealed in the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals panel (Griffin, P.J., and D. E. Holbrook, Jr., and Weaver, JJ.), ordered that Judge Giddings be disqualified and therefore reversed the findings of Chief Judge Houk and remanded the case for the appointment of a different judge. This Court granted appellants\u2019 (plaintiffs\u2019 and plaintiffs-intervenors\u2019) interlocutory applications for leave to appeal. We now reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The issue presented to this Court regarding the disqualification of Judge Giddings is an outgrowth of a prisoners\u2019 rights class action originally filed in 1988.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The pertinent procedural history of this litigation will now be set forth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In 1985, the Department of Corrections issued a policy directive to address the subject of prisoner personal property control. It is important to note that for purposes of personal property, this 1985 policy directive did not differentiate between security classifications of the prisoners. In 1988, as a result of the massive prison construction program responding to the large increases in prisoner population that began in 1984-85, the department attempted to revise its 1985 policy directive. It decided that changes needed to be made in its policy regarding the type and quantity of personal property that prisoners would be allowed to possess.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This 1988 revised policy directive specifically associated the type and amount of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>sonal property afforded to a prisoner with the security classification of the prisoner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Approximately two months later, on April 26, 1988, six male prisoners filed a complaint and a request in the Court of Claims for an ex parte temporary restraining order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These individuals challenged the department\u2019s authority to reduce or change possession of personal property by prisoners. The primary cause of action asserted by the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs-intervenors is that the security classification system created by the department is arbitrary and capricious and violates the Michigan and United States Constitutions because the policy directive involves the taking of personal property by the department that is dependent on the security classification system.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">On April 27, 1988, Judge Giddings entered a temporary restraining order that precluded the department from implementing its 1988 revised policy. On September 26, 1988, Judge Giddings granted the female prisoners\u2019 motion to intervene. Subsequently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>respective classes of male and female prisoners were certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">On August 21, 1989, the Legislature entered this arena by giving effect to MCL 800.42; MSA 28.1411.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although Judge Giddings\u2019 order enjoined the department\u2019s 1988 revision of its personal property policy directive, this statute served to impose similar limitations on the type and quantity of personal property that could be possessed by prisoners at differing levels of security. This caused the male prisoners to file a motion to enjoin the enforcement of this statute that was granted by Judge Giddings after a hearing on the matter on September 18, 1989.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This preliminary injunction was reduced to writing and entered on November 14, 1989.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The injunction currently remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">DISQUALIFICATION: SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUND EVENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The road leading up to the department\u2019s motion to disqualify Judge Giddings has been long, winding, and bumpy. The focus of the department\u2019s motion centers on the relationship (or lack thereof) between Judge Giddings and Governor Engler. In the interest of time and space, this opinion will only recount the essential facts culminating in the department\u2019s decision to seek the disqualification of Judge Giddings.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The preliminary injunction issued by Judge Giddings generated numerous disputes over control of prisoner personal property. Many prisoners brought contempt proceedings against the department, alleging that it was violating the November 1989 injunction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As a result, prisoners were often required to appear in court as witnesses to the alleged violation. A question arose concerning whether these individuals were entitled to receive the statutory witness fee pursuant to MCL 600.2552; MSA 27A.2552. On October 7, 1993, at a hearing on the issue, Judge Giddings decided that the prisoners were entitled to receive their statutory witness fee of $12 a day.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>On Thursday, October 14, 1993, while attending a dedication ceremony for the Saginaw Regional Correctional Facility, Governor John Engler made a comment regarding Judge Giddings that evidenced the Governor\u2019s distaste for the witness fee ruling.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At the time, Judge Giddings stated that he would not respond to the Governor\u2019s comments. However, \u201c]p]ursuant to [his] ethical obligation imposed ... by Subsection 3B(3)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the Code of Judicial Conduct,\u201d Judge Giddings sent a letter to the Attorney Grievance Commission regarding the Governor\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ments on October 21, 1993. In bis letter, Judge Giddings stated that the Governor\u2019s statements appeared to violate Rules 3.5,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 8.2,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and 8.4(c),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of the Michigan Rules of Professional Responsibility.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>ary 7, 1994, the Attorney Grievance Commission informed Governor Engler that Judge Giddings\u2019 request for investigation was dismissed. However, the commission \u201ccautioned\u201d the Governor regarding the ramification of such comments on the integrity of Michigan\u2019s legal system.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Additionally, during this time, the news media were taking great interest in the Governor\u2019s press releases and comments in this case. The record indicates that Judge Giddings was progressively becoming concerned over the statements reported by the press. Particularly, Judge Giddings focused on the substance of the Governor\u2019s press releases. On November 2, 1993, Judge Giddings held a hearing to address miscellaneous matters. At this time, Judge Giddings discussed what he termed to be \u201cinaccuracies\u201d in statements made to the press.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Further, Judge Giddings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>questioned whether it would be appropriate for him to respond to what he felt were incorrect statements made by a litigant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>The next significant event took place on June 2, 1994, when Judge Giddings, sua sponte, entered an order responding to what he viewed as the media problems surrounding the case. The media contacts order reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">This matter having come before the Court as a result of media contacts with the Court and the Court being made aware of certain inaccurate reports disseminated to the public media by representatives of the Michigan Department of Corrections (mdoc) and other state agents, and the Court perceiving the need to impose reasonable steps to foster an environment to allow the case to be fairly litigated, and the Court being fully advised in the premises, it is hereby sua sponte ordered that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">(1) Any written remarks or press releases made or given to a member of the press by any employee or agent of the State, regarding this <em>Cain </em>litigation, must also be faxed to Plaintiffs\u2019 spokesperson Linda Forster, Plaintiff class-member Mark Coleman and Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel Charlene Snow at the same time that the remarks are provided to the public media. Similarly, any remarks or press releases given by the Plaintiffs to the public media must be faxed to Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Counsel, A. Peter Govorchin, Assistant Attorney General, and the Michigan Department of Corrections\u2019 press spokesperson, Warren Williams.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Subsequently, the department moved that this order be stayed pending appeal on the merits because the order allegedly restricts the free speech of all state employees. Further, the plaintiffs moved for guidance concerning the interpretation of the June 2, 1994, order. After a hearing on June 30, 1994, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for clarification of the June 2, 1994, order and denied the department\u2019s motion for a stay. Much of the discussion during the hearing revolved around who could be included in the scope of the media contacts order.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Particularly of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>concern was whether the Governor could be included within the scope of the order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">And I\u2019m going to close with this one point and emphasis [sic] that frankly, I gave a lot of thought as to whether or not the chief executive should be included within the scope of this order. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">[O] n several occasions he has taken upon himself to speak directly about this case and purports to speak with authority. And I assume he does. As the Governor of the state he has access to information, and those who work for the Department of Corrections are accountable to him at some level and because of that supervisory authority, and because he both apparently and actually, it seems to me that if he is going to speak on this, and because there is that history there \u2014 and I already referenced of fairly significant misrepresentation, not the criticism. I\u2019m talking about misrepresentations of what, in fact, this court did. It seems to me that in that context, it\u2019s appropriate to include him within this requirement that copies of those remarks be forwarded to relevant persons in this lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Judge Giddings then issued an order clarifying his previous order. Specifically, the revised order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">(1) Any written remarks or press releases made or given to a member of the press by the Governor or his Press Secretary, or by the Department of Corrections Director; or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Department\u2019s press spokesperson, or by any employee or agent of the Department of Corrections purporting to speak for the Department regarding this <em>Cain </em>litigation, must also be faxed to Plaintiffs\u2019 spokesperson Linda Forster, Plaintiff class-member Mark Coleman and Plaintiff Intervenors\u2019 counsel Charlene Snow at the same time that such remarks are provided to the public media.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">(2) Similarly, any remarks or press releases given to the public media by agents of the Plaintiffs or Plaintiff Intervenors, including named class representatives, or any other members of the class purporting to speak for the Plaintiff or Plaintiff-Intervenors\u2019 class, must be faxed to Defendant\u2019s counsel, A. Peter Govorchin, Assistant Attorney General, and Department of Corrections press spokesperson, Warren Williams. [Order denying defendant\u2019s motion for stay of order regarding public media contact and granting clarification of order regarding public media contacts, June 30, 1994, pp 2-3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Clearly, Judge Giddings intended that Governor Engler be subject to the media contacts order.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The Governor rejected Judge Giddings\u2019 attempt to regulate the operation of the executive press office. In fact, through his spokesperson, John Truscott, Governor Engler announced his intention to disobey the June 2, 1994, and June 30, 1994, orders. As early as November 1993, in response to Judge Giddings\u2019 bench ruling, Mr. Truscott announced,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">\u201cWe have often said there is Michigan law and then there is Giddings law and often times [sic] they are not even similar .... We don\u2019t expect the Department of Corrections to comply, nor will our office comply. We do not feel an obligation to inform convicted felons of state business or the legal proceedings of the state.\u201d [The Detroit News, <em>PE for inmates? Engler enraged, </em>November 24, 1993, p 1A.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Subsequent to the issuance of the order, Mr. Truscott was quoted as stating, \u201cI object to being ordered to fax my press releases to prisoners .... My job is to communicate to the media, not to murderers and rapists.\u201d The Detroit News, <em>Engler, judge battle over faxing news releases to </em>inmates, June 24, 1994. Mr. Truscott stated that, at that time, he had released about four statements from the Governor that were not forwarded to the prisoners, their attorneys, or the spokesperson for the prisoners appearing in propria persona. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The department appealed the denial of its motion for a stay of the media contacts order to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals granted the department\u2019s application for leave regarding its motion to stay the media contacts order. Further, the Court of Appeals granted the department\u2019s motion to stay, and the appeal on the merits is currently pending.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In August 1994, before entry of the stay by the Court of Appeals, the Governor wrote a letter to Attorney General Frank Kelley. The letter was dated August 12, 1994, and pertained to the <em>Cain </em>litigation. The importance of this letter will become apparent below.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Further, during this time, on August 23, 1994, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the Governor issued a press release addressing the recent escape of inmates from the Ryan Correctional Facility. This press release directly linked the Ryan facility outbreak with Judge Giddings\u2019 rulings in the <em>Cain </em>litigation and was not forwarded to the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">DISQUALIFICATION: THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EVENT</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">As a result of the Governor\u2019s failure to forward his August 23, 1994, press release to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs filed a motion for an order to show cause why Mr. Truscott and Governor Engler should not be held in criminal contempt. This motion was scheduled to be heard on September 12, 1994. The parties and Judge Giddings each have differing perspectives of what actually took place that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Before a hearing on the motion, Judge Giddings, the parties, their attorneys and representatives, and the monitor held a conference in chambers off the record. The purpose of the conference was to discuss, inter alia, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an order to show cause regarding Governor Engler. During the course of this conference, Judge Giddings referred to the motion of the plaintiffs appearing in propria persona to show cause. He indicated to Mr. Walen that the pleadings, as filed, were inadequate. As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Judge Giddings indicated that the motion needed to be redrafted. What happened next is in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Attorney General Govorchin, by way of affidavit, described the events that took place in chambers as follows:<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">4. . . . Judge Giddings reviewed the [plaintiffs\u2019] motion [to show cause] and noted that the Plaintiffs were placing more emphasis on the alleged false statements in a press release issued by John Truscott than on the assertion that the press release had not been faxed as directed in the Court\u2019s order ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">5. . . . Judge Giddings expressed doubt about a motion to hold John Truscott in contempt because he could probably not act on his own. Judge Giddings stated that the show cause hearing would have to be heard by a different judge. Judge Giddings then reviewed the three alleged false statements set forth in the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion and commented that the falsity of those statements was not all that clear. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Judge Giddings noted that if Plaintiff was seeking criminal contempt, the motion should set forth distinct counts describing the contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">8. <em>Judge Giddings then said that another statement would seem more appropriate for the motion. He referred to a letter sent by Governor Engler to Frank J. Kelley, Attorney General for the State of Michigan, on August 12, 1994- Judge Giddings asked if anyone had a copy of that letter. Both Charlene Snow, Plaintiff-Intervenors\u2019 counsel, and Plaintiffs\u2019 representative Chuck Walen had a copy. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">9. . . . <em>Judge Giddings then read a portion of the letter out loud. That portion concerned the Governor\u2019s statement that Judge Giddings had adjourned the trial date in Cain again, \u201cfor reasons known only to the Court. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">10. <em>Judge Giddings stated that that statement was not true. That the record would reflect that the Cain case was adjourned due to the mdoc's non-compliance with Plaintiffs\u2019 Discovery Requests and a default entered against the MDOC.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">12. <em>Judge Giddings then implied that the Governor\u2019s letter to Attorney General Frank J. Kelley . . \u25a0 would be a more appropriate basis for contempt on the basis of the \u201cfalse\u201d statement regarding the adjourned trial, under the contempt statute [MGL 600.1701(1)-, MSA 27A.1701(1)]. Plaintiffs\u2019 representative Walen indicated that he would revise the motion for contempt. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">The department argued before this Court that this action by Judge Giddings is indicative of bias. Accordingly, the September 12, 1994, conference forms the basis of the department\u2019s motion to disqualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>However, Judge Giddings viewed the in-chambers conference in a different light.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> He described the events as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">The Court has little disagreement with the summary of the in-chambers discussions and other events described [in] Defendant\u2019s Brief in Support of the Motion to Disqualify. The summary is, however, somewhat incomplete and contains inaccuracies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">Serious inaccuracies are contained in the affidavits of attorneys representing the Department. With regard to the Govorchin Affidavit, <em>the Court disputes Mr. Govorchin\u2019s comment . . . that this Court \u201csaid that another statement would seem more appropriate for the motion. \u201d That is not correct. The Court did indicate that if Plaintiffs intended to proceed with the contempt, then they should consider including reference to inaccuracies in Governor Engler\u2019s letter of August 12th. This Court did not suggest, as asserted in . . . Govorchin\u2019s affidavit that the letter of August 12th was \u201ca more appropriate basis for </em>contempt.\u201d[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Accordingly, there is a conflict between the department and Judge Giddings with respect to the events of the September 12 conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The department filed its motion to disqualify Judge Giddings on September 26, 1994. The hearing transcripts indicate that the department did not inform the judge or the other parties of the existence of this motion until the day it was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS\u2019 MOTION TO DISQUALIFY JUDGE GIDDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">Pursuant to the requirements of MCR 2.003, see part v, the department filed its motion for disqualification of Judge Giddings from the <em>Cain v Dep\u2019t of Corrections </em>litigation. Initially, the department argues that its motion is based on the happenings of the in-chambers meeting. Specifically, the department stated that Judge Giddings,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-11\">actively counseled the male prisoners\u2019 \u201crepresentative\u201d on how best to pursue a motion for an order to show cause why Governor John Engler and John Truscott (the Governor\u2019s press spokesperson) should not be held in criminal contempt . . ., and . . . raised, on the Judge\u2019s own initiative, a new and additional ground that the male prisoners should utilize to pursue the allegations of criminal contempt against Governor Engler .... These actions, in the context of this case, demonstrate a personal legal bias on the part of Judge Giddings against Governor Engler and bias against the mdoc because Judge Giddings repeatedly stated that he considered the Governor (who is not a defendant) and the Department of Corrections (which is the only defendant) to be a single entity subject to his authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Accordingly, the department argues that Judge Giddings\u2019 conflict with the Governor bred animosity that was transferred into prejudice or bias against other parts of the Executive Branch. Consequently, the department contends that it will be denied a fair trial in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The department\u2019s motion to disqualify was made pursuant to MCR 2.003, which imposes a mandatory filing time of fourteen days after discovery of the grounds for the motion. Thus, the department points to September 12, 1994, as the day that the grounds for its motion surfaced. However, the department urges this Court to consider other instances occurring within the previous eleven months in support of its allegation of bias.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Specifically, the department urges us first to consider Judge Giddings\u2019 \u201cfiling\u201d of a \u201ccomplaint\u201d with the Attorney Grievance Commission because of the Governor\u2019s speech. The department further stated that Judge Giddings \u201crepeatedly\u201d throughout the proceedings declared there to be a unity of interest between the Governor and the department. Moreover, Judge Giddings entered the media contacts order sua sponte. Lastly, he appointed the male prisoners a press spokesperson and appointed a nonclass representative prisoner to receive the Governor\u2019s and the department\u2019s faxes of press releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The department contends that Judge Giddings has \u201cdemonstrated excessive personal involvement and inappropriate advocacy .... [His] conduct reveals a willingness and personal interest in manipulating this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>litigation and using judicial time and resources to engage in a public dispute with the Governor . . . The department would like this Court to examine human nature and conclude from experience that the risk of bias or prejudice resulting from all of these circumstances is too great. Therefore, the department argues that all these instances, combined with the September 12, 1994, meeting, are sufficient to require the disqualification of Judge Giddings.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">MICHIGAN DISQUALIFICATION LAW</p>\n<p id=\"Auv\">A. THE COURT RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In Michigan, a motion to disqualify a judge is made pursuant to court rule, MCR 2.003. Defendant moved to disqualify Judge Giddings under what is now MCR 2.003(B)(1), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">Grounds. A judge is disqualified when the judge cannot impartially hear a case, including but not limited to instances in which</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">(1) The judge is personally biased or prejudiced for or against a party or attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">Further, MCR 2.003(C)(1) requires that a motion to disqualify \u201cbe filed within 14 days after the moving party discovers the ground for disqualification.\u201d The moving party must submit an affidavit including all grounds for disqualification that are known at the time the motion is filed. MCR 2.003(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">A judge is disqualified when he cannot hear a case <em>impartially </em>pursuant to MCR 2.003(B). The court rule sets forth a list of situations that are deemed to be the equivalent of an inability to hear a case impartially. One such instance is when the judge \u201cis person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ally biased or prejudiced for or against a party.\u201d MCR 2.003(B)(1).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">MCR 2.003(B)(1) requires a showing of <em>actual </em>bias. Absent actual bias or prejudice, a judge will not be disqualified pursuant to this section. <em>In re Forfeiture of $1,159,420, </em>194 Mich App 134, 151; 486 NW2d 326 (1992); <em>Mourad v Automobile Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>186 Mich App 715, 731; 465 NW2d 395 (1991); <em>Band v Livonia Associates, </em>176 Mich App 95, 118; 439 NW2d 285 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Coupled with the requirement of actual bias, subsection (B)(1) also requires that the judge be \u201cpersonally\u201d biased or prejudiced in order to warrant disqualification pursuant to this section. The federal disqualification statutes similarly contain the requirement that the bias or prejudice be \u201cpersonal\u201d in nature. See 28 USC 144 (\u201cthe judge . . . has a personal bias or prejudice either against [a party] or in favor of any adverse party\u201d), and 28 USC 455(b)(1) (\u201cWhere [the judge] has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party\u201d). As a result of this statutory language, the federal courts have developed what is commonly known as the \u201cextrajudicial source\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Simply stated, a showing of \u201cpersonal\u201d bias must usually be met before disqualification is proper. This requirement has been interpreted to mean that disqualification is not warranted unless the bias or prejudice is both personal and extrajudicial. Thus, the challenged bias must have its origin in events or sources of information gleaned outside the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>proceeding. The United States Supreme Court addressed the \u201cpersonal\u201d bias requirement in <em>Liteky v United States, </em>510 US 540, 550; 114 S Ct 1147; 127 L Ed 2d 474 (1994), and stated that the words \u201cbias\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">connote a favorable or unfavorable disposition or opinion that is somehow <em>wrongful </em>or <em>inappropriate, </em>either because it is undeserved, or because it rests upon knowledge that the subject ought not to possess . . ., or because it is excessive in degree .... [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Further, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u201cFirst, judicial rulings alone almost never constitute valid basis for a bias or partiality motion. ... In and of themselves (i.e., apart from surrounding comments or accompanying opinion), they cannot possibly show reliance upon an extrajudicial source; and can only in the rarest circumstances evidence the degree of favoritism or antagonism required . . . when no extrajudicial source is involved. . . . Second, opinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 555.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Thus, <em>Liteky </em>indicates that a favorable or unfavorable predisposition that springs from facts or events occurring in the current proceeding may deserve to be characterized as \u201cbias\u201d or \u201cprejudice.\u201d However, these opinions will not constitute a basis for disqualification <em>\u201cunless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). See also <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>States v Young, </em>45 F3d 1405, 1415 (CA 10, 1995), interpreting <em>Liteky, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Furthermore, the party who challenges a judge on the basis of bias or prejudice must overcome a heavy presumption of judicial impartiality. <em>In re Forfeiture of $1,159,420, supra </em>at 151.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">B. THE <em>CRAMPTON v DEP\u2019T OF STATE </em>STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The Due Process Clause requires an unbiased and impartial decisionmaker. Thus, where the requirement of showing actual bias or prejudice under MCR 2.003(B)(1) has not been met, or where the court rule is otherwise inapplicable, parties have pursued disqualification on the basis of the due process impartiality requirement. <em>Crampton v Dep\u2019t of State, </em>395 Mich 347; 235 NW2d 352 (1975), is the leading Michigan case addressing the constitutional basis for disqualification.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The <em>Crampton </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has disqualified judges and decisionmakers without a showing of actual bias in situations where <em>\u201cexperience teaches that the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally </em>tolerable.\u201d Among the situations identified by the Court as presenting that risk are where the judge or decisionmaker</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">(1) has a pecuniary interest in the outcome;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">(2) \u201chas been the target <em>of </em>personal abuse or criticism from the party before him\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">(3) is \u201cenmeshed in [other] matters involving petitioner . . or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">(4) might have prejudged the case because of prior participation as an accuser, investigator, fact finder or initial decisionmaker. <em>[Id. </em>at 351 (citations omitted; emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">This Court has examined the issue of judicial disqualification pursuant to the Due Process Clause and has found that disqualification for bias or prejudice is only constitutionally required in the most extreme cases.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The test articulated in <em>Crampton </em>was extracted from the United States Supreme Court decision <em>Withrow v Larkin, </em>421 US 35; 95 S Ct 1456; 43 L Ed 2d 712 (1975).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The <em>Withrow </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\">Concededly, a \u201cfair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.\u201d This applies to administrative agencies which adjudicate as well as to courts.

The example cited in <em>Cramp-ton </em>involved a situation in which a trial judge had been insulted, slandered, and vilified during trial by a defendant representing himself. The Supreme Court held that the trial judge should not adjudicate postjudgment contempt proceedings against the defendant. <em>Mayberry v Pennsylvania, </em>400 US 455, 465-466; 91 S Ct 499; 27 L Ed 2d 532 (1971). However, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">It is, of course, not every attack on a judge that disqualifies him from sitting. . . . Many of the words leveled at the judge in the instant case were highly personal aspersions, even \u201cfighting words\u201d \u2014 \u201cdirty sonofabitch,\u201d \u201cdirty tyrannical old dog,\u201d \u201cstumbling dog,\u201d and \u201cfool.\u201d He was charged with running a Spanish Inquisition and told to \u201cGo to hell\u201d and \u201cKeep your mouth shut.\u201d Insults of that kind are apt to strike \u201cat the most vulnerable and human qualities of a judge\u2019s temperament.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>In <em>Mayberry, </em>the nature of the defendant\u2019s remarks necessarily required the judge to become \u201cembroiled in a running, bitter controversy\u201d with the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 465. Thus, it would have been improper for the judge to adjudicate the defendant\u2019s contempt proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 466. The facts of the present case do not rise to the level of those presented in <em>Mayberry. </em>See part vn(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Situation 3 listed in <em>Crampton </em>calls for the disqualification of the judge or decisionmaker in an instance where that individual is \u201c \u2018enmeshed in [other] matters involving <em>petitioner.'' </em>\u201d 395 Mich 351, citing <em>Johnson v Mississippi, </em>403 US 212, 215; 91 S Ct 1778; 29 L Ed 2d 423 (1971) (emphasis added). In <em>Johnson, </em>the United States Supreme Court found that a trial judge should be disqualified from adjudicating a defendant\u2019s contempt proceedings where the judge had revealed deep prejudice against the defendant\u2019s profession and, further, was recently a losing party in a civil rights suit brought by that individual. The United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">In concluding that Judge Perry should have recused himself, we do not rely solely on the affidavits filed by the lawyers reciting intemperate remarks of Judge Perry concerning civil rights litigants. Beyond all that was the fact that Judge Perry immediately prior to the adjudication of contempt was a defendant in one of petitioner\u2019s civil rights suits and a losing party at that. <em>From that it is plain that he was so enmeshed in matters involving petitioner as to make it most appropriate for another judge to sit. Trial before \u201can unbiased judge\u201d is essential to due process. </em>[403 US 215-216 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Accordingly, this situation involved an actual previous lawsuit between the judge and the defendant before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>him. Again, the situation in <em>Johnson </em>differs from that presented by the facts of this case. See part VH(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">C. THE <em>CLEMENS v BRUCE </em>DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In the present case, the department has placed heavy reliance on the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Clemens v Bruce, </em>122 Mich App 35; 329 NW2d 522 (1982). <em>Clemens </em>ineffectively interprets the disqualification standard articulated in <em>Crampton. </em>The plaintiffs in <em>Clemens </em>moved to disqualify the judge on the basis of personal bias against their attorney, who had filed a complaint against the judge with the Judicial Tenure Commission as a result of a dispute over the appointment of counsel for indigent criminal defendants.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thus, it appears that the plaintiffs were alleging actual bias pursuant to the court rule. However, without an examination of disqualification law under the court rule, the Court of Appeals held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">[t]he circumstances presented . . . fall within factors (2) and (3) of the test stated in <em>Crampton. </em>The circumstances suggested such a risk of actual prejudice on the part of the judge that due process required his disqualification even absent a showing of actual prejudice. . . . Our decision is not to be construed as suggesting that the trial judge was guilty of any actual impropriety. [122 Mich App 38.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Aside from a repetition of the <em>Crampton </em>language, the Court of Appeals in the <em>Clemens </em>opinion gives little, if any, guidance regarding an interpretation of the listed situations calling for disqualification. The decision incorrectly refers to the <em>Crampton </em>scenarios as \u201cfactors,\u201d as if it is applying some sort of balancing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>test. We disagree with this characterization, because the <em>Crampton </em>scenarios are examples, not factors to be balanced. Moreover, the lack of insightful analysis in <em>Clemens </em>fails to aid this Court in its attempt to understand and apply the <em>Crampton </em>standard for disqualification. Accordingly, we find the department\u2019s emphasis and reliance on <em>Clemens </em>to be misplaced and find that decision to be without precedential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">OPINIONS DENYING THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS\u2019 MOTION TO DISQUALIFY</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">In determining the issue before us, we review the factual findings made by Chief Judge Houk for an abuse of discretion. Judge Houk accepted the version of events as related by Judge Giddings. Consequently, we defer to the factual findings and conclusions of both Chief Judge Houk\u2019s and Judge Giddings\u2019 opinions.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In their arguments to this Court, the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors have, for the most part, relied on the analysis presented in these opinions. Therefore, the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors\u2019 arguments will be addressed within this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">As previously discussed, Judge Giddings\u2019 perception of what took place on September 12, 1994, at the in-chambers meeting is much different from that of Messrs. Govorchin and Soros. Judge Giddings correctly stated that MCR 2.003 requires a showing of actual bias or prejudice.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> However, Mr. Govorchin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>admitted that Judge Giddings has not prejudged the case, nor has he shown actual bias or prejudice.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Accordingly, because of the lack of any actual bias, the opinion states that the court rule has not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Judge Giddings rejected the department\u2019s arguments made under <em>Clemens.</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In response to the department\u2019s statement that Judge Giddings had become \u201csufficiently irritated with and has personal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ized his judicial response to the public statements of Governor John Engler,\u201d Judge Giddings stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">That is utterly false. A dispassionate examination of this Court\u2019s statements makes clear that this Court\u2019s concern has been directed to one thing and one thing only. That one thing is the accurate reporting of court proceedings. That is reflected in repeated statements made on and off the record by this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">This record is barren of any indication of \u201cirritation\u201d or some \u201cpersonalized\u201d response to the Governor\u2019s or any public criticism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Additionally, Judge \u25a0 Giddings responded to the department\u2019s argument that it was inappropriate for him to make comments about the plaintiff\u2019s show cause petition. Judge Giddings stated, \u201c[n]ot only does this Court have the right to examine into the sufficiency of allegations in support of a petition for show cause, the Court has a duty to do so.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">No matter how Defendant chooses to characterize the matter, the upshot of those discussions was that this Court refused to issue the requested Order to Show Cause [why Governor Engler and John Truscott should not be held in contempt] for several reasons. First, the petition was somewhat unclear and imprecise. Moreover, it included allegations against Mr. Truscott which the Court felt would accomplish little but to confuse the process. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">What Defendant really objects to is the Court\u2019s suggestion that Plaintiff might want to focus on Engler\u2019s letter of August, 1994 to Attorney General Kelley. This, it is said by counsel for Defendant, demonstrates \u201cthe appearance of bias or prejudice\u201d against Governor Engler. Assuming that to be true, it is of no consequence here. To the extent Engler may become involved in these proceedings in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>future, this judge would not be presiding at such proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\">At this point, Governor Engler is not a party to these proceedings. Nor is he personally affected by them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Judge Giddings clearly stated that he does not consider the Governor to be a party to the <em>Cain </em>case. Even under the <em>Clemens </em>(i.e., Crampton) standard for disqualification, the bias or prejudice must involve a party. Therefore, Judge Giddings concluded that both of the <em>Clemens </em>situations 2 and 3 are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In response to the Governor\u2019s August 12 letter to Attorney General Kelley, Judge Giddings set forth reasons for the delay in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">[T]he most recent trial adjournment occurred because the Department is in default. This is the second time the Department has been defaulted. The trial was also adjourned because discovery had been delayed by the Department\u2019s failure to comply with the court rules regarding discovery. Moreover, numerous contempt proceedings have been brought against the [Department of Corrections] and the Department has been held in contempt on six different occasions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Accordingly, it appears that the department is in part responsible for the delay in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Lastly, Judge Giddings characterized his actions at the September 12 conference as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">The Court did suggest that Plaintiffs clarify their petition and be more specific. This Court also tried to discourage Plaintiffs from proceeding against Press Secretary Truscott. <em>True, this Court did suggest (not demand or even request) a contempt proceeding against the Governor based on the August 12th letter. </em>The suggestion, however, is appropriate' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>in light of MCL 600.1701(10); MSA 27A.1701(10)\u2019[<footnotemark>42</footnotemark>] and in light of the Canons of Ethics\u2019[<footnotemark>43</footnotemark>] and Michigan case law .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Judge Giddings\u2019 decision denying the disqualification motion was affirmed by Chief Judge Houk in his opinion dated October 7, 1994. In his opinion, Judge Houk supported the analysis and conclusion reached by Judge Giddings.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>vn</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">After a thorough review of the entire record in this case, this Court is of the opinion that disqualification of Judge Giddings is not required. Therefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision requiring disqualification and remand to the trial court for swift, fair, and accurate resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The Court of Appeals, without conducting oral argument or reviewing the complete lower court record, particularly the transcripts of the hearings on the motion to disqualify, peremptorily reversed the decisions of Chief Judge Houk and Judge Giddings. The pertinent portions of the Court of Appeals one-page order are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">The lower court abused its discretion in denying the motion to disqualify Judge James R. Giddings. <em>The record clearly demonstrates actual bias on the part of the trial judge thereby mandating disqualification. </em>MCR 2.003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">Further, the <em>procedural due process guarantees </em>of the Michigan and the United States Constitutions <em>require disqualification </em>under these circumstances. <em>Crampton v Dep\u2019t of State, </em>395 Mich 347, 351; 235 NW2d 352 (1975); <em>Clemens v Bruce, </em>122 Mich App 35; 329 NW2d 522 (1982).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">The record reveals that the trial judge has become personally enmeshed in the prosecution of this claim. At a time when the trial judge considered the Governor of the State of Michigan and defendant Department of Corrections to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>a single entity, the judge personally filed a grievance with the Attorney Grievance Commission against the Governor based upon the Governor\u2019s criticisms of the trial judge\u2019s rulings. Thereafter, the trial judge advised plaintiff\u2019s counsel how to most effectively proceed with a motion to hold the Governor in contempt of court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, this Court concludes that the trial judge has abandoned his essential role of a neutral and detached judicial officer. [Unpublished order, entered December 1, 1994 (Docket No. 179431) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">A. NO SHOWING OF ACTUAL BIAS OR PREJUDICE</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">This Court disagrees with the Court of Appeals decision that the department succeeded in showing that Judge Giddings has demonstrated actual bias or prejudice against it. There has been no such showing of actual bias or prejudice as required by MCR 2.003(B)(1).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> This conclusion is primarily based on Mr. Govorchin\u2019s admission of no actual bias, see n 40, as well as the lack of. evidence to indicate bias throughout the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Furthermore, pursuant to a literal reading of the court rule, disqualification is simply not required on the basis of these facts. The fact of the matter is that the Governor of this state is not a party to this action, nor was he ever a party to this action. Although the department argues that Judge Giddings considered the Governor to be a party, Judge Giddings never declared him to be so.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In fact, after reviewing the record, this Court finds that Judge Giddings was hesitant to include the Governor within the scope of the media contacts order, but did so because the Governor, at that time, was purporting to speak with authority on the subject of <em>Cain v Dep\u2019t of Corrections.</em><footnotemark><em>47</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, Judge Giddings never declared the Governor to be a party to this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">It did not escape our attention that the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors have presented inconsistent arguments regarding the status of the Governor in relation to this case. They argue that the Governor is not a party for purposes of the <em>Crampton </em>theory of disqualification. Yet, they also argue that the Governor is a party for purposes of amenability to the orders issued by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Coincidentally, the dissent presents the mirror image of the inconsistent argument advanced by the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs-intervenors. The dissent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>would impose a test for determining who constitutes a \u201cparty\u201d under MCR 2.003(B)(1) that is dependent on the trial judge\u2019s subjective beliefs. Without any support for its contention, the dissent states that \u201cthe judge\u2019s perception\u201d is the touchstone for determining disqualification questions. <em>Post </em>at 528. Apparently, the dissent wishes to implement a two-pronged subjective inquiry. First, in determining who is a \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of MCR 2.003(B)(1), the dissent contends that we must look to the judge\u2019s perception. Second, in determining whether the trial judge is personally biased or prejudiced, the dissent contends that we must again step inside the mind of the judge. The dissent fails to set forth any support for either of these contentions. Conversely, the federal statutes employ an objective standard for determining the bias or prejudice prong of the disqualification analysis. See n 48. We find the federal objective test to be a sound approach to disqualification motions brought pursuant to MCR 2.003(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Under the dissent\u2019s proposed definition, a \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of MCR 2.003(B)(1) is anyone whom the judge perceives to be a party. Under this analysis, which requires this Court to examine the judge\u2019s subjective beliefs, the dissent impliedly concludes that Governor Engler is a party to the <em>Cain </em>litigation. Therefore the dissent explicitly concludes that the department is thereby precluded from receiving a fair trial of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">However, the dissent\u2019s argument, if followed to its logical conclusion, would subject the Governor to the orders and contempt powers of the trial court in this case. Surely, the dissent would not stand for such a result. Like the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>intervenors, the dissent cannot manipulate the present situation so as to achieve its desired, albeit inconsistent, result. If the Governor is deemed a party by virtue of Judge Giddings\u2019 alleged beliefs or perceptions as the dissent proposes, then the Governor would be subject to the orders set forth by the judge and is further amenable to the judge\u2019s contempt powers. It is that simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We prefer an alternate course to that suggested by the dissent. Specifically, we employ a commonsensical and literal reading of the court rule in reaching the conclusion that the Governor is not a party to this case. Moreover, we believe that imposing a subjective test for determining a \u201cparty\u201d will only create confusion in disqualification and other situations involving a \u201cparty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In order for disqualification pursuant to MCR 2.003(B)(1) to be proper, the judge must have shown actual bias against a <em>party </em>or a party\u2019s attorney. Because the bias in this case was between the judge and a nonparty, the requirements of MCR 2.003(B)(1) have simply not been met. Moreover, this Court would like to stress that the record reveals a mutual respect between Judge Giddings and the attorneys for the department. Clearly, the Court of Appeals was wrong when it held that Judge Giddings demonstrated actual bias against the department.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Additionally, there has been no showing that the alleged bias or prejudice is \u201cpersonal\u201d as required by MCR 2.003(B)(1). The department has challenged actions on the part of Judge Giddings that took place within the confines of this lawsuit. It has not alleged that the bias stems from some extrajudicial source. We find the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Liteky, supra, </em>to be instructive with respect to our application of MCR 2.003(B)(1). Accordingly, the department has failed to persuade us that Judge Giddings\u2019 alleged animosity toward the Governor or his actions at the September 12 in-chambers conference are such that he has displayed a \u201cdeep-seated favoritism\u201d for the plaintiffs (or the plaintiffs-intervenors) or \u201cantagonism\u201d for the department to the extent that fair judgment is rendered impossible in this case.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>B. THE <em>CRAMPTON </em>STANDARD FOR DISQUALIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Pursuant to <em>Crampton, </em>the question is whether the present situation is one where \u201cexperience teaches that the probability of actual bias ... is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\u201d 395 Mich 351. Analysis of disqualification issues under <em>Crampton </em>requires a case-by-case determination of when the risk of actual bias is too prevalent, so that the constitutional guarantee of a fair trial would be inhibited. As stated in n 33, the constitutional standard for disqualification is not easily met. We stress that it is only through an examination of the four listed scenarios and their concomitant examples that the \u201cexperience teaches\u201d test articulated in <em>Crampton </em>is rendered meaningful. See n 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We find that Judge Giddings\u2019 apparent conflict with the Governor is not a proper basis for disqualification under the test or the scenarios articulated in <em>Cramp-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>ton. </em>A narrow reading of <em>Crampton </em>leads us to conclude that the facts of this case are unquestionably distinguishable from those situations listed in <em>Crampton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">First, Judge Giddings was not the target of personal abuse by a party before him, as was the judge in <em>May-berry. </em>See part v(b).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Rather, the comments were made by the nonparty Governor who at that time was at the height of his campaign for reelection. We find it most unfortunate that Judge Giddings failed to recognize and insulate himself from the political climate in which he was operating at the time.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> However, it is this Court\u2019s belief that with the passage of time, so comes the cooling of tempers and the cooling of rhetoric. What was once a very hot climate surrounding this case has now become considerably cooler. Accordingly, the remarks made some time ago are not likely to resurface. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he mere fact that a judge has been subjected to press criticism in connection with a case or a party does not necessarily require the judge\u2019s disqualification.\u201d <em>Illinois v Cole</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>man, </em>168 Ill 2d 509, 541; 660 NE2d 919 (1995).<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The Governor is not the department, just as the department is not the Governor. This Court is confident that the department will not be denied a fair trial of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Second, unlike the judge in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>Judge Giddings is not enmeshed in other matters involving the department or other parties to this case.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> This Court finds that the struggle between the Governor and Judge Giddings does not rise to the level of being \u201cenmeshed\u201d as set forth in <em>Crampton. </em>See part v(b). Judicial officers should resist the temptation to enter into public political discussions with candidates for public office. However, this Court recognizes the ability of individual judges to file requests for investigation with the Attorney Grievance Commission pursuant to the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Moreover, on the basis of the facts of this case, we understand Judge Giddings\u2019 concern regarding the accuracy of the statements made to the press. Cognizant of the fact that the propriety of Judge Giddings\u2019 allegedly overbroad media contacts order is not before us, it must be remembered that trial judges are human and they do make mistakes. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>remedy for mistakes made by trial judges lies in the appellate process, not in motions to disqualify. Therefore, we do not think that Judge Giddings\u2019 vigorous attempt to regulate the accuracy of statements made to the press is a sound basis for his disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Additionally, we do not find that Judge Giddings\u2019 actions at the September 12, 1994, in-chambers meeting warrant his disqualification. In reaching this conclusion, we choose to defer to the findings of both Judge Giddings and Chief Judge Houk. See pp 504-507.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Particularly, we accept Judge Houk\u2019s decision regarding the events that took place during that meeting. This is not only a class action, it is a class action involving a class of prisoners who are proceeding in propria persona. Therefore, the nature of this lawsuit dictates that the judge assume a more active role than he would in ordinary day-to-day civil litigation. Accordingly, we find that Judge Giddings\u2019 advice to the plaintiffs appearing in propria persona regarding the structure of their motion was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">This Court is less certain about the propriety of Judge Giddings \u201csuggestion\u201d that the August 12 letter from the Governor to Attorney General Frank Kelley was an alternative ground for a contempt motion. Nonetheless, defense counsel did not object at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>time, nor were any objections made at the hearing following that in-chambers meeting. Each of the events challenged by the department, even when viewed together, do not amount to the judge being enmeshed in other matters to the extent that disqualification is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">vm</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Having concluded that the disqualification of Judge Giddings was erroneously ordered by the Court of Appeals, we reverse and remand this case for immediate scheduling of trial. After nearly eight years of pretrial litigation, this Court is convinced that the resolution of this case must be accomplished fairly and expeditiously. We expect not only the swift resolution of this case, we further expect that the parties and the court will engage in the appropriate good will so that resolution will be an easier task. In conformance with our directive of swift resolution, we order the trial court judge to investigate, with the state\u2019s Attorney General, the advisability of the appointment of a special counsel to represent the class of male prisoner plaintiffs who have thus far proceeded in propria persona. We further order that the court and the parties prepare an expedited calendar for scheduling purposes and that the court submit to this Court a report indicating the dates set for trial in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b642-9\">Levin, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-8\"> Until his disqualification in this case, Judge Giddings has sat as both an Ingham Circuit judge and as a judge of the Court of Claims. Primarily, this case has been a Court of Claims case; thus, Judge Giddings, rather than a jury, is the finder of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> This class action involves two classes of plaintiffs. The original plaintiffs are male prisoners numbering greater than 36,000. This class is proceeding in propria persona. The second class, the plaintiffs-intervenors, is comprised of over 1,700 women prisoners. This class is represented by counsel. Further, several other individual cases filed by prisoners have been consolidated with this one at the request of the Department of Corrections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\"> As a result of this case having been filed in 1988, many volumes of lower court records have been generated. Out of necessity and brevity, this opinion will attempt to keep the procedural facts contained in these pretrial volumes to a minimum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b597-9\"> The department was also opening a new level VI (\u201csuper max\u201d) security classification for prisoners with substantial behavioral problems and wanted to restrict level VI prisoner access to personal property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\"> On March 2, 1988, the department issued an implementation preparation memo and a revised version of its policy directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Increased personal property shall be afforded to prisoners as their custody level is reduced. [1988 Policy Directive, PD-BCF-53.01, p 2.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b598-12\"> Two courts are involved in this case, the Ingham Circuit Court (Docket No. 88-61119-AZ) and the Court of Claims (Docket Nos. 93-15000-CM and 93-14975-CM). Apparently, as explained by plaintiffs-intervenors\u2019 counsel, Charlene Snow, the original complaint of the male plaintiffs was filed in the Court of Claims with a circuit court suffix number. The Ingham Circuit Court clerk\u2019s office opened the case as a circuit court action and put it on its docket. Judge Giddings found the error and recommended that it be corrected. Judge Giddings has served as the judge in this matter in both courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\"> A general idea of the nature of the statute, MCL 800.42; MSA 28.1411, can be gleaned from the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">A prisoner in a correctional facility having a security designation of IV, V, or VI shall not wear or have in his or her living area any personal clothing, except that a prisoner in a correctional facility having a security designation of IV may keep 1 set of personal clothing as determined by the department in his or her living area and may wear such clothing for court appearances or during visits. A prisoner in a correctional facility having a security designation of V or VI shall be provided civilian clothing by the institution for jury trials or as ordered by the court for other court appearances.

This was also included in Judge Giddings\u2019 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b599-10\"> The preliminary injunction reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">It is ordered that from and after September 18, 1989, Defendant, its officers, agents, servants, employees, and those acting in concert or participation with them are restrained and enjoined from:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>(1) implementation of MCL 800.42 until further order of this Court;</p>\n<p id=\"ANy\">(2) implementation of any version of PD-BCF-53.01 subsequent to the 9-16-85 version until further order of this Court; and</p>\n<p id=\"Anpv\">(3) the Defendant agrees that implementation of Emergency Rules 3 and 4 as to personal property be restrained until further order of the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b600-12\"> As a result of the quantity of contempt lawsuits that were being filed by prisoners, Judge Giddings appointed a monitor on February 14, 1990, to look into prisoner complaints. Three different individuals have subsequently served as the monitor in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b600-16\"> Judge Giddings based his decision on a literal interpretation of the statute as well as a recent United States Supreme Court case, <em>Demurest v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Manspeaker, </em>498 US 184; 111 S Ct 599; 112 L Ed 2d 608 (1991). At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Giddings stated on the record:</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The long and the short of it is simply this, the statute is clear. Every person who goes to court gets a witness fee subject to the exceptions set forth therein. There is no exception for prisoners. If the Legislature wants to adopt exceptions, that\u2019s up to them. They haven\u2019t done that. Since they haven\u2019t done it, that\u2019s the rule. So, they would be entitled to their witness fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">It should be noted that after this decision, the Legislature amended the statute so that prisoners are no longer entitled to the statutory witness fee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> \u201cThe guy\u2019s a lunatic.

Furthermore, after being pressed by the state bar to apologize to Judge Giddings, the Governor refused. However, he did issue an apology to the Wayne State University Law School and its graduates. The Governor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">I was surprised when I read that (Giddings went to Wayne State), because I\u2019ve appointed many graduates of the Wayne State University law school to the bench .... They\u2019re outstanding, learned judges so it\u2019s inconceivable to me that Jim Giddings went to the same school. He may have gone there, but he didn\u2019t learn the same law or the same appreciation of the constitution .... I think his rulings are off the wall and I think the Legislature is probably going to intervene to eliminate the right of prisoners sitting in their cells to copjure up legal actions in order to keep drawing witness fees ....

Judge Giddings stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Those, who were present, know full well that, in fact, those fees would be paid out of Prisoner Benefit Fund, not taxpayers funds, and if and whether the taxpayers would ever be required to pay those witness fees is highly speculative at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">However, Judge Giddings felt as if his rulings had been mischaracterized in the press. He further commented that members of the press contacted him at home. Judge Giddings decided that</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the Department [should] make some provision whereby somebody can speak on behalf of the male prisoners. [T]he female prisoners have their own spokesperson [and] some mechanism [should] be devised whereby . . . somebody, will be made available to authorized representatives of the news media within say 30 minutes after the Department contacts so that they can say here\u2019s what the ruling was. . . . Because I just don\u2019t want to be put in that position and I want to be certain, at least, there is a fair opportunity for the media to have a balanced view of what is transpiring because to some extent some of the statements that have been made may affect this Court\u2019s ability to administer this class action. ...

[Emphasis added.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\"> The transcript of the hearing reflects the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\"><em>Ms. Snow. . . . </em>[I]t seems to me that it is clear that the Court meant only to direct [the June 2 order] to those people from the State of Michigan who have some kind of interface with this case, not any individual who simply chose to write a letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\"><em>The Court: </em>So would not that include the Governor?</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\"><em>Ms. Snow: </em>It appears that the Governor is choosing to have interface with this case. I\u2019m not sure whether Mr. Govorchin or Mr. Soros directly represent the Governor. I guess this is kind of a twist in the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\"><em>The Court: </em>I assume he is the chief executive officer.

Anything beyond that I think is beyond even the scope of the remedy the Court was trying to fashion with regard to the <em>Cain </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>So is the Governor covered? No. I don\u2019t represent the Governor in this proceeding. Have never represented to the Court that I do. And that\u2019s not been our position. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\"><em>The Court-. . . . </em>[I]n terms of a legal entity, there may be a unity between the Department of Corrections, and for that matter the DNR and the Governor.

I am not sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\"><em>Mr. Govorchin: </em>Well, our argument is that they are separate and distinct for the purposes of this litigation, from the Governor\u2019s office and from the other State Departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">After this exchange took place, the court stated to the parties its motivation behind issuing the June 2, 1994, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\"><em>The Court: </em>[I]nsulating the Court from criticism was certainly not the purpose. Anybody and everybody has the right to criticize the Court, criticize the Court\u2019s rulings and the basis for the Court\u2019s rulings. However, I have [n\u2019t] been presented with any authority that suggests that people have the right to misrepresent the Court\u2019s rulings when they involve \u2014 in the business before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">I don\u2019t know of any authority that gives people the right to, for example, when I enter an order, that enables the Department to live up to their duties under 53.01, that I am somehow ordering the Department to make color televisions available to prisoners. Absolutely absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">So the purpose of that order is not to level the playing field but to be an enducement [sic] on those who write of this case to take care to malee sure that they write accurately and to at least provide a mechanism so that if others happen to write incorrectly, they may have a judicial right to be wrong. I think they do. But someone else may pick that up and say, no, that\u2019s not what happened. This is what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">I really don\u2019t care if somebody wants to say that my decisions are ill reasoned and Judge Giddings was not logical, or I did not follow the law. Fine. That\u2019s their opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">\n<em>The purpose was to see that those who are involved, in the litigation and purport to speak with authority about this litigation, </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\n<em>have a certain obligation under this court order. And only those who purport to do so.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">\n<em>Obviously any time Director McGinnis speaks he has to be speaking with authority because he\u2019s the director. Any time Warren Williams does that he has to. Seems to me the Governor is in the same position because he has supervisory authority over Director McGinnis. And as does his agents, trustors.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\"><em>So I would grant the following clarification.

The sole issue before us is whether the disqualification of Judge Giddings by the Court of Appeals was warranted under the existing court rule and case law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\"> The letter stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">I am writing to express my serious concern about yet another delay in the trial of <em>Cain v Michigan Department of Corrections, </em>pending before Ingham County Circuit Judge James Giddings. As you know, in 1988 Judge Giddings enjoined the implementation of a Department of Corrections policy and later a state statute governing the types of personal property that state prison inmates may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>possess. I understand that on Monday of this week Judge Giddings announced that the trial scheduled to begin in November of this year would be delayed yet again, this time until after January 15, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">I consider this delay, and the others that have preceded it, a miscarriage of justice against the people of this state. As you know, Michigan prison inmates filed this lawsuit in April 1988. <em>This court, for reasons known only to it, has been unable to conduct a trial of this matter in the nearly six-and-a-half years that it has been pending. . . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">This micromanagement of our state prisons is judicial activism run amok. It should and must be brought to an end so that management of our state prisons is taken out of the hands of the judiciary and returned to those charged by law with administering our state prison system.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">I am, therefore, asking that you immediately seek a writ of superintending control from the Michigan Court of Appeals to force Judge Giddings to conduct a trial of this matter as previously scheduled in November 1994. Given the nearly seven-year duration of this case, I am convinced that this is the only way to insure its conclusion at the trial court level. The people of this state can no longer afford to have justice delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Apparently, this letter was not forwarded to Judge Giddings, nor was he contacted before it was written and sent to the Attorney General. However, the letter was made immediately available to the press. See Judge Giddings\u2019 opinion, dated September 30, 1994, pp 12-13. The reasons for the delay will be set forth in a discussion of Judge Giddings\u2019 disqualification opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b611-9\"> Relevant portions of the August 23, 1994, press release read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">The policy [requiring the most dangerous inmates to wear uniforms] and subsequent legislation to implement the policy had been enjoined by an Ingham County Circuit Court judge in the <em>Cain v Michigan Department of Corrections </em>case.

In <em>Tumey v Ohio, </em>273 US 510, 523; 47 S Ct 437; 71 L Ed 749 (1927), the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">[I]t certainly violates the [Due Process Clause of the] Fourteenth Amendment ... to subject [a person\u2019s] liberty or property to the judgment of a court the judge of which has a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest in reaching a conclusion against <em>him </em>in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">However, the United States Supreme Court has also stated that</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>not \u201c]a]ll questions of judicial qualification . . . involve constitutional validity.

Accordingly, the burden is heavy for a disqualification motion grounded on the constitutional right to an unbiased and impartial tribunal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\"> <em>Withrow </em>involved the administrative board in charge of licensing physicians, and warning, reprimanding, or suspending physician licenses. The Court found no procedural due process violation where a physician examining board conducted an investigation, issued charges, and then sat as the decisionmaker at the hearing on the charges. Accordingly, like <em>Crampton, Withrow </em>takes place in the administrative agency setting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\"> Because <em>Crampton </em>arose in an administrative agency context, the disqualification court rule (at that time GCR 1963, 912) was inapplicable, i.e., it only applied to \u201cjudges,\u201d as does the current court rule. The right to a fair hearing exists in the administrative setting just as it does in the courtroom. Accordingly, the <em>Crampton </em>decision developed out of the constitutional right to a fair hearing in front of an impartial decisionmaker. See, generally, <em>Ferrario v Escanaba Bd of Ed, </em>426 Mich 353; 395 NW2d 195 (1986) (the board of education conducted a hearing into charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>alleged against a teacher); <em>Morris v Metriyakool, </em>n 33 <em>supra </em>(medical malpractice arbitration panels).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b624-9\"> Importantly, we recognize the amorphous nature of the situations listed in <em>Crampton </em>as 1 through 4; therefore, an analysis of the examples given as illustrative of each particular situation is critical.

We assume this is because <em>Clemens </em>involved a judge, whereas <em>Crampton </em>involved an administrative board.

Chief Judge Houk stressed that counsel for the department was unable to point to a single ruling or event that prejudiced the department. Further, the department has not sought to remove Judge Giddings from other cases in which it is a party. In fact, Mr. Govorchin had acknowledged that most of Judge Giddings\u2019 rulings were favorable to the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Chief Judge Houk stated that the department \u201cfailed to discharge its \u2018heavy burden\u2019 and demonstrate \u2018actual prejudice\u2019 . . . .\u201d Furthermore, the department failed to meet the test articulated in <em>Clemens </em>and <em>Cramp-ton. </em>He based his conclusion on the fact that Mr. Govorchin acknowledged that he was unable to show any actual bias against his client. Further, none of the <em>Clemens </em>\u201cfactors\u201d were present. Lastly, many of the asserted matters had become stale.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Chief Judge Houk did not accept the version of events presented by Messrs. Govorchin and Soros, because their recollections did not comport with those of the others present at the meeting. Rather, Chief Judge Houk accepted the version of events as related by Judge Giddings himself, attorney Charlene Snow, and the prisoner litigants. The fact that the plaintiffs\u2019 show cause motion changed from its initial form shows no more than compliance with the judge\u2019s comments at that meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Finally, Chief Judge Houk responds to the department\u2019s primary contention that because Judge Giddings harbors ill feelings against the Governor, these feelings have ripened into bias against the department. The Chief Judge stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">[A] system that rewards attacks upon a judge by the champion of a party by requiring the judge\u2019s recusal where the judge\u2019s response has been authorized by law, and not publicly advanced by the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>can only result in forum shopping that will ultimately destroy the independent judiciary that all State Officers are sworn to uphold. This is particularly true where counsel does not demonstrate actual bias or prejudice against the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">Accordingly, Chief Judge Houk denied the department\u2019s motion to disqualify Judge Giddings from this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\"> In his concurrence, Chief Justice Brickley suggests that by focusing on subsection (B)(1) of the court rule, we are \u201crestrainflng] disqualification to situations that happen to be accurately reflected in an example.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 519-520.

That which the concurrence urges, we do. Specifically, we recognize the nonexclusive nature of the list of situations set forth in MCR 2.003(B). However, in answering the disqualification question we have focused on subsection (B)(1). Because the department has alleged actual bias on the part of Judge Giddings and the Court of Appeals has found such bias, we find it absolutely necessary to address the question concerning actual bias. Therefore, we are required to apply subsection (B)(1) of the court rule. We do not agree that our application of MCR 2.003(B)(1) has the effect of restraining the number of situations that call for disqualification of the trial judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b634-7\"> Even if the department were correct in its assertion that in the judge\u2019s mind, the Governor was a party to this lawsuit, this would not change the fact that, in reality, the Governor was not a party. The court rule does not allow for such a loose interpretation of the term \u201cparty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\"> As stated in n 22 <em>supra, </em>the propriety of Judge Giddings\u2019 ruling regarding the Governor is pending in the Court of Appeals. Whether the decision to include the Governor within the scope of the media contacts order was proper has no bearing on the issue of disqualification presented here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\"> It appears that the department has pursued its motion on the basis of the appearance of impropriety. This is the phraseology of one of the standards adopted by the federal courts, found at 28 USC 144 and 28 USC 455. \u201cUnder both statutes, recusal is appropriate where \u2018a reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts would conclude that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yagman v Republic Ins, </em>987 F2d 622, 626 (CA 9, 1993) (citations omitted).

These statutes afford more protection to parties than does the constitution. Thus, the federal \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d standard of \u00a7 455(a) is not the standard for disqualification under due process. See <em>United States v Wade, </em>931 F2d 300, 304, n 5 (CA 5, 1991); <em>United States v Couch, </em>896 F2d 78 (CA 5, 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We acknowledge there may be situations in which the appearance of impropriety on the part of a judge or decisionmaker is so strong as to rise to the level of a due process violation. However, this case does not present such a situation. After reviewing the lower court record, we find that the actions of Judge Giddings do not constitute a deprivation of the department\u2019s due process guarantee of an unbiased and impartial decisionmaker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\"> The similarities between the requirements of MCR 2.003(B)(1) and 28 USC 455(b)(1), provide access to a body of federal disqualification case law to which this Court may look for guidance. The following cases involve situations like the present case in which the alleged judicial bias or animus was directed not toward the party desiring disqualification, but toward someone who was in someway connected to that party. See <em>In re City of Detroit, </em>828 F2d 1160 (CA 6, 1987). In <em>People Helpers Foundation v Richmond, Va, </em>12 F3d 1321 (CA 4, 1993), the district judge was not per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>sonally biased against the City of Richmond in a suit brought against the city for violation of the fair housing act. That the judge voiced his perceptions concerning the case and made comments that allegedly demonstrated his negative feelings about the conduct of a former city council member, were insufficient to show a personal bias against the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Generally, the federal cases discussing disqualification for actual personal bias under \u00a7 455(b)(1), indicate that these motions are rarely granted. For example, see <em>Yagman v Republic Ins, </em>n 48 <em>supra. </em>In <em>Yagman, </em>the district judge sat as the adjudicator in a previous heated defamation trial in which Mr. Yagman served as an attorney for the plaintiff. On appeal, the judge\u2019s imposition of sanctions on Mr. Yagman was vacated and the case was reassigned to preserve the appearance of justice. The district judge did not reassign the case as directed, which then prompted the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to issue a writ of mandamus ordering reassignment. In response, the judge unsuccessfully petitioned for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. Subsequently, in a different case, Mr. Yagman sought recusal of the same judge on the basis of the events of the previous lawsuit. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the events of the previous case, which involved heated conflicts between the judge and Mr. Yagman, were insufficient to prove actual or even apparent bias in the latter case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b639-5\"> In <em>Mayberry, </em>degrading comments were made by a party directly to the judge in the courtroom setting. The United States Supreme Court found that it would therefore be improper for that judge to adjudicate the party\u2019s contempt proceeding arising as a result of the abusive comments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\"> The following passage from <em>Mahlen Land Corp, </em>n 31 <em>supra </em>at 350, continues to be appropriate and wise advice for trial judges to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We would desire that all trial courts be irreproachable in patience, tact, wisdom, and courtesy, not only learned in the law but impervious to the vexations and irritations that plague the rest of mankind.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Additionally, the following advice offered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is instructive: \u201c[B]y training and inclination, judges meet media criticism of their actions with robust insensitivity.\u201d <em>United States v Martorano, </em>866 F2d 62, 69 (CA 3, 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\"> Prior written attacks upon a judge are . . . legally insufficient to support a charge of bias or prejudice on the part of a judge toward an author. <em>[United States v Bray, </em>546 F2d 851, 858 (CA 10, 1976).]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\"> Again, <em>Johnson </em>involved a situation in which the judge was involved in previous litigation with a party.

See <em>Kolowich v Ferguson, </em>264 Mich 668, 670; 250 NW 875 (1933). This Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">We accept the statement of the circuit judge that he has no bias or prejudice and can accord defendant a fair trial. Unless the fact of prejudice or bias is established or the necessities of justice to the defendant require it, a change of judge is an unjustifiable wrong to the public for it works delay, entails expense, and endangers the prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b642-10\">Brickley, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWB\">(concurring). While I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Judge Giddings should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>be disqualified from hearing the underlying suit, I write separately because the conflict between the majority and the dissent over whether the Governor is a \u201cparty\u201d to this suit threatens to overwhelm thoughtful resolution of the actual issue in this case\u2014 whether the conduct of the Governor and Judge Giddings requires Judge Giddings\u2019 disqualification from the <em>Cain </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The Court\u2019s struggle to define the Governor\u2019s relationship to the suit is understandable. The relationship between a governor and a department is difficult to define because it is unique. On the one hand, the State Constitution vests in the Governor broad powers over the departments of state. See, e.g., Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3 and 8. On the other hand, we do not expect the Governor, as a practical matter, to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the departments, including most litigation. This particular relationship renders any attempt to decide whether the Governor is a \u201cparty\u201d to litigation between a department and a third party a frustrating and divisive task at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">At worst, this attempt distracts this Court\u2019s attention from the disqualification issue. The court rule disqualifies a judge from hearing the underlying litigation when the \u201cjudge cannot impartially hear a case . . . .\u201d MCR 2.003(B). By focusing on subsection (B)(1) of the court rule, the majority and the dissent ignore the broader mandate of the court rule in favor of an example of when a \u201cjudge cannot impartially hear a case.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would not restrain disqualifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tion to situations that happen to be accurately reflected in an example. Instead, I would disqualify this judge if I determined, with reference to the examples, that this judge could not in fact impartially hear a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Under the facts before this Court, I agree with the majority that Judge Giddings can impartially hear the <em>Cain </em>litigation. The facts show that Judge Giddings aided a plaintiff in propria persona by recommending substantive additions to plaintiffs show cause motion \u2014 in chambers in the presence of opposing counsel. Such an action is consistent with the judge\u2019s separate power to \u201cproperly intervene in a trial of a case to promote expedition, and prevent unnecessary waste of time, or to clear up some obscurity . . . .\u201d Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3A(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Additionally, in the present case Judge Giddings could have filed the show cause order himself. See MCR 3.606 and MCL 600.1701(g); MSA 27A. 1701(g). Where the judge could have filed the show cause order, I find nothing improper in the judge\u2019s decision to aid a plaintiff in propria persona to accomplish the same objective. Either under the facts as stated by the plaintiffs or under the facts propounded by defendants, nothing regarding Judge Giddings\u2019 conduct in camera, standing on its own, suggests that Judge Giddings cannot in fact impartially hear the <em>Cain </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">I reach the same conclusion when viewing the proceedings in camera in light of Judge Giddings\u2019 June 2 and 30, 1994, media contact orders. Without com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>meriting on whether the orders were a mistake of law, I recognize that, even if the orders did exceed Judge Giddings\u2019 authority, he made a legal mistake. The remedy for a legal mistake is the appellate process, not a motion to disqualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">If anything, viewing the proceedings in camera in the context of the media contact orders emphasizes the propriety of these proceedings. Because Judge Giddings acted under the assumption that the Governor violated a court order, filing a motion to show cause is not out of the ordinary. The facts simply do not suggest that Judge Giddings cannot impartially hear the <em>Cain </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">I also agree that the facts of this case do not harmonize with those situations that require due process disqualification. I agree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of due process case law. I agree that the citations of United States Supreme Court cases in this Court\u2019s <em>Crampton </em>decision frame the discussion of whether a particular fact situation rises to the level of a due process issue. <em>Crampton v Dep\u2019t of State, </em>395 Mich 347; 235 NW2d 352 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">However, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s application of the due process case law to these facts. As in my analysis of the Court Rule, I would not base a ruling on a \u201cyes or no\u201d analysis of whether the Governor was a \u201cparty\u201d to the suit. Instead, I would prefer to recognize that the Governor was, in some manner, connected to this suit. The task in ruling on a motion to disqualify is to decide whether that connection was close enough, and if the conduct was outrageous enough, that the situation suggests that the probability of actual bias is great enough to counsel in favor of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>However, even assuming the Governor\u2019s connection to the Department of Corrections was close enough, and that the Governor\u2019s conduct was outrageous enough, the Due Process Clause does not require disqualification in this circumstance. To make this point, I will review the second and the third situations listed in <em>Crampton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The second situation listed in <em>Crampton </em>requires disqualification if the judge \u201c \u2018has been the target of personal abuse or criticism from the party before him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351. This Court explained this statement by discussing the United States Supreme Court case of <em>Mayberry v Pennsylvania, </em>400 US 455; 91 S Ct 499; 27 L Ed 2d 532 (1971). <em>Crampton, </em>395 Mich 352. <em>Mayberry </em>holds that, when a judge has been such a target, the judge should be disqualified from hearing postjudgment contempt proceedings. <em>Mayberry </em>does not disqualify a judge from continuing to hear the underlying case, the case during which the judge was targeted. <em>Mayberry, </em>400 US 465-466. See also <em>Taylor v Hayes, </em>418 US 488, 501-503; 94 S Ct 2697; 41 L Ed 2d 897 (1974). Because all the parties agree that Judge Giddings would not preside over a contempt hearing against the Governor, I cannot conclude that <em>Cramp-ton's </em>second situation compels Judge Giddings\u2019 disqualification from the underlying <em>Cain </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The third situation listed in <em>Crampton </em>requires disqualification if the judge is \u201c \u2018enmeshed in [other] matters involving petitioner ....\u2019\u201d <em>Crampton, </em>395 Mich 351 (bracketing in the original). <em>Crampton </em>explained this statement by discussing the United States Supreme Court\u2019s case of <em>Johnson v Mississippi, </em>403 US 212; 91 S Ct 1778; 29 L Ed 2d 423 (1971). In <em>Johnson, </em>the judge was disqualified from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>adjudicating a courtroom observer to be in contempt for actions occurring in the judge\u2019s courtroom because the judge had just been a losing defendant in a separate civil rights suit involving the same observer. 403 US 215-216. Therefore, I interpret the third <em>Cram/pton </em>situation as disqualifying a judge when the judge is enmeshed in other matters, separate from the underlying litigation, involving a petitioner. Otherwise, a party in a case could disqualify a judge simply by attacking the judge in the context of the underlying litigation until the judge became enmeshed in the situation created by the attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Applying this interpretation of <em>Crampton </em>to the present facts, I conclude that Judge Giddings was not enmeshed in other matters, separate from the underlying litigation, involving the Governor. All the challenged activity on the part of the Governor and on the part of Judge Giddings took place during, and concerned, the underlying <em>Cain </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In conclusion, the majority\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s debate over whether the Governor was a party to this litigation obscures the essential issue. Under the court rule, the essential issue is whether the judge can impartially hear the case. Nothing in the facts before the Court suggests that Judge Giddings cannot. Under the Due Process Clause, the essential issue is whether \u201cexperience teaches that the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge ... is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\u201d <em>Crampton, </em>395 Mich 351, quoting <em>Withrow v Larkin, </em>421 US 35, 47; 95 S Ct 1456; 43 L Ed 2d 712 (1975). Nothing about these facts leads me to conclude that there is sufficient appearance of bias to recommend disqualification. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Therefore, I agree with the result reached by the majority.</p>\n<judges id=\"b648-5\">Levin, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Brickley, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-6\"> I recognize that the parties have phrased this issue in terms of subsection (B)(1), but I see no compelling reason to similarly limit our discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>sion of the underlying motion to disqualify, especially when such a limitation confuses the underlying issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b648-6\">Riley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADG\">(dissenting). I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision holding that Judge Giddings should be disqualified from further participation in this case. Therefore, for the reasons set forth following, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">I am persuaded that Judge Giddings is unable to impartially decide this case consistently with <em>Crampton v Dep\u2019t of State, </em>395 Mich 347; 235 NW2d 352 (1975), or MCR 2.003. I believe Judge Giddings should be disqualified under <em>Crampton </em>because he has become \u201c \u2018enmeshed in [other] matters involving petitioner,\u2019,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and is \u201c \u2018the target of personal abuse or criticism from the party before him . . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, Judge Giddings has demonstrated that he is personally biased against the Department of Corrections and should be disqualified pursuant to MCR 2.003(B)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, I am persuaded that Ingham Circuit Court Chief Judge Peter D. Houk abused his discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to disqualify Judge Giddings and that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>i</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The Department of Corrections filed a timely motion to disqualify Judge Giddings on September 26, 1994. Judge Giddings denied defendant\u2019s motion by opinion dated September 30, 1994. Pursuant to MCR 2.003(C)(3)(a), the motion was referred to Chief Judge Houk, who reviewed the matter de novo and affirmed Judge Giddings\u2019 decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, the Court of Appeals granted immediate consideration and held that the lower court abused its discretion in denying Judge Giddings\u2019 disqualification.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I believe the standard of review for this Court is also abuse of discretion. Accordingly, the Court must defer to findings of fact made by Chief Judge Houk, including his refusal to accept defense counsels\u2019 account of the in-chambers exchange.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court is, therefore, bound to analyze the merits of defendant\u2019s claim on the basis of Judge Giddings\u2019 account of the in-chambers exchange.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">I disagree, however, with the chief judge that acceptance of Judge Giddings\u2019 account of the in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>chambers exchange is fatal to the Department of Corrections\u2019 motion for disqualification.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to Judge Giddings\u2019 September 30, 1994, opinion denying defendant\u2019s motion to disqualify: \u201cThis Court has little disagreement with the summary of the in-chambers discussions and other events described\u201d in defendant\u2019s brief in support of the motion to disqualify. The facts of this case, as conceded by Judge Giddings and applied to the law in this state, warrant Judge Giddings\u2019 disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">I agree with much of the majority\u2019s conscientious analysis of the law of disqualification. The Court of Appeals has traditionally analyzed judge-disqualification cases separately under the court rule and <em>Crampton. Crampton </em>is broader than the court rule because it specifically obviates the requirement of actual bias in cases in which a litigant\u2019s due process guarantees are violated. I agree with the majority that <em>Crampton </em>is best interpreted as setting forth a nonexhaustive list of situations in which a judge cannot impartially hear a case. This analysis is more appropriately deemed an alternative to, rather than an extension of, the court rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Parole Bd, </em>210 Mich App 148, 155; 532 NW2d 899 (1995).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion to disqualify Judge Giddings should be analyzed separately under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the court rule and the <em>Crampton </em>standard of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">I am persuaded that Judge Giddings should be disqualified on the basis of the due process analysis enunciated in <em>Crampton. Crampton </em>held that a basic requirement of due process is a \u201chearing before an unbiased and impartial decisionmaker . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351. Relying on <em>Withrow v Larkin, </em>421 US 35, 47; 95 S Ct 1456; 43 L Ed 2d 712 (1975), the Court held that proof of actual bias <em>is not necessary </em>if \u201c \u2018experience teaches that the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crampton, supra </em>at 351. <em>Crampton </em>then set forth a nonexclusive list of potential situations in which the probability of actual bias exists sufficient to require the judge\u2019s disqualification. The judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">(1) has a pecuniary interest in the outcome;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">(2) \u201chas been the target of personal abuse or criticism from the party before him\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">(3) is \u201cenmeshed in [other] matters involving petitioner . . .\u201d; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-10\">(4) might have prejudged the case because of prior participation as an accuser, investigator, fact finder or initial decisionmaker. <em>[Id. </em>at 351.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">I believe situations two and three warrant this judge\u2019s disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">I initially note that both of the applicable <em>Cramp-ton </em>situations presuppose the involvement of a \u201cparty\u201d or \u201cpetitioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the Governor was not a party to this action, Judge Giddings insisted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>he was a party. The judge persistently unified the interest of the department and the Governor without a rational basis and over repeated objections of the department\u2019s counsel. The judge continually rejected defense counsel's suggestion that there was no unity of interest between the Department of Corrections and the Governor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">For purposes of disqualification, the Court must focus on the judge\u2019s perception. Because the judge objectively demonstrated his erroneous belief that the Governor was a party and acted consistently with that belief, it obviously affected the department\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> My conclusion that the judge determined that the Governor was a party is not merely subjective, but clearly supported by uncontroverted statements on the record. The dissent does not conclude, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, that the Governor was a party to this litigation. He was <em>never </em>a litigant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>It was Judge Giddings who <em>repeatedly </em>stated on the record that the Governor <em>was </em>a party and acted consistently with that belief in his continual pursuit of the Governor. This in no way suggests that the Governor was ever a party in fact. Furthermore, the majority has incorrectly characterized the dissent\u2019s discussion as an attempt to \u201cmanipulate\u201d the status of the Governor in this lawsuit. The dissent has only illuminated how <em>Judge Giddings manipulated </em>the <em>Cain </em>litigation to obtain control over the Governor to the prejudice of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In fact, the department was prejudiced by the judge\u2019s determination that Governor Engler was a party because the department then became responsible to \u201crepresent\u201d a nonparty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At several of the hearings, the department\u2019s attorney was unable to determine what interests he represented, clearly prejudicing the department\u2019s ability to construct its defense. This was complicated by Judge Giddings\u2019 ruling on the morning of September 30, 1994. On that day, Judge Giddings released his opinion on the issue of disqualification, declaring abruptly and without explanation that the Governor was not a party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">At this point, Governor Engler is not a party to these proceedings. Nor is he personally affected by them. The . . . rale [of <em>Clemens v Bruce, </em>122 Mich App 35; 329 NW2d 522 (1982)] would require disqualification where the Court becomes enmeshed in other matters involving \u201cpeti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>tioner\u201d (the Department of Corrections), not <em>some third party such as the Governor.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">This unexplained switch at the eleventh hour does not, however, eviscerate Judge Giddings\u2019 previous statements, evidencing his belief that the department and the Governor were the same entity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, I believe that the fact that Judge Giddings perceived the Governor to be a party and conducted the trial accordingly biased the department\u2019s ability to defend sufficiently to permit analysis of the case pursuant to the situations enunciated in <em>Crampton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">1. JUDGE ENMESHED IN OTHER MATTERS</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Under situation three in <em>Crampton, </em>Judge Giddings was obligated to disqualify himself if he became \u201c \u2018enmeshed in [other] matters involving petitioner . . . <em>Crampton, supra </em>at 351, quoting <em>Johnson v Mississippi, </em>403 US 212, 215; 91 S Ct 1778; 29 L Ed 2d 423 (1971). In <em>Johnson, </em>the United States Supreme Court concluded that a trial judge should have recused himself because he lost a civil rights action brought by the same petitioner<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> facing contempt in a subsequent action. The Court concluded that \u201c[t]rial before \u2018an unbiased judge\u2019 is essential to due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, citing <em>Bloom v Illinois, </em>391 US 194, 205; 88 S Ct 1477; 20 L Ed 2d 522 (1968), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number><em>Mayberry v </em>Pennsylvania, 400 US 455, 465; 91 S Ct 499; 27 L Ed 2d 532 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">In isolation, Judge Giddings\u2019 conduct appears somewhat innocuous. However, each incident must not be considered in a vacuum; rather, they should be considered in relation to the judge\u2019s overzealous pursuit of the Governor. I agree with defense counsel that Judge Giddings\u2019 actions over an eleven-month period demonstrate that he became \u201cenmeshed\u201d in matters far beyond the scope of the <em>Cain </em>litigation and resulted in a violation of the department\u2019s due process right to an impartial decisionmaker. This conclusion is first supported by the fact that Judge Giddings recommended <em>substantive changes </em>to plaintiffs\u2019 motion to show cause why Mr. Truscott and Governor Engler should not be held in criminal contempt.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Initially, Judge Giddings recommended that plaintiffs separate their motion into individual counts. Next, he suggested that plaintiffs should not proceed against John Truscott, suggesting that the motion to show cause be brought only against Governor Engler. Finally, and most egregiously, he advised plaintiffs to \u201cconsider including reference to inaccuracies in Governor Engler\u2019s letter of August 12[, 1994,]\u201d to the Attorney General. In doing so, the judge unmistakably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>recommended another ground on which plaintiffs could proceed against the Governor.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Judge Giddings unified the interest of the Governor and the department for purposes of this litigation and proceeded to assist plaintiffs in drafting a motion to hold the Governor in contempt.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This illustrates how the judge clearly became \u201cenmeshed\u201d in matters involving the Governor. He, in fact, became so enmeshed that he assisted a party before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Several actions of Judge Giddings before his assistance of plaintiffs further demonstrate that he became \u201cenmeshed\u201d in other matters involving Governor Engler and the department. The judge first filed a letter of complaint against the Governor with the Attorney Grievance Commission on October 21, 1993. Next, in November 1993, Judge Giddings appointed a spokesperson for the male prisoners. His purported basis for the appointment was that \u201cwe have only gotten one side on most instances because of the practical problems.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, after indicating that the Governor had released an untrue statement to the press, he candidly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>This is a release . . . that went to every newspaper. The more recent one went, as far as I can determine, to every major newspaper in the State. <em>... I have to be able to respond to all of those. </em>I shouldn\u2019t have to respond to any of them. That\u2019s not my job. I\u2019m not a litigant. It\u2019s not my job. I would like to say to the newspaper person, hey, get your fanny down here. The court file is there. Read the Court file. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">This makes it clear that the spokesperson was not only appointed to be the voice of the prisoner litigants, but also to be the voice of Judge Giddings. This was an explicit and improper manipulation of the litigation to respond to the criticism of Governor Engler.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Additionally, Judge Giddings entered media contact orders on June 2 and 30, 1994. In his order dated June 2, 1994, the judge, sua sponte, ordered that any written remarks or press releases made by employees or agents of the state regarding the <em>Cain </em>litigation must be faxed to plaintiffs\u2019 spokesperson, to a member of plaintiffs\u2019 class, and to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel at the same time the remarks are made to the public. The order required the same of plaintiffs in regard to any press releases made by them. This was another attempt to obtain jurisdiction and control over the Governor (a person he perceived to be a party) and to address matters clearly outside the scope of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Each of these actions by Judge Giddings had one improper goal: to obtain control of the Governor in such a manner as to control the Governor\u2019s public opinion of the <em>Cain </em>litigation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s efforts unnecessarily consumed <em>considerable </em>time and judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>cial resources. Irrespective of whether the Governor\u2019s comments may be viewed as improper, the judge was sworn to proceed and remain focused on the merits of the case before him \u2014 which he had increasingly become unable to do. Instead, he expended judicial resources to assert jurisdiction over the Governor to the obvious prejudice of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Clemens, supra, </em>a subsequent decision applying <em>Crampton, </em>is persuasive. <em>Clemens </em>affirms that the present set of facts warrant disqualification of Judge Giddings. In <em>Clemens, </em>the Court of Appeals followed <em>Crampton </em>and held that the risk of actual prejudice on the part of the judge required disqualification without a showing of actual prejudice. The record in <em>Clemens </em>reflected a serious dispute between the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney and the trial judge regarding appointment of counsel for indigent criminal defendants. The plaintiffs\u2019 attorney filed a complaint against the judge with the Judicial Tenure Commission. The complaint remained pending at the time of trial. The court held that these facts warranted disqualification of the trial judge because, under <em>Crampton, </em>the judge had been the target of personal abuse or criticism from a party before him, and the judge had become enmeshed in other matters involving the petitioner. Similar to the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the facts of <em>Clemens </em>\u201csuggested such a risk of actual prejudice on the part of the judge that due process required his disqualification . . . <em>Id. </em>at 38.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">2. JUDGE TARGET OF CRITICISM</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><em>Crampton </em>states that the risk of an impartial decisionmaker is too great where the judge \u201c \u2018has been the target of personal abuse or criticism from the party before him,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 351, quoting <em>Withrow, supra </em>at 47. The Court relied on <em>Mayberry, supra </em>at 465, in which the United States Supreme Court held that a judge who is \u201cvilified . . . necessarily becomes embroiled in a running, bitter controversy,\u201d rendering the judge unlikely to \u201cmaintain that calm detachment necessary for fair adjudication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465. Quoting <em>Cooke v United States, </em>267 US 517, 539; 45 S Ct 390; 69 L Ed 767 (1925), the Court stated that \u201c \u2018[t]he judge must banish the slightest personal impulse to reprisal, but he should not bend backward and injure the authority of the court by too great leniency. The substitution of another judge would avoid either tendency . . . <em>Mayberry, supra </em>at 464. Additionally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>I hasten to add, however, that a \u201cjudge cannot be driven out of a case.\u201d <em>Mayberry, supra </em>at 463. Accordingly, I do not premise my conclusion that Judge Giddings should be disqualified on the basis of the criticism leveled by the Governor, but rather on the inappropriate means by which Judge Giddings retaliated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201cthe judge should not himself give vent to personal spleen or respond to a personal grievance. These are subtle matters, for they concern ingredients of what constitutes justice. Therefore, justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 465, quoting <em>Offutt v United States, </em>348 US 11, 14; 75 S Ct 11; 99 L Ed 11 (1954).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>The public comments Governor Engler made in regard to the <em>Cain </em>litigation and specifically in regard to Judge Giddings quite evidently struck at \u201c \u2018the most vulnerable and human qualities\u2019 \u201d of the judge\u2019s temperament. <em>Mayberry, supra </em>at 466, quoting <em>Bloom, supra </em>at 202. Such criticism does not <em>itself </em>violate a litigant\u2019s due process rights sufficient to disqualify the judge. However, Judge Giddings\u2019 repeated attempts to respond to the Governor\u2019s comments through plaintiffs did violate defendant\u2019s due process rights. While the comments made by the Governor arguably may have been inappropriate, Judge Giddings was sworn to impartially focus on the issues before the court and bring the litigation to a reasonably swift and completely fair resolution. The facts indicate that Judge Giddings was unable to surmount the public criticism and discharge his obligation by divorcing himself from the acrimonious political climate that had arisen. Accordingly, on these facts, I agree that \u201cit is generally wise where the marks of the unseemly conduct have left personal stings to ask a fellow judge to take his place.\u201d <em>Mayberry, supra </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Defendant also brought its motion for disqualification pursuant to two subsections of the court rule.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The subsection pursued on appeal, MCR 2.003(B)(2), provides that a judge is disqualified if \u201cpersonally biased or prejudiced for or against a party or attorney . . . .\u201d The Court of Appeals has repeatedly construed this phrase to require a showing of actual bias.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>This Court, therefore, must decide whether defendant has sufficiently shown that the judge was actually biased. I disagree with the majority because I believe that the lower court abused its discretion in concluding that Judge Giddings was not actually biased under the court rule. The judge assumed a role that exceeded the scope of his role of neutral and impartial decisionmaker. Assisting a party in drafting a motion prejudices the judge\u2019s impartiality and is an instance of personal bias under MCR 2.003(B)(2). Because the judge unified the interest of the Governor and the department, the department was analogously prejudiced by the judge\u2019s assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">A judge must not relinquish his role as an impartial decisionmaker by providing inordinate assistance to the parties before the court. In <em>Tretick v Layman, </em>95 Md App 62, 69; 619 A2d 201 (1993), the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland aptly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">The court, in our adversarial system, cannot substantially help either party; to lend aid would subvert a necessary part of our adversarial system designed to guarantee just trials, which require the impartiality of the referee \u2014 the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Therefore, the assistance to plaintiffs in their motion to show cause as more fully described in part n(A) by itself rises to the level of actual bias under MCR 2.003(B)(2) and warrants the judge\u2019s disqualification.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Chief judge Houk reached the opposite conclusion because he misunderstood the definition of actual bias. Close scrutiny of the hearing transcript and the opinion of the chief judge indicate that he erroneously concluded that actual bias may only be demonstrated by <em>a prejudicial ruling </em>of the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\"><em>The </em>Court: Let\u2019s focus back then on how this somewhat tenuous relationship has actually prejudiced your client, the Michigan Department of Corrections. <em>Demonstrate a ruling where it has done that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\"><em>Mr Govorchin: </em>Demonstrate a what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\"><em>The Court: A ruling. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Chief Judge Houk later insisted: \u201c[Y]ou can\u2019t point me to a <em>single ruling </em>in this case where <em>the Judge has ruled against your client. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Moreover, Chief Judge Houk\u2019s inaccurate determination that actual bias may only be demonstrated by proof of an unfavorable ruling is corroborated in his opinion denying the motion for disqualification: \u201cBoth before this Court and in front of Judge Giddings counsel for Defendants were unable to point to a <em>single ruling </em>or event that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>prejudiced the Defendant Michigan Department of Corrections.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In his opinion, Chief Judge Houk stated that \u201c[defendant has failed to discharge its \u2018heavy burden\u2019 and demonstrate \u2018actual prejudice\u2019 . . . .\u201d He arrived at this conclusion, however, by mistakenly stating that defendant\u2019s counsel acknowledged at the hearing that he was unable to show any actual bias against the department. This is a mischaracterization of defense counsel\u2019s statements. Defense counsel only conceded that there had not been a <em>biased ruling </em>by Judge Giddings.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Although a ruling is one means by which a judge may evidence actual bias, it is certainly not the only means by which a moving party may demonstrate that a judge is actually biased.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Certainly, a presiding judge\u2019s substantial assistance to a party before the court is sufficient evidence of actual bias. Accordingly, I would hold that Judge Giddings displayed actual bias under MCR 2.003.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Finally, the majority acknowledges, but does not address, the significance of the fact that Judge Giddings is the trier of fact in this proceeding. This case has primarily been a court of claims action, and, therefore, the judge rather than a jury will preside as finder of fact. The potential for subtle bias and prejudice is therefore heightened. It is much more difficult, if not impossible, to guard against biased findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">This Court in <em>People v Ramsey, </em>385 Mich 221; 187 NW2d 887 (1971), recognized, admittedly under different circumstances, that the Court must proceed cautiously when the trial judge is sitting as trier of fact. The Court held it was error requiring reversal for a judge acting as trier of fact to review and subsequently refer to a transcript not in evidence. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">This case demonstrates the need for an absolute rule in this situation. There is no way to determine whether or not the trial court was prejudiced by \u201cglancing\u201d at the transcript. In fact, it is difficult to determine precisely how much, if any, of the transcript was read by the court, or for what purpose. Therefore, in order to avoid problems of proof on this issue, we hold that as an absolute rule it is reversible error for the trial court sitting without a jury to refer to the transcript of testimony taken at the preliminary examination except under the exceptions provided by statute. <em>[Id. </em>at 225.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Ramsey illustrates the precautionary measures that are necessary to guard against judicial bias or prejudice in cases in which the judge sits as the trier of fact. The Supreme Court of Arkansas has noted this danger in the context of judicial disqualification. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>In <em>Burrows v Forrest City, </em>260 Ark 712, 720; 543 SW2d 488 (1976), the court stated: \u201c[T]he better procedure, where the trial judge sits as a fact finder, would be to resolve the difference in favor of the appearance of fairness and remand this case for hearing . . . before a different judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Judge Giddings should be disqualified because he became \u201c \u2018enmeshed in [other] matters involving petitioner\u2019 \u201d and became \u201c \u2018the target of personal abuse or criticism from the party before him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crampton, supra. </em>Judge Giddings\u2019 persistent pursuit of Governor Engler prejudiced the department by denying it the right to a fair and reasonably timely adjudication of its rights on the underlying claim. Therefore, in order to preserve defendant\u2019s due process right to \u201can unbiased and impartial decisionmaker,\u201d under <em>Crampton, </em>Judge Giddings should be disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Additionally, Judge Giddings has demonstrated a personal bias against the department pursuant to MCR 2.003(B)(2). A party moving to disqualify a trial judge pursuant to MCR 2.003(B)(2) is not required to prove actual bias by proof of a court ruling. The substantial assistance given to plaintiffs in this case by Judge Giddings sufficiently demonstrated that he was actually biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b666-8\">Weaver, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 351, quoting <em>Johnson v Mississippi, </em>403 US 212, 215; 91 S Ct 1778; 29 L Ed 2d 423 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 351, quoting <em>Withrow v Larkin, </em>421 US 35, 47; 95 S Ct 1456; 43 L Ed 2d 712 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-10\"> MCR 2.003(B)(2) was changed to MCR 2.003(B)(1), effective September 1, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\"> See <em>People v Bero, </em>168 Mich App 545, 549; 425 NW2d 138 (1988); <em>People v Upshaw, </em>172 Mich App 386, 389; 431 NW2d 520 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\"> The Court of Appeals has consistently reviewed such decisions of the lower court for abuse of discretion.

The majority fails to recognize it is the judge\u2019s <em>perception </em>that Governor Engler is a party that gives rise to the prejudice against the department and, hence, the applicability of the court rule and <em>Crampton.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\"> The concurrence misses the point in this regard. The fact that Judge Giddings conducted the trial as though the Governor were a party <em>by itself </em>prejudiced the department. The issue is, therefore, not a \u201cdistraction]\u201d for this Court, but instead is inextricably connected to the issue we must decide. The issue whether the Governor is a party did, however, severely distract and obfuscate the central issue of the underlying claim at the trial level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b654-9\"> The majority recognizes that the plaintiffs and plaintiffs-intervenors, similar to Judge Giddings, argued inconsistently on this issue. <em>Ante </em>at 510. Judge Giddings, plaintiffs, and plaintiffs-intervenors argue both ways. For purposes of obtaining control over Governor Engler, they assert that he was a party to the action. In contrast, for purposes of disqualification, they argue that the Governor is not a party. The majority fails to see, however, how this prejudiced the department in its formulation of a defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b654-10\"> The petitioner was a defendant in a criminal proceeding in the circuit court of Grenada County, Mississippi.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\"> The majority concludes that Judge Giddings\u2019 advice to plaintiffs was appropriate because plaintiffs appeared in propria persona. See <em>ante </em>at 517. It should be noted that the interest of plaintiffs in this litigation is identical to that of plaintiffs-intervenors <em>who did have counsel present. </em>The majority\u2019s analysis enables a litigant to proceed in propria persona and receive with impunity extensive assistance of a trial judge. It is certainly more advantageous to have the assistance of the trial judge than the assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\"> The majority is similarly concerned about the propriety of Judge Giddings \u201csuggestion.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 517-518. The majority is somehow able to justify Judge Giddings\u2019 assistance because defense counsel did not object either at the in-chambers discussion or at the following hearing. However, Judge Giddings\u2019 assistance is either proper or improper. The failure of defense counsel to object when he was under no obligation to do so certainly cannot diminish the severity of the judge\u2019s actions. It should be noted that, under the court rule, defense counsel was only obligated to raise a timely motion for the judge\u2019s disqualification within fourteen days of the improper act. <em>Orampton </em>has no such requirement. Defense counsel brought a timely motion and was under no additional obligation to object.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\"> Plaintiffs, in fact, followed the judge\u2019s advice and restructured their pleading into four separate counts, including count II, which incorporated Governor Engler\u2019s August 12, 1994, letter.
