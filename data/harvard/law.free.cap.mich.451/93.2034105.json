HISTORY OF <em>PEOPLE v BEWERSDORF</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In <em>Bewersdorf, </em>this Court, for the first time, interpreted the relationship between the habitual offender act and the Motor Vehicle Code. We held that the habitual offender act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is applicable to third and subsequent convictions for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (ouil),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and therefore, reversed the Court of Appeals. This Court concluded that the Motor Vehicle Code and the habitual offender act were not conflicting; rather, they \u201cdovetail[ed] harmoniously.\u201d 438 Mich 55, 59; 475 NW2d 231 (1991). Accordingly, on the basis of a literal interpretation of the plain language of the statutes, a defendant who is convicted of ouiL-3d is guilty of a felony. Thus, if a defendant is subsequently convicted of another 0UlL-3d offense, he can be charged as an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">However, this result was not always so clear. Before this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bewersdorf, </em>the Court of Appeals decided <em>People v Tucker, </em>177 Mich App 174; 441 NW2d 59 (1989), in which it held that a person who had two or more ouiL-3d convictions could not be charged as an habitual offender. A different panel of the Court of Appeals chose to follow the <em>Tucker </em>holding in <em>People v Bewersdorf, </em>181 Mich App 430; 450 NW2d 271 (1989). This Court overruled both decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>B. HISTORY OF <em>PEOPLE v DOYLE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">During the pendency of the <em>Bewersdorf </em>appeal to this Court (between January 8 and August 22, 1991), the present defendant chose once again to drive while drunk. Defendant\u2019s conduct took place on June 26, 1991, in Oakland County, two months before the release of the <em>Bewersdorf </em>opinion. Defendant was charged with operating a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, third or subsequent offense (0UlL-3d), MCL 257.625(6); MSA 9.2325(6),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> driving a vehicle while his license was suspended or revoked, second or subsequent offense (DWLS-2d), MCL 257.904(3); MSA 9.2604(3), and being an habitual offender, second offense, MCL 769.10; MSA 28.1082.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Approximately two months after the release of <em>Bewersdorf, </em>on October 8, 1991, before pleading guilty to the OUlL-3d and DWLS-2d charges, Mr. Doyle moved to dismiss the habitual offender information. The court granted Mr. Doyle\u2019s motion, concluding that application of <em>Bewersdorf </em>to conduct occurring before the release of the opinion would violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>gan Constitutions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, Mr. Doyle pleaded guilty of ouiL-3d and DWLS-2d. On November 19, 1991, he was sentenced to two to five years for the 0UlL-3d conviction, a $500 fine was imposed, his license was revoked for five years, and he was given credit for forty-six days in jail. Additionally, he was sentenced to one year for the DWLS-2d conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">At the plea proceedings, the prosecution placed the defendant on notice that it intended to appeal the dismissal of the habitual offender charge. Subsequently, the ruling was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 203 Mich App 294, 296; 512 NW2d 59 (1994). The Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe due process provisions of the United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution bar the retroactive application of judicial decisions that have the effect of enhancing the possible penalty for a criminal conviction.\u201d The Court found that application of <em>Bewersdorf </em>to Mr. Doyle\u2019s conduct would effectively increase the authorized penalty for a crime after the fact, in violation of ex post facto principles. Further, the Court found that retroactive application of <em>Bewersdorf </em>in that case did not obligate it to apply <em>Bewersdorf </em>retroactively in this case. Finally, in response to the prosecution\u2019s argument that due process considerations are not implicated because there has been no change in the law, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Court stated, \u201cit is unrealistic to say that <em>Bewersdorf </em>did not change the law.\u201d 203 Mich App 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The dissent was based on the fact that when Mr. Doyle was arrested and charged on June 26, 1991, Administrative Order No. 1990-6<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was not in effect. Thus, at the time the defendant was arrested, \u201che could expect that should his case reach the Court of Appeals, the panel that would consider his case might disagree with the <em>Tucker/Bewersdorf </em>ruling, and he would be bound by any contrary ruling . . . .\u201d 203 Mich App 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Mr. Doyle has argued that this Court created \u201cnew law\u201d in <em>Bewersdorf </em>which, if applied retroactively to his conduct, will violate the constitution, specifically the ex post facto prohibitions found in both the Michigan and United States Constitutions. The Court of Appeals agreed with Mr. Doyle and affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the habitual offender information. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">It is well recognized that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply directly to the judiciary. <em>Marks v United States, </em>430 US 188; 97 S Ct 990; 51 L Ed 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>260 (1977). However, ex post facto principles are applicable to the judiciary by analogy through the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Bouie v City of Columbia, </em>378 US 347; 84 S Ct 1697; 12 L Ed 2d 894 (1964). This Court has acknowledged the application of the ex post facto analogy to the judiciary first in <em>People v Dempster, </em>396 Mich 700, 714-718; 242 NW2d 381 (1976), and later in <em>People v Stevenson, </em>416 Mich 383, 395; 331 NW2d 143 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Therefore, retroactive application of a judicial decision will only violate due process when it acts as an ex post facto law. An ex post facto law has been defined by the United States Supreme Court as one \u201c \u2018that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was <em>innocent </em>when done, criminal; and punishes such action,\u2019 or \u2018that <em>aggravates a crime, </em>or makes it <em>greater </em>than it was, when committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bouie, supra </em>at 353 (emphasis in original). As a result of the due process analogy, it has been stated that \u201can unforeseeable <em>judicial enlargement </em>of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, operates precisely like an <em>ex post facto law </em>. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353 (emphasis added). \u201cThe retroactive application of an <em>unforeseeable </em>interpretation of a criminal statute, if detrimental to a defendant, generally violates the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Hagan v Caspari, </em>50 F3d 542, 545 (CA 8, 1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Further, this Court has recognized that a judicial decision that increases the authorized penalty for a crime is also a violation of the ex post facto prohibition. <em>Stevenson, supra </em>at 397. In <em>Stevenson, </em>this Court stated that \u201c[providing fair notice that conduct is criminal is one of the central values of the <em>Ex Post </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Facto </em>Clause . . . [b]ut fair notice is not the sole purpose of the clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396. Generally, the basic principles protected by the Due Process Clause guarantees preclude retroactive application of a \u201cjudicial construction of a criminal statute [that] is \u2018unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Bouie, supra </em>at 354, quoting Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law (2d ed), p 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">In the present case, the Court of Appeals holding is based, in part, on <em>Stevenson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">[T]he due process provisions of the United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution bar the retroactive application of judicial decisions that have the effect of enhancing the possible penalty for a criminal conviction. . . . Among other things, a court cannot by judicial construction increase the authorized penalty for a crime after the fact. . . . Because that is precisely what the application of <em>Bewersdorf </em>to this case would do, that case cannot be applied to this one. <em>[Doyle, supra </em>at 296.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We reject this holding by the Court of Appeals. Contrary to the Court of Appeals decision, this Court finds that retroactive application of <em>Bewersdorf </em>to Mr. Doyle does not implicate any due process<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or ex post facto concerns. Our decision is based on our belief that <em>Bewersdorf </em>was not an unforeseeable decision that had the effect of \u201cchanging\u201d the law. Therefore, <em>Bewersdorf </em>did not establish a \u201cnew\u201d rule of law in Michigan jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In <em>Bewersdorf </em>this Court discussed at length and clarified the relationship between ouil felony offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>and the habitual offender act. The Court held that an OUlL-3d conviction, which is a felony pursuant to MCL 257.902; MSA 9.2602 of the Motor Vehicle Code, can support charging the defendant as an habitual offender when it is a second or subsequent ouiL-3d conviction. The habitual offender statute affects only the maximum term of the defendant\u2019s sentence by allowing the judge, in his discretion, to increase the maximum sentence by one and one-half times. Thus, the Court noted that the Legislature has provided the courts with discretion whether to impose such enhanced punishment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further, the Court repeated that in enacting the habitual offender act, \u201c \u2018the legislature did not intend to make a separate substantive crime out of being an habitual criminal but rather, for deterrent purposes, intended to augment the punishment for second or subsequent felonies.\u2019 \u201d 438 Mich 67, quoting <em>People v Shotwell, </em>352 Mich 42, 46; 88 NW2d 313 (1958). This Court noted that the constitutionality of the habitual offender act has been consistently upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Guided by the rules of statutory construction, the Court next focused on the legislative intent underlying the habitual offender statute and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">In the habitual offender act, the Legislature has directed that when an individual commits a <em>\u201csubsequent felony </em>within this state, the person <em>shall </em>be punished\u201d in accordance with the act\u2019s provisions. The language is <em>clear </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>unambiguous; </em>it makes <em>no exceptions </em>with respect to ouil felony convictions. <em>People v Shotwell, supra </em>at 46 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">In the Court of Appeals, the <em>Bewersdorf </em>majority, relying on <em>People v Tucker, supra, </em>ruled that the habitual offender act may not be used to enhance defendant\u2019s sentence for ouil-3. Although the panel in <em>Tucker </em>conceded that an application of the plain meaning of the habitual offender act would mean that \u201cenhancement is clearly available . . . since the habitual offender statute clearly applies to all felonies,\u201d 177 Mich App 179, it nevertheless chose to analyze the ouil statute and habitual offender act so as to place them in conflict. [438 Mich 68-69.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Accordingly, this Court held that <em>Tucker </em>was wrongly decided and that the two acts are not conflicting.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">We reject the <em>Tucker </em>panel\u2019s <em>forced </em>construction that placed the two statutes in conflict. We prefer a course which, in the words of the dissenting <em>Bewersdorf </em>Court of Appeals judge, enables the two acts to \u201cdovetail harmoniously.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">[T]he Legislature intended that the sentence for an ouil-3 felony, if it is a first felony conviction, shall be as provided in the Motor Vehicle Code: imprisonment for not less than one or more than five years .... However, any subsequent ouil felony conviction is subject to the repeat offender provisions of the habitual offender act regardless of whether the underlying felony conviction is also an ouil-3 offense. [438 Mich 69-70.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Therefore, <em>Bewersdorf </em>was based on a clear reading of unambiguous statutory provisions, both of which were in effect long before defendant\u2019s June 26, 1991, drunk driving offense. In <em>Bewersdorf, </em>this Court addressed a question of statutory interpretation that had never been previously decided at this level. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>determined that the proper answer lay in the clear language of the statute, as enacted by the Legislature. In light of that language, it cannot be maintained that our <em>Bewersdorf </em>decision was \u201cunforeseeable.\u201d We did not change the law. We gave effect to an unambiguous statute, implementing the intent of the Legislature. Thus, the law was as we interpreted it to be, because of the nature of the unambiguous statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u201c[T]he general rule is that judicial decisions are to be given complete retroactive effect. . . . [C]omplete prospective application has generally been limited to decisions which overrule clear and uncontradicted case law.\u201d <em>Hyde v Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents, </em>426 Mich 223, 240; 393 NW2d 847 (1986). If a judicial decision is \u201cunexpected\u201d and \u201cindefensible\u201d in light of the law existing at the time of the conduct, retroactive application of such a decision is problematic. <em>Tebo v Havlik, </em>418 Mich 350; 343 NW2d 181 (1984), illustrates such a situation. In remaining consistent with our decision in <em>Tebo, </em>we find that there are special circumstances that, if present here, would require that <em>Bewersdorf </em>be given only prospective application. However, we find that <em>Tebo </em>may be distinguished from the case presented by Mr. Doyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">In <em>Tebo, </em>this Court was presented with the question whether its decision in <em>Putney v Haskins, </em>414 Mich 181; 324 NW2d 729 (1982), interpreting the \u201cname and retain\u201d provision of the dramshop act, was to be given retroactive effect. The statutory<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cname and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>retain\u201d provision states that a dramshop action can be maintained only if \u201cthe alleged intoxicated person is a named defendant in the action and is retained in the action until the litigation is concluded by trial or settlement.\u201d The purpose of the provision is to avoid collusive litigation in which, following a settlement, the plaintiff and the allegedly intoxicated defendant are both aligned against the tavern (the \u201cdramshop\u201d defendant). <em>Putney, supra </em>at 186-188.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Similar to the procedural development of the present case, an earlier decision by the Court of Appeals spoke directly to the \u201cname and retain\u201d issue. In <em>Buxton v Alexander, </em>69 Mich App 507; 245 NW2d 111 (1976), the Court held that a dramshop action could go forward following an agreement under which the allegedly intoxicated driver remained a named defendant, but the plaintiff would indemnify the driver and her insurer. This Court denied leave to appeal. 399 Mich 827 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Five years later, this Court granted leave in <em>Putney </em>and rejected the approach taken in <em>Buxton, </em>holding instead that the \u201cname and retain\u201d provision is violated by any settlement between the plaintiff and the allegedly intoxicated defendant. This Court concluded in <em>Putney </em>at 190, \u201cWe are obligated to enforce the statute as written.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">If broadly applied, the rule of <em>Putney </em>would have required dismissal of many dramshop suits in which attorneys had followed the course that appeared proper in light of <em>Buxton. </em>Careful professional judgments had been made in reliance on the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Buxton. </em>Therefore, in <em>Tebo </em>this Court granted leave to appeal the issue of the retroactivity of <em>Putney, </em>and ordered that no dismissals take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>place until the question was decided. 417 Mich 887 (1983); Administrative Order No. 1983-1, 417 Mich cxviii.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In its several <em>Tebo </em>opinions, this Court explained why the special circumstances described above required prospective application of the rule of <em>Put</em>ney, notwithstanding the fact that the ruling was grounded in the plain language of the statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This Court said, \u201c[although it has often been stated that the general rule is one of complete retroactivity, this Court has adopted <em>ajflexible </em>approach.\u201d 418 Mich 360 (emphasis added). Further, the Court stated, \u201cwhere statutory construction has been involved, this Court has limited the retroactivity of a decision where justice so required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361. This Court found that justice required limiting the retroactivity of its <em>Putney </em>decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">In light of the unquestioned status of <em>Buxton </em>at the time <em>Putney </em>was decided by this Court, it would be unjust to apply <em>Putney </em>retroactively to persons other than those before the Court in that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">In contrast to the harsh effect which the full retroactivity of <em>Putney </em>would have on injured plaintiffs, prospective application will have little effect on dramshop defendants in those pending cases where settlement agreements have been made, even though the defense of <em>Putney </em>will be unavailable. [418 Mich 363-364.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Accordingly, this Court found these circumstances problematic for retroactivity purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Obviously, the procedural development of the \u201cname and retain\u201d issue is similar to the development in the present case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, there is a substantial difference between <em>Tebo </em>and this case. In <em>Tebo, </em>lawyers and parties had made significant decisions in direct reliance on <em>Buxton </em>for a period of five years. This Court notes the significance of the institutional pressures encouraging settlement. Given this pressure, the Court stated that reliance on <em>Buxton </em>could \u201chardly be deemed unreasonable.\u201d See 418 Mich 363, n 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Defendant argues that pursuant to MCR 7.215(C)(2), this Court \u201cspecifically\u201d put him on notice that <em>Tucker </em>was the law on which he could rely. We believe that it cannot be seriously maintained that drunk drivers, such as Mr. Doyle, were relying on the rule of <em>Tucker </em>in conducting their behavior. No person would decide to drive drunk for a third time because, pursuant to <em>Tucker, </em>such conduct would be a felony that could result in a five-year prison sentence,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but not a prison sentence of seven and a half years.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We therefore find defendant\u2019s reliance argument to be absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>We axe also unpersuaded that our <em>Bewersdorf </em>decision was unforeseeable. Obviously, the Court of Appeals <em>Tucker </em>interpretation was clearly erroneous in light of the plain language of the statute. As noted by the dissent, <em>Tucker </em>was not even binding on the Court of Appeals at the time <em>Bewersdorf </em>reached that level. See Administrative Order No. 1990-6.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If Mr. Doyle chose to apprise himself of the state of the \u201claw\u201d of which he was probably familiar, this having been his sixth OUIL conviction, he would have found that <em>Tucker </em>was resting on shaky ground, given that oral argument had already been heard in <em>Bewersdorf </em>at the time of his offense. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that our decision in <em>Bewersdorf was </em>\u201cunexpected,\u201d \u201cunforeseeable\u201d or \u201cindefensible\u201d in light of all pertinent considerations. Furthermore, we do not disturb the viability of our holding in <em>Tebo v Havlik, </em>because we find that case to be completely distinguishable from the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In this case, the Court of Appeals was unpersuaded by the prosecution\u2019s position, which this Court now adopts, that <em>Bewersdorf </em>did not \u201cchange\u201d the law. The Court states, \u201c[b]ecause \u2018[a] new decision that explicitly overrules an earlier holding obviously \u201cbreaks new ground\u201d or \u201cimposes a new obligation,\u201d \u2019 it is unrealistic to say that <em>Bewersdorf </em>did not change the law.\u201d 203 Mich App 297, quoting <em>Butler v McKellar, </em>494 US 407, 412; 110 S Ct 1212; 108 L Ed 2d 347 (1990). Additionally, the Court stated that its <em>Tucker </em>decision was \u201cthe law\u201d on the date of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>offense and that retroactive application of <em>Bewersdorf </em>\u201cwould [therefore] undermine the rule of law in this state.\u201d 203 Mich App 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">This approach taken by the Court of Appeals overlooks the hierarchical nature of the court system, as well as the special rule of the Legislature when it provides a clear statutory enactment. In the view of the Court of Appeals majority, the \u201crule of law\u201d in this state is more offended by the retroactive application of a controlling decision by this Court, than it is by a continued application of an erroneous and overruled decision by the Court of Appeals. As stated in part II, we find that <em>Bewersdorf </em>was not an unforeseeable decision that had the effect of changing the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The Court of Appeals reliance on <em>Butler </em>for the proposition that it is \u201cunrealistic\u201d to say that <em>Bewersdorf </em>did not change the law was misplaced. In <em>Butler, </em>the United States Supreme Court was faced with the question whether its decision in <em>Arizona v Roberson, </em>486 US 675; 108 S Ct 2093; 100 L Ed 2d 704 (1988), announced a \u201cnew rule\u201d of law that was not dictated by the precedent established by another United States Supreme Court decision, <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US 477; 101 S Ct 1880; 68 L Ed 2d 378 (1981).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ingly, <em>Butler </em>addresses the situation in which the highest Court in this country renders its decision in such a way that it changes, modifies or overrules another of <em>its own </em>cases that is established precedent at the time of the new ruling. <em>Butler </em>involves a change <em>in. judge-made </em>law. This is not what happened in <em>Bewersdorf.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Moreover, the Court of Appeals mistakenly relied on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Stevenson. </em>That case abrogated the common-law \u201cyear and a day\u201d rule in homicide cases. This Court held that the abrogation could not be applied to Mr. Stevenson because to do so would violate due process. However, like <em>Butler, Stevenson </em>is also distinguishable on the basis that it altered a longstanding judge-made common-law rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Certainly there is a distinction between a decision made by this Court that overrules precedent established by this Court and a decision made by this Court that overrules a lower court decision. For purposes of determining whether retroactivity is proper, the latter situation does not invoke the same kinds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>due process considerations that are central to a determination in the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We do recognize that a published decision of the Court of Appeals is controlling precedent for trial courts. MCR 7.215(C)(2).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Defendant argues that <em>Bouie </em>requires that the criminal law applied to him have existed when the conduct in issue occurred. He argues that because <em>Tucker </em>was precedent for the trial courts, it was the \u201claw\u201d at the time he committed the prohibited conduct. However, it is without question that at the time of defendant\u2019s offense the statutory language of the habitual offender act was unambiguous and clear. Therefore, the habitual offender act, by its plain language, applied to defendant\u2019s second 0UKr3d conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\u201cA judicial inquiry investigates, declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist. That is its purpose and end. Legislation, on the other hand, looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power.\" <em>[Ross v Oregon, </em>227 US 150, 163; 33 S Ct 220; 57 L Ed 458 (1913).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">In <em>Bewersdorf, </em>this Court fulfilled its judicial role and gave effect to valid laws that existed before June 26, 1991. Unfortunately, Tucker\u2019s previous erroneous interpretation of the statute served to thwart the legislative intent and the mandated result.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>v</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Lastly, we find no merit in defendant\u2019s argument that retroactive application of <em>Bewersdorf </em>will perpetuate the same \u201cevil\u201d that existed in <em>People v Moon, </em>125 Mich App 773; 337 NW2d 293 (1983). <em>Moon </em>involved a situation in which the defendant received, as a condition of probation, a jail term twice as long as had been permissible under the statutory language in effect on the date of the offense. The Court of Appeals found that this increase in punishment was a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. However, <em>Moon </em>involved a postconduct <em>legislative </em>amendment, not a judicial interpretation of an unambiguous statute. Thus, it is not applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We find that <em>People v Dempster, supra, </em>is also inapposite to the present case. <em>Dempster </em>was a securities case in which this Court concluded that it would violate due process if Ms. Dempster and her corporate codefendant were convicted under a criminal statute that applied to them only as the result of the judicial gloss supplied in this Court\u2019s <em>Dempster </em>opinion. This Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">This Court is not able, within the bounds of due process, to \u201cinterpret\u201d a criminal statute which contains an <em>ambiguous </em>exemption such that it results in conviction of the defendant charged in the specific case. That is not the \u201cfair warning\u201d demanded by the Constitution. [396 Mich 715 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Thus, <em>Dempster </em>involved this Court\u2019s interpretation of an ambiguous substantive criminal statute, not the interpretation of a precise unambiguous sentence-enhancement statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Accordingly, we hold that, as in this case, where a precisely drafted statute, unambiguous on its face, is interpreted by this Court for the first time, there has not been a \u201cchange\u201d in the law. Where the Legislature has passed an unambiguous statute, that statute is the law. Our role is to enforce the law as written. Our holding today is grounded in the belief that it is perfectly clear that anyone reading the habitual offender act and the Motor Vehicle Code easily could have concluded that the <em>Tucker </em>decision was contrary to their plain meanings. See <em>Hagan v Caspari, supra </em>at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
