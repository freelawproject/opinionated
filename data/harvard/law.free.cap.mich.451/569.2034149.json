Young was paroled on September 15, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">While on parole, Young committed a breaking and entering, and was arrested.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This crime occurred less than a week before the scheduled conclusion of the two-year period of parole. Although aware of this arrest, the Department of Corrections discharged Young from parole on September 15, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Young was convicted of the breaking and entering on May 26, 1992. The Recorder\u2019s Court judge sentenced Young on June 10, 1992, to three and a half to ten years, and, at the time, questioned why the department had discharged Young from parole, thereby preventing consecutive sentencing. Asserting ancillary jurisdiction respecting the parole, the judge, at the prosecutor\u2019s request, issued a show cause order directing the department to explain why it had dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>charged Young from the armed robbery sentence although he had been arrested for a felony before the two-year parole had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">At the hearing on the show cause order held August 7, 1992, the department stated that Young had been \u201cmistakenly discharged,\u201d prompting the judge to vacate the Parole Board order discharging Young from parole, and then to resentence him to the same three and a half to ten years, adding that the sentence was to be served consecutively to Young\u2019s earlier armed robbery sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Concurrently, the prosecutor and the department were litigating how much time Young would be required to serve for the earlier armed robbery conviction before he would begin serving the sentence for breaking and entering. Three statutes are involved:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">\u2022 \u00a7 34(2) of the corrections act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides that the Parole Board has jurisdiction to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>granting parole after a prisoner sentenced to consecutive terms has served the total of the <em>minimum </em>terms;</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">\u2022 \u00a7 38(5) of the corrections act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> states that parolees who commit new crimes while on parole are subject to the added m\u00ednimums rule set forth in \u00a7 34(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">[If the foregoing statutory provisions were the only provisions applicable, Young clearly could be paroled after serving three and a half years on the breaking and entering conviction. He had already served more than the six-year minimum imposed for the armed robbery conviction before he was returned to prison.]</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">\u2022 The prosecutor contends that the \u201cremaining portion\u201d clause of \u00a7 7a(2),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> added by 1988 PA 48, requires parolees who commit crimes while on parole to first serve the <em>maximum </em>of the earlier sentence before beginning to serve the new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The prosecutor asked the department, pursuant to \u00a7 63 of the Administrative Procedures Act,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for a ruling determining when Young\u2019s new sentence would begin to rim. When the department did not timely respond, the prosecutor filed a declaratory judgment action in Wayne Circuit Court. The circuit judge agreed with the prosecutor and granted the prosecutor summary disposition on January 6, 1993.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The Court of Appeals consolidated the civil and criminal appeals, and affirmed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The majority held that \u00a7 7a(2) impliedly repealed \u00a7\u00a7 34(2) and 38(5), and that the \u201cremaining portion\u201d language requires that a parolee convicted of another felony committed while on parole serve the maximum of the earlier sentence before beginning to serve the new sentence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The majority also held that the ruling would apply prospectively from the date of the circuit judge\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the prosecutor had standing to commence this action on behalf of the people of the State of Michigan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The prosecutor had a specific dispute with the department concerning the computation of Young\u2019s sentence, and asked a circuit court, pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, to resolve that dispute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Because the prosecutor has standing under \u00a7 53, Young\u2019s argument that other legislation<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> precludes a civil action unless approved by the Wayne County Board of Commissioners need not be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Our analysis of the statutory provisions involved, and of the Court of Appeals decision, begins with the axiom that repeals by implication are disfavored. This Court presumes, in most circumstances, that if the Legislature had intended to repeal a statute or statutory provision, it would have done so explicitly. See, e.g., <em>House Speaker v State Administrative Bd, </em>441 Mich 547, 562; 495 NW2d 539 (1993): \u201c \u2018Repeals by implication are not favored and will not be indulged in if there is any other reasonable construction. The intent to repeal must very clearly appear, and courts will not hold to a repeal if they can find reasonable ground to hold the contrary.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>While this Court may find a repeal by implication when the conflict between two statutes is clear, or when a subsequent law was clearly intended to occupy the entire field covered by a prior enactment, \u201cthe burden on the party claiming an implied repeal is a heavy one[.]\u201d <em>House Speaker </em>at 563.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The prosecutor has not met that \u201cheavy\u201d burden. The prosecutor\u2019s construction of \u00a7 7a(2) is not the only construction possible. When this Court can construe statutes, claimed to be in conflict, harmoniously, it must do so rather than find repeal by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The guiding principle is, to be sure, that we are obliged to determine the will of the Legislature; but where the intent of the Legislature is claimed to be unclear, it is our duty to proceed on the assumption that the Legislature desired both statutes to continue in effect unless it manifestly appears that such a view is not reasonably plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">We turn to a consideration of the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting \u00a7 7a(2), and whether that intent is compatible with the continued viability of \u00a7\u00a7 34(2) and 38(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">It is clear that the Legislature enacted \u00a7 7a(2) in response to <em>People v Walker, </em>143 Mich App 479; 372 NW2d 596 (1985). There the Court of Appeals held that a parolee was not subject to consecutive sentencing for a crime committed while on parole under \u00a7 7a as it read before the 1988 amendment adding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>subsection (2),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> because he was not \u201cincarcerated\u201d at the time of the second offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The Legislature responded with the enactment of \u00a7 7a(2) to require parolees to be treated the same as prisoners who commit crimes while incarcerated or at large on escape.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> While the legislative analysis did not specifically reference the <em>Walker </em>decision, that analysis shows that in enacting \u00a7 7a(2) the Legislature sought to eliminate the definitional problem found in <em>Walker, </em>and to thereby provide for the imposition of a consecutive sentence for a crime committed by a parolee who commits another offense \u2014 the same sentencing faced by \u201ca prisoner, whether incarcerated or escaped,\u201d who commits another crime before the department has released him from prison.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>a</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The prosecutor contends that \u00a7 7a(2) must mean that parolees are required to serve the maximum of the earlier sentence because otherwise \u00a7 7a(2) would have \u201cno effect.\u201d The predicate of this contention is that ordinarily a parolee has served at least the minimum of an earlier sentence before being released on parole, with the result that ordinarily the new sentence will be consecutive to nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">This contention ignores the Legislature\u2019s intent, as evidenced by the fact that the language of \u00a7 7a(2) closely copied the language of \u00a7 7a(l), to analogize a parolee who commits an offense while on parole to an inmate or escaped prisoner who commits another offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The department has consistently construed the language of \u00a7 7a(l) since its enactment by 1954 PA 100. For over forty years, the department has computed the eligibility for parole of an inmate who commits a crime in prison or an escapee who commits a crime while escaped by adding the consecutive minimum terms of all the offenses for which he is incarcerated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>in state prison.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, consecutive sentences imposed on persons who, while incarcerated or on escape, commit another crime will commence to ran when the total of the <em>minimum </em>sentences imposed for prior offenses has been served. Accordingly, if an inmate or escapee, who has served beyond his minimum term, commits an offense while incarcerated or while on escape, the \u201cconsecutive\u201d sentence would commence to run immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The department has been consistent in the construction of \u00a7 7a(l) since its enactment by 1954 PA 100. This statutory construction of the department has gone unchallenged until this litigation, entitling it to considerable deference by this Court. This Court will ordinarily assume that the Legislature was aware of past practice in the administration of a nearly identical provision of law. Absent other evidence, we conclude that the Legislature expected a similar approach in the administration of \u00a7 7a(2) as had been taken by the department regarding \u00a7 7a(l).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">There is nothing in the language of the statute or in the record that demonstrates a legislative intent to change the consistent construction of \u00a7 7a(l), nor is there any evidence that the Legislature sought to have parolees, or expected that parolees would be, treated differently in this regard from prisoners and escapees who commit new crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The department has consistently and without challenge construed \u00a7 7a(l) for too long to justify reading the same language in \u00a7 7a(2) as a legislative decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>to alter the method of sentence calculation as advocated by the prosecutor. The Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting \u00a7 7a(2) was simply to extend the statutory provisions of \u00a7 7a(l) to parolees, effectively reversing the result in <em>People v Walker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Adoption of the prosecutor\u2019s construction of \u00a7 7a(2) would mean that sentences for crimes committed while on parole would be consecutive to the maximum of the earlier sentence, although sentences for crimes committed while incarcerated or on escape are consecutive to the minimum of the earlier sentence. This would not be consistent with the legislative intent to analogize a parolee who commits an offense while on parole to an inmate or escaped prisoner who commits another offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">While ordinarily a parolee will have served the minimum of his earlier sentence before being released on parole,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> this will not always be the case. Section 233 of the Department of Corrections act permits \u201cspecial parole\u201d of a prisoner \u201cwhenever the sentencing judge . . . gives written approval of the parole of the prisoner before the expiration of the minimum term of imprisonment.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">A special parolee who commits another offense while on parole thus will ordinarily have some time left to serve on the minimum of his earlier sentence before beginning service of the minimum of the new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Because of the extenuating circumstances necessary to authorize a special parole, and the limited number of inmates who are eligible for consideration,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> we are persuaded that the Legislature did not enact \u00a7 7a(2) because of, or intend to limit the applicability of \u00a7 7a(2) to, special parolees.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The parties have adverted to the statutory provisions concerning good-time credit that a parolee might have accumulated in prison.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The department argues that the authority thereby conferred to revoke good-time credit following a parole violation provides sufficient \u201ceffect\u201d to \u00a7 7a(2)\u2019s mandate requiring that the parolee serve the remaining portion of his earlier sentence. We decline to rest our decision on that basis, however. Our review of \u00a7 7a(2) and our conclusion regarding the legislative intent obviates any need to rely on these statutory provisions to provide substance to \u00a7 7a(2).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Further support for our conclusion that the Legislature did not intend \u00a7 7a(2) to repeal all discretion held by the Parole Board is that the Legislature, when it enacted \u00a7 7a(2), did not provide the massive funding increases for housing and feeding inmates, required to serve the maximum of the earlier sentence before the minimum of the later sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>begins to run, that would be necessary if the prosecutor\u2019s interpretation were accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The facts in <em>Walker </em>point toward a proper resolution of this controversy. The earlier sentence to which Walker\u2019s new sentence was to be consecutive was the time Walker was serving by order of the Parole Board for a parole violation.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The trial judge had sought to sentence Walker to a term of imprisonment consecutive to that portion (between the minimum and maximum) of the earlier sentence Walker was serving as a result of the decision of the Parole Board to revoke parole for a parole violation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Walker </em>held that, because a parolee was not \u201cincarcerated,\u201d the sentence the judge sought to impose could not be imposed. It thus appears that had \u00a7 7a(2) been in effect when <em>Walker </em>was decided, a sentence consecutive to the portion of the earlier sentence Walker was serving because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the parole violation would, or should, have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We conclude that the \u201cremaining portion\u201d clause of \u00a7 7a(2) requires the offender to serve at least the combined m\u00ednimums of his sentences, plus whatever portion, between the minimum and the maximum, of the earlier sentence that the Parole Board may, because the parolee violated the terms of parole, require him to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">We turn to the question whether the Recorder\u2019s Court judge erred in reinstating Young\u2019s parole following the show cause hearing at which the department was provided an opportunity to explain why it had discharged Young from parole although he had been arrested for a felony shortly before the conclusion of the two-year parole period respecting the armed robbery sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Young contends that the judge was without power to reinstate his parole because a parole discharge, once accepted by the parolee, is not subject to judicial review.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Young relies on <em>In re Eddinger, </em>236 Mich 668, 670; 211 NW 54 (1926), in which this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">The absolute discharge is something more than a release from parole. It is a remission of the remaining portion of his sentence. Like a pardon, it is a gift from the executive, and like any other gift it does not become effective until it is delivered and accepted. After delivery it cannot be recalled. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>So in the instant case if there was a delivery and acceptance of the discharge, it was beyond the power of the governor to revoke it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Young argues that if, as this Court declared, the Governor does not have the power to revoke a parole after it has been accepted by the parolee, neither are the courts empowered to do so.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the power to parole is vested in the department, but said that this power is subject to judicial review, and, because Young had not successfully completed his parole, the department\u2019s action in discharging Young from parole was violative of the powers conferred by statute on the Parole Board, as the department had \u201cadmitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In the Court of Appeals and in this Court, the prosecutor and the Attorney General ignored Young\u2019s claim, based on <em>Eddinger, </em>that the judge was without power to reinstate his parole following Young\u2019s receipt of the Parole Board order discharging him from parole.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Generally, when a party fails to brief an issue duly raised by the other party, this Court will endeavor to decide the issue correctly without requesting further briefing. This is not, however, ordinary litigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>where the resolution is of little concern to persons other than the litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The opinion of the Court of Appeals does not discuss this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Eddinger. </em>Further, the Court of Appeals did not address Young\u2019s argument that the judge in a pending criminal case is not empowered to exercise ancillary jurisdiction respecting a sentence, and subsequent parole, imposed by another court.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> There are statutory provisions that should be analyzed in any consideration of the authority of a prosecutor to challenge, or of a court to review, a discharge from parole.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The department\u2019s concession that it erred in issuing an order of discharge to Young is not binding on Young, and does not preclude him from contending that it is beyond the power of the Parole Board to reopen a decision to discharge a parolee from parole after the parolee has received the order of discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The question whether there is a power of judicial review, and, if so, how it should be exercised or circumscribed, is too important to be decided without adequate briefing and an opportunity for all who might be interested to file briefs as amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">There are a number of cases pending in this Court and in the Court of Appeals in abeyance awaiting decision concerning this Court\u2019s construction of the \u201cremaining portion\u201d clause of \u00a7 7a(2). We, therefore, have concluded that we should not delay announce-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>merit of our unanimous decision on that issue until the question on which we think further briefing is required can be further briefed, heard, and decided in this Court. Further, we ordinarily prefer to have the views of the Court of Appeals before addressing and deciding a question.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Accordingly, this case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further briefing, oral argument, and consideration of the issues that the Court of Appeals has not yet addressed, namely, the appropriateness of the trial court\u2019s exercise of ancillary jurisdiction, whether the Recorder\u2019s Court, as a court of limited jurisdiction, has the power to review a Parole Board decision, the effect of <em>Eddinger, </em>and the scope of the Legislature\u2019s authorization for review of Parole Board decisions.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b711-7\">Brickley, C.J., and Cavanagh, Boyle, Riley, Mallett, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\"> MCL 768.7a(2); MSA 28.1030(1)(2).
