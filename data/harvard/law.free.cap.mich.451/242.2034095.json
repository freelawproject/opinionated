We reverse and remand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Plaintiff Gordon Ghrist was working as an employee of Aetna Enterprises on May 1, 1989, when his right hand became caught in a die. The die, which Ghrist alleges was designed and manufactured by Chrysler/Jeep Eagle, was fitted by Chrysler/Jeep Eagle with T-shaped \u201ckickers\u201d designed to help eject parts made in the die. Ghrist asserts that the injury occurred when he reached into the press area to remove a part, and the kicker descended unexpect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>edly. The effect was to pinch his right hand and thereby cause injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Ghrist filed this action, alleging that Chrysler/Jeep Eagle had negligently designed and manufactured the die, negligently failed to test the die, and breached express and implied warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The complaint alleges that the \u201ckickers\u201d on the die created dangerous pinch points even when used properly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint further alleged that the T-shaped nature of the kickers was not essential to the die\u2019s function and that the die could have been designed with safer kickers without any corresponding decrease in utility. In granting summary disposition, the judge said that \u201c[a]bsent evidence that a die press manufacturer knows or has specific reason to know that the original purchaser will use a die press unsafely, it has no duty to provide safety devices not ordered by the purchaser . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished per curiam opinion on January 26, 1994.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Agreeing with the circuit judge, the Court of Appeals said that \u201c [i]t is implicit under <em>Fredericks </em>and <em>White </em>that there is no cause of action for negligent design and manufacture of a die.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In <em>Fredericks </em>and <em>White, </em>this Court considered whether an employee who was injured while working with a die that had been installed in an unguarded press, could maintain an action against the owner of the die who had purchased the die from the manufacturer and had loaned it to the plaintiffs employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The plaintiffs in both cases asserted that the dies should have been guarded, and sought to recover under two legal theories. One was negligent entrustment. In <em>Fredericks, </em>recovery also was sought on the ground that an unguarded die is so unreasonably dangerous as to be defective for purposes of a products liability action. Similarly, the plaintiffs in <em>White </em>sought recovery on the ground that defendants Chrysler and Ford had \u201cnegligently supplied [the plaintiffs employer] with chattels (the die sets) dangerous for the intended use.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">This Court denied recovery in both cases on both claims. With respect to the claim that the die was defective as delivered by General Motors, this Court in <em>Fredericks </em>said that in light of each employer\u2019s statutorily mandated duty to maintain safe working conditions, it could not \u201chold <em>as a matter of law </em>that it was foreseeable to defendant that the product it supplied would be used in an unsafe manner rendering it defective.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs\u2019 negligent supply claim was also rejected in <em>White </em>on similar grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">In contrast with <em>Fredericks </em>and <em>White, </em>where the defendants loaned the die to plaintiffs\u2019 employer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Ghrist alleges that Chrysler/Jeep Eagle was the manufacturer and designer of the die that caused his injury. Chrysler/Jeep Eagle argues that a distinction between an allegation of negligent design and manufacture and one of negligent supply is not cognizable at law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The law of products liability imposes greater responsibility on one who manufactures and designs a chattel than on one who merely supplies it. See 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 388, p 300;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Bevard v Ajax Mfg Co, </em>473 F Supp 35, 38-39 (ED Mich, 1979); <em>Seasword v Hilti, Inc (After Remand), </em>449 Mich 542, 545-547; 537 NW2d 221 (1995). The manufacturer is especially knowledgeable about a product\u2019s capabilities and limitations and the foreseeability of harm. Further, the manufacturer is in the best position to effectuate needed safety-related improvements. Because the manufacturer possesses both this knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>edge and power, it is uniquely susceptible to the incentive structure built into the negligence standard and, as a result, is more likely to actually implement needed changes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, by putting the product into the stream of commerce, the manufacturer impliedly promises that the product is safe for its intended and all reasonably foreseeable uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">A manufacturer has a duty to design its product to eliminate \u201cany unreasonable risk of foreseeable injury.\u201d <em>Prentis v Yale Mfg Co, </em>421 Mich 670, 693; 365 NW2d 176 (1984). While this Court accepts that a die, standing alone, is an inert object only capable of causing injury when teamed with a working press, this in itself does not insulate die manufacturers from liability under all circumstances.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Like any other product manufacturer, a manufacturer of a die \u201cis liable for negligence in the manufacture or sale of any product which may reasonably be expected to be capable of substantial harm if it is defective.\u201d Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 96, p 683; <em>Prentis, supra </em>at 691.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A die manufacturer is similarly liable under a breach of warranty theory if it supplies a defective product that causes injury. <em>Piercefield v Remington Arms Co, </em>375 Mich 85, 96; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>133 NW2d 129 (1965); <em>Smith v E R Squibb &amp; Sons, </em>405 Mich 79, 89; 273 NW2d 476 (1979).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Ghrist\u2019s breach of warranty and negligence claims thus turn on whether the die was defective. \u201cA product is defective if it is not reasonably safe for its foreseeable uses.\u201d <em>Fredericks, supra </em>at 720. This definition of \u201cdefective\u201d is not limited to manufacturing defects, but also includes design defects. <em>Prentis, supra </em>at 683-684; <em>Scott v Allen Bradley Co, </em>139 Mich App 665, 670; 362 NW2d 734 (1984); <em>Johnson v Chrysler Corp, </em>74 Mich App 532, 537; 254 NW2d 569 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">We are obliged, for purposes of this motion for summary disposition, to accept the facts as pleaded by Ghrist as true.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Ghrist alleges that Chrysler/Jeep Eagle\u2019s inclusion of the T-shaped kicker on its die created hazardous pinch points, thereby rendering the die defective.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>also contends that his injuries were caused by this defect and were foreseeable, given the relationship between the claimed defect and the ordinary use of the press. Ghrist thereby stated a claim on which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Chrysler/Jeep Eagle asserts that summary disposition was proper because it was not legally possible to foresee that the die would be used by Ghrist\u2019s employer in an unsafe manner because Ghrist\u2019s employer was required, under the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Act, to \u201c[f]umish to each employee, employment and a place of employment which is free from recognized hazards that are causing, or are likely to cause, death or serious physical harm to the employee.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although an employer has a statutorily imposed duty to make the workplace safe for its employees, MIOSHA does not abrogate the general duty of a manufacturer to exercise the degree of care necessary in the design and manufacture of a product to avoid all reasonably foreseeable injuries. \u201cThe public interest in assuring that safety devices are installed demands more from the manufacturer than to permit him to leave such a critical phase of his manufacturing process to the haphazard conduct of the ultimate purchaser.\u201d <em>Bexiga v Havir Mfg Corp, </em>60 NJ 402, 410; 290 A2d 281 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Were this Court to hold otherwise, manufacturers would be free to rely on MIOSHA as a shield and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>manufacture products girded with only the bare minimum of safety features. Responsibility for safety would shift from the party most able to provide it in the least expensive and highest quality form and would rest solely on the shoulders of the comparatively ignorant party, the employer. Such a scenario harkens back to the <em>pre-MacPherson v Buick Motor </em>Co<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> period when caveat emptor ruled the day and all risk of liability was transferred along with the goods being purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Chrysler/Jeep Eagle\u2019s position also runs contrary to the clearly expressed intent of the Legislature in enacting MIOSHA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\"><em>Nothing in this act shall be construed to </em>supersede or in any manner affect any workers\u2019 compensation law, or to enlarge or <em>diminish or affect </em>in any other manner <em>the common law </em>or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities <em>of employers </em>and <em>employees </em>under any law with respect to injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or in the course of, employment. [MCL 408.1002(2); MSA 17.50(2)(2) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The foregoing provision illustrates that, policy considerations aside, the mandates of miosha do not invalidate a common-law cause of action against a third party that would otherwise be maintainable without regard to the employer\u2019s obligations to the employee.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We hold that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the circuit court\u2019s grant of Chrysler/Jeep Eagle\u2019s motion for summary disposition. Ghrist made out a facially valid claim on which relief can be granted.

Ghrist made out a facially valid claim on which relief can be granted. Whether the die that caused Ghrist\u2019s injury was defectively designed is a question of fact for the jury to decide. <em>[Ante </em>at 252.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>I disagree. The Court of Appeals concluded that summary disposition was proper, citing <em>Fredericks v General Motors Corp, </em>411 Mich 712; 311 NW2d 725 (1981), and <em>White v Chrysler Corp, </em>421 Mich 192; 364 NW2d 619 (1984), for support.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">Under the holdings of <em>Fredericks </em>and <em>White, </em>there is no duty for an automobile manufacturer to place guards on a die or to warn the component manufacturer of hazards attendant with its use. <em>Fredericks </em>held that there is no cause of action for negligence or for breach of implied warranty for an unguarded die. Likewise, <em>White </em>determined that negligently supplying an unguarded die failed to state a claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">It is implicit under <em>Fredericks </em>and <em>White </em>that there is no cause of action for negligent design and manufacture of a die. It is not sufficient to allege negligent design and manufacture as opposed to negligent supply. Nor is a claim stated merely by asserting that the die had pinch points rather than that it was unguarded. Regardless of the theory, plaintiffs employer had the duty to provide safe working conditions and the failure to do so was not foreseeable. [Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued January 26, 1994 (Docket No. 143681), slip op at 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In <em>Fredericks, </em>the plaintiff suffered nearly the complete loss of his left hand when it was crushed by an unguarded power press. He sued General Motors, who owned the die in the press at the time of the accident, claiming that the die was unreasonably dangerous and defective because it was not guarded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>This Court found that the directed verdict was properly granted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">A product is defective if it is not reasonably safe for its foreseeable uses. An unguarded die may be used in a reasonably safe manner in a guarded press or in an unsafe maimer in an unguarded press. At the time of plaintiff\u2019s ipjury 1967 PA 282 required that \u201c[ejach employer shall establish and maintain conditions of work which are reasonably safe and healthful for employees.\u201d In light of this statutory duty imposed on Manistee Drop Forge we cannot hold as a matter of law that it was foreseeable to defendant that the product it supplied would be used in an unsafe manner rendering it defective. <em>[Id. </em>at 720-721.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In both <em>Fredericks </em>and the present matter, the die causing the injury was owned by an automotive company and was being used by another corporation for stamping purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In both cases, the plaintiffs alleged that these dies contained design defects. In <em>Fredericks, </em>the alleged defect was the lack of a safety guard, and here the alleged defect was a T-bar kicker that created a pinch point.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Plaintiff attempts to distinguish <em>Fredericks </em>by arguing that, in the present case, a safety device could not have been added to the die in order to make it completely safe. However, <em>Fredericks </em>could not state with certainty that a guard on the press would have prevented the injury, only that it might have.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s injury may well have resulted from the absence of guarding; however, <em>this accident might have been pre</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>vented by guarding on the press </em>instead of the die. There are numerous methods of guarding the point of operation on a power press. Die guards are merely one. <em>[Id. </em>at 720 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Similarly, it cannot be said that removing the T-bar in this case would insure absolute safety. Even if the alleged design defects were cured, injuries of the type suffered by the plaintiff in <em>Fredericks </em>and this case remain a possibility. Hence, <em>Fredericks </em>is directly on point, and the Court of Appeals properly relied on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The Court of Appeals also correctly relied on <em>White. </em>In <em>White, </em>the plaintiffs were injured when their hands were caught in power presses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the power presses were owned by the plaintiffs\u2019 employers, they were being utilized to provide component parts for Ford and Chrysler, who had designed the dies used for the project. This Court, in a unanimous decision, found for the defendants.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">We would not be justified in so transforming the responsibility for the observance of job safety precautions. The common law and the Legislature impose responsibility for job safety on the contractor, not on the employer of the contractor. However, because of the bar of the exclusive remedy provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act, there generally is no tort liability for failure to provide workplace safety. The proposed theory of liability would evolve a special rule for the benefit only of employees of a contractor injured as a result of the use of chattels in production pursuant to an out-source contract. A common-law cause of action should not be evolved solely or primarily to avoid a statutory limitation. We are not persuaded that such a special rule for the benefit only of a discrete class of seriously injured workers is justified. <em>[White, supra </em>at 204.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Another case that is directly on point and persuasive is <em>Bradford v General Motors Corp, </em>123 Mich App 641; 333 NW2d 109 (1983). In <em>Bradford, </em>General Motors sent a die to the plaintiffs place of employment, Wyandotte Tool Company. Unfortunately, while testing this die, the plaintiff was injured when her hand was caught and crushed inside the die.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff brought suit against General Motors on the ground that the die was defective because it did not contain the proper guards.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals explicitly referenced Fredericks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\"><em>Fredericks </em>controls this case. When Bradford was injured in 1973, the statute referred to in <em>Fredericks </em>was still in effect. . . . Gm, then, was justified in expecting Wyandotte to fulfill its statutory duty to provide a safe workplace, including machines properly guarded under OSHAt[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] and miosha.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] Under <em>F~edericks, </em>the dies involved here were not unsafe for their foreseeable uses. The plaintiff did not establish a prima facie case that gm knew or should have known of Wyandotte\u2019s dangerous work site, which would render the dies unsafe. The granting of a directed verdict was proper. <em>[Bradford, supra </em>at 645.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">This decision closely parallels the facts presented here. In both the present case and <em>Bradford, </em>the plaintiffs were injured in press accidents. The presses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>were owned by an outsource company, the dies were provided by an automotive corporation, and both plaintiffs alleged defects in the design of the dies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The majority argues that the manufacturer of the die was under a duty to make the die safe for its intended use.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">A manufacturer has a duty to design its product to eliminate \u201cany unreasonable risk of foreseeable injury.\u201d <em>Prentis v Yale Mfg Co, </em>421 Mich 670, 693; 365 NW2d 176 (1984). While this Court accepts that a die, standing alone, is an inert object only capable of causing injury when teamed with a working press, this in itself does not insulate die <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>manufacturers from liability under all circumstances. <em>[Ante </em>at 248.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">I agree that a manufacturer has a duty to design a product safely, but in the present case defendant only provided a die that was to be used in a much greater press system. The die, standing alone, could not cause any injury, and there is no guarantee that the absence of the T-bar on the die would prevent all injuries once incorporated in the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In any event, in order for the risk of injury to arise, the die had to be included in a press system. Under MCL 408.1011(a); MSA 17.50(ll)(a), it is the responsibility of the employer who is utilizing this press system to make sure that the system as a whole is safe for its employees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">An employer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">(a) Furnish to each employee, employment and a place of employment which is free from recognized hazards that are causing, or are likely to cause, death or serious physical harm to the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The majority argues that this analysis will encourage manufacturers to rely on MIOSHA as a shield.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">Were this Court to hold otherwise, manufacturers would be free to rely on the MIOSHA as a shield and to manufacture products girded with only the bare minimum of safety features. <em>[Ante </em>at 250-251.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">I disagree. <em>Fredericks, White, Villar v E W Bliss Co, </em>134 Mich App 116; 350 NW2d 920 (1984), and <em>Bradford </em>do stand for the proposition that the employer is the one who has the onus of guaranteeing that a press syst'em is safe when it utilizes a die. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>manufacturers are still required to make safe products. If the manufacturer provided a die that was so negligently designed and assembled that it exploded after its first use, then obviously the manufacturer would not be able to hide behind the shield of miosha. Those facts, however, were not the ones presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Although my decision would limit plaintiffs recovery to worker\u2019s compensation, I do not believe that this is the wrong result. Moreover, if this result is deemed to be incorrect, it should be left to the Legislature to correct. Thus, I concur with this Court\u2019s statement in <em>White, supra </em>at 206:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">The absence of tort liability or other reparations for loss not covered by workers\u2019 compensation benefits caused by the failure to observe job safety precautions results in the undercompensation of many seriously injured workers. The larger problem of uncompensated loss for industrial injury or disease remains unresolved, and a solution may be impeded, by allowing a finite number of seriously injured workers to recover for loss not covered by workers\u2019 compensation benefits. This social problem deserves a broader solution than patchwork by this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Defendant merely provided a die to be used by Aetna Industries in its larger press system. It was Aetna\u2019s responsibility under miosha to make sure that this press system, as a whole, was safe for the use of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">While Aetna may have failed in this duty, Aetna\u2019s negligence is not the issue before this Court. Instead, plaintiff\u2019s action is against defendant on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>that it supplied an allegedly defective die. The type of fact pattern in the matter before us is directly akin to the facts presented in <em>Fredericks, White, Bradford, </em>and <em>Villar. </em>Although plaintiff attempts to distinguish these cases, I am not persuaded. In these actions, one constant joining thread exists \u2014 a plaintiff attempting to hold a die supplier liable on the ground that the die is somehow defective. Whether that defect is the lack of a safety device or the presence of a T-bar, there is still the same allegation \u2014 a defect in the design of a die. Consequently, <em>Fredericks, White, Villar, </em>and <em>Bradford </em>are directly on point with the facts here. I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision finding summary disposition appropriate.</p>\n<judges id=\"b384-5\">Weaver, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> [P]laintiff contends that an unguarded die is unreasonably dangerous and should, therefore, be considered \u201cdefective,\u201d giving rise to products liability on the part of the supplier for personal injuries sustained by its use. Plaintiff argues that his iiyury was a result of the absence of a guard on this particular die, that General Motors could have provided a guard, and that the failure to provide a guard should result in liability. <em>[Id. </em>at 720.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b378-9\"> This is not an uncommon occurrence. Generally, the automotive companies maintain ownership of these dies so as to guarantee production. If an outsourcing company goes bankrupt or cannot continue to produce the finished product, the automotive companies can simply reacquire the dies and send them to another outsourcing company for production.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\"><em> White </em>and <em>Buschlen v Ford Motor Co, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\"> Wyandotte Tool Company does not produce parts for General Motors.

In <em>Villar, </em>the plaintiff was injured while operating a press manufactured by the defendant. The press was manufactured in 1930 and did not have sufficient safety guards. However, the specific press was included in a much larger press system. The Court of Appeals found:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Because <em>Fredericks </em>shows that it was not foreseeable that plaintiff\u2019s employer would fail to incorporate the press into a press system containing adequate safety devices, the trial court erred by declining to grant defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. <em>[Id. </em>at 121.1</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">The Court arrived at this decision because the press manufactured by the defendant was a component included in a larger press system.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">The press manufactured by defendant here, like the dies at issue in <em>Fredericks, </em>was only a part of a press system. The press at issue here could only be used in coryunction with dies, a power source, and some method of feeding materials into the press, whether manual, semi-automatic, or automatic. The press was harmless and inoperable unless incorporated into such a system. <em>[Id. </em>at 120.]</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">If, in <em>Villar, </em>an entire press included in a press system did not invoke liability on the manufacturer of the press, then certainly the simple die component included in a much larger press and press system cannot invoke liability either.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
