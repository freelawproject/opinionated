Presented for our review in this appeal is the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that defendant Gratiot County Road Commission breached its duty to provide traffic control devices and warning signs, \u201cthat <em>Scheurman [v Dep\u2019t of Transportation </em>and] <em>Prokop [v Wayne Co Bd of Rd Comm\u2019rs, </em>434 Mich 619; 456 NW2d 66 (1990)] are dis-positive that the road commission had a duty to . . . repair and maintain the improved traveled portion of the roadway, but did not have to go outside the roadway proper.\u201d The trial court granted summary disposition for the defendant road commission. We conclude that the trial court erred as a matter of law, and remand for a summary disposition hearing pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">On September 5, 1988, John Pick was driving his car eastbound on Roosevelt Road in Gratiot County. At the crossroads intersection of Roosevelt and Crapo Roads,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pick\u2019s automobile collided with a vehicle being driven by defendant Jan Szymczak.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint made the following allegations relevant to this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>21. That pursuant to MCLA 691.1401, <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 3.996(101) <em>[et seq.][</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>. . ., the defendant, Road Commission, is charged with the statutory duties to design, maintain and repair all roadways within its jurisdiction, including Roosevelt Road, Crapo Road, and their intersection, so they are reasonably safe and fit for public travel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">22. That included within the above-described duties was a duty owed by the defendant, Road Commission, to post signs and other traffic control devices and warnings at or before the aforesaid intersection to assure that same was reasonably safe and fit for public travel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">23. That one of the proximate causes of the collision previously described above, and the resulting injuries and damages sustained by the plaintiffs, was the failure of the defendant, Road Commission, to fulfill their aforementioned duties so that the said roadways and intersection were reasonably safe and fit for public travel, and the said defendant\u2019s breaches were in the following particulars:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">A. Failing to properly design the aforesaid intersection and roadways to be safe for vehicular traffic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">B. Failing to properly maintain the aforesaid intersection and roadways to be safe for vehicular traffic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">C. Failing to install and provide reasonably necessary traffic control devices at or near the intersection of Roosevelt Road and Crapo Road in Gratiot County, Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">D. Failing to install and provide stop or yield signs at or near the aforesaid intersection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\">E. Failing to install and provide warning signs or notices on Roosevelt Road and Crapo Road informing motorists of the approaching crossroad and intersection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>F. Failing to install and provide signs or devices to assure that the aforesaid intersection and roadways were safe for vehicular traffic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Defendant filed a motion for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(7), (8) and (10). In its brief in support of that motion, defendant argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">[T]here is no claim in this matter that any condition existing within the \u201ctraveled portion of the roadbed actually designed for vehicular travel\u201d caused either vehicle to go out of control, or leave the roadway ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">Rather, it is the contention of both Plaintiffs . . . that the accident occurred as a result of an alleged \u201cvision obstruction\u201d in the form of an orchard, which was admittedly located on private property, and outside the \u201cimproved portion of the roadway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">After oral argument at the motion hearing, the circuit judge stated that \u201cthe issue before the Court is what were the duties of the road commission . . . Noting that questions of duty are questions of law, the circuit court held \u201cthat <em>Scheurman </em>[and] <em>Prolcop </em>are dispositive that the road commission had a duty to . . . repair and maintain the improved traveled portion of the roadway, but did not have to go outside the roadway proper.\u201d Accordingly, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">The circuit court did not specify which subsection of the court rule it relied on in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition in either its bench ruling or its written order. The Court of Appeals noted that the circuit court based its grant of sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>maiy disposition on its holding that defendant \u201chad no duty to maintain areas outside the improved portion of the roadway\u201d and, accordingly, reviewed it as a grant under MCR 2.116(C)(8). 203 Mich App 138, 139; 511 NW2d 694 (1993). We agree, and will review the Court of Appeals decision under the same standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The Court of Appeals panel cited <em>Scheurman, supra, </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe duty [that arises under the highway exception] is narrowly drawn, and extends only to the improved, traveled portion of the roadway of a highway that was designed for vehicular travel; it does not include . . . any other installation outside the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d 203 Mich App 140 (citations omitted). The Court of Appeals majority then held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">In this case, it is very clear that the orchards on private property adjacent to the road cannot be classified as being part of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel. Consequently, the existence of the orchards and their influence as a visual obstruction of the intersection creates no duty on the part of the defendant under the highway exception to governmental immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">What is not so clear is whether the improved portion of the highway includes improvements that serve as integral parts of the highway, such as signs and shoulders. See <em>Scheurman, supra </em>at 637, n 29; <em>Salvati v State Hwy Dep\u2019t, </em>415 Mich 708; 330 NW2d 64 (1982); <em>Hutchinson v Allegan Co Bd of Rd Comm\u2019rs (On Remand), </em>192 Mich App 472, 477; 481 NW2d 807 (1992). If there is an \u201cintegral parts of the highway\u201d exception under the broad concept of \u201ctraffic sign maintenance\u201d that includes erecting signs or warning devices at points of hazard, it appears to conflict with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>very narrow definition of duty that excluded street lighting in <em>Scheurman. </em>Because we can find no way to distinguish between street lighting and traffic signs, and because both have their physical structure outside the traveled or paved portion of the roadbed, we must conclude that the defendant is not subject to liability for the alleged lack of adequate traffic signs at the intersection of Roosevelt and Crapo Roads.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">Affirmed. [203 Mich App 141.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The dissenting judge on the panel \u201cdisagree [d] with the majority\u2019s conclusion that this case is controlled by the limited definition of an improved roadway set forth in <em>Scheurman </em>.... While the Supreme Court in <em>Scheurman, supra </em>at 633, may have clearly stated that there is no duty to provide street lighting because it is not part of the improved portion of a roadway, it did reserve its decision with respect to the duty to post and maintain traffic signs, citing the previous case of <em>Salvati v State Hwy Dep\u2019t, </em>415 Mich 708; 330 NW2d 64 (1982).\u201d 203 Mich App 142 (citing <em>Scheurman, supra </em>at 637, n 29). In the view of the dissenting judge, the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition should be reversed and the case remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">We granted leave and instructed the parties to \u201cinclude among the issues to be briefed whether a \u2018point of hazard\u2019 is created by vegetation growing on private property.\u201d 448 Mich 930 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">As a threshold matter, we think it necessary to clarify exactly what claims are at issue in this appeal. Defendant\u2019s brief and oral argument in this Court evidence a mistaken belief that plaintiffs alleged a breach of duty only in regard to the vegetation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>allegedly constitutes a visual obstruction at the intersection where the accident occurred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In fact, as already noted, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint also stated the following claims: defective design of the intersection, failure to provide reasonably necessary traffic control devices or warning signs at the intersection, and, generally, failure to properly maintain the intersection so as to be safe for vehicular traffic. Put another way, plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that a governmental duty arises under the highway exception with regard to any factors that actually affect reasonably safe vehicular travel on the improved portion of a roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Defendant\u2019s position, based on the purported authority of <em>Scheurman </em>and <em>Prokop, </em>is that no duty of any kind arises under the highway exception in cases where the alleged hazard-creating factor is physically outside the improved portion of the roadbed actually designed for vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Properly characterizing it as a question of law for the court to decide, the circuit judge, citing <em>Scheurman </em>and <em>Prokop, </em>ruled that defendant had no duty with regard to the alleged visual obstructions cited by plaintiffs because those obstructions are \u201coutside the roadway proper.\u201d We hold that, under the proper interpretation of all relevant language in the highway exception, the circuit court\u2019s ruling was erroneous as a matter of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the Court of Appeals affirmance, on the same basis, is also erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>The Court of Appeals majority went beyond the reasoning of the circuit court, recognizing the possibility that, at least theoretically, there might be \u201can \u2018integral parts of the highway\u2019 exception under the broad concept of \u2018traffic sign maintenance\u2019 that includes erecting signs or warning devices at points of hazard,\u201d but ultimately concluded that such an exception \u201cappears to conflict with the very narrow definition of duty that excluded street lighting in <em>Scheurman\u201d </em>203 Mich App 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We hold today that <em>Scheurman </em>does not establish authoritative precedent for any such \u201cvery narrow definition of duty\u201d and that, in any event, the statutory language of the highway exception, read in its entirety, does not support such a narrow definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">In <em>Scheurman, </em>a three-justice plurality would have held that \u201ccompliance with the conditions and restrictions of the highway exception statute negates the inclusion of street lighting within the duty of the state because the physical structure of the lights falls outside the traveled or paved portion of the roadbed actually designed for public vehicular travel.\u201d 434 Mich 633 (opinion of Riley, C.J.). In <em>Prokop, </em>the companion case, in which the plaintiff\u2019s claim was based on the existence of a hedge on private property that obstructed vision at the intersection where the plaintiff was injured, the same plurality concluded: \u201cWhile the hedge may have interfered with compass-range vision within the intersection, it cannot be catego<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>rized as a defective condition upon \u2018the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 635. Therefore, the plurality concluded, \u201cliability may not be imposed upon the defendant for a hedge, located on private property, which obstructed the view of travelers.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The actual disposition of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in <em>Scheurman </em>and <em>Prokop </em>was accomplished by Justice Boyle\u2019s concurrence, which stated: \u201cI join in both the rationale and result of the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion, with the understanding that it does not preclude the application of MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102) in cases alleging a failure to \u2018repair and maintain\u2019 installations that are integral to, if not part of, the \u2018improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel,\u2019 <em>such as traffic lights and signs.\u2019\u2019 Id. </em>at 637 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The concurrence concluded with the following statement: \u201cSee <em>ante, </em>p 637, n 29.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is a reference to note 29 of the plurality opinion, which acknowledged that in <em>Tuttle v State Hwy Dep\u2019t, </em>397 Mich 44, 45-46; 243 NW2d 244 (1976), \u201cthis Court found the defendant liable for a newly opened intersection that \u2018was not \u201creasonably safe and fit for travel\u201d by reason of inadequate signalization.\u2019 \u201d In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>same footnote, the plurality opinion also recognized the relevance of <em>Salvati, supra, </em>stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">the plurality decision [in <em>Salvati] </em>indicates a willingness by the Court to include the duty to post and maintain traffic signs within the highway exception statute. Again, however, neither of the two opinions [i.e., <em>Tuttle </em>or <em>Salvati], </em>nor any of the cited cases within them, address the issue whether traffic signs fall within the \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">Notwithstanding our decision today, we feel it is inappropriate to express an opinion as to the validity of <em>Tuttle </em>or <em>Salvati </em>at this time. <em>[Scheurman, supra </em>at 637, n 29.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The <em>Salvati </em>decision actually comprised two three-justice plurality opinions. The lead opinion favored, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, reversal of the judgment of the lower courts, whose rulings were favorable to the plaintiff, and remand for further proceedings; the other plurality favored denial of leave to appeal or, if leave to appeal was granted, affirmance of the lower courts\u2019 judgments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The six justices unanimously agreed, however, that the governmental duty of maintenance with regard to public roads encompassed a duty to provide warning signs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">A governing unit may incur liability under the broad concept of \u201ctraffic sign maintenance\u201d . . . for failing to erect any sign or warning device at a point of hazard, ... or for placing a sign which inadequately informs approaching motorists of a hazard. <em>[Salvati, </em>415 Mich 715 (Coleman, J., joined by Fitzgerald, C.J. and Ryan, J.).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">A governmental agency having jurisdiction of a highway has the obligation to post traffic signs and to warn motorists at points of special danger. Liability may arise for fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>ing to erect a sign or barrier warning at a point of hazard, or for posting a sign which inadequately warns of an approaching danger. <em>[Id. </em>at 721 (Levin, J., joined by Kavanagh and Williams, JJ.) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">We recognize that, in a strict sense, the <em>Salvati </em>opinions\u2019 conclusions in regard to the scope of the governmental duty of maintenance of roadways can be characterized as dicta. However, we are convinced that the reasoning underlying their shared conclusion is convincing and faithful to the true intent of the Legislature in providing the highway exception. Therefore, we expressly hold that a duty to provide adequate warning signs or traffic control devices at known points of hazard arises under the highway exception of the governmental tort liability act,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102). We also note a more recent conclusion of a majority of this Court: \u201cThe highway exception abrogates governmental immunity at \u2018points of special danger to motorists . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Mason v Wayne Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>447 Mich 130, 135; 523 NW2d 791 (1994) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">At the time of the incident at issue in this case, the highway exception stated:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">Each governmental agency having jurisdiction over any highway shall maintain the highway in reasonable repair so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel. Any person sustaining bodily injury or damage to his property by reason of failure of any governmental agency to keep any highway under its jurisdiction in reasonable repair, and in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel, may recover the damages suffered by him from the governmental agency. . . . The duty of the state and the county road commissions to repair and maintain highways, and the liability therefor, shall extend only to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel and shall not include sidewalks, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The historical development of governmental immunity, generally, and the specific development of the highway exception, have been fully detailed elsewhere (albeit from significantly different perspectives), and are unnecessary to our decision in this case. See <em>Scheurman, supra </em>at 626-631; <em>Chaney v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>447 Mich 145, 184-193; 523 NW2d 762 (1994) (Levin, J., dissenting). We find that the statutory language of the highway exception itself, read in its proper context, is fully adequate for resolution of the precise legal question before us in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The first sentence of this provision establishes the duty to \u201cmaintain the highway in reasonable repair so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>that it is reasonably safe . . . for public travel.\u201d And the duty of maintenance includes the duty to erect adequate warning signs or traffic control devices at a \u201cpoint of hazard\u201d (or a \u201cpoint of special danger\u201d). Therefore, if the alleged impediments to safe vehicular travel on Roosevelt and Crapo Roads cited by plaintiffs are points of hazard,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> then defendant has a duty to warn motorists,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or to otherwise act so as to render travel on the improved portion of the roadway reasonably safe.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Defendant and the lower courts in this case have discerned (not, we acknowledge, wholly implausibly) a bright-line rule of decision that limits governmental responsibility for public roadways to factors that are physically part of the roadbed itself. However, such a rule requires an improperly stringent reading of the highway exception, one that focuses solely on the fourth sentence of that statutory section, and specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>cally on the phrase \u201cthe improved portion of the highway.\u201d We expressly disavow this selective reading of the statute. As previously stated by Justice Levin, \u201cIn providing, in the fourth sentence of the highway exception, that the duty \u2018to repair and maintain highways, and the liability therefor\u2019 shall not extend to \u2018any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel,\u2019 the Legislature did not [abrogate the] duty, and liability therefor, under the first two sentences of the highway exception, to repair and maintain the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel . . . .\u201d Chaney, <em>supra </em>at 193-194.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In gleaning the true scope of the highway exception to governmental immunity from the entire statutory provision and our undeniably fractured case law precedents, we do, in fact, derive some guidance from <em>Scheurman:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">It seems clear even from a literal reading that the \u201cimproved portion\u201d language of '\u00a7 2 does not distinguish the surface of the highway as opposed to conditions other than the surface of the highway which may well foreclose the highway from being \u201creasonably safe.\u201d [434 Mich 641 (opinion of Brickley, J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">A myopic focus on the phrase \u201cthe improved portion of the highway\u201d ignores not only the first two sentences of the highway exception, but also ignores the phrase immediately following it: \u201cdesigned for vehicular travel.\u201d Vehicular travel does not take place solely on the two-dimensional length and width of the roadway; rather, it occurs in three-dimensional space, and necessarily implicates factors not physically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>within the improved portion of the roadway itself, factors that can be points of hazard to reasonably safe vehicular travel on the interconnected network of public roadways.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">We define \u201cpoint of hazard\u201d (or \u201cpoint of special danger\u201d) as any condition that directly affects vehicular travel on the improved portion of the roadway so that such travel is not reasonably safe.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To be a point of hazard for purposes of the highway exception, the condition must be one that uniquely affects vehicular travel on the improved portion of the roadway, as opposed to a condition that generally affects the roadway and its. surrounding environment. We reemphasize, however, that such conditions need not be physically part of the roadbed itself.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">We turn now to the other basis for the Court of Appeals majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Scheurman, </em>i.e., that it could \u201cfind no way to distinguish between street lighting and traffic signs . . . .\u201d 203 Mich App 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The obvious difference between the two, which was expressly acknowledged by the entire Court in <em>Scheurman, </em>is that the defendant in <em>Scheurman </em>was statutorily excluded from the duty to provide streetlights on the relevant roadways. See <em>Scheurman, </em>434 Mich 632, n 23 (opinion of Riley, C.J.); <em>id. </em>at 651-652 (opinion of Brickley, J.) (both citing MCL 247.651b; MSA 9.1097[lb]).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>The other, generally applicable factor that distinguishes street lighting is that darkness is not a condition unique to the three-dimensional space in which vehicular traffic on a roadway occurs.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In conclusion, we expressly hold that a duty is imposed on governmental agencies to provide traffic control devices or warning signs at, or in regard to, points of hazard affecting roadways within their jurisdiction. And, as already noted, we emphasize that the issue whether a duty arises under this standard is strictly subject to the notice requirement of \u00a7 3 of the act, MCL 691.1403; MSA 3.996(103).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We acknowledge that our prior opinions readily evidence \u201cthis Court\u2019s badly fractured view of what the Legislature has divined in its efforts to provide this exception,\u201d <em>Chaney v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, supra </em>at 162, n 7 (opinion of Brickley, J.), and that, even in individual cases, we have produced \u201cbadly fractured opinions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178 (opinion of Cavanagh, C.J.). In this case, we have attempted to clearly state a workable principle that is faithful to the plain language of the highway exception, read in its proper context, and the intent of the Legislature in providing this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In remanding this case to the circuit court, we make no comment regarding the quality or quantity of the factual evidence presented by the parties. We leave the initial assessment of that evidence to the trial court in the exercise of its inherent discretion to make such evaluations in proceedings pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10).

I therefore concur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>in part with Justice Riley\u2019s result, while disagreeing with her rationale. Because I am unprepared to overrule cases recognizing liability for design or construction defects,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>1 agree with Justice Cavanagh that plaintiffs\u2019 allegation survives in respect to that claim and would remand regarding that claim alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">I write separately to set forth my disagreement with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cany factors that actually affect reasonably safe vehicular travel on the improved portion of a roadway,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 615, state a claim of breach of duty under the highway exception to governmental immunity, MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102), and to disagree with Justice Riley\u2019s rationale that the duty to warn can only arise from \u201cdisrepair of the roadbed\u201d itself. <em>Post </em>at 654. In my view, an actionable breach of duty might occur where a governmental unit fails to warn of a dangerous condition of the roadway surface that could have been eliminated through discharging the statutory duty to maintain the improved portion of the roadway designed for vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">I concede that this case is complicated by the fact that it is postured as a motion granted under MCR 2.116(C)(8) and that the majority\u2019s conclusion is defensible as a further illustration to the Legislature of the need to clarify the extent of the highway exception.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Chaney v Transportation Dep\u2019t, </em>447 Mich 145, 178; 523 NW2d 762 (1994) (Cavanagh, C.J., con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>curring). I agree with Justice Riley that the question whether the statutory obligation is to maintain the road in reasonably safe condition, or to use due diligence to keep the road in good repair, has been a problem for the judiciary since the enactment of 1879 PA 244. However, while I agree that the amendment of the statute resolved the question by limiting the duty to the \u201cimproved portion of the highway,\u201d I cannot agree that the phrase \u201cimproved portion of the highway\u201d limited the exception to immunity to a failure to repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Acknowledging that there is a duty to erect signs as proper warning devices at points of hazard, <em>post </em>at 635, Justice Riley cannot demonstrate either through legislative history or canons of construction that the duty described in the first sentence of the statute is solely to repair the improved portion of the highway. 1964 PA 170 does not define the duty as a duty to \u201c \u2018maintain the highway in reasonable repair.\u2019 \u201d Riley, J., <em>post </em>at 635. Rather, it specifically defines the duty to \u201crepair and maintain highways.\u201d Thus, while Justice Riley is correct that the second sentence of the statute identifies an injured person\u2019s right to recovery and does not define the duty of the agency, her conclusion that the duty extends only to repair is refuted by the fourth sentence of the statute that defines the duty to encompass a duty to repair and maintain the highways. Justice Riley\u2019s analysis of the statutory duty thus collapses the definition of duty in the fourth sentence of the statute, which specifically includes the duty to maintain, into the first sentence, which defines the duty to \u201cmaintain the highway in reasonable repair.\u201d MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Thus, while the duty extends only to the improved portion of the highway, the Legislature included within the exception the duty to keep the roadbed surface travel worthy by repairing and maintaining it. In adding the words \u201cimproved portion of the highway,\u201d the Legislature may have intended to reject a duty to keep the road in reasonably safe condition, and reached a compromise regarding the duty to keep the road in good repair. The duty imposed would appear to be to maintain the highway either by repairing the highway or warning motorists using the highway of a dangerous condition of the roadway itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">This interpretation is consistent with a narrow reading of the exception, with the results in both <em>Scheurman v Transportation Dep\u2019t, </em>434 Mich 619; 456 NW2d 66 (1990), and its companion case, <em>Prokop v Wayne Co Bd of Rd Comm\u2019r, </em>and it is also consistent with cases such as <em>Joslyn v Detroit, </em>74 Mich 458; 42 NW 50 (1889), <em>Longstreet v Mecosta Co, </em>228 Mich 542; 200 NW 248 (1924), and <em>Jewell v Rogers Twp, </em>208 Mich 318; 175 NW 151 (1919), in which liability was imposed for the failure to continue the road in the condition it had been maintained or failure to warn of any changes in the road that created a dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">It is also consistent with the notice requirement of the act. MCL 691.1403; MSA 3.996(103). The notice requirement not only gives the government notice of a defect so it can remedy it, it also charges it with the duty of giving an appropriate warning if the hazard created by the condition of the roadway cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>readily repaired or is not amenable to repair or redesign.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Defining a point of hazard as requiring the government to install warnings to exclude dangers arising from a condition of the highway that would not be reasonably apparent to a person exercising due care is also consistent with Justice Coleman\u2019s explanation of a point of hazard in <em>Salvati v State Hwy Dep\u2019t, </em>415 Mich 708; 330 NW2d 64 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In <em>Salvati, </em>the breach of duty alleged was the inadequacy of two signs bearing \u201cWATCH FOR ICE ON bridge,\u201d and in not having a flashing light or a message directing the driver to reduce speed. Justice Coleman wrote to reverse the verdict, finding that the two reflectorized signs were adequate to warn that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">a hazardous condition existed on the bridge, so as to enable [the driver] in the exercise of ordinary care, to avoid injury. We will not require of defendant more than what is reasonable under the circumstances; nor will we make defendant an insurer of the travelers of the roadway. <em>[Id. </em>at 716.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Less important, but of interest, is that such an approach is consistent with the statutory schemes of other states that absolve the government of liability for failure to install signs or signals, while imposing a duty to erect signs and adequate markings to warn against extremely dangerous trap-like hazards, unusual obstructions, or defects in the road, <em>Burkett v Honeyman, </em>561 So 2d 857 (La App, 1990). <em>Dep\u2019t of Transportation v Caffiero, </em>522 So 2d 57 (Fla App, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>1988). Thus, for example, \u00a7 830.8 of the California Government Code, enacted a year before adoption of the improved portion of the highway language here in question, provides that a public entity is not exonerated for failure to erect a signal sign or marking device \u201cnecessary to warn of a dangerous condition which endangered the safe movement of traffic and which would not be reasonably apparent to, and would not have been anticipated by, a person exercising due care.\u201d <em>Washington v San Francisco, </em>219 Cal App 3d 1531, 1535, n 3; 269 Cal Rptr 58 (1990). See also New Jersey Stat 59:4-4, discussed in <em>Civalier v Trancucci, </em>138 NJ 52; 648 A2d 705 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">I would hold that the government is not obligated to erect a warning at an uncontrolled intersection on secondary gravel roads. The intersection is not a point of special hazard, nor does a limited ability to make observations on one side of the road caused by trees or vegetation make it so. In the former case, the nature of the intersection is apparent to a driver using due care. In the latter, the limited range of vision is itself a warning that due care must be maintained. <em>Ortega v Lenderink, </em>10 Mich App 190; 159 NW2d 140 (1968). Further, the dangers presented by such an intersection do not arise from the condition of the roadway itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The decision to provide traffic devices that have not been determined to be necessary, <em>Tuttle v State Hwy Dep\u2019t, </em>397 Mich 44; 243 NW2d 244 (1976), is within the discretion of highway authorities. MCL 257.608; MSA 9.2308. To construe the statute to impose a duty to erect signs at ordinary intersections on flat terrain, or at such intersections where vision is partially obscured, would be to construe the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>to wholly undermine that discretion. It follows that the duty to warn must be limited. To fail to do so would make the state an insurer of highway safety, and dismantle the highway exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Additionally, while it is well established that there may be more than one proximate cause of an injury, application of that principle in the context of a claim of injury because a lack of a warning that would have made the road safer would convert proximate cause analysis into a highly speculative inquiry. It is one thing to allege that an unknown or undiscoverable point of hazard was the factual cause of a motoring injury, and quite another to say that failure to warn of the danger of an intersection where vision is partially obstructed by vegetation is a factual cause of an accident in the intersection. As Judge Markman recently observed in <em>Wechsler v Wayne Co Rd </em>Comm, 215 Mich App 579; 546 NW2d 690 (1996), if the accident was caused by another driver\u2019s failure to follow the law and yield the right of way, concluding that the offending driver would have paid more attention to a sign saying, \u201cyield,\u201d or a traffic light, necessarily implicates the causation analysis of <em>Skinner v Square D Co, </em>445 Mich 153; 516 NW2d 475 (1994). Stated otherwise, if the driver that struck plaintiffs\u2019 car proceeded into the intersection without observation and failed to yield the right of way, it is difficult to see how a sign would have prevented the danger. If the offending driver\u2019s vision was blocked by vegetation, as alleged, that did not give him the right to enter the intersection and attempt a maneuver that would put him in the path of oncoming traffic.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Whatever else \u201cthe improved portion of the highway\u201d means, we must give it some meaning. For the reasons stated, I would hold that a claim of failure to erect signs at an open intersection and a claim that vision was obstructed at such an intersection by vegetation on private property do not, as a matter of law, constitute an allegation of a breach of the government\u2019s duty to warn plaintiffs of a point of hazard originating on the roadway. Every intersection may be dangerous, but courts do not have the authority to expose the government to tort liability for every situation that presents a potential for harm. As observed in <em>Wayne Co Rd Comm, supra </em>at 595, \u201cSuch a construction would impose a burden upon the public treasury that, if it is to be imposed, must be imposed only by the representative institutions of government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The openness of the intersection and the vegetation do not constitute a hazardous condition of the roadway surface as a result of improper maintenance of the roadway surface itself. A sign might make the intersection safer, but government is not the insurer of highway safety.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">I would affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal in all respects save that alleging a design defect.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-10\"> The signals and signs claims allege only breach of a duty to install.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> The parties have not briefed or argued this issue.

Because I do not believe that the majority\u2019s conclusion is faithful to the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>and purpose of the highway exception to the governmental immunity statute, I respectfully dissent. Consistent with this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Scheurman v Transportation Dep\u2019t, </em>434 Mich 619; 456 NW2d 66 (1990), I would hold that the highway exception, MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102), does not expose the state or a county to liability for alleged defects that arise outside the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel. Plaintiffs argue on appeal that the Gratiot County Road Commission failed to place adequate signs warning motorists of the special danger presented by both (1) the unmarked intersection and (2) a nearby apple orchard that allegedly obscured a traveler\u2019s view of the intersection. There was no allegation that there was a defect in the surface of the traveled roadbed itself, i.e., the improved portion of the highway, and, consequently, there was no claim that the road commission failed to repair or maintain the improved portion of the highway. Hence, I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision upholding the grant of summary disposition in favor of the road commission as a matter of law under MCR 2.116(C)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">I. STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"AM6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Under MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107), all governmental agencies are immune from tort liability while performing a governmental function, unless the activity falls within one of the narrowly drawn exceptions. <em>Mason v Wayne Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>447 Mich 130, 134; 523 NW2d 791 (1994); <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567, 618; 363 NW2d 641 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>(1984). One of the narrow exceptions, MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1), enables a person to recover against a governmental agency for an injury arising from the use of public highways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-4\">Each governmental agency having jurisdiction over any highway shall maintain the highway in reasonable repair so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel. Any person sustaining bodily injury or damage to his or her property by reason of failure of any governmental agency to keep any highway under its jurisdiction in reasonable repair, and in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel, may recover the damages suffered by him or her from the governmental agency. The liability, procedure and remedy as to county roads under the jurisdiction of a county road commission shall be provided in [MCL 224.21; MSA 9.121], The duty of the state and the county road commissions to repair and maintain highways, and the liability therefor, shall extend only to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel and shall not include sidewalks, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The resolution of the controversy in this case depends on the proper interpretation of this statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Citing the reasoning of <em>Salvati v State Hwy Dep\u2019t, </em>415 Mich 708; 405 NW2d 856 (1982), the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>concludes that under the highway exception a governmental agency has a \u201cduty to provide adequate warning signs or traffic control devices at known points of hazard . . . <em>Ante </em>at 619. I agree that the exception creates a duty to erect signs or proper control devices at points of hazard, but only when these hazards arise from the failure of the state or county to \u201cmaintain the [improved portion of the] highway [designed for vehicular travel] in reasonable repair . . . .\u201d MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1). The hazard must result from the governmental agency\u2019s failure to fulfill its statutory duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">In contrast, the majority expands the meaning of this duty beyond that created by the Legislature by defining a \u201cpoint of hazard\u201d as <em>\u201cany </em>condition that directly affects vehicular travel on the improved portion of the roadway so that <em>such travel is not reasonably safe.\u201d Ante </em>at 623 (emphasis added). In so defining this phrase, the majority has interpreted the statute as establishing a governmental duty to ensure that the improved portion of a highway is \u201creasonably safe and fit for travel,\u201d which is a more burdensome duty than to merely \u201cmaintain the [improved portion of the] highway [designed for vehicular travel] in reasonable repair . . . .\u201d MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1). This is not consistent with a narrowly drawn interpretation of the statute. See <em>Mason, supra </em>at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The majority rightly notes that the first sentence of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1) establishes the governmental agency\u2019s duty. The Legislature only required that the government \u201cmaintain the highway in reasonable repair . . . .\u201d This is the statement of the duty. The Legislature creat\u00e9d this duty to achieve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>a particular end \u201cso that [the highway] is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is the value that the Legislature hoped to realize by creating the duty. However, the statutory duty is not violated whenever the statute\u2019s end is not achieved. In other words, there is not a violation of this duty by the lone fact that a highway is not \u201creasonably safe and convenient for public travel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Legislature did not require that the governmental agency ensure that all highways were reasonably safe. Only when the governmental agency fails to \u201cmaintain the highway in reasonable repair\u201d is there a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">In support of its reasoning, the majority refers to Justice Levin\u2019s dissent in <em>Chaney v Transportation Dep\u2019t, </em>447 Mich 145, 193-194; 523 NW2d 762 (1994), in which he argued that the first two sentences of the statute establish that there is a duty \u201c \u2018to repair and maintain the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel . . . <em>Ante </em>at 622. In Chaney, <em>supra </em>at 196-198, Justice Levin relied on the statute\u2019s second sentence in concluding that a governmental agency has a duty to provide this end (a reasonably safe road), not the mere duty to keep the highway in \u201creasonable repair.\u201d The second sentence of the statute provides that \u201c[a]ny person sustaining bodily injury or damage to his or her property by reason of failure of any governmental agency to keep any highway under its jurisdiction in reasonable repair, <em>and in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel, </em>may recover the damages suffered by him or her from the governmental agency.\u201d MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>This interpretation of the second sentence suffers from the same deficiency as the majority\u2019s treatment of the first sentence. Examined in context, the second sentence does not expand the government\u2019s obligation established by the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The first sentence establishes the governmental agency\u2019s duty. The second sentence then identifies an injured person\u2019s right to recovery for a breach of that duty. The second sentence accomplishes this goal by providing for recovery when the governmental agency fails to keep the highway in \u201creasonable repair, and in condition reasonably safe . . . .\u201d MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1). The comma placed after \u201creasonable repair\u201d divides the government\u2019s duty (\u201cmaintain\u201d in \u201creasonable repair\u201d) from the end this duty is intended to secure (a \u201creasonably safe\u201d road). The point of identifying the statute\u2019s desired end with the duty it created in this sentence is to indicate that a person will recover only when the government\u2019s failure to perform its duty creates an unsafe condition. Thus, even if there is a breach of the duty (failure to maintain in reasonable repair), an injured person will not recover unless the breach of the duty created an unsafe condition. The interpretation that the majority posits when it adopts Justice Levin\u2019s analysis ignores the significance of this comma and the preceding text.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The strict interpretation is confirmed by subsequent text in the highway exception\u2019s fourth sentence, which provides: <em>\u201c[t]he duty </em>of the state and the county road commissions <em>to repair and maintain highways, </em>and the liability thereof, shall extend only to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel . . . MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1). The duty is reiterated. Using the ordinary meaning of these terms, the state and county road commissions, as governmental agencies, only have the duty \u201cto repair and maintain\u201d the highways, not the duty to keep the roads reasonably safe. See <em>Scheurman, supra </em>at 631 (Riley, C.J.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u201cThe purpose of the highway exception is not to place upon the state or the counties an unrealistic duty to ensure that travel upon the highways will always be safe\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">With this understanding of the statutory duty, the statute in the fourth sentence states that the duty to repair and maintain \u201cshall hot include sidewalks, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>lar travel,\u201d thus limiting this duty to <em>\"only\u201d </em>the \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1). I believe, as a plurality of this Court stated in <em>Scheurman, supra </em>at 631:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">[T]he phrase \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d refers only to the traveled portion, paved or unpaved, of the roadbed actually designed for public vehicular travel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">[T]he true intent of the Legislature is to impose a duty to keep the physical portion of the traveled roadbed in reasonable repair. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">This conclusion is based on the nature of the duty the Legislature created. The state and county road commissions can only repair and maintain what already exists, what has already been constructed. Consequently, in specifying the improved portion of the highway, the Legislature must have contemplated the maintenance of the integrity of the roadbed\u2019s surface, keeping it travel worthy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Consequently, I believe the majority has improperly enlarged the duty from one of repair and maintenance to a duty to keep the traveled portion of the road reasonably safe. I recognize that the majority has attempted to impose a limitation on the application of this expansive interpretation, but I believe this analysis only further confuses the matter. The majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">To be a point of hazard for purposes of the highway exception, the condition must be one that <em>uniquely </em>affects vehicular travel on the improved portion of the roadway, as opposed to a condition that <em>generally </em>affects the roadway and its surrounding environment. We reemphasize, however, that such conditions need not be physically part of the roadbed itself. <em>[Ante </em>at 623 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The majority fails to explain clearly what kind of condition \u201cuniquely\u201d affects the roadway and what condition only \u201cgenerally\u201d affects it. The majority attempts to clarify this distinction by applying it to the facts in <em>Scheurman </em>in which this Court ruled that there is no statutory duty for the state to erect a streetlight. The majority explains that \u201cdarkness is not a condition unique to the three-dimensional space in which vehicular traffic on a roadway occurs\u201d in describing why the lack of street lighting would not expose travelers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>to a special hazard. <em>Ante </em>at 624. I worry that our trial courts will have a difficult time applying this distinction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">This very effort to distinguish between unique and general hazards that arise outside the physical roadbed may provide insight to the Legislature\u2019s desire to limit the duty of the state and county only to the obligation to \u201crepair and maintain\u201d the improved portion of the highway. The duty to repair would generally limit the government\u2019s liability to cases in which there are defects in the roadbed\u2019s surface. In contrast, the Legislature may have feared that it could not anticipate the circumstances in which the state or county would be exposed to liability if the Legislature imposed on it the duty to ensure that travel is reasonably safe on governmental highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>n. CASE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"ATE\">A. RECENT CASES</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The narrow inteipretation required by the statute is consistent with this Court\u2019s recent rulings. In a similar case, a plurality of this Court recognized the limitation that the statute\u2019s fourth sentence placed on the duty created by the highway exception. See <em>Scheurman, supra </em>at 630-631. In <em>Scheurman, supra </em>at 623, this Court examined whether the highway exception statute imposed a duty on governmental agencies either to (1) install street lighting to ensure safe travel on the roadway or (2) remove vegetation on private property that allegedly obstructed the view of motorists approaching an intersection. In applying a narrow construction of the statute, the plurality (Riley, C.J., joined by Cavanagh and Griffin, JJ.) concluded that there was no duty to install street lighting \u201cbecause the physical structure of the lights falls outside the traveled or paved portion of the roadbed actually designed for public vehicular travel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. Thus, any alleged hazard did not arise from a defect in the roadbed\u2019s surface. Likewise, because the hedge that allegedly obstructed a motorist\u2019s view had \u201cno connection\u201d with the roadbed, the Wayne County Road Commission did not have a duty under the statute to ensure that the hedges were trimmed to allow for unobstructed vision while driving. <em>Id. </em>at 635.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>After <em>Scheurman, </em>in 1994, this Court analyzed the highway exception statute in <em>Mason, supra </em>at 132-133, where a pedestrian alleged that a county failed to install proper signs and traffic devices at a school crossing for pedestrians, and in <em>Chaney, supra </em>at 151, where a driver alleged that the state failed to properly design and construct a concrete bridge abutment and adjoining guardrail adjacent to, but beyond, the shoulder of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">In <em>Mason, supra </em>at 135-137, this Court concluded that the county was not liable under the highway exception statute because a school crossing is not a danger to vehicles and passengers. This Court explained that the statute definitively excludes from the exception \u201cspecific installations whose only rational purposes narrowly service the unique ne\u00e9ds of <em>pedestrians.\u201d Id. </em>at 136 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Cha</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number><em>ney, </em>the Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision by ruling that the Department of Transportation was protected by governmental immunity where the plaintiffs injuries arose from an allegedly defective guardrail even though the plaintiff claimed that the department failed to provide adequate warnings about this danger. See <em>Chaney, supra </em>at 152-153. However, there were four opinions among the five justices who concurred in this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">This Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Mason </em>(signs for school crossing) and <em>Chaney </em>(guardrail) is consistent with a narrow interpretation of the statute, as is this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Scheurman </em>(streetlights) and its companion case, <em>Prokop v Wayne Co Bd of Rd Comm\u2019rs </em>(hedges on private property that allegedly obscured the view of an intersection). In each of these cases, the alleged defect did not arise from the physical roadbed itself, and this Court concluded that the statute protected the state or county from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Moreover, this interpretation is consistent with this Court\u2019s rulings in <em>Gregg v State Hwy Dep\u2019t, </em>435 Mich 307, 313-317; 458 NW2d 619 (1990), and <em>Roy v Transportation Dep\u2019t, </em>428 Mich 330, 331; 408 NW2d 783 (1987). In <em>Gregg, </em>this Court concluded that the statute did not protect the state from liability for a bicycle path that was a part of the improved portion, while in <em>Roy </em>this Court concluded that the statute did protect the state from liability for a bicycle path that was detached from the highway because the path did not comprise part of the traveled portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">B. OTHER CASES</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In <em>Scheurman, </em>the plurality noted at 637, n 29, that it reserved the decision about the continuing vitality of two previous decisions, <em>Tuttle v State Hwy Dep\u2019t, </em>397 Mich 44, 45-46; 243 NW2d 244 (1976), and <em>Salvati, supra, </em>for another case. In each of these cases, this Court or a plurality of this Court apparently concluded that the highway exception included a duty to erect signs, regardless of whether the hazard arose from the roadbed surface. The present case involves the allegation that the road was unsafe because of the road commission\u2019s failure to provide a warning sign or a traffic device, e.g., a stop sign, at the unmarked intersection that was allegedly obscured by a nearby apple orchard. Thus, this is the case that allows this Court to revisit <em>Tattle </em>and <em>Salvati.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">In <em>Tattle, supra </em>at 45-46, the plaintiff suffered serious injuries when he collided with another vehicle at an intersection he claimed was riot reasonably safe because of \u201cinadequate signalization.\u201d Sprinkle Road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>was a five-lane road with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour that intersected with a two-lane state trunk line with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour. There was a thirty-six-inch reflectorized \u201cstop ahead\u201d sign and a thirty-six-inch reflectorized stop sign on Sprinkle Road at each approach to the intersection. Immediately after opening the intersection, the traffic and safety engineer for the Department of State Highways received reports that people were not stopping, and he determined that the signs were not noticeable. Consequently, he ordered the installation of large black and white cross-hatch backboards to attach to each stop ahead sign and the installation of red and yellow battery-operated flashers for each stop sign and \u201cstop ahead\u201d sign. The department did not carry out these work orders before the accident. The department\u2019s supervising electrical service unit had also approved the installation of a traffic signal at the intersection. On the basis of these facts, this Court unanimously decided that the department was negligent for failing to carry out its own orders when it had already determined that the existing stop controls were not sufficiently noticeable. <em>Id. </em>at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Yet, the Court in <em>Tuttle </em>never examined the highway exception itself to determine whether the department\u2019s failure was a breach of its duty to repair and maintain the highway. Instead, it merely assumed that there was a duty to keep the road reasonably safe and fit for travel. See <em>Tuttle, supra </em>at 52, n 5. Therefore, the Court did not address the question whether the alleged hazard arose from the surface of the highway because of the department\u2019s failure to repair and maintain it. I do not believe this ruling can govern this Court\u2019s understanding of the scope of liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>created by the Legislature in the highway exception and would overrule it to the extent that it holds that the state or a county can be liable for inadequate signage at an intersection, when that signage does not identify a hazard related to the state\u2019s failure to repair and maintain the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In <em>Salvati, </em>the plaintiff alleged that the department failed to post adequate signs alerting motorists of the danger of ice on a bridge road. Each plurality opinion in <em>Salvati </em>concluded that the duty of maintenance encompassed a duty to provide warning signs for a \u201cpoint of hazard,\u201d but, as I stated above, I would limit this principle to the circumstance in which the hazard resulted from the state\u2019s or county\u2019s failure to repair and maintain the roadbed\u2019s surface designed for vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Before our ruling in <em>Scheurman, </em>this Court also concluded that the duty created by the highway exception includes the obligation to cure any design or construction defect in order to ensure that the road is reasonably safe. See <em>Killeen v Transportation Dep\u2019t, </em>432 Mich 1, 4; 438 NW2d 233 (1989); <em>Peters v State Hwys Dep\u2019t, </em>400 Mich 50, 53, n 1; 252 NW2d 799 (1977). I do not believe that this statement of the duty under the highway exception is consistent with the language of the statute, nor with the Legislature\u2019s intent in limiting liability. See <em>Killeen, supra </em>at 19-21 (Riley, C.J., dissenting).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under a strict reading of the highway exception, the state or a county would only be bound to fix a design or construction defect when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>that defect left the physical surface of the road in disrepair (or not maintained), and thereby unsafe. For example, the state or a county would be responsible for remedying a construction or design defect that allowed a substantial depression to develop in the roadbed\u2019s surface because of the agency\u2019s failure to ensure that support for the roadbed was girded. Thus, I agree with the result in <em>Peters, supra </em>at 52-53, in which the state\u2019s failure to repair a defect in the road\u2019s drainage system allowed a body of water, up to ten to twelve inches deep, to collect on the road surface. This defect enabled a substantial obstruction to block free travel on the surface of the roadbed, leaving the surface of the roadbed legally in disrepair. However, I would overrule <em>Killeen </em>in which the alleged defect was a \u201csuperelevation\u201d of the road because the defect did not arise from the physical surface of the roadbed. <em>Id. </em>at 5. In the present case, the allegation in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint about a design defect was also unrelated to the roadbed\u2019s surface.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>m. legislative history</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">A. PREDECESSOR STATUTES</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Finally, I wish to briefly examine this Court\u2019s treatment of the highway exception\u2019s predecessor statutes to dispel any misapprehension about the significance I believe these cases have for the statute at issue. See <em>Chaney, supra </em>at 178-216 (Levin, J., dissenting). The present highway exception was enacted under 1964 PA 170. Before 1964, this Court interpreted the predecessor statutes, 1879 PA 244,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 1885 PA 214,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>1887 PA 264,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to provide that a municipality (\u201ctownship, village, city or corporation\u201d) was obliged to ensure that the road was in a \u201creasonably safe\u201d condition.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>In <em>McEvoy v Sault Ste Marie, </em>136 Mich 172, 176; 98 NW 1006 (1904), this Court recognized that there was a conflict in the cases because the 1879 act was open to two incompatible constructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\">[O]ne, that it imposed upon municipalities an obligation to use diligence to keep their highways and streets in a condition reasonably safe and fit for public travel; and the other, that it imposed upon municipalities only the obligation to use due diligence to keep their highways and streets in good repair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">This Court decided to embrace the first interpretation, as it had held in <em>Joslyn v Detroit, </em>74 Mich 458; 42 NW 50 (1889), and decided to disregard the analysis, although not necessarily the results, of the conflicting cases, as represented by <em>McArthur v Saginaw, </em>58 Mich 357; 25 NW 313 (1885), among others.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> I do not quarrel with this holding or with the conclusion that the previous statutes required that a municipality ensure that a road was in a reasonably safe condition. However, the Legislature repealed this statute and, in enacting a new one, substantially changed the duty that it created.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">B. 1964 PA 170</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">In response to this Court\u2019s decision to abrogate common-law governmental immunity for municipalities in <em>Williams v Detroit, </em>364 Mich 231; 111 NW2d 1 (1961), the Legislature enacted the governmental immunity act under 1964 PA 170 in order to restore governmental immunity to municipalities and to provide uniform treatment for state and local agencies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>Ross, supra </em>at 604-605. The Legislature created exceptions to governmental immunity, including a highway exception under MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102). For the first two sentences of this statute, the Legislature borrowed provisions from 1887 PA 264: the first sentence of the new statute was basically taken from the first sentence of \u00a7 3 of 1887 PA 264, and the second from 1887 PA 264\u2019s first sentence of \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In reestablishing the highway exception, however, the Legislature specifically reduced the scope of liability for the state or a county road commission in the statute\u2019s fourth sentence from what it created in the first sentence by eliminating liability for the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>and counties for \u201csidewalks, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway.\u201d MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1). Instead, in this fourth sentence, the Legislature explained that the duty only extended to the \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Moreover, in limiting this liability, the Legislature described the nature of the duty as requiring the state or county only to \u201crepair and maintain\u201d the improved portion of the highway. I believe, in construing this statute narrowly, that this sentence not only limits the scope of liability, but also limits the nature of the duty the Legislature intended to create for these agencies. See part i(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">IV. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In applying this properly strict interpretation of the highway exception statute to the facts of this case, I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision to grant summary disposition in favor of the Gratiot County Road Commission.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argue that the commission failed to keep this intersection reasonably safe in two different regards: (1) it did not place adequate signs to warn motorists of the danger of the improperly designed intersection where there were no traffic controls, and (2) it failed to warn motorists of the obstructed vision (a \u201cpoint of hazard\u201d) caused by the apple orchard growing on private property near the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">There is no dispute that the alleged hazard from the lack of traffic controls in this intersection did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>arise from the disrepair of the roadbed (or from a failure to maintain the roadbed), and that the alleged design defect did not compromise the integrity of the roadbed surface. The duties imposed on the state and counties under the highway exception statute do not include the installation and maintenance of signs for dangers that do not arise from a defect in the roadbed. Consequently, the road commission is not subject to liability for the alleged lack of adequate signage at the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Moreover, the alleged danger due to the apple orchard did not arise from the roadbed. In fact, this Court ruled on almost the identical issue in <em>Prokop, </em>the companion case to <em>Scheurman. </em>The plaintiff in <em>Prokop, supra </em>at 633, argued that the road commission was liable under the statute because it failed to remove a six-foot hedge, located on private property, that obstructed the view of travelers. This Court concluded that there was no liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">[T]he indisputable fact is that the hedge in question was on private property and had no connection with the roadbed or public travel thereon. While the hedge may have interfered with compass-range vision within the intersection, it cannot be categorized as a defective condition upon the \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel . . . .\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 635 (Riley, C.J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Similarly, in this case, I would conclude that there was no liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The duty identified by the majority cannot reasonably be reconciled with the result in <em>Prokop.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>ing to the reasoning of the majority, the plaintiff in <em>Prokop </em>failed to come under the highway exception as a matter of law merely because she neglected to argue that the hedge created a \u201cpoint of hazard,\u201d like the apple orchard allegedly did in the present case, requiring the road commission to erect a sign to alert drivers of this hazard. Hence, substantially nothing from <em>Prokop </em>survives this opinion. I also question whether this Court will need to revisit the result we reached in <em>Chaney </em>as a consequence of the majority\u2019s decision today.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">I believe that the Court of Appeals properly relied on <em>Scheurman, supra, </em>in affirming the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary disposition in favor of defendant Gratiot County Road Commission. The statute is unambiguous in creating a governmental duty to repair and maintain only the improved portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the highway designed for vehicular travel. This conclusion is faithful to the plain meaning of the provision defining the scope of the duty of the state and counties. Consequently, the state or a county road commission would only be liable when its failure to repair or maintain the improved portion of the highway, i.e., the physical structure of the roadbed surface, causes an injury. There is no obligation to warn motorists about dangers that do not arise from the condition of the roadbed itself. Hence, the Gratiot County Road Commission is protected from liability as a matter of law because plaintiffs\u2019 claims about the alleged dangers (an upcoming intersection and an apple orchard obstructing the motorists\u2019 view) were unrelated to the highway roadbed itself. I would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b780-5\">Weaver, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\"> H a statute is unambiguous, this Court may not engage in judicial construction, but must apply the statute as written. <em>Turner v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>448 Mich 22, 27; 528 NW2d 681 (1995); <em>Coleman v Gurwin, </em>443 Mich 59, 65; 503 NW2d 435 (1993).

Chief Justice Cavanagh, writing separately, stated that he also \u201creluctantly\u201d joined this opinion. <em>Chaney, supra </em>at 177.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\"> Thus, I do not agree with the majority that this duty \u201cimplicates factors not physically within the improved portion of the roadway itself . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 622-623.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">I dispute the claim in Justice Boyle\u2019s concurrence that I have \u201ccollapse [d]\u201d the duty recognized by the fourth sentence of the statute with the one created by the first. See <em>ante </em>at 627. The duty articulated by the statute\u2019s first sentence (\u201cmaintain the highway in reasonable repair\u201d) and fourth sentence (\u201crepair and maintain highways\u201d) are essentially the same. In Justice Boyle\u2019s concurrence, she concludes that \u201can actionable breach of duty might occur where a governmental unit fails to warn of a dangerous condition of the <em>roadway </em>surface\u201d and that this statutory duty to repair and maintain the highway is discharged by \u201crepairing the highway or warning motorists using the highway of a dangerous condition of the <em>roadway itself.\" Ante </em>at 626, 628 (emphasis added). She later concludes that there was no point of hazard in this case, except from the design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>defect, because the alleged dangers did \u201cnot constitute a hazardous condition of the roadway surface as a result of <em>improper maintenance of the roadway surface itself.\" Ante </em>at 632 (emphasis added). This analysis appears to recognize the same standard I have identified, although Justice Boyle applies it differently for the design defect claim. Justice Boyle does not explain why the allegation that the road commission failed to properly design the intersection indicates that there is a defect in the <em>roadbed surface.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\"> In fact, Chief Justice Cavanagh himself appeared to recognize this point in his concurring opinion in <em>Chaney, supra </em>at 178. In that case, Justice Brickley wrote the lead opinion and offered a very similar interpretation of the highway exception as Justice Cavanagh does in the present case. Justice Brickley concluded that MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102) \u201cencompasses (1) installations physically located within that traveled or paved portion of a highway designed for vehicular travel, or (2) <em>some installations, </em>even those physically located beyond the traveled or paved portion of a highway, <em>that directly and integrally affect safe vehicular travel on this improved portion.\u201d Chaney, supra </em>at 158 (emphasis added). Cf. Justice Cavanagh\u2019s definition of \u201cpoint of hazard,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 623. In response to Justice Brickley\u2019s interpretation, Justice Cavanagh concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Justice Brickley\u2019s interpretation does not provide a standard with which to guide both the bench and bar. The test is vulnerable to endless interpretation, encouraging recurrent appellate litigation. <em>[Chaney, supra </em>at 178.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b766-5\"> In a concurring opinion in Scheurman, <em>supra </em>at 637, Justice Boyle <em>\u201cjoin[ed] in both the rationale and result\u201d </em>of this opinion with the understanding that</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">it does not preclude the application of [the statute] in cases alleging a failure to \u201crepair and maintain\u201d installations that are integral to, if not part of, the \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel,\u201d such as traffic lights and signs. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>There is no dispute in the present case that the Gratiot County Road Commission had not placed any signs at this intersection. Thus, there were no existing signs to \u201crepair and maintain.\u201d See also <em>Chaney, supra </em>at 152-153, 176-177 (Boyle, J., concurring) (\u201cThe plaintiffs claim is barred by governmental immunity because he does not allege a failure to repair and maintain the paved surface of the roadway or a traffic sign or signal,\u201d even though the plaintiff alleged that the transportation department \u201cfailed to provide adequate warnings of dangers on the entrance ramp\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b767-14\"> As the majority notes, this Court did state in <em>Mason, supra </em>at 135 that \u201c[t]he highway exception abrogates governmental immunity except [sic] at \u2018points of special danger to motorists. . . <em>Grof v Michigan, </em>126 Mich App 427, 434; 337 NW2d 345 (1983); <em>Comerica Bank of Kalamazoo v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>168 Mich App 84, 86; 424 NW2d 2 (1987).\u201d However, this statement from <em>Mason </em>does not, by itself, indicate that the Court departed from the plain meaning of the highway exception statute. Rather, the Court employed the phrase \u201cpoints of special danger to motorists\u201d in order to emphasize that the highway exception statute was intended to protect <em>motorists </em>and not <em>pedestrians, </em>the pivotal point of that case. This Court did not hold that there was a duty to post signs for dangers that do not arise from the physical roadbed itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals cases cited in <em>Mason </em>did state that the statute created a duty to post signs even where the state and road commission had kept the road surface in reasonable repair. See <em>Comerica, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number><em>supra </em>at 86-87 (inadequate signage at intersection); <em>Grof, supra </em>at 434-435 (inadequate signage at intersection). This conclusion conflicts with the limitations placed in the statute by the Legislature. Consequently, I would overrule these cases insofar as they hold that the statute creates a more burdensome duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In other cases, the Court of Appeals has previously reached the conclusion, I believe erroneously, that the public highway exception created a duty to ensure that the road was reasonably safe even if there was no disrepair in the roadbed. See, e.g., <em>Hutchinson v Allegan Co Bd of Rd Comm\u2019rs (On Remand), </em>192 Mich App 472, 479-480; 481 NW2d 807 (1992) (failure to place guardrail to protect drivers from adjacent ditch); <em>Hall v State Hwys Dep\u2019t, </em>109 Mich App 592, 602-603; 311 NW2d 813 (1981) (failure to properly design a median guardrail); <em>Bennett v City of Lansing, </em>52 Mich App 289, 294-295; 217 NW2d 54 (1974) (failure to repair malfunctioning traffic control light); <em>Lynes v St Joseph Co Rd Comm, </em>29 Mich App 51, 54-58; 185 NW2d 111 (1970) (inadequate signage). But see <em>Alpert v Ann Arbor, </em>172 Mich App 223, 230; 431 NW2d 467 (1988); <em>Zyskowski v Habelmann (On Remand), </em>169 Mich App 98, 103; 425 NW2d 711 (1988) (\u201cThe first sentence . . . suggests that only the physical structure of the road itself was contemplated\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\"> \u201cThe statute does not impose a duty to repair defects in design or construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b772-5\"> Furthermore, before <em>Scheurman, </em>this Court recognized that the highway exception rendered a governmental agency liable for a design or construction defect of a guardrail. See <em>Endykiewicz v State Hwy Comm, </em>414 Mich 377, 380; 324 NW2d 755 (1982); <em>Arnold v State Hwys Dep\u2019t, </em>406 Mich 235, 236; 277 NW2d 627 (1979). I do not believe that this conclusion from these cases remains good law after this Court\u2019s recent ruling in <em>Chaney, supra. </em>Although we issued four opinions among the five justices in the majority, these opinions agreed that the highway exception did not create a duty for the state to properly design and construct the concrete bridge abutment and adjoining guardrail. Rather, we affirmed the Court of Appeals decision upholding the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of the Department of Transportation where the plaintiff\u2019s injuries arose from an allegedly defective guardrail. See <em>Chaney, supra </em>at 161-162 (Brickley, J.), 167-168 (Riley, J., joined by Griffin, J.), 171 (Boyle, J.), 177 (Cavanagh, C.J., joining the opinion of Riley, J.). Thus, <em>Endykiewicz </em>and <em>Arnold </em>were effectively overruled on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b773-6\"> Act 244 provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">[Section 1.] That <em>any person or persons sustaining bodily injury </em>upon any of the public highways or streets in this state, <em>by reason of neglect to keep such public highways or streets, and all bridges, crosswalks and culverts on the same in good repair, and in a condition reasonably safe and fit for travel, </em>by the township, village, city, or corporation whose corporate authority extends over such public highway, street, bridge, crosswalk or culvert, and whose duty it is to keep the same in good repair, such township, village, city, or corporation shall be liable to, and shall pay to the person or persons so injured or disabled, just damages, to be recovered in an action of trespass on the case, before any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">[Section 4.] <em>It is hereby made the duty of townships, villages, cities, or corporations to keep in good repair, so that they shall be safe and convenient for public travel at all times, </em>all public highways, streets, bridges, crosswalks, and culverts that are within their jurisdiction and under their care and control, and which are open to public travel.
