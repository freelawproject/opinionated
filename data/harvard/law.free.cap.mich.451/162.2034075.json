Title to this warehouse complex had vested in the State of Michigan because of unpaid taxes. Before the fire, the city had begun taking steps to have the buildings condemned and demolished.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Continental and its insurer filed a tort action for property damage against the city on a theory of trespass-nuisance. The jury entered a verdict of $2,986,000 in favor of plaintiffs. The Court of Appeals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> affirmed the award. This Court then granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">This Court has recognized a limited trespass-nuisance exception to governmental immunity. Trespass-nuisance is \u201cdefined as trespass or interference with the use or enjoyment of land caused by a physical intrusion that is set in motion by the government or its agents and resulting in personal or property damage.\u201d To establish trespass-nuisance the plaintiff must show \u201ccondition (nuisance or trespass); cause (physical intrusion); and causation or control (by government).\u201d <em>Hadfield v Oakland Co Drain Comm\u2019r, </em>430 Mich 139, 169; 422 NW2d 205 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Two elements, condition and cause, have been established. See <em>Buckeye Union Fire Ins Co v Michigan, </em>383 Mich 630; 178 NW2d 476 (1970). Thus, the only question before us is whether plaintiffs established control of the warehouses<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by the city. The Court of Appeals found that the evidence was \u201csufficient to allow a jury to determine defendant possessed the requisite \u2018control\u2019 over the premises such that defendant could be found liable for failing to abate the nuisance.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of control is twofold. First, plaintiffs allege that the city \u201cas a matter of reality\u201d was the owner of the property. Second, plaintiffs contend that the city was in control of the warehouses by virtue of its efforts to have the buildings demolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 first theory of control<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because the city was not \u201cas a matter of reality\u201d the owner of the property. The record owners of the warehouse complex located at 2915 West Hancock Street were Clara K. Berger, A. Victor Bizer, and Samuel Berger, cotrustees (hereafter the Bergers). The Bergers apparently abandoned their property sometime in the early 1980\u2019s. Because the Wayne County 1982 taxes were not paid, the property was offered at the annual county tax sale on May 7, 1985.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The property was neither purchased nor redeemed. Therefore, title automatically vested in the state on May 6, 1986, subject to an additional six-month redemption period<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the procedures set forth in <em>Dow v </em>Michigan, 396 Mich 192; 240 NW2d 450 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">On November 12, 1986, the City of Detroit filed an application for conveyance of all properties located in the city that the state had acquired during the year. On January 13, 1987, the state\u2019s deed to the property was recorded. The fire giving rise to this lawsuit occurred on March 12, 1987. On December 26, 1987, the state conducted the due process hearing required by <em>Dow v Michigan, </em>which extinguished any other person\u2019s prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>erty rights in the warehouse complex. On April 1, 1988, the state conveyed title to the property to the City of Detroit.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Michigan\u2019s Legislature has provided detailed requirements for transfer of real property,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> none of which took place before the fire. Despite plaintiffs\u2019 contention that at the time of the fire \u201call that remained was the paperwork\u201d to effect a transfer of title to the city from the state, this Court will not accept plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to overturn centuries of certainty in real estate transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Having rejected plaintiffs\u2019 first theory of control, we now evaluate plaintiffs\u2019 second theory of control. We hold that plaintiff did not establish control by pointing to the city\u2019s efforts to have the buildings demolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 387, p 297 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">\u25a0 An independent contractor or servant to whom the owner or possessor of land turns over the entire charge of the land is subject to the same liability for harm caused to others, upon or outside of the land, by his failure to exercise reasonable care to maintain the land in safe repair as though he were the possessor of the land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">We hold that it is this level of absolute control that the city must exercise in order to be liable under a theory of trespass-nuisance for property it does not own or possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">On August 8, 1986, the city inspected the property and found that the property contained buildings that were in a dangerous and dilapidated condition. On October 10, 1986, the city issued a dangerous-building notice to the Bergers. On October 30, 1986, an administrative hearing was held, and the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>officer recommended that the Detroit City Council order demolition of the buildings. On December 4, 1986, the city council directed the Bergers to demolish the buildings and directed the city engineering department to let a contract for demolition. The city was in the process of bidding when the fire occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Plaintiffs rely on <em>Oxenrider v </em>Gvoic, 340 Mich 591; 66 NW2d 80 (1954), to say that these actions show the city had taken complete control of the abandoned warehouses. In Oxenrider, the plaintiffs adjacent building was damaged when the building owned by the defendant collapsed. This Court found that the owner of the building was not liable for damages caused by the building\u2019s collapse because the city had taken complete control of the building. In <em>Oxenrider, supra </em>at 596-597, this Court found the key issue was \u201cwhether defendant was so excluded from possession and control of her property by the action of the city as to relieve her from legal obligation to demolish in whole or in part the dangerous structure.\u201d \u201c \u2018The city had erected a bridge over the sidewalk, had taken out a building permit in its own name, had officially recognized the danger and had negotiated with a licensed wrecking company to the point of accepting its bid and authorizing a contract.\u2019 \u201d It is significant that in <em>Oxenrider </em>the owner was legally prevented from repairing her building or correcting its dangerous condition. In the instant case the city ordinances do not so restrict the owner. <em>Oxenrider </em>did not hold that the city was in control of the property, only that the owner was relieved of liability because she was not in control of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The circumstances in <em>Hadfield v Oakland Co Drain Comm\u2019r, supra, </em>are also strikingly different from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>case before us. In both the Hadfield,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and McCaul<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> cases, a situation was presented where the governmental authority had specifically designed and built a facility to serve a purpose for the government and the individuals of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In this case, the city simply did not use the property. At no point did the city lease the property, collect rents, exclude people from the property, or invite them onto it. Nor did the city in any way prevent the owner from making any legal use of the property. As a result, we find that the city had not taken control of the buildings to the exclusion of all others. Therefore, liability should not be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Our resolution on this key issue makes it unnecessary to address the other issues raised by appellant. We reverse and remand this suit to the trial court for entry of the appropriate order of dismissal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b292-7\">Brickley, C.J., and Boyle and Riley, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-12\"> Although the city did not have title to these buildings at the time of the fire, it did obtain ownership of them over a year later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\"> The city was acting under the authority found in Detroit Ordinance 290-H.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\"> 205 Mich App 404; 521 NW2d 844 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\"> 448 Mich 930 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\"><em> </em>Plaintiffs have never contended that defendant caused the fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b288-11\"> <em>Id. </em>at 410.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\"> Control may be found where the defendant creates the nuisance, owns or controls the property from which the nuisance arose, or employs another to do work that he knows is likely to create a nuisance.

Consequently, I would affirm the Court of Appeals conclusion that the evidence presented was \u201csufficient to allow a jury to determine defendant possessed the requisite \u2018control\u2019 over the premises such that defendant could be found liable for failing to abate the nuisance.\u201d 205 Mich App 404, 410; 521 NW2d 844 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Michigan law provides that a municipal government is immune from tort liability when engaged in a governmental function.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, this grant of immunity is not absolute. Thus, the judiciary recognizes an excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>tion to the general rule of tort immunity for trespass-nuisance actions. See, e.g., <em>Peterman v Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>446 Mich 177, 204-205; 521 NW2d 499 (1994) (\u201c \u2018It is well settled that a municipality has no more right to invade or cause the invasion of private property than an individual.\u2019 . . . The government, therefore, \u2018cannot excuse its tortious taking of private property by invoking the shibboleth of governmental function\u2019 \u201d). See also <em>Hadfield v Oakland Co Drain Comm\u2019r, </em>430 Mich 139; 422 NW2d 205 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">To succeed under the trespass-nuisance exception, a plaintiff must show \u201ccondition (nuisance or trespass); cause (physical intrusion); and causation or control (by government).\u201d <em>Hadfield, supra </em>at 169. Causation or control, in turn, exists if the governmental entity has \u201ceither created the nuisance, owns or controls the property from which the nuisance arose, or employed another that it knows is likely to create a nuisance.\u201d <em>Kuriakuz v West Bloomfield Twp, </em>196 Mich App 175, 177; 492 NW2d 757 (1992). There is no dispute that the condition and cause elements are satisfied in this case. This case turns on a determination whether the city sufficiently controlled the Hancock property so that liability could attach under a trespass-nuisance theory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">As an initial matter, while I do not endorse the majority\u2019s definition of control, I believe that the facts in the instant case would support a finding of control by the city even under that definition. Citing 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 387, p 297, the majority indicates that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>party takes control of property and is therefore subject to liability as though a possessor, at the point \u201cthe owner or possessor of land turns over the entire charge of the land\u201d to the third party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In this case, there was no neat, formal agreement that transferred control of the Hancock property from the Bergers to the city. Nevertheless, I believe that the actions of the Bergers and the city effected every bit as much of a transfer of control as if they had mutually agreed on a transfer of control of the Hancock property to the city for purposes of demolition. The facts adequately justify the conclusion that the Bergers abandoned the property, effectively relinquishing all control over the property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To complete the \u201ctransfer\u201d of control, the city stepped in and undertook all steps necessary to permit it to demolish the warehouse complex and thereby accepted control over these abandoned premises.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Effectively, as of the date of the city demolition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>order, December 4, 1986, the city had the power to enter the property and destroy the warehouses. As a result, I believe that even under the majority\u2019s rule, there was, in effect, a transfer of control to the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>In any event, I believe the majority construes the term \u201ccontrol\u201d too narrowly. The majority would require that, before control could exist, the city would have to make some positive use of the land. Thus, the majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">In this case, the city simply did not use the property. At no point did the city lease the property, collect rents, exclude people from the property, or invite them onto it. Nor did the city in any way prevent the owner from making any legal use of the property. As a result, we find that the city had not taken control of the buildings to the exclusion of all others.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">While the uses listed by the majority may evidence control, I believe that they do not represent the only uses that can evidence control on the part of the city. Indeed, the uses cited by the majority conveniently ignore the very nature of the Hancock property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, I believe that given the facts in this case, once the city completed all the steps necessary to undertake demolition of the property, the jury could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>reasonably find that the city possessed sufficient control over the property for liability to attach under the trespass-nuisance exception to governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">I believe that the result I reach is supported by the only previous case in which this Court considered the scope of the term control with respect to a municipality, albeit indirectly, for purposes of the trespass-nuisance exception. <em>Oxenrider v Gvoic, </em>340 Mich 591; 66 NW2d 80 (1954).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Oxenrider, </em>the plaintiff sued a private landowner in a nuisance action for damage caused to his property from the collapse of the landowner\u2019s neighboring buildings. The defendant landowner owned a series of old buildings that the city building department found to contain serious structural defects. After unsuccessfully directing the landowner to repair the structural defects, the city voted by resolution to demolish the buildings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, the Department of Public Works was directed by a city resolution to take immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ate action to dismantle the upper portions of the defendant\u2019s buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">One month later, the department notified the tenants to vacate the buildings. A month after that, the department had completed all the administrative steps necessary to demolish the buildings. On a determination that outside professional help was needed, the city solicited bids from private demolition crews. The city authorized a contract with one of the demolition crews, but no contract was signed with any of the crews. Approximately one week later, the buildings completely collapsed causing damage to the plaintiff\u2019s neighboring property.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In <em>Oxenrider, </em>this Court framed the issue as \u201cwhether defendant was so excluded from possession and control of her property by the action of the city as to reheve her from legal obligation to demolish in whole or in part the dangerous structure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596. This Court placed significance in the fact that the city resolved to demolish the buildings. <em>Id. </em>at 601. It reasoned that because of the city\u2019s actions toward the property, \u201cthe defendant had a right to assume that the building was going to be demolished under and by virtue of the authority of the city.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In <em>Oxenrider, </em>this Court plainly stated that the building on the property was \u201ceither in the control of defendant or the city of Detroit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court then held that the landowner was not in control of the property, from which one can only infer that the city controlled the property.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, this Court stated that the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>owner was not liable for a nuisance on its property because the property, \u201cinsofar as its demolition was concerned, was in the control of the city.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">I find that the facts in the instant matter nearly overlap those in <em>Oxenrider. </em>In the instant case, as in <em>Oxen-</em>rider, the city became aware of and inspected the vacant Hancock buildings. In both cases, the city posted multiple notices on the buildings instructing the landowner either to secure or demolish the dangerous buildings. In Oxenrider, the landowner did not sufficiently repair the buildings, so the city undertook administrative proceedings on its own initiative that permitted it to demolish the buildings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the instant case, no action was taken by the landowners or their agents, so the city also obtained a demolition resolution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The city indicated its intent to take legal control of the Hancock property by issuing a lis pendens.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After a city resolution authorizing demolition was obtained, the engineering department surveyed the Hancock property to estimate the demolition costs. As in <em>Oxenrider, </em>the city solicited bids to demolish the Hancock property from demolition crews to demolish the buildings, but had not yet signed a demolition contract.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As in <em>Oxen-rider, </em>the city had the authority to demolish under a city ordinance, having successfully completed all administrative requirements necessary to demolish the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The majority attempts to distinguish <em>Oxenrider </em>in part because there the landowner was \u201clegally prevented from repairing her building or correcting its dangerous condition . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This effort fails, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>because unlike <em>Oxenrider, </em>the owner in the instant matter was, for all practical purposes, nonexistent. Given a completely absent owner, the city stepped in and took control of the Hancock property by way of its demolition powers. At that point, a jury could reasonably conclude that the city had control over the property for purposes of demolition.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">As in <em>Oxenrider, </em>the city in the instant case had taken all the necessary steps and had the authority to initiate demolition proceedings on the property at any time. The city had completed all necessary administrative hearing and notice procedures, and the city council had voted by resolution to demolish the building.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At this point, authority over the property transferred to the city engineering department, the department in charge of demolition. The deputy director of the city engineering department testified that when the property came to his department for demolition, the private owner was no longer involved in the property. For these reasons, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>believe that the instant case is substantially similar to <em>Oxenrider.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Consequently, given this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Oxenrider, </em>I believe that a jury may reasonably conclude that the facts in this case support a finding that the city had sufficient control for purposes of trespass-nuisance liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">I believe that public policy further justifies the result I would reach in this matter. It is important, especially in an urban setting such as Detroit, that someone be held responsible for every piece of real estate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">\u201cPublic policy in a civilized community requires that there be someone to be held responsible for a private nuisance on each piece of real estate, and, particularly in an urban area, that there be no oases of nonliability where a private nuisance may be maintained with impunity.\u201d <em>[Buckeye Union Fire Ins Co v Michigan, </em>383 Mich 630, 643-644; 178 NW2d 476 (1970), quoting <em>Kurtigian v City of Worcester, </em>348 Mass 284, 291; 203 NE2d 692 (1965).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Given the amount of abandoned property in Detroit, we should avoid creating oases of nonliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">In the case of abandoned property, liability for nuisance should lie with the private owner of the property, absent sufficient evidence of control by a third party.

The city began the administrative process for demolition on August 8, 1986, with the initial inspection of the Hancock property. The Bergers did not respond to any notices to repair or demolish the Hancock property. The Bergers did not attend the first administrative hearing, nor did they attend the city council hearing. The Bergers did not respond to the city council resolution directing them to demolish the Hancock buildings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"> The city initiated the first step in the administrative process when it inspected the property in response to a citizen complaint. This was done on August 8, 1986, by Inspector Polk of the City Building Department. Under city ordinance 290-H, \u00a7 12-11-28.4, Inspector Polk determined that the Hancock premises were dangerous and issued notice to the owner of record to appear at a hearing to show cause why the building should not be demolished or made safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The city initiated the second step when it issued a dangerous building notice to the last owner of record on October 10, 1986. This notice directed the owner to make the necessary repairs and advised of an administrative hearing on October 30, 1986, regarding the status of the property. The owners did not appear or otherwise respond to the notice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>On October 10, 1986, the building department filed a lis pendens to notify interested parties that legal proceedings had been commenced to demolish the Hancock buildings. The department inspected the property on October 30, 1986, to determine if the owners had cured the dangerous condition. The inspection revealed that the buildings were never repaired or barricaded. None of the inspections revealed an immediate danger of failure or collapse that would endanger life; therefore, the department was not authorized to take emergency measures to render the buildings safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The city initiated the third step when it conducted the administrative hearing on October 30, 1986. The hearing officer was required to \u201crender his decision either closing the proceedings or ordering the building or structure to be demolished, repaired or otherwise made safe.\u201d Section 12-11-28.4. The owner, if present at the hearing, had the right to appeal the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the board of appeals. Section 12-11-32.0. If the owner did not appear, or refused to act in accordance with the ruling, the officer was required to file his findings with the city council. Because no owner appeared, the hearing officer recommended that the city council order the demolition of the Hancock property. On November 19, 1986, the department mailed notice to the record owners that demolition was recommended. The department reinspected the property on November 26, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The city initiated the fourth step when it conducted a show-cause hearing before the city council. The owner of record was notified of this hearing and it was published in the Detroit Legal News. A show-cause hearing was conducted before the city council on December 4, 1986. The record owner did not appear, and the council ordered the buildings demolished with costs assessed against the property. The city council resolution and notice directed the record owner of the Hancock property to demolish the buildings. It also directed the city engineering department to proceed with demolition.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">After the completion of these four administrative steps, the evidence indicates that the city engineering department had the power to demolish the buildings without any further council action. The power to demolish remained in control of the engineering department unless and until the property owner regained control by requesting to demolish the property himself. Because the property was abandoned by the private owner, was in the hands of the state, and the city had applied to acquire it, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that there was no chance that the owner would return to demolish the property and that, effectively, the city assumed control of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\"> <em>Ante </em>at 168.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> Most of the activities listed by the majority would never occur on the abandoned piece of property that exists in this case. There was nothing to lease but a vacant fire trap. The fact that the property could not be sold through a tax sale, but rather escheated to the state, suggests that there were no rents to be derived from this property. There was no positive use that anyone could make of this dangerous string of warehouses. It is true that the city did not attempt to exclude anyone from the property. It is equally true, however, that this is precisely what the city should have done to avoid the disaster that initiated this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Furthermore, I find that the city did, in fact, invite others onto the property through the solicitation of bids for demolition work. The city had every legal right to solicit such bids and had every intention of following through and engaging a demolition contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">As a final matter, I find a lack of significance in the fact that the city did not prevent the owner from making legal use of the property because, as a practical matter, a jury could conclude there was no owner in this case. See part n.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\"> I agree with the majority that <em>Hadfield v Oakland Co Drain Comm\u2019r </em>and its companion case <em>McCaul v Lake Odessa Village, </em>do not assist the Court in its determination whether control exists for purposes of the trespass-nuisance exception under the instant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">In <em>Hadfield, </em>this Court found an actionable trespass-nuisance because \u201c[t]he interference was a physical intrusion onto private property that was <em>caused </em>by the county drain commissioner\u2019s actions or failure to act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184 (emphasis added). Because the Court found that the municipality \u201ccaused\u201d the nuisance, it did not need to determine if the government otherwise \u201ccontrolled\u201d the nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">In <em>McCaul, </em>this Court stated, \u201c[w]hether there are sufficient allegations of the existence of a nuisance or of defendant\u2019s control over the creation of the nuisance are not in dispute here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. All this Court decided was whether the \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 complaint, read as true, states a claim that conforms to the exception\u201d for purposes of overcoming the defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b298-11\"> The owner attempted to repair her buildings, but all her attempts failed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\"> While it is true, as the majority points out, that this Court in <em>Oxen-rider </em>did not directly hold that the city was in control of the property, it is also true that the city\u2019s liability was not at issue in that case. Given that this Court stated that either the city or the private owner had control, and given that this Court found the private owner not liable, I am certain that, had the city\u2019s control been at issue, this Court would have found that such -control existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b300-5\"> I do not find significance in the fact that the city in <em>Oxenrider </em>\u201cerected a bridge <em>over the sidewalk in front </em>of defendant\u2019s building for the protection of pedestrians\u201d since the sidewalk was owned by the city. <em>Id. </em>at 594 (emphasis added). Nor do I see this as a determinative factor in the <em>Oxenrider </em>holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\"> The City of Detroit had the authority to destroy dangerous buildings under Detroit Ordinance 290-H. This ordinance provides procedures to undertake demolition proceedings by city council resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Resolved.

And that says that the City has taken some action legally with respect to that property. They\u2019ve taken some legal control over it?</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\"><em>A. </em>That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\"><em>Q. </em>And in this case the legal control over the property was that the City has notified the owners that it was going to proceed with demolition?</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\"><em>A. </em>Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\"><em>Q. </em>Is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\"><em>A. </em>That is correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b301-14\"> The majority assigns weight to the fact that the city had authorized a contract with the contractor who presented the lowest bid. Again, I do not see this as determinative, because the city engineering department had full authority to demolish upon completion of the four administrative steps. See n 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b301-15\"> It is unclear from the <em>Oxenrider </em>opinion why the property owner was prevented from demolishing her property on her own. However, given her previous history of poor compliance with the city\u2019s directives to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>repair her unsafe property, one can only speculate that the city had concern with the owner\u2019s ability to properly demolish the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In the instant case, even if the owner had appeared, the city had authority equivalent to that of the city in <em>Oxenrider, </em>e.g., the testimony of Ronald Hamilton, supervisor of the dangerous buildings unit, suggests that the city could have prevented the owner from taking over demolition upon a finding by the city that the owner was incapable of making the property safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Furthermore, I find the ability of the owner to repair is insignificant because even the majority\u2019s rule based on the 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 387, does not require an absolute and irrevocable grant of control.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> This concept is further strengthened under the facts of this case because the city had affirmatively applied for, and was in the process of obtaining, title to the Hancock property. Furthermore, the testimony at trial indicated that property not sold at a tax sale is available to the city. It does not appear that the state ever rejects the city\u2019s request for transfer of title of abandoned property. Coincidentally, the city obtained title to the property sometime after the fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\"> See n 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
