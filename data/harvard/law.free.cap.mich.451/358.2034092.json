We hold that the trial court properly found that plaintiff had failed to sufficiently support a prima facie case of hostile work environment with documentary evidence and therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, which upheld the findings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Plaintiff Elena Quinto was employed by defendant Cross and Peters Company, the maker of Better Made Potato Chips, for eighteen years. Plaintiffs first amended complaint sought judgment against Cross and Peters and John Kujawski, alleging that during four years at Cross and Peters, Kujawski, her supervisor, \u201cdemeaned and humiliated\u201d and made \u201cdiscriminatory decisions\u201d concerning her that created a hostile work environment on the basis of her age, sex, and national origin. The complaint further alleged that, on one occasion, after a co-worker made obscene gestures, Kujawski asked her what happened \u201cin a demeaning manner\u201d and pushed her. Plaintiff was sixty years old and held the position of potato chip inspector when she left defendant\u2019s employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Plaintiff filed a two-count complaint against Cross and Peters and Kujawski.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In her first count, she alleged an assault and battery by Kujawski. The second count alleged that defendant created a hostile work environment by demeaning and humiliating her in violation of the Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.\\ </em>MSA 3.548(101) <em>et seq. </em>Summary disposition was requested on behalf of both Cross and Peters and Kujawski on both counts. The trial judge stated that the two dispositive questions were whether plaintiff\u2019s intentional tort claim was barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, MCL 418.131; MSA 17.237(131), and whether plaintiff had established a prima facie case of age, sex; or national origin discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The trial court ultimately held that no intentional tort existed to take count I, plaintiffs assault and battery claim against defendant Cross and Peters, outside the worker\u2019s compensation act because \u201c[t]he evidence . . . does not establish that Defendant, Cross and Peters, her employer, had actual knowledge that any injury was certain to occur . . . Summary disposition was denied with respect to Kujawski. Regarding count n, the discrimination claim, the trial court found that, accepting plaintiff\u2019s allegations of harassment as true, there were no specific facts in plaintiff\u2019s affidavit sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a question of fact regarding Cross and Peters\u2019 creation of a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court in an unpublished memorandum opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff appealed to this Court. We granted leave, limited to the issue whether the trial court erred in granting summary disposition on plaintiff\u2019s claim of discrimination under the Civil Rights Act with regard to Cross and Peters. 448 Mich 868 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">MCR 2.116 is modeled in part on Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As pointed out by Justice Brennan in <em>Celotex v Catrett, </em>477 US 317; 106 S Ct 2548; 91 L Ed 2d 265 (1986), the initial burden of production is on the moving party, and the moving party may satisfy the burden in one of two ways.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>First, the moving party may submit affirmative evidence that negates an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim. Second,, the moving party may demonstrate to the court that the nonmoving party\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim. If the nonmoving party cannot muster sufficient evidence to make out its claim, a trial would be useless and the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. [477 US 331 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In reviewing a motion for summary disposition brought under MCR 2.116(C)(10), a trial court considers affidavits, pleadings, depositions, admissions, and documentary evidence filed in the action or submitted by the parties, MCR 2.116(G)(5), in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. A trial court may grant a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10) if the affidavits or other documentary evidence show that there is no genuine issue in respect to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. MCR 2.116(C)(10), (G)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In presenting a motion for summary disposition, the moving party has the initial burden of supporting its position by affidavits, depositions, admissions, or other documentary evidence. <em>Neubacher v Globe Furniture Rentals, </em>205 Mich App 418, 420; 522 NW2d 335 (1994). The burden then shifts to the opposing party to establish that a genuine issue of disputed fact exists. <em>Id. </em>Where the burden of proof at trial on a dis-positive issue rests on a nonmoving party, the non-moving party may not rely on mere allegations or denials in pleadings, but must go beyond the pleadings to set forth specific facts showing that a genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>McCart v J Walter Thompson, </em>437 Mich 109, 115; 469 NW2d 284 (1991). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>If the opposing party fails to present documentary evidence establishing the existence of a material factual dispute, the motion is properly granted. <em>McCormic v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>202 Mich App 233, 237; 507 NW2d 741 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Plaintiff alleged that her supervisor, John Kujawski, created a hostile work environment contrary to the Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.] </em>MSA 3.548(101) <em>et seq., </em>by \u201ccontinually\u201d demeaning her in front of coemployees. Although the main thrust of defendant\u2019s initial motion was the exclusive remedy issue, defendant also briefly addressed the hostile work environment claim. Plaintiff\u2019s brief in reply responded to defendant\u2019s claim that summary disposition should be granted in respect to the discrimination claim. Defendant\u2019s responsive brief asserted that plaintiff had failed to provide specific facts to support allegations of discriminatory treatment. It referenced exhibits, attached deposition testimony<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and other evidence that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">refutes Plaintiff\u2019s claims of alleged discrimination by Defendant Kujawsld resulting in the creation of a hostile working environment. Plaintiff has come forth with no evidence to establish a genuine issue of factual dispute; therefore, Defendant\u2019s motion for Summary Disposition should be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Whatever the procedural peculiarities of the prior pleading and responses, it is clear that at the time of hearing on November 1, 1991, the parties knew that the civil rights claim was in issue. After the hearing and before the decision, plaintiff filed a reply brief and an affidavit in support, disputing the credibility of the deposition testimony regarding whether Ms. Quinto had been pushed by her supervisor. The affidavit<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> also contained allegations regarding plaintiffs discrimination claim, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>9. . . . [M]y supervisor, John Kujawski, had continually harassed me by demeaning and humiliating me in front of fellow employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">10. His conduct included comments regarding my age, my sex, my national origin and my ability to speak English.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">11. That all of these incidents took place while I was at work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">12. That I reported these incidents to my superiors at work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Thus, the narrow issue before us is whether the affidavit raised a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The trial court concluded that plaintiff failed to present specific facts to support a prima facie case of discrimination. In particular, it found that plaintiffs allegations, taken as true, did not \u201crise to the level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>severity necessary to sustain an actionable claim of hostile environment discrimination\u201d against Cross and Peters. The Court of Appeals agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">We have not had occasion to address whether a claim of discrimination based on hostile environment, when the allegations of discrimination involve conduct or communication that is not \u201cof a sexual nature,\u201d is encompassed by the Civil Rights Act. MCL 37.2103(i)(iii); MSA 3.548(103)(i)(iii); <em>Radtke v Everett, </em>442 Mich 368; 501 NW2d 155 (1993). Nor do we decide that issue today.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, we assume without deciding that plaintiff is within the class protected and that a hostile environment claim may be maintained on conduct involving a plaintiffs gender, age, or national origin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In <em>Radtke, supra </em>at 382-383, we set forth the five elements necessary to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on hostile work environment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">(1) the employee belonged to a protected group; (2) the employee was subjected to communication or conduct on the basis of [her protected status]; (3) the employee was subjected to unwelcome . . . conduct or communication [involving her protected status]; (4) the unwelcome . . . conduct was intended to or in fact did substantially interfere with the employee\u2019s employment or created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>(5) respondeat superior. MCL 37.2103(h); 37.2202(l)(a); MSA 3.548(103)(h); 3.548(202)(l)(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Our review centers on the third and fourth elements \u2014 whether Kujawski\u2019s actions involved conduct or communication involving her protected status, and whether the conduct toward plaintiff was intended to, or in fact did, substantially interfere with her employment or created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. Under <em>Radtke, </em>whether a hostile work environment was created by the unwelcome conduct \u201cshall be determined by whether a reasonable person, in the totality of circumstances, would have perceived the conduct at issue as substantially interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s employment or having the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive employment environment.\u201d 442 Mich 394. Consequently, to survive summary disposition, plaintiff had to present documentary evidence to the trial court that a genuine issue existed regarding whether a reasonable person would find that, in the totality of circumstances, Kujawski\u2019s comments to plaintiff were sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">There is no serious claim that plaintiff was not on notice of the need to respond to the (C)(10) motion with regard to count H or that the motion was prematurely filed or prematurely granted. Despite plaintiffs burden to respond with \u201cspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial,\u201d MCR 2.116(G)(4), plaintiff responded with conclusory allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">At the stage where all that was before the court with respect to count n was the deposition testimony and the affidavit of the plaintiff, the only evidence of record supporting the plaintiffs claim of discrimination by Cross and Peters was inadequate under this standard. Had plaintiff testified in conclusory form at trial that her supervisor\u2019s conduct was \u201ccontinually\u201d demeaning and humiliating regarding her age, sex, national origin, and ability to speak English, a reasonable jury could not have found from a preponderance of the evidence that the comments were of a type, severity, or duration to have created an objectively hostile work environment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s affidavit disclosed no specific instances of ethnic, sexist, or \u201cageist\u201d remarks hostile to a protected class from which an inference of a hostile work environment could be drawn. It did not describe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>with particularity when, where, or how plaintiff was harassed. Although, as the trial judge recognized, a single act by an employer may so poison the environment as to constitute discrimination, it does not follow that allegations of a push without evidence of conduct or communication violative of the act presents a claim to submit to a jury. Plaintiffs affidavit conclusorily states that Kujawski subjected her to harassing comments regarding her age, sex, national origin, and ability to speak English. As a consequence, the trial court properly found that plaintiff did not establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact on an essential element of her claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In conclusion, we hold that once defendant supported its motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10) with documentary evidence, plaintiff, as the opposing party, had the duty to rebut with documentary evidence defendant\u2019s contention that no genuine issue of material fact existed. Plaintiff\u2019s affidavit did not satisfy her burden as the opposing party; rather, it constituted mere conclusory allegations and was devoid of detail that would permit the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>that there was such conduct or communication of a type or severity that a reasonable person could find that a hostile work environment existed. The Court of Appeals properly affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b496-5\">Brickley, C.J., and Cavanagh, Riley, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> Kujawski is now deceased.

Plaintiff Elena Quinto thus was not obliged under MCR 2.116(G)(4) to file an affidavit setting forth specific facts showing there was a genuine issue for trial. Quinto could properly rest on the allegations in her amended complaint without further elaboration or affidavit because a (C)(10) motion had not been filed, and defendant\u2019s unsworn <em>brief </em>did not constitute an amended or supplemental <em>motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Today\u2019s decision, ruling for Cross and Peters under (C)(10), encourages sloppy practice by defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>and by the circuit court in ruling on (C)(10) motions, and denied Quinto an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Quinto, an elderly woman of Italian descent who speaks only broken English, worked for eighteen years for Cross and Peters, the last four as a potato chip inspector.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She alleges that during those four years, she was demeaned and humiliated by her supervisor John Kujawski. Quinto alleges that Kujawski made a variety of offensive remarks, mostly about her age, national origin, sex, and ability to speak English.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The culmination of Quinto\u2019s problems at Cross and Peters occurred on August 5, 1988, when, Quinto alleges, she and a co-worker argued, and the coworker uttered an obscenity and exposed her buttocks to Quinto. Upset, Quinto reported the incident to senior management. Soon after, Kujawski came over to Quinto\u2019s work station to ask what was going on. Quinto alleges that as Kujawski spoke, he pushed her, causing her to fall and injure herself. This assertion is disputed by other co-workers who said that Quinto was not pushed, but feigned a faint when touched. These witnesses stated that Kujawski actually caught Quinto as she fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The day of this incident was Quinto\u2019s last day at work. Quinto filed worker\u2019s compensation and social security benefits claims. These were followed by a short, voluntary stay, from December 12, 1988 until January 16, 1989, in the Psychiatric Center of Michigan where she was diagnosed as suffering from \u201catypical depression with hypochondriasis and somatization disorder.\u201d Quinto claims that this stay was necessitated by her traumatic experiences at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In August, 1990, Quinto filed this action against Cross and Peters and Kujawski, seeking damages for her physical injuries resulting from the alleged battery, as well as for psychological injuries caused by Cross and Peters\u2019 discriminatory treatment respecting age, sex, and national origin. Kujawski subsequently died, and Quinto dismissed the action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Cross and Peters moved for summary disposition of both the assault and battery and discrimination claims. The motion was granted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. This Court granted leave to appeal limited to whether summary disposition was proper with regard to Quinto\u2019s Civil Rights Act discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">This Court has recognized civil rights causes of action for two types of discrimination. A \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d claim alleges that the victim was denied some privilege of employment given to others because of a particular trait (skin color, gender, or ethnic background). <em>Betty v Brooks &amp; Perkins, </em>446 Mich 270, 281; 521 NW2d 518 (1994). The second claim, the one alleged by Quinto, may be maintained when the employer creates a \u201chostile work environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ment.\u201d <em>Radtke v Everett, </em>442 Mich 368; 501 NW2d 155 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Quinto alleged in her complaint and subsequent affidavit a hostile work environment on the basis of two occurrences. First, that Kujawski, motivated by discriminatory animus, pushed her down, causing her to suffer emotional and physical injuries. Second, Quinto claims that he \u201cdemeaned and humiliated\u201d her during her employment at Cross and Peters with repeated comments regarding her age, sex, and national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Cross and Peters took what can be charitably described as an unorthodox path to the ultimate summary disposition on the merits under subrule (C)(10). Cross and Peters alleged that Quinto could not recover on the civil rights claim because of the exclusive remedy provision of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act. Cross and Peters made <em>no mention </em>of the merits or the factual sufficiency of Quinto\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">After Quinto responded to Cross and Peters\u2019 motion with a brief in opposition, Cross and Peters filed, on October 8, 1991, three weeks before oral argument in the circuit court, a reply brief to Quinto\u2019s response. This second brief went into greater depth than Cross and Peters\u2019 first brief, and adverted to the factual allegations of discrimination made in Quinto\u2019s complaint. While this brief did not explicitly so state, Cross and Peters asserted, during oral argument in this Court, that this unsworn reply brief served as a new motion for summary disposition, Cross and Peters having withdrawn its original motion. A few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>days before oral argument, on October 29, 1991, Quinto filed a second response, which focused on the exclusive remedy and intentional tort issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Oral argument on the summary disposition motion was then held two days later on November 1, 1991. The hearing dealt almost exclusively with the issue originally raised by Cross and Peters, whether, because of the exclusive remedy provision of the worker\u2019s compensation act, the circuit court had jurisdiction to hear Quinto\u2019s claims. The factual context (pushing/fainting) was adverted to but not discussed, except superficially; there was <em>no discussion </em>of Quinto\u2019s claim of offensive remarks concerning sex, age, and national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Nevertheless, although Cross and Peters\u2019 motion for summary disposition did not address the sufficiency of Quinto\u2019s factual allegations, and the hearing focused on the exclusive remedy and intentional tort issues, the circuit court concluded in a written opinion that summary disposition under subrule (C)(10) was proper <em>on the merits </em>of the age, sex, and national origin claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The circuit court\u2019s opinion finding Quinto\u2019s allegations insufficient for want of factual support ignored that MCR 2.116(G)(4) requires Cross and Peters to file, before summary disposition may be granted, a motion \u201cspecifically identifying] the issues as to which the moving party believes there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d Additionally, MCR 2.116(G)(3) requires Cross and Peters\u2019 motion to be supported by \u201c[affidavits, depositions, admissions, or other documentary evidence in support of the grounds asserted . . . .\u201d Cross and Peters failed to satisfy either of these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Putting aside the procedural irregularities in this case, summary disposition was improvidently granted because if one accepts all the facts alleged by Quinto as true, as MCR 2.116(C)(10) mandates, a genuine issue remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The depositions focused almost exclusively on Quinto\u2019s allegation that her supervisor pushed her. There was no focus on Quinto\u2019s allegation that she was verbally harassed.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The circuit court erred in relying on the deposition testimony concerning the pushing/fainting incident. Quinto\u2019s account of factual events must be accepted as true. It is not the function of the circuit judge to weigh credibility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v Vinson, </em>477 US 57, 65; 106 S Ct 2399; 91 L Ed 2d 49 (1986), that \u201cTitle VII affords employees the right to work in an environment free from discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus it appears that while, as the circuit court noted, one or two incidences of name-calling may not be actionable, insults that amount to ridicule and that cause intimidation are. Because in this case, without the benefit of trial testimony, it is impossible to determine whether Quinto\u2019s allegations fall into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>first or second category, summary disposition was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">This Court, in <em>Radtke v Everett, supra </em>at 394, stated that \u201cwhether a hostile work environment exist[s] shall be determined by whether a reasonable person, <em>in the totality of circumstances, </em>would have perceived the conduct at issue as substantially interfering with [Quinto\u2019s] employment or having the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive employment environment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because of the procedural deficiencies, it is difficult to grasp some of the circumstances involved, much less the <em>totality </em>of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Quinto was not required to show before trial to any degree of certainty that her claim would ultimately be successful. Rather, \u201cthe test is \u2018whether the kind of record <em>which might be developed, </em>giving the benefit of reasonable doubt to the opposing party, would leave open an issue upon which reasonable minds might differ.\u2019 \u201d <em>Skinner v Square D Co, </em>445 Mich 153, 162; 516 NW2d 475 (1994) (emphasis added). Although worded without complete specificity, her complaint and affidavits clearly meet this threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Summary disposition may not be granted \u201cwhere the credibility of a witness or deponent is crucial.\u201d <em>Crossley v Allstate Ins Co, </em>139 Mich App 464, 468; 362 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>NW2d 760 (1984), citing <em>Arber v Stahlin, </em>382 Mich 300; 170 NW2d 45 (1969), and <em>Brown v Pointer, </em>390 Mich 346; 212 NW2d 201 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">While a workplace environment characterized by sexual harassment by a supervisor of an employee is clearly intolerable, federal courts have also recognized that harassing behavior is similarly unacceptable when based on ethnicity,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> age,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and gender.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because this is consistent with the goals of the Civil Rights Act, this Court should adopt the approach of these federal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">I turn to a consideration of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">In affirming the summary disposition of Quinto\u2019s hostile work environment claim on the basis that she failed to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact, the majority ignores Cross and Peters\u2019 failure to properly put in issue whether there is a genuine issue of material fact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Cross and Peters\u2019 motion for summary disposition and brief in support argued that Quinto\u2019s \u201csole and exclusive remedy in this matter is recourse to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Department of Labor by way of a worker\u2019s compensation claim.\u201d In neither the motion nor the brief did Cross and Peters challenge the pleading or factual sufficiency of Quinto\u2019s hostile work environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Indeed, the brief in support acknowledged that \u201cthe fact of the allegations [of a hostile working environment and of supervisor Kujawski\u2019s pushing Quinto from the rear causing her to fall] and the denial are <em>irrelevant </em>in light of this Motion.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The majority asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">Although the <em>main </em>thrust of defendant\u2019s <em>initial </em>motion was the exclusive remedy issue, defendant also <em>briefly addressed </em>the hostile work environment claim[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">There are three inaccuracies in the foregoing statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">\u2022 There was not a \u201cmain\u201d and a secondary or lesser thrust; the <em>only </em>thrust of defendants\u2019 motion was the exclusive remedy issue;</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">\u2022 There was not an \u201cinitial\u201d motion and a subsequent motion; there was <em>only </em>one motion;</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">\u2022 The motion did not briefly or otherwise <em>address </em>the hostile work environment claim;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it addressed <em>only </em>the exclusive remedy issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The majority states that Cross and Peters\u2019 reply brief, filed October 8, 1991 \u2014 three weeks before oral argument, over eight months after Quinto\u2019s response and brief had been filed \u2014 \u201casserted that plaintiff had failed to provide specific facts to support allegations of discriminatory treatment. It referenced exhibits, attached deposition testimony and other evidence that [Cross and Peters contends] \u2018refutes Plaintiff\u2019s claims of alleged discrimination by Defendant Kujawski resulting in the creation of a hostile working environment. Plaintiff has come forth with no evidence to establish a genuine issue of factual dispute; therefore, Defendant\u2019s motion for Summary Disposition should be granted.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The foregoing assertions in Cross and Peters\u2019 reply brief are what its counsel, during oral argument in this Court, characterized as a new motion for summaiy disposition, and then represented to this Court that the \u201coriginal\u201d motion for summary disposition had been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>No affidavit of either Cross and Peters\u2019 counsel, Kujawski, or any officer of Cross and Peters was attached to this reply brief, claimed to have constituted a new motion for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The \u201cattached deposition testimony\u201d focused on the pushing/fainting incident and did not otherwise concern Quinto\u2019s age, sex, and national origin, hostile work environment claim. This is understandable because the depositions were taken by Quinto\u2019s lawyer, <em>not </em>Cross and Peters\u2019 lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The questions posed by Quinto\u2019s lawyer appear to have been designed to provide him with background information about Quinto\u2019s last day of work and the potato chip factory and its management system, layout, and employees. The questions focused predominantly on either the pushing/fainting incident or the general work conditions and personnel dynamics in the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Senoia Waters, the co-worker on the potato chip inspection line with Quinto who argued with her, touching off the pushing/fainting incident, testified in response to questions about the events leading up to and after the incident. She was asked a few general questions about how supervisor Kujawski treated employees, and whether he was easy to get along with, but nothing about discriminatory name-calling.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Warner Scott, another co-worker was asked questions similar to those asked Waters concerning what happened on Quinto\u2019s last day of work. Like Waters, Scott was asked whether Kujawski was \u201ctough\u201d or \u201cantagonistic\u201d with Quinto.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Rene Meservey, a machine repairman who had also observed the incident, was the only witness asked directly if there was any prejudice at work. He stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>that only a couple of persons at the company would \u201ccut [someone] down because of their race.\u201d He was not asked who those persons were, nor did he volunteer this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Plant manager George Orris testified that he did not observe the incident. He was not asked any questions about Kujawski\u2019s general demeanor or specific conduct toward Quinto, other than how Kujawski responded when Quinto \u201cfainted.\u201d He said, however, that Kujawski had had \u201cproblems\u201d with Quinto in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Robert Marracino testified briefly, and was not asked any questions about Quinto\u2019s and Kujawski\u2019s relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The majority acknowledges the \u201cprocedural peculiarities\u201d of Cross and Peters\u2019 so-called new motion for summary disposition,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but nevertheless concludes that Quinto was \u201con notice of the need to respond to the (C)(10) motion\u201d with regard to her hostile work environment claim, and even asserts that the \u201cnew\u201d motion, which was never filed, was not \u201cprematurely <em>filed.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Manifestly, nothing in the deposition testimony concerning the pushing/fainting incident or in Cross and Peters\u2019 unsworn reply brief, inaccurately characterized as a \u201cnew motion\u201d for summary disposition, put Quinto on notice that she was obliged to come forward with evidence in support of her allegation of a hostile work environment based on remarks concerning her age, national origin, sex, and ability to speak English.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Surely, the moving party, Cross and Peters, cannot demand that the other party, Quinto, come forward with evidence absent the moving party first offering some (any) evidence negating Quinto\u2019s claims concerning remarks about her age, national origin, sex, and ability to speak English. There is <em>nothing </em>in the depositions regarding Quinto\u2019s claims in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">At oral argument in the circuit court on November 1, 1991, Cross and Peters\u2019 counsel argued first that this case is controlled by the exclusive remedy provision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He said there was no question of fact, depositions had been taken, and \u201call of the eye witnesses said exactly the same thing\u201d \u2014 the supervisor \u201cdid not push her.\u201d Cross and Peters\u2019 lawyer argued that there is \u201cno question of fact remaining\u201d because \u201c[everybody said exactly the same thing . . . .\u201d He concluded with the observation that there was no actionable intentional tort because to recover for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>intentional tort there has to be a \u201cspecific intent that the injury alleged occurred; that just isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">He then turned for the first time to speak of the \u201csecond matter that\u2019s addressed in both of the briefs,\u201d the civil-rights-type action, and argued that \u201call through the discovery there were no indications at all that this woman was discriminated against.\u201d The lawyer argued in support <em>only </em>that all the employees were women, that seventy percent were over the age of forty, and that the owners of the defendant are Italian.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The depositions had, as previously observed, focused almost entirely on the pushing/fainting incident on the last day of Quinto\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Quinto was not deposed. This is not a case in which the plaintiff, Quinto, made concessions on deposition that arguably permit framing an issue of law on the basis of Quinto\u2019s admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The circuit court, as well as Quinto, was not on notice that this case was about to be decided on the basis of the merits of the age, sex, and national origin allegations. The court did not have a clue that the real issue in the case \u2014 the issue regarding which this Court granted leave to appeal \u2014 was whether summary disposition should be granted with respect to Quinto\u2019s claim that she had been subjected to a hostile work environment by remarks concerning sex, age, and national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The court said that Cross and Peters\u2019 lawyer was arguing that there was \u201cno <em>assault and </em>battery, based upon the proofs or the discovery.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Quinto\u2019s lawyer responded that Cross and Peters\u2019 lawyer \u201cdid not deem it important to take the deposition testimony of [Quinto] who will, in fact, testify that she was pushed.\u201d The court responded \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure she will. You said it in your complaint and I am sure she will testify to that. What he is saying is that nobody else will. Is that correct?\u201d Quinto\u2019s lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>responded that that created a disputed question of fact.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The court then responded, irrelevantly, \u201cOkay, and when you redeem your [worker\u2019s compensation] case . . . are you getting it for the damages done to her when she was pushed?\u201d Then from the court, \u201cWhat you really have to prove is that there was an intentional tort, right?\u201d And then the court said that any damages for intentional tort that are obtained in compensation cannot be duplicated in this court. Quinto\u2019s lawyer agreed, and the judge said they were all agreed and inquired when the worker\u2019s compensation case would be concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">After all these irrelevancies were concluded, the court talked about scheduling and, again, redemption of the worker\u2019s compensation claim. The court said that it did not think Quinto could keep Cross and Peters in the case even if she might be able to keep Kujawski. The court said that it planned on issuing a written opinion. Quinto\u2019s lawyer inquired whether the court was interested in additional briefing on the issue of keeping Cross and Peters in, to which the judge responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Cross and Peters\u2019 lawyer asked the court whether it wanted the full transcripts of the depositions to which the judge said, <em>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d </em>\u201cOnly the part that deals with <em>this,\u201d </em>adding what she meant by this: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got anything to indicate that there was an <em>intentional tort, you produce it, okay?\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">It is clear that the judge was thinking about dismissing the case because there was no evidence of intentional tort. At no point did she discuss harass-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>merit or Quinto\u2019s civil rights claim. She did not think that Quinto was going to be able to show intentional tort, and that she should not be allowed to recover double damages by redeeming the worker\u2019s compensation claim and maintaining a circuit court action for the same loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">I conclude that neither the circuit court nor Quinto were \u201con notice of the need to respond to the (C)(10) motion with regard to\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the age, sex, national origin, hostile work environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">I recognize that the judge wrote an opinion dismissing the hostile work environment claim. That portion of the opinion is not based on anything set forth in Cross and Peters\u2019 briefs or argued orally at the hearing. The court simply decided to dismiss the case, and did so, and probably was unaware of the grossly inadequate procedural posture of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The majority references statements in Quinto\u2019s briefs, and contends that they indicate that she was on notice of the need to put forth evidence concerning her hostile work environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Quinto filed a short brief after oral argument that focused <em>entirely </em>on the pushing/fainting incident and the testimony of the witnesses in that regard. The brief did <em>not </em>otherwise advert to or argue the hostile work environment claim. Read in the context of that brief, Quinto\u2019s affidavit attached to the brief was <em>not </em>submitted in support of the hostile work environment claim, but rather the assault and battery claim.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>v</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The Court of Appeals should be reversed, and the case remanded for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b513-7\">Weaver, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\"> MCR 2.116(G)(4) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\"><em>A motion under subrule (C)(10) must specifically identify the issues as to which the moving party believes there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.

In Count n, the Plaintiff herein did allege injuries as set forth in paragraph 12 of her Complaint as having been caused by a hostile work environment created by the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">3. That in fact on or about November 2, 1988, the Plaintiff herein, Elaina Quinto, did cause to be filed with the Michigan Department of Labor a worker\u2019s compensation claim alleging the same incident and claiming the same injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">4. That, to the best of the knowledge of your undersigned, said worker\u2019s compensation claim is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">5.

I would only indicate, first of all, to the Court that Cross and Peters stands for Cross Moceri and Peter Cipriano, who are the two Italian gentlemen that founded this country (sic); their children are still in charge of this country (sic). This is an Italian family business.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">There is no \u2014 all through the discovery there were no indications at all that this woman was discriminated against. As a matter of fact, just the opposite was testified to by all of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">The other employees testified that this particular supervisor\u2014 while not a supervisor for four years as is alleged in the complaint but a supervisor for only one year \u2014 was fair, treated everybody exactly the same, was not a hostile person, did not aggravate any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>body; and that, In fact, in this particular incident was attempting to calm Mrs. Quinto down.</p>\n<p id=\"AHV\">The reason given by all of the employees for her hysteria was that it had been a hot day and that\u2019s just the way it is.</p>\n<p id=\"AMB\">So, the discovery shows that there was no discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b511-9\"> See pp 378-379, the text immediately preceding part III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b512-10\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 370.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b512-11\"> Her affidavit, in relevant part, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">3.
