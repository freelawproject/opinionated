MCL 418.301(5)(a); MSA 17.237(301)(5)(a). We conclude that the testi-' mony does not create a bona fide offer of reasonable employment because defendant failed to limit the offer to specific employment that would accommodate the physical limitations the magistrate and the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board found to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">There is no dispute that plaintiff, while serving as a police officer for defendant, suffered a compensable, work-related, back injury during the arrest of an intoxicated individual in June, 1983. From the date of injury until March, 1985, plaintiff sporadically worked light-duty jobs, including a sedentary position with access to a cot that was specifically created for him by the chief of police in December, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s back pain became increasingly severe, and, on the advice of his physician, Dr. Steven Newman, he stopped working on March 8, 1985. Plaintiff was subsequently examined by defendant\u2019s physician, Dr. John Barber, on March 14, 1985. Dr. Barber found no work limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">On the basis of Dr. Barber\u2019s report, the chief of police mailed plaintiff a letter, dated April 3, 1985, indicating that he was to \u201creturn to work with no limitations\u201d and that if he failed to report, his \u201ctime [would] no longer be charged to duty injury.\u201d Rather than returning to work, plaintiff filed a petition for worker\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The matter was heard before a magistrate on February 27, 1986, and April 21, 1986. Medical testimony was presented from the depositions of three physicians,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the record was closed on May 26, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Defendant argued before the magistrate that the April 3, 1985, letter was a bona fide offer of reasonable employment and that benefits should be terminated as of that date because plaintiff had unreasonably refused to accept that offer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 21, 1986, Inspector Dansby and Police Chief Rechlin testified that they never intended that plaintiff return to a regular job without restriction. Chief Rechlin stated that, subject to the city doctor\u2019s recommendation, the job specially created for plaintiff in December, 1984, remained available.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The magistrate concluded that plaintiff was disabled as a result of a back injury \u201carising out of and in the course of employment with this defendant due to the injury of June 7, 1983. He is unable to return to regular work duties as a police officer.\u201d The magistrate further concluded that there was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">no offer of favored work on April 3, 1985 and a reasonable refusal of the plaintiff to return to regular duties at the time. ... If the city offers a job of favored work, they should make it clear that such a job is offered, and not include such an offer in a letter following a paragraph indicating the plaintiff is released by their doctor for unrestricted duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The magistrate also concluded, however, that plaintiff was able to perform the job that had been created for him in December, 1984, which \u201cdefense council [sic] had indicated on the record on February 27, 1986 . . . was available.\u201d Because the job was still available,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">plaintiff should have contacted the defendant to see about this work. Worker\u2019s Compensation benefits will be suspend form [sic] that date based on the indication that the favored work was available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Benefits were awarded from April 2, 1984, to February 27, 1986. Both parties appealed the magistrate\u2019s decision to the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In December, 1990, the wcab affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision, but modified the decision by terminating benefits on April 21, 1986. 1990 WCABO 1515, 1516. Rather than relying on defense counsel\u2019s statement on February 27, 1986, that a favored-work position remained available, the wcab concluded that Chief Rechlin\u2019s testimony on April 21, 1986, established a bona fide offer of reasonable employment. The wcab noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">Chief Rechlin indicated that as of April 21, 1986, the special services job as it previously existed, including cot-resting privileges, remained available to plaintiff. While Dr. Newman\u2019s 1986 testimony indicated that this job still could not be performed if cot-resting were limited to 10 minutes daily, as per his history of the early 1985 experience, we find that defendant then made a bona fide offer of reasonable work. Plaintiff should have then reported to defendant to make a reasonable attempt to perform those duties, as they were then offered by defendant, in the light of the opinions from Drs. Lele and Barber. His failure to do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>entitles defendant to suspend benefits from that date until he makes a good faith attempt to perform those duties within the limitations established by Dr. Newman. [1990 WCABO 1524-1525.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal was denied by the Court of Appeals. Plaintiff appealed to this Court and we remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on leave granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed on remand in an unpublished opinion per curiam, issued December 21, 1993 (Docket No. 150640), and denied rehearing on February 16, 1994. Plaintiff again sought leave to appeal in this Court, and we denied plaintiff\u2019s application on October 25, 1994.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, and we granted leave to appeal on June 23, 1995.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The factual determinations of a court are inherently limited attempts to re-create reality in order to answer real-world questions \u2014 here, the relatively straightforward matter regarding whether there was a specific job within plaintiff\u2019s physical limitations to which he could have returned. At the outset, we note that in this case that attempt has been complicated and frustrated by intransigence and an abysmal lack of communication between plaintiff and defendant. Both parties are to blame: defendant could have more precisely defined the job it was inviting plaintiff to return to, and plaintiff could just as easily have returned to work to learn the nature of the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ruent described and the limitations the city doctor felt were appropriate. Neither option was chosen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The result has been a tortuous nine-year journey through the judicial system. The predictable consequence is an effect on the losing party out of all proportion to the original dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">In 1981, the Legislature codified the judicially created \u201cfavored work\u201d doctrine in the \u201creasonable employment\u201d provisions of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, with numerous changes not relevant to this case. <em>Pulver v Dundee Cement Co, </em>445 Mich 68; 515 NW2d 728 (1994); MCL 418.301; MSA 17.237(301). Like favored work, if a disabled worker unreasonably refuses a \u201cbona fide offer of reasonable employment,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the worker \u201cis no longer entitled to any wage loss benefits . . . during the period of such refusal.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The pertinent issue in this case \u2014 an issue equally relevant under both the favored-work doctrine and the reasonable employment provisions \u2014 is whether defendant made a \u201cbona fide <em>offer </em>of reasonable employment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The WCAB concluded that testimony of Chief Rechlin established a \u201cbona fide offer of reasonable work,\u201d 1990 WCABO 1525, and the Court of Appeals affirmed this conclusion stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">[T]he testimony of two police officials and plaintiffs supervisor on February 27, 1986, and April 21, 1986, that a job in the records department was still available to plaintiff, subject to the city physician\u2019s approval, was competent evidence in the record to support the wcab\u2019s conclusion that the city made an offer of favored work on April 21, 1986. [Slip op at 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Whether defendant made a bona fide offer of favored work is generally a factual issue. Findings of fact by the WCAB are conclusive if supported by any competent evidence. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28; MCL 418.861; MSA 17.237(861); <em>Kostamo v Marquette Iron Mining Co, </em>405 Mich 105, 147; 274 NW2d 411 (1979). However, \u201c[e]rror may be committed by bas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>ing a finding of fact on a misconception of law and by failing to correctly apply the law to the finding of fact.\u201d <em>Braxton v Chevrolet Grey Iron Foundry, </em>396 Mich 685, 692-693; 242 NW2d 420 (1976); <em>Pulver v Dundee Cement Co, supra </em>at 87 (Riley, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">A bona fide offer of reasonable employment must describe with a fair degree of specificity the duties the disabled employee is to perform. <em>Kolenko v United States Rubber Products, Inc, </em>285 Mich 159; 280 NW 148 (1938). Specific employment with established responsibilities within the employee\u2019s limitations must be presented for the employee to accept. A general invitation for a disabled employee to come in, and something will be found is an insufficient offer. <em>Maddox v General Motors Corp, </em>1986 WCABO 578. The offer must be for a \u201cspecific restricted job,\u201d not an \u201cunspecified grouping\u201d of jobs, which may or may not accommodate the employee\u2019s limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Nearly sixty years ago, this Court addressed a case involving facts analogous to this case. In <em>Kolenko, supra, </em>the plaintiff sustained a work-related injury, and the defendant voluntarily paid benefits. Eventually the defendant filed a petition to terminate benefits, contending that the plaintiff failed to cooperate by refusing to accept employment tendered by the defendant. The plaintiff testified that she refused to return to work because the defendant would not explain what her employment responsibilities would be. On appeal, this Court affirmed the Department of Labor and Industry\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to accept unspecified employment did not illustrate such a lack of cooperation that benefits should be forfeited.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Plaintiff was under no obligation to comply with the unreasonable and arbitrary demand of defendant that she accept whatever work the company thought suitable for \u2022her. <em>[Id. </em>at 162.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">When an employer seeks to fulfill its worker\u2019s compensation requirements by offering a disabled employee reasonable employment, it must inform the worker of the \u201ckind of work [the employee] would be expected to do\u201d and \u201cthe nature of the job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161. In short, the employee has a right to know \u201cwhat the job consistfs] of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In this case, both Inspector Dansby and Chief Rechlin testified that, in accordance with city policy, before any police officer could return to work of any nature after a medical leave, the officer had to undergo a medical examination by the city doctor. This requirement applied to all officers who were returning after medical leave, regardless of whether a work-related injury was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Testimony of both Inspector Dansby and Chief Rechlin, however, went beyond merely requiring the city doctor, Dr. Barber, to agree that plaintiff could do the reasonable employment described at trial within the limitations indicated by plaintiff\u2019s physician, Dr. Newman. Plaintiff was not offered a specific job within the limitations described by Dr. Newman, subject to approval by the city physician, but, rather, any work limitations would depend solely on the city doctor\u2019s recommendations. The exact nature of plaintiff\u2019s duties would not be established until after the city doctor examined him.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>After reviewing the testimony before the magistrate, the wcab noted the lack of specificity in the duties plaintiff would be asked to undertake:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">[T]he type of duties to which plaintiff would be assigned ultimately depended on the outcome of any new examination by Dr. Barber, if and when plaintiff reported for work. [1990 WCABO 1522-1523.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">If the city doctor found no work limitation, plaintiff faced the possibility of returning to normal duty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In light of this possibility, we conclude that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>was not offering a specific job within the physical limitations described by Dr. Newman, limitations the magistrate and the wcab concluded were appropriate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, while we accept the wcab\u2019s factual determinations, we conclude as a matter of law that defendant\u2019s testimony does not fulfill the legal requirements of a bona fide offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Testimony that plaintiff\u2019s previous favored-work position was still \u201cavailable\u201d does not create a bona fide offer of reasonable employment in this case because the testimony was equivocal with respect to whether plaintiff would be allowed to return to that specific job. Although the duties associated with this job were described with sufficient specificity, defendant refused to concede that plaintiff would not be required to undertake more strenuous responsibilities, but repetitively reinforced that all limitations might be removed by the city doctor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>plaintiff knew the responsibilities associated with the favored-work position does not mean that that job was being offered for plaintiffs acceptance. See <em>Dixon v General Motors Corp, </em>1989 WCACO 226, 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">We do not decide that the offer is defective because the employer conditioned actual employment upon the approval of a physician. This case is different from one in which an employer invites an employee to return to specific employment within the employee\u2019s limitations, contingent upon approval by the employer\u2019s or the employee\u2019s doctor. In this case, the offer fails because defendant did not definitively offer specific employment within the physical limitations found to exist by the magistrate and WCAB. Defendant essentially offered plaintiff employment with duties ranging from unlimited cot-resting privileges to full patrol responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In an effort to limit defendant\u2019s offer to a job within the limitations described by Dr. Newman, the WCAB engrafted a qualification on the city doctor\u2019s recommendation that is not supported by defendant\u2019s testimony. The WCAB restricted defendant\u2019s job offer by reinstating benefits if defendant assigned plaintiff a more demanding job than that described by Dr. Newman.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">If any other duties than those within Dr. Newman\u2019s restrictions are prescribed for plaintiff after he is reexamined by Dr. Barber in compliance with defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>announced policy in such situations, benefits are to be reinstated. [1990 WCABO 1525.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">This qualification was created solely by the wcab and is not supported by the record.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Absent this limitation, however, we are left with a situation in which defendant invites plaintiff to return to work, announces that a job within plaintiff\u2019s limitations is available, but then concedes that, depending on what defendant\u2019s physician recommends, plaintiff\u2019s ultimate employment duties may be far more demanding than those previously described. We conclude that such an invitation does not rise to the level of specificity necessary to create a bona fide offer of reasonable employment and benefits may not be terminated because plaintiff failed to respond to such an offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-9\">Levin, Cavanagh, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\"> Plaintiff offered the deposition of Dr. Newman, and defendant submitted the depositions of Dr. Barber and Dr. Lele.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\"> See n 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\"> 439 Mich 971 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\"> 447 Mich 995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b458-10\"> 449 Mich 859.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b459-5\"> The unfortunate lack of clarity in the record appears to have been caused by an extraordinary amount of contentiousness between the lawyers. From this vantage point, there is enough blame to go around and that makes this a difficult case to decide, but decide we must. The dissent highlights the strength of defendant\u2019s position, but defendant\u2019s refusal to guarantee that additional duties would not be placed on plaintiff destroys the specificity necessary to create a valid offer. Any ambiguity must be construed in favor of plaintiff because defendant has the burden of proving that it made a bona fide offer of reasonable employment. See <em>Kolenko v United States Rubber Products, Inc, </em>285 Mich 159, 162; 280 NW 148 (1938). Defendant has not carried that burden in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b459-6\"> Reasonable employment is defined as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u201cReasonable employment,\u201d as used in this section, means work that is within the employee\u2019s capacity to perform that poses no clear and proximate threat to that employee\u2019s health and safety, and that is within a reasonable distance from the employee\u2019s residence.

In order to reach this conclusion, the majority looks beyond the actual job that was offered. Because the Court\u2019s decision should be based on the facts established below, it should rely on the offer that the magistrate found, rather than engage in speculation about what other jobs might have existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The Court must determine what constitutes an offer of reasonable employment. The plaintiff cites two cases for the proposition that the offer must sufficiently describe a specific job. In <em>Kolenko v United States Rubber Products, Inc, </em>285 Mich 159; 280 NW 148 (1938), the defendant employer requested that the employee report to its factory, where she would be given a job. The employee went to the defendant\u2019s employment office and asked to be advised of what kind of work she would be expected to do. The defendant refused to tell her and would not permit her attorneys to enter the factory to ascertain what the work would be. The Court found that this did not constitute a bona fide offer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">The burden was on the defendant to show that it offered plaintiff work which she could perform. . . . Plaintiff was under no obligation to comply with the unreasonable and arbitrary demand of defendant that she accept whatever work the company thought suitable for her. [285 Mich 162.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>In <em>Maddox v General Motors Corp, </em>1986 WCABO 578, the WCAB found that the employee had not unreasonably refused to perform favored work. The plaintiff worked in a foundry and was assigned to work as an \u201cextra man\u201d in the light assembly department, where he could potentially participate in approximately seventy jobs as he was needed. On any given day, the employee could be asked to perform any one of the jobs. The decision that this did not constitute a bona fide offer was premised on two conclusions: the plaintiff consistently attempted to perform his duties, but was unable to continue because of his injury, and, as cited by the majority, \u201cthere [was] no specific restricted job to which plaintiff would return, but only a[n] unspecified grouping of them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">In neither of the cases cited by the majority did the employee know the duties attendant to the job. In one case, the employer refused to tell the employee anything at all about the job, and in the other the employee was assigned to rotate as needed among a large number of jobs. Although I recognize that these were situations in which an employer had failed to make a bona fide offer, I would distinguish these cases from the instant dispute. Unlike <em>Kolenk\u00f3 </em>and <em>Maddox, </em>this case does not involve an employer who refused to provide a job description or an employee assigned to rotate between several dozen jobs. The plaintiff had already worked at the job offered to him, so he cannot claim he did not understand its scope. Nor had he been requested to rotate among unspecified jobs. However, the majority still concludes that the offer was not sufficient because of the possibility that the plaintiff would be assigned additional responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The majority states that its holding is not based on the medical-examination requirement, and it apparently would have no difficulty with a situation in which the contents of a job offer changed after and on the basis of the results of the examination. I am unable to distinguish between that situation and the possibility, contemplated by the majority in the instant case, that the plaintiff would be asked to perform different work with unknown requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The majority concludes that \u201cplaintiffs ultimate employment duties may be far more demanding than those previously described.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 342. This conclusion can only be based on speculation that, if the defendant\u2019s doctor had found that the plaintiff could work without restrictions, the plaintiff might have been assigned to a regular-duty job, and therefore had not received an offer of a specific job with sufficiently detailed duties. I dissent because I disagree with that inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">First, I do not believe that the case law states that the mere possibility of additional duties destroys an otherwise sufficient offer of reasonable employment. As stated above, the instant case is distinguishable on its facts from the cases cited by the majority where offers were insufficiently specific. Here, the offer was specific. In fact, the plaintiff was familiar with all the responsibilities that he might be called on to perform, since he had previously worked both a regular-duty job and a regular desk job. Moreover, the employment was with the police department and not at a factory where he could be called upon to perform a large number of jobs. I admit that there was a slight possibility that the plaintiff would be offered other work that he had not previously performed. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>this scenario is not comparable to situations in which an employee was offered work consisting of unspecified duties. Rather, here the defendant\u2019s offer was sufficiently specific regarding any other potential job requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Second, the WCAB specifically excluded the possibility that the plaintiff could be asked to perform a different job regardless of the results of the medical examination. As the majority notes, the police supervisors testified before the magistrate that they never intended the plaintiff return to a regular, unrestricted job. <em>Id. </em>at 332. Even on cross-examination, although admitting that the city doctor might conclude that the plaintiff could work without restrictions, the police chief testified that \u201cthat never entered into my mind, putting him back on the road.\u201d The WCAB reflected this finding in holding that benefits would be reinstated if the plaintiff were assigned to additional duties. The majority notes this qualification, but concludes that it is not supported by the record. <em>Id. </em>at 341-342.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The wcab\u2019s qualification is supported by the record. The magistrate concluded, on the basis of the medical evidence, that the plaintiff could perform the specially created job. She also concluded that the job was described in detail sufficient to constitute a bona fide offer of reasonable employment. The wcab followed those findings in imposing the qualification that the plaintiff could not be required to do other work. Additional responsibilities would not necessarily fall within the medical limitations that the magistrate found to exist. Also, the finding that an offer had been made referred only to the special job, not to other duties. Thus, the wcab\u2019s decision to reinstate the plaintiff\u2019s benefits if he were required to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>other duties is supported by the record as a whole, and in fact is necessary to accurately reflect the facts as established by the record. Without the qualification, the plaintiff might be required to perform work outside the boundaries established by the magistrate, which would constitute a failure to follow the magistrate\u2019s medical fact finding. The qualification should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Because I conclude that there was a bona fide offer of reasonable employment, I reach the question whether the plaintiff was reasonable in his refusal to accept the offer. In <em>Pulver v Dundee Cement Co, </em>445 Mich 68; 515 NW2d 728 (1994), this Court articulated several factors to be considered when relevant in determining the reasonableness of a refusal of an offer of reasonable employment. These include the timing of the offer, the employee\u2019s reasons for moving away from the place of employment, the diligence of the employee in trying to return to work, and whether the employee has returned to work with some other employer. Of relevance in this case is the plaintiff\u2019s lack of diligence in attempting to perform the work offered. As of April 21, 1986, the testimony established that the specially created job was available to the plaintiff. For ten years, he has failed to attempt to perform the job. I conclude that his refusal was unreasonable and that it was therefore proper to suspend his benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">This result is supported by the cases cited by the majority. Both <em>Kolenko </em>and <em>Maddox </em>involved employees who demonstrated diligence in attempting to return to work. The <em>Kolenko </em>Court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>[p]laintiff in her attitude and conduct with regard to the proposed job clearly appears to have been actuated by good faith. . . . The only lack of cooperation that appears from the record in this case is on the part of defendant. [285 Mich 162.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Similarly, in <em>Maddox, </em>the plaintiff employee attempted to perform the work offered, but was unable to continue. The holdings in these cases were based at least partly on the employees\u2019 demonstrated good faith and diligence in attempting to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The Court of Appeals also requires an employee to at least attempt to perform reasonable employment once the employer has met its burden of offering that employment. In <em>Christiansen v Eaton, Yale &amp; Towne, Inc, </em>89 Mich App 440, 444; 280 NW2d 463 (1978), the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">The board\u2019s statement that plaintiff had the \u201cburden of attempting to perform same\u201d is not inconsistent wdth the case law. Plaintiff refused to even examine the jobs offered. In light of this total refusal it cannot be said that plaintiff acted in good faith, as was found to be the fact in <em>Kolenko </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The same conclusion was reached in <em>Parmeter v Grand Rapids Public Schools, </em>168 Mich App 97, 102; 424 NW2d 6 (1987). The Court stated, \u201c[i]t is true that, where the defendant meets his burden of making a good-faith job offer of sufficiently favored work, the plaintiff must attempt to perform it . . . .\u201d The employee\u2019s obligation to attempt work attaches only after the employer has met its burden of offering reasonable employment. Under this test, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to report to work supports the decision to suspend his benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">I conclude that the WCAB and Court of Appeals were correct in concluding that the evidence demonstrated that the defendant made a bona fide offer of reasonable employment to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff refused that offer by failing to attempt to perform the work. Accordingly, I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision to suspend the plaintiffs benefits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-5\">Riley and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Brickley, C.J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
