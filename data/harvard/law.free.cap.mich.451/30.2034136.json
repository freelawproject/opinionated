This Court has addressed the issue of vindictive prosecution where a sentence is increased after a defendant\u2019s appeal from a criminal conviction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>not directly addressed alleged actual vindictiveness arising in the dual-sovereign pretrial context.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">We find that the defendant in this case failed to affirmatively prove actual vindictiveness because he did not show that the Wayne County prosecutor, by prosecuting under Michigan law, sought to penalize defendant for exercising his constitutional right to counsel. Nor did defendant present any evidence of untoward collusion between the federal investigation and the state prosecution. The Court of Appeals is reversed and the defendant\u2019s conviction reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Defendant, Thomas J. Ryan, was arrested with a kilogram of cocaine in Livonia, Michigan on the evening of March 21, 1987, as part of a federal drug investigation. Local Livonia police support was solicited to facilitate defendant\u2019s arrest. Federal agent Hubert Coleman questioned defendant at the scene and told him that if he cooperated with the federal investigation, Agent Coleman would pursue federal rather than state charges. This \u201cdeal\u201d was favorable to defendant because a conviction in the State of Michigan for possession with intent to deliver 650 grams of cocaine carries a mandatory life sentence, while federal prosecution for the same act carries only a possible sentence of twenty-four to thirty-six months in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Defendant was taken to the Livonia police station where federal agents played audiotapes involving defendant\u2019s conversations with a Cleveland contact. Later that night, Agent Coleman traveled to Cleveland in an unsuccessful attempt to locate an additional two kilo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>grams of cocaine thought to be connected to defendant\u2019s operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">At some point during questioning, defendant requested counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because defendant\u2019s attorney, Kenneth Cockrel, was unavailable, attorney James Feinberg responded to defendant\u2019s call. However, attorney Feinberg made it clear, at least to defendant, that he would not represent defendant if he cooperated with the federal investigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Attorney Cockrel arrived the next day to represent defendant, but found that the \u201cdeal\u201d was off the table.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Defendant\u2019s case was referred to the Wayne County prosecutor, and he was arraigned on March 23, 1987, two days after his arrest. Defendant was convicted in state court of possession with intent to deliver more than 650 grams of cocaine and sentenced to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction, but found that the defendant had established a prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>case of actual governmental vindictiveness and, therefore, remanded for an evidentiary hearing. Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued May 9, 1991 (Docket No. 113547). The Court of Appeals did not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">On remand, the trial court heard testimony from federal agents, attorney James Feinberg, and the defendant. The trial court found that Agent Coleman went to Cleveland only because of information provided by defendant after defendant requested counsel but before defendant spoke to counsel, that Agent Coleman knew that defendant did not yet have an attorney when Agent Coleman went to Cleveland, and that defendant did not have the opportunity to consult with an attorney before the deal was removed from the table.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">On the basis of these findings the trial court concluded: \u201cDea Agents, particularly, supervising agent Hubert Colman [sic], indulged in a forbidden form of forum shopping in this instance . . . that as a result of that alone, defendant was prosecuted in the criminal justice system of the State of Michigan.\u201d Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court, Docket No. 87-03365, pp 12-13. This, the trial court concluded, \u201cnot only denied defendant his right to counsel but violated his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution as well.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal in an unpublished opinion per curiam, entered February 24, 1994 (Docket No. 144052). We granted leave by order entered January 5, 1995. 448 Mich 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">It is a violation of due process to punish a person for asserting a protected statutory or constitutional right. <em>North Carolina v Pearce, </em>395 US 711; 89 S Ct 2072; 23 L Ed 2d 656 (1969); <em>People v Goeddeke, </em>174 Mich App 534, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>536; 436 NW2d 407 (1988). \u201cTo punish a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort . . . .\u201d <em>Bordenkircher v Hayes, </em>434 US 357, 363; 98 S Ct 663; 54 L Ed 2d 604 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Such punishment is referred to as prosecutorial vindictiveness. There are two types of prosecutorial vindictiveness, presumed vindictiveness and actual vindictiveness. Actual vindictiveness will be found only where objective evidence of an \u201cexpressed hostility or threat\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> suggests that the defendant was deliberately penalized for his exercise of a procedural, statutory, or constitutional right. See, e.g., <em>United States v Goodwin, </em>457 US 368, 374, 380, n 12; 102 S Ct 2485; 73 L Ed 2d 74 (1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The burden is on the defendant to affirmatively establish actual vindictiveness. <em>People v Watts, </em>149 Mich App 502, 511; 386 NW2d 565 (1986). The mere threat of additional charges during plea negotiations does not amount to actual vindictiveness where bringing the additional charges is within the prosecutor\u2019s charging discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The Court of Appeals found that defendant established a prima facie case of actual vindictiveness and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court relied on</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">assertions by defendant that the drug enforcement administration threatened to bring charges in Michigan and ultimately did so after defendant requested assistance of counsel in deciding whether to cooperate with the administration . . . .[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We agree that the evidence is undisputed that federal agent Coleman told defendant during initial questioning that if defendant refused to cooperate, the case would be referred for state prosecution. It is also undisputed that defendant requested counsel. Sometime thereafter, before defendant met with Attorney Cockrel, the \u201cdeal\u201d was withdrawn and the case was referred by the federal agent to state prosecutors. However, this sequence of events does not dictate a conclusion that the defendant was vindictively deprived of his constitutional right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">We find that the mere threat to refer the case for state prosecution does not amount to objective evidence of hostile motive because it came from an individual who lacked authority to prohibit the Wayne County prosecutor from exercising his legitimate power to prosecute violations of Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Implicit in the trial court\u2019s reasoning is that the state would have been unable to prosecute defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>if the federal government had also pursued charges. But the state has independent authority to prosecute crimes within its borders. In <em>In re Illova, </em>351 Mich 204, 209; 88 NW2d 589 (1958) (rev\u2019d on other grounds), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">When a defendant has violated both State and Federal laws he is liable to each sovereign and subject to prosecution by each. It is not his privilege to choose which shall first inflict punishment. If any comity between sovereigns is violated, the offended sovereign may complain, not the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Thus, the Wayne County prosecutor had independent authority to pursue charges against this defendant regardless of any \u201cdeal\u201d suggested by the federal agent. It is also well accepted that the vindictiveness of one sovereign is not normally chargeable to the independent decision to prosecute by a separate sovereign because the likelihood of prosecutorial abuse is minimized. <em>United States v Schoolcraft, </em>879 F2d 64, 68 (CA 3, 1989), citing <em>United States v Ballester, </em>763 F2d 368, 370 (CA 9, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">For example, in <em>United States v Schoolcraft, supra, </em>the defendant argued that a state prosecutor had acted vindictively when he referred a federal firearms offense to the United States attorney. The defendant made two allegations: first, the defendant claimed that the state prosecutor made the referral because the federal penalties were stiffer than the state\u2019s penalties; and, second, he alleged that the state prosecutor, as private counsel, had represented parties that settled a civil suit favorable to defendant. At the conclusion of the civil suit, the prosecutor allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>stated that he would \u201cnail [defendant] to the wall\u201d if he ever came before him. <em>Id. </em>at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">On these facts, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit found no vindictive prosecution. The court stated that it would not focus on the actions of the state prosecutor, but rather on the United States attorney who prosecuted defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The Court of Appeals employed a similar analysis in <em>United States v Fulford, </em>825 F2d 3 (CA 3, 1987). In <em>Fulford, </em>the defendant asserted that the state prosecutor \u201cbadgered\u201d and \u201cpressured\u201d a federal agent into seeking an indictment against the defendant for counterfeiting. The defendant claimed that the state prosecutor wanted the federal indictment so that he could use it as leverage in his attempt to get the defendant to cooperate in the prosecution of another individual on state charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Again, the court found that the defendant had failed to make out a claim of vindictiveness because he had failed to show improper conduct on the part of the sovereign that ultimately prosecuted the matter. In reaching its decision, the court stressed that the federal government\u2019s authority to prosecute violations of federal law is independent of the prosecutorial rights of other sovereigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The same can be said of the State of Michigan\u2019s authority to prosecute the present case. The authority exists independently from that of other sovereigns. Except in the rarest of circumstances, that authority cannot be undermined by the unlawful actions of other sovereigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Furthermore, to find that a federal agent\u2019s actions could so taint a state decision to prosecute, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>would have to be evidence of some untoward collusion between the federal referral and the state prosecution where the state acted as a \u201cstalking horse\u201d for the federal investigation. <em>Schoolcraft, supra </em>at 68. In the case before us, there simply was no evidence presented of such impermissible collusion. In fact, while the dea made the referral in this case, local police were at the scene of defendant\u2019s arrest and were certainly aware that he had violated Michigan law by possessing a kilogram of drugs. This information was obtained independently from Agent Coleman\u2019s referral of the facts to the prosecutor. Thus, it is altogether possible that, even without Agent Coleman\u2019s referral, Livonia Police would have eventually involved the state prosecutor in this case. In any event, we hesitate to forestall such action with a ruling that would prohibit state authorities from prosecuting where they clearly had a right to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Finally, the trial court clearly erred when it relied on the activities of the federal agent, given the fact that the agent had no authority to preclude state prosecution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Implicit in the trial court\u2019s analysis is the misconception that if the defendant did give information to the agents at the station that motivated the Cleveland trip, his cooperation created a quid pro quo requiring the agents to keep the deal available.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>As a general rule, \u201c \u2018fundamental fairness requires that promises made during plea-bargaining and analogous contexts be respected\u2019 . . . <em>United States v Streebing, </em>987 F2d 368, 372 (CA 6, 1993) (quoting <em>Johnson v Lumpkin, </em>769 F2d 630, 633 [CA 9, 1985]). However, this rule has two conditions: \u201c(1) the agent must be authorized to make the promise; and (2) the defendant must rely to his detriment on the promise.\u201d <em>Streebing, supra </em>at 372. There is no evidence that Agent Coleman was authorized by federal or state prosecutors to make promises to defendant that would preclude state prosecution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As we have noted, the state had the sovereign authority to pursue charges against this defendant. Furthermore, we do not see that the defendant\u2019s difficulty in obtaining counsel amounts to detrimental reliance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Because defendant failed to affirmatively prove with objective evidence that the state prosecution was motivated by hostility or that there was an unjustifiable connection between the federal agent\u2019s threats and the state prosecution, we find no actual vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">There is no doubt that defendant had a constitutional right to counsel. Nevertheless, the issue we dealt with involves whether the defendant was vindictively prosecuted in derogation of that right. We find that he was not. Vindictive prosecution in the dual-sovereign context does not occur where the prosecuting sovereign does nothing improper. A contrary result is inconsistent with a system of government that recognizes the state\u2019s independent authority to punish those who commit crimes within its borders. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b166-5\">Brickley, C.J., and Riley and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-12\"> <em>People v Payne, </em>386 Mich 84; 191 NW2d 375 (1971); <em>People v Jones, </em>403 Mich 527; 271 NW2d 515 (1978); <em>People v Mazzie, </em>429 Mich 29; 413 NW2d 1 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> This Court denied leave in two cases involving preconviction prosecutorial conduct: <em>People v </em>Watts, 149 Mich App 502; 386 NW2d 565 (1986), and <em>People v Goeddeke, </em>174 Mich App 534; 436 NW2d 407 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\"> There was no claim raised or argued regarding any violation of defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to counsel; therefore, the dissent\u2019s suggestion that evidence should have been suppressed, see <em>post, </em>p 60, n 30, is misleading and unsupportable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\"> Though attorney Feinberg\u2019s personal convictions may have made representation of a cooperating defendant uncomfortable, his refusal to represent the defendant under these circumstances and his failure to clearly communicate his intention not to represent this defendant to the federal agents unnecessarily aggravated defendant\u2019s circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\"> The trial court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Defendant testified also, that he asked Mr. Feinberg to contact Mr. Cockrel, and that Mr. Feinberg must have done so, since Mr. Cockrel did come to see him.

He was referred to another lawyer who appeared within an hour and spoke to Coleman, and then to Ryan and declined to represent Ryan because this lawyer did not represent persons who \u201ccooperate\u201d with law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Coleman testified that he told the lawyer that he planned \u201cto take the case to State prosecution,\u201d which would result in a mandatory life sentence because the quantity exceeded 650 grams. Coleman advised the lawyer that if \u201cRyan could cooperate with us and tell us where [the other two kilograms were] and work with us in the next few hours or days like over that weekend to get that package that perhaps we could defer this case to Federal Court . . . .\u2019\u2019He added that he advised the lawyer that \u201cif there was a possibility of cooperation that night or that weekend that we could maybe defer this thing in Federal Court.\u201d If Ryan had cooperated, the dea \u201cwould have started making a taped telephone call, we would have tried to figure out how we could get an undercover guy into this guy . . . .\u201d \u201c[W]e would have started working it that night.\u201d Coleman said that if Ryan had cooperated, he would have prosecuted in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">The judge found that when the lawyer who declined to represent Ryan left the Livonia police station, Cole<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>man concluded that Ryan would not cooperate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Coleman then drove from Livonia to Cleveland in the early morning hours, seeking to find persons who perhaps had received a telephone call at a motel in Cleveland. He found a person occupying the room in the motel, but the two kilograms of cocaine were not there. Coleman surmised that the person who had been waiting to receive money for the kilogram Ryan had delivered to an undercover officer probably was no longer there.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The judge found that \u201cColeman left for Cleveland because of some information he received from the defendant. The question tends to pose itself: If they had everything on the tapes why have any interest in the defendant\u2019s information.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Coleman also testified that by the time the lawyer Ryan had first sought to reach by telephone arrived the morning after the arrest, the deal was, as the lawyer reported to Ryan, off the table because, as Coleman testified, the dea was then \u201ccommitted to go to State Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">It appears from the testimony of the other dea agent who testified that Coleman had directed her to begin processing Ryan for transfer to state prosecutorial authorities before he left for Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">This dea agent also testified that no state law enforcement officer was involved in the investigation or interrogation of Ryan.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The judge so found.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AoU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Coleman testified that he thought that because three kilograms of cocaine were involved, a life sentence was appropriate. Nevertheless, he was \u201cdefinitely interested in the other two kilos to see if we could get the cooperation from the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Coleman testified that he had authority as a group supervisor \u201cto opt to go Federal or State.\u201d Coleman acknowledged that there had been \u201csome\u201d multiple kilogram cases in which he was involved that had been tried in federal court, and thus those cases had not been prosecuted in state court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The other dea agent who testified said that in the six years that she had been a dea agent, she was not aware of any case, other than this case, in which federal law enforcement authorities declined to prosecute where as much as 650 grams were involved.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>F</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The judge found that \u201cColman\u2019s [sic] testimony that a deal <em>never </em>would have been offered in a case involving that amount of cocaine, does not reconcile with all of his own testimony, nor with other testimony. Although it would have been highly beneficial to defendant to have faced Federal prosecution rather that [sic] State prosecution, according to the testimony of [the other DEA agent], it would not have been unusual.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The judge said that among the factors that persuaded him to discredit Coleman\u2019s testimony was the \u201ctestimony regarding a two-year sentence in Federal prison. This obviously referred to Federal Sentencing guidelines, with which defendant would not likely be familiar. It is reasonable to assume that Mr. Colman, as an experienced, long-time agent, would have been familiar with these guidelines. Yet, he denied that he was.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The judge found that \u201cit has not been shown by the prosecution that even in Michigan, there is a policy of deferring to State prosecution, major controlled substance cases for prosecution under the harsher law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Clearly, if Ryan had waived his Fifth Amendment privilege and, without consulting counsel, further incriminated himself by aiding the dea in its efforts to locate the other two kilograms of cocaine, he would, if Coleman had kept his word, have been prosecuted in a federal court and would have been sentenced to a relatively short term of imprisonment. Ryan did not so cooperate, and the dea turned the evidence it had compiled against him over to state law enforcement officials, resulting in a prosecution in state court and the imposition of a mandatory life sentence without possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The Recorder\u2019s Court judge found that the dea acted vindictively. Whether that characterization is justified or a less pejorative or derogatory word would more appropriately characterize the dea conduct should not be the focus of our inquiry or analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Ryan had a right to remain silent. He was under no duty to negotiate with the dea.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The judge, on ample evidence, found that Ryan was penalized because he sought to consult with a lawyer before further incriminating himself. And, thus, he was penalized for exercising his Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>There is a body of law concerning claims of vindictive action by judges<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and prosecutors.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This case concerns a claim of vindictiveness against a law enforcement officer. The majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\">It is a violation of due process to punish a person for asserting a protected statutory or constitutional right. <em>North Carolina v Pearce, </em>395 US 711; 89 S Ct 2072; 23 L Ed 2d 656 (1969); <em>People v Goeddeke, </em>174 Mich App 534, 536; 436 NW2d 407 (1988). \u201cTo punish a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort . . . .\u201d <em>Bordenkircher v Hayes, </em>434 US 357, 363; 98 S Ct 663; 54 L Ed 2d 604 (1978). <em>[Ante, </em>pp 35-36.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The majority also states that actual prosecutorial vindictiveness \u201cwill be found only where objective evidence of an <em>\u2018expressed hostility or threat\u2019 </em>suggests that the defendant was deliberately penalized for his exercise of a procedural, statutory, or constitutional right.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 36 (emphasis added). Neither the words \u201cexpressed hostility or threat,\u201d nor a similar phrase appears in <em>Goodwin, </em>n 12, which is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>United States v Gallegos-Curiel, </em>681 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>F2d 1164, 1168 (CA 9, 1982), in which the quoted language appears, does not establish that actual vindictiveness can only be found where there is expressed hostility or threat. <em>Gallegos-Curiel, </em>and the cases cited in that opinion<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> consider and discuss the presumption of vindictiveness, not actual vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">When Ryan asked to speak to a lawyer, further interrogation should have ceased. <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 474; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966); <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US 477, 484-485; 101 S Ct 1880; 68 L Ed 2d 378 (1981).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The United States government may not, consistent with <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards, </em>punish an accused for exercising his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The judge\u2019s findings \u2014 not discussed by the majority\u2014 that the dea turned the evidence that it had compiled against Ryan over to state law enforcement officers to punish him for exercising his right to counsel are amply supported and were not clearly erroneous. Thus, his decision should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">The judge\u2019s findings are consistent with Coleman\u2019s testimony that he sought Ryan\u2019s cooperation and offered to \u201cdefer\u201d state prosecution that would result in a sentence of life imprisonment, and to prosecute instead in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>federal court with a comparatively short sentence, if Ryan would cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The judge\u2019s findings are also consistent with Coleman\u2019s testimony that \u201csome\u201d multiple kilogram cases are prosecuted in federal court, and the prosecution\u2019s failure to show that any other multi-kilogram case was transferred to the state for prosecution. The judge\u2019s findings are also consistent with the other dea agent\u2019s testimony that the dea, in her six years with the dea, did not turn over for state prosecutions persons apprehended with a kilogram of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The United States government has the resources to prosecute such major offenders. It is not surprising that, after expending considerable effort to apprehend a drug trafficker engaged in major activity, the dea, the attorney general, and local United States attorneys ordinarily proceed to prosecute offenders under federal law and do not refrain from prosecuting, and do not \u201cdefer\u201d to state prosecution by turning the offender over to state authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">Had there been a showing by evidence of a Federal policy of referring such cases as this to state courts for persecution [sic], the case might be viewed a little differently. While the State of Michigan, through legislative enactment, has expressed a clear public policy of the state by mandating that offenders involved with 650 grams or more of the prohibited substances be sentenced to life imprisonment, the United States Congress had expressed a decidedly different national public policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Congress, not a DEA agent, enacts laws expressing governmental policy. A dea agent is not a private citizen who might report crime he happens to observe. A dea agent has been provided the resources to investigate, obtain evidence, and arrest offenders, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>power he possesses, to enforce United States governmental policy, not his own personal choices. The sentencing guidelines presumably reflect congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The Recorder\u2019s Court judge discredited Coleman\u2019s assertion that he had discretion \u201cto go Federal or State.\u201d It would not be consistent with congressional intent for the DEA to purport to confer on a DEA agent discretion to refer multi-kilogram cases to state authorities when he personally believes that a life sentence without parole is more appropriate than the fifteen-year penalty (and guideline sentence) established by the Congress. Absent evidence, in addition to Coleman\u2019s discredited assertion, that the DEA had conferred authority on him to turn Ryan over for state prosecution because Coleman was of the opinion that the state\u2019s penalty structure was more appropriate than the federal structure, the Recorder\u2019s Court judge did not err in rejecting Coleman\u2019s testimony that he had discretion \u201cto go Federal or State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">To be sure, a DEA agent may offer concessions in the prosecution of <em>federal offenses </em>in exchange for cooperation leading to the arrest of other offenders. (The guideline sentence offered was not such a concession.) But he must do so within constitutional limitations. Dea agents have not been authorized by the Congress to punish, nor may a dea agent, consistent with the Constitution of the United States punish, an offender for exercising his rights under the Fifth Amendment respecting self-incrimination and the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The State of Michigan is, indeed, a separate sovereign and may, although the conduct involved is also violative of federal law, prosecute for violation of its laws at least where, as here, the federal government has not prosecuted for violation of federal law.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">As the Recorder\u2019s Court judge found,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> this was not, however, a case in which federal and state law enforcement officers were jointly investigating and together apprehended a drug trafficker. State law enforcement officers were not meaningfully involved in Ryan\u2019s apprehension. But for the conduct of the dea in turning over to the state the evidence the dea had compiled as punishment for Ryan\u2019s exercise of his rights, the state is not likely to have become aware of the evidence against Ryan compiled by the dea, and probably would have little, if any, evidence with which to prosecute.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>If the state has evidence obtained before or without regard to whether the dea had turned over its file to the state, the state may, I agree with the majority, properly prosecute Ryan for major drug activity. But it would be contrary to the Supremacy Clause<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> for the state to prosecute Ryan with evidence obtained by the state as a result of conduct of the United States \u2014 punishing Ryan for exercise of protected rights \u2014 barred by <em>Miranda </em>or <em>Edwards </em>or the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The majority appears to address a double jeopardy issue that was not briefed and argued when it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">Implicit in the trial court\u2019s reasoning is that the state would have been unable to prosecute defendant if the federal government had also pursued charges. But the state has independent authority to prosecute crimes within its borders. <em>[Ante, </em>pp 37-38.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The issue whether the state may prosecute after the federal government has also prosecuted for a drug offense is pending before this Court in <em>People v Hermiz </em>(Docket No. 101689) and <em>Mezy </em>(Docket No.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>102274), argued January 10, 1996 (Calendar No. 13).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It is not appropriate for the Court to speak to this issue before it decides <em>Hermiz </em>and <em>Mezy.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b185-4\">Cavanagh and Mallett, JJ, concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\"> Issued May 9, 1991 (Docket No. 113547).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\"> The Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">[D]efendant alleges that he was denied due process when the drug enforcement administration penalized defendant after defendant exercised his right to counsel after the drug enforcement administration requested cooperation. In a motion for a new trial, defendant alleges that agents at the Livonia police headquarters told defendant that if he were willing to cooperate as to his \u201csource\u201d that they would charge defendant in Federal Court where his maximum sentence would be thirty-six months in prison as opposed to the Michigan mandatory term of life without parole. Defendant stated that he told the agents that before he would enter into a deal, he wanted to speak to an attorney. Defendant further alleges that the agents threatened defendant with prosecution in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>state court unless he made a decision at that time. Subsequently, defendant was tried in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">A government actor\u2019s actions are vindictive and violative of due process if it punishes a person for exercising a protected statutory or constitutional right. <em>United States v Goodwin, </em>457 US 368, 372; 102 S Ct 2485; 73 L Ed 2d 74 (1982), <em>Bordenkircher v Hayes, </em>434 US 357; 98 S Ct 663; 54 L Ed 2d 604 (1978), <em>People v Goeddeke, </em>174 Mich App 534, 536; 436 NW2d 407 (1988). Vindictiveness is not presumed in pretrial actions concerning a prosecution\u2019s charging function. <em>People v Watts, </em>149 Mich App 502, 511; 386 NW2d 565 (1986). Thus, in order to establish his claim of a denial of due process, defendant must affirmatively prove actual vindictiveness. <em>Id. </em>However, a defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on a charge of vindictiveness when defendant makes a <em>prima facie </em>case based on facts sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about the government agency\u2019s purpose. <em>People v Napue, </em>834 F2d 1311, 1329 (CA 7, 1987). The extent to which the government had obtained its evidence prior to defendant\u2019s assertion of some right is one of the key indicia scrutinized by courts when confronted by a claim of vindictive prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In the present case, we hold that the assertions by defendant that the drug enforcement administration threatened to bring charges in Michigan and ultimately did so after defendant requested assistance of counsel in deciding whether to cooperate with the administration, creates a <em>prima facie </em>case of vindictiveness entitling defendant to an evidentiary hearing. Because the lower court record does not supply a complete evidentiary basis to decide the issue of vindictiveness, we remand to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\"> The judge said:</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">This court also [finds] as a fact that the Government denied the defendant defendant\u2019s right to obtain counsel in order to negotiate for the bargain it invited. A fair review of Agent Colman\u2019s [sic] testi[m]ony as well as his actions, and a fair review of the testimony of the other witnesses leads to that conclusion. The court is also satisfied that the DEA Agents, particularly, supervising agent Hubert Colman, indulged in a forbidden form of forum shopping in this instance. It finds that as a result of that alone, defendant was prosecuted in the criminal justice system of the State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>While the United States Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not violated by the mere fact that the prosecutor \u201ccarries out a threat made during plea negotiations,\u201d it has firmly held that to punish a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort. <em>United States v Goodwin, </em>457 US 368, 384; 102 S Ct 2485; 73 L Ed 2d 74 (1982), and <em>Blackledge v Perry, </em>417 US 21; 94 S Ct 2098; 40 L Ed 2d 628 (1974). It is in the context of this principle that this court finds a violation of due process in the State prosecution of this defendant. The defendant clearly had a right to have the assistance of counsel. <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The court finds as a matter of fact and as a matter of law that the defendant was denied his right to counsel. It is clear from the testimony, not merely that of the defendant but attorney Feinberg and Supervising DEA Agent Hubert Colman as well, that Colman knew that defendant had not been counselled in regal'd to the advisability of cooperating with the Federal authorities and making statements in line with such cooperation. Yet, without providing the defendant any additional and reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel, the Federal authorities referred the case to State jurisdiction and the harsher penalty. Furthermore, this was done after information was obtained from the defendant, without counsel. The defendant testified in effect, that while he did not tell them everything he knew he did give them information about people in Cleveland, and named one individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The court finds further, as a matter of fact and as a matter of law, that surrendering the defendant to State prosecution under the circumstances was vindictive governmental action which not only denied defendant his right to counsel but violated his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The court does not wish to be misunderstood as saying that the mere fact that state prosecution under a harsher statute simply because the defendant would not cooperate would necessarily amount to vindictiveness. The agents did not merely choose to go to the State court. Had they done that merely to see that defendant, if convicted, would have received a harsher sentence even to punish the defendant, that would not have been a denial of due process. See <em>Bordenkircher v Hayes, </em>434 US 357; 98 S Ct 663; 54 L Ed 2d 604 (19[78]), and <em>People v Goeddeke, </em>174 Mich App 534, 536-537 (1988). While these cases strongly support that view, they unanimously hold that \u201cto punish a person for exercising a statutory or constitutional right violates due process.\u201d <em>(Goeddeke, </em>p 536.)

A DEA agent testified that she could recall no case involving over 650 grams, in her six years as an agent, that had been turned over for state prosecution. The court\u2019s findings that after defendant requested an opportunity to consult with counsel and his initial attempt to obtain the advice of counsel failed, the federal authorities referred the case to the state without providing defendant \u201cany additional and reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel,\u201d and that they did so out of vindictiveness, were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b170-9\"> The majority adds that Ryan did not present any evidence of untoward collusion between the federal investigation and the state prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\"> Information was provided by Ryan shortly after his arrest after he asked to consult counsel, and the DEA agent nevertheless continued to interrogate him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b170-11\"> See n 1 and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b170-12\"> See n 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b170-13\"> The majority states that \u201cno claim [was] raised or argued regarding any violation of defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to counsel....\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 34, n 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">The Recorder\u2019s Court judge found \u201cas a fact that the Government denied the defendant defendant\u2019s right to obtain counsel,\u201d and that \u201cthe defendant was denied his right to counsel,\u201d and more specifically</p>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">It is in the context of this principle that this court finds a violation of due process in the State prosecution of this defendant.

Coleman testified that he had provided Ryan with <em>Miranda </em>warnings, but did not have him sign an \u201cacknowledgement of his constitutional rights\u201d; \u201cI just advised him verbally, but I did have witnesses to that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b172-11\"> Ryan explained that he wished to consult a lawyer to verify that the DEA would follow through on the offer.

Mr. Coleman left immediately for Cleveland intending to make a \u201cbust.\u201d Some of the information which he had, he obviously got from the defendant, who testified that while he was told that he could have a lawyer, he would have to answer some questions first. He said that he did. If whatever knowledge or information regarding Cleveland suspects Mr. Coleman sought from the defendant was already on the tapes or otherwise within his knowledge, he and other agents, no doubt, would have taken steps to seize the Cleveland suspects simultaneously with the Livonia operation. Had that information been at hand, would would [sic] have been no reason to \u201cdeal\u201d with this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">It is clear that the defendant never had a chance to hire or consult wth [sic] a lawyer until after the deal had been \u201ctaken off the table.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\"> Earlier in his decision, the judge said:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">In response to further questions, defendant said that when he discussed the matter at the Livonia Police Department he gave some of the information about Cleveland people. He said that he named one person, Willie Butka. He stated further, that \u201che, (apparently referring to Colman [sic]) played tapes for me that says, Took, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>here\u2019s the phone calls from Cleveland, we know you\u2019re there, we know this guy is here so why dont\u2019t [sic] you just go with us tonight and we\u2019ll get him and you\u2019ll do your two years and that will be it,\u2019 and I told them that was alright.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">He said he was told, \u201c. . . this is your chance right now.

We won\u2019t even handcuff you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">Coleman\u2019s version of what occurred was somewhat different, but he did not directly contradict Ryan\u2019s testimony about going to Cleveland.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b175-13\"> She also testified that the taped cassettes of telephone conversations during the surveillance and the nonnarcotic evidence were kept under the control of the DEA, and the seized drugs were sent to the Chicago office of the DEA for evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">The Livonia Police Department was informed by the DEA of the impending drug transaction, and may have provided surveillance and backup, but did not actually participate in the investigation or arrest or in the interrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b175-15\"> This had not, in fact, been a joint operation between Federal and State or County agents.
