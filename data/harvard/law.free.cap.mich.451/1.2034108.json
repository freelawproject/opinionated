Michael Hocking on May 12, 1994, and subsequently amended on October 6, 1994. The amended complaint alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>that Judge Hocking engaged in acts of misconduct including improper touching, abusive courtroom behavior, inappropriate reasoning at sentencing, abuse of contempt power, abuse of the grievance process, and perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The Honorable Joseph B. Sullivan, the master appointed by this Court on June 14, 1994, conducted hearings on October 25, 26, 27, 28, and November 14 and 30. The master\u2019s report, issued on December 28, 1994, concluded that four of the six instances of alleged behavior constituted misconduct. The master dismissed the charges of improper touching and perjury, finding that these allegations were not supported by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The master further found that Judge Hocking\u2019s reasons for departing from the sentencing guidelines \u201cshowed a certain obvious lack of sensitivity towards the feeling of women generally,\u201d that on two occasions Judge Hocking was rude and discourteous,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that Judge Hocking\u2019s abuse of the grievance process in two instances constituted \u201ca failure to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety, in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 2A.\u201d While not specifically charged in the complaint, the master also made an explicit finding that there was no evidence of gender bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Both parties filed objections to the master\u2019s report, and oral argument was held before the commission on March 20, 1995. The commission adopted the majority of the master\u2019s findings and issued its decision and rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>ommendation of discipline on April 12, 1995.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In its report, a majority<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the commission concluded that Judge Hocking was guilty of misconduct for improper remarks made during sentencing. The commission unanimously adopted the master\u2019s findings that in two instances Judge Hocking was rude and discourteous toward two attorneys, and unanimously agreed that Judge Hocking had abused the grievance process in one instance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The commission also found a \u201cstrong indication of a pattern of gender bias,\u201d but refused to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>formal finding in this regard because gender bias was not an allegation formally charged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">As a result of this misconduct, a majority of the commission recommended that Judge Hocking be suspended from judicial office for thirty days without pay.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">On May 24, 1995, Judge Hocking petitioned this Court, pursuant to MCR 9.224 and MCR 9.225, to reject or modify the commission\u2019s recommendation, contending that the commission\u2019s findings of misconduct are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">After review of the record de novo,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we conclude that the exchange with attorney Elaine Sharp violates the Code of Judicial Conduct. However, while we do not condone Judge Hocking\u2019s controversial tone and courtroom manner in addressing attorney Pamela Maas, or his rationale regarding defendant Hensick\u2019s state of mind, we do not find that this behavior is judicial misconduct. Nor can we conclude that Judge Hocking abused the grievance process. The commission recommended that Judge Hocking be suspended for thirty days without pay for this misconduct. Having concluded that Judge Hocking was not persistently rude and discourteous, MCR 9.205(C), that his remarks during sentencing were not clearly prejudicial to the fair administration of justice, MCR 9.205(C) and that he did not abuse the grievance process, we find no pattern of misconduct. Judge Hocking\u2019s conduct with respect to Ms. Sharp was clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice, MCR 9.205(C)(4), and constitutes misconduct. After reviewing the record in this case and the discipline this Court has imposed in similar cases of judicial mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>conduct, we find suspension an appropriate sanction, although our conclusions with regard to Judge Hocking\u2019s actions do not warrant the term of suspension recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">As the cornerstone of our tripartite system of government, the judiciary has a public trust to both uphold and represent the rule of law. Those who exercise authority and those who consent to its exercise have reciprocal obligations. Citizens are bound to observe a certain line of conduct in exchange for the protections of the law, and judges, no less than other officers of government, are bound to conduct themselves with honor and dignity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the ideal judge is a person who has by habit and practice achieved self-control and acquired the virtue of being able to will and act as a just person ought to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">But as James Madison noted early on, discipline must also come from within the system.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions. <em>[The Federalist Papers, </em>No 51 (New York: Mentor-Penguin Books, 1961), p 322.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The issue before us is whether the record supports the findings of misconduct with which Judge Hocking is charged, and if so, what level of discipline that conduct merits. See <em>In re Bennett, </em>403 Mich 178, 184; 267 NW2d 914 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Three of the instances of misconduct alleged by the commission arise directly or indirectly from Judge Hocking\u2019s reasons for departing from the sentencing guidelines during the sentencing of Timothy Hensick after conviction for criminal sexual conduct in <em>People v Hensick, </em>Livingston Circuit Court, File No. 91-6537-FC. Although these proceedings do not involve the merits of the <em>Hensick </em>case, because the only issues before us are those relating to the recommended discipline of Judge Hocking, some background is necessary to assess the propriety of Judge Hocking\u2019s conduct and comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">In <em>Hensick, </em>the criminal sexual conduct charges arose from allegations of oral and digital penetration committed by an attorney with a female client he was representing in divorce proceedings. Between 1:00 and 2:00 A.M. on April 29, 1990, Mr. Hensick called his client and arranged to meet with her at her apartment a short time later. After he arrived, there were two instances of fellatio and Hensick penetrated her digitally. Hensick claimed the sex was consensual and that they parted amicably. His client, however, filed charges claiming that the contact was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The element of force or coercion was vigorously disputed by the parties at trial. There was no evidence of physical blows or use of a weapon, or any allegations by the complainant that Hensick used verbal threats to compel her to yield to his advances. Although there was testimony that the complainant herself admitted that Hensick had not threatened her and that perhaps Hen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>sick did not know how she felt, at trial she testified that she was too frightened to resist participating in the aforementioned acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The jury accepted the complainant\u2019s version of the incident, finding sufficient evidence of coercion to convict Hensick of three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At sentencing, Judge Hocking denied a defense motion for a directed verdict, finding that there was sufficient evidence regarding each element of the crime. He went on to observe, however, that this was the weakest criminal case he had ever seen stating, \u201chad I tried this case without a jury, I would have acquitted the Defendant . ...\u201d As Judge Hocking began to pronounce sentence, it was apparent that he intended to deviate significantly downward from the sentencing guidelines because he felt the guidelines did not adequately deal with the facts of the case. Shortly after he began his lengthy explanation of why he thought the guidelines were inapplicable, assistant prosecuting attorney Pamela Maas rose to her feet and attempted to argue that the scoring of the guidelines was not at issue because Hensick did not contest the scoring. Judge Hocking angrily ordered Ms. Maas to sit down stating that she could appeal if she did not like what he had to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">As suddenly as the outburst arose, his demeanor returned to normal and he proceeded to explain why he believed this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630; 461 NW2d 1 (1990), required him to depart from the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>This background sets the stage for the following misconduct charges.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Two allegations of misconduct arose directly from the <em>Hensick </em>sentencing: first, that Judge Hocking\u2019s justifications for departing from the guidelines were blatantly improper and sexist; second, that Judge Hocking was impermissibly rude during the colloquy with assistant prosecutor Maas.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Judge Hocking was clearly in absolute disagreement with the jury verdict finding the defendant guilty of three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The jury reached its decision on the basis of sufficient evidence to prove every element of the crime, however, and Judge Hocking knew the sentencing guidelines required him to impose a prison term of ten to twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>five years or to provide adequate justification for deviating downward. Therefore, to justify his significant downward departure,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Judge Hocking apparently felt he had to sequentially eliminate all conceivable grounds for why the sentence should not be higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In discussing why a lower sentence was appropriate, Judge Hocking moved through approximately a dozen numbered reasons to depart from the guidelines. He repeatedly stated that his principal basis for his sentencing analysis was <em>People v Milbourn, supra. </em>Having argued <em>Milboum </em>before this Court, Judge Hocking believed this Court\u2019s opinion in that case required that he deviate from the guidelines if he felt the guidelines did not address the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Two of the twelve reasons given to justify the sentence imposed became the focus of national media attention. In considering where the facts of this case fell on the continuum of criminal sexual conduct cases, Judge Hocking stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">A mitigating factor, although minor, is evidence that the Defendant helped the victim up off the floor after the occurrence. Another mitigating factor \u2014 that the victim told a spouse-abuse agency the sex was not forced but resistance \u2014 her resistance was worn down by the Defendant\u2019s persistent request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Judge Hocking also used language that was interpreted to mean that a lesser sentence was appropriate because \u201cthe victim asked for it.\u201d In addressing what he felt was the defendant\u2019s lack of culpability, as compared to other offenses and offenders, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>[T]he fact that the victim agreed to the Defendant\u2019s 2:00 A.M., Sunday morning visit is a mitigating circumstance, again with regard to the presence of an evil state of mind on behalf of the Defendant. This is not a perfect world, but as common sense tells me that when a man calls a woman at 2:00 a.m. and says he wants to come over and talk and he\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s accepted, a reasonable person, whether you want to shake your head or not, Ms. Maas, I haven\u2019t been living in a shell. A reasonable person understands that means certain things. They may be wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">In this regard, I do not find any credible evidence that the victim consented to the Defendant\u2019s visit for professional reasons. The jury could believe whatever they want.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The commission adopted the master\u2019s conclusion that \u201cstatements of that nature[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] hold the court up to ridicule in violation of the standards of judicial conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">In reviewing Judge Hocking\u2019s comments, we note that, generally, a judge is not subject to discipline for \u201cappealable errors of law or abuses of discretion,\u201d <em>In re King, </em>409 Mass 590, 601; 568 NE2d 588 (1991), and \u201c[j]udicial error alone is not a sufficient basis upon which to found violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct . . . .\u201d <em>In re Elliston, </em>789 SW2d 469, 477 (Mo, 1990). However, as the commission notes, the justification for departure \u2014 the act of judicial discretion\u2014 is not at issue in this case. Judge Hocking is not subject to discipline for his decision to depart downward on the basis of the facts of the case. Relief for unjustified departure, if warranted, is available through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>appeal. Whether relief on appeal is warranted or not, it does not follow that a judicial officer is immune from discipline for the manner in which the decision is articulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">It is clear, however, that every graceless, distasteful, or bungled attempt to communicate the reason for a judge\u2019s decision cannot serve as the basis for judicial discipline. We are committed to eradicating sexual stereotypes, but we cannot ignore the cost of censoring inept expressions of opinion. The commission\u2019s contention that Judge Hocking\u2019s comments were \u201crife with remarks revealing his frustration with the jury verdict and his sympathy for the defendant\u201d illustrates the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Judge Hocking was obviously straining to find ground to justify a reduced sentence. However, disagreement with a jury verdict is not improper, and sympathy for a defendant a judge believes to have been wrongfully convicted is not inappropriate. The rationale for a severe sentence would inevitably have a negative effect on those who disagree with the verdict, and \u201csympathetic\u201d remarks would have a negative effect on those who believed the verdict was correct. In short, we would discourage honest explanation of the rationale for tailoring sentences to the offender and the offense were we to define misconduct from the perspective of the person most sensitive to such remarks.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Similarly, both the trial judge\u2019s responsibility to find facts in a bench trial and to control proceedings would be substantially compromised if, absent discriminatory animus or a pattern of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>behavior, remarks \u2014 critical or disapproving of counsel, the parties, or their cases \u2014 constituted misconduct in office.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">A judge\u2019s comments are not immune from censure simply because they are based on facts adduced at trial or events occurring at trial. However, where a judge is stating an opinion drawn from his knowledge of the proceedings, the threshold for a finding of misconduct must be flexible enough to accommodate the imperatives of the system.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A judge\u2019s mode of articulating a basis for decision may exhibit such a degree of antagonism or other offensive conduct that a single incident would indicate that impartial judgment is not reasonably possible. In that event, the judge has prejudiced the administration of justice because the conduct undermines public confidence in the impartiality of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">We conclude that the line between insensitive comment<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice requires us to assess the communication of judicial opinion from an objective perspective. Comment based on knowledge acquired during a proceeding is misconduct when it is so clearly unacceptable that it displays an unfavorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>predisposition indicating an inability to impartially determine the facts. See <em>Liteky v United States, </em>510 US 540, 551; 114 S Ct 1147; 127 L Ed 2d 474 (1994), or when, in combination with other conduct violative of MCR 9.205, it is clearly prejudicial to the fair administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Reviewing the statements from this perspective in the context in which they were made, we find that Judge Hocking\u2019s attempt to explain his view of the defendant\u2019s lack of malevolent purpose does not constitute misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Judge Hocking\u2019s statements were motivated by his intent to comply with <em>Milboum, </em>on the basis of evidence he had heard at trial. They were not explicitly abusive,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> nor do they evidence persistent misconduct. The comments were tasteless and undoubtedly offensive to the sensibilities of many citizens. They do not display a mindset unable to render fair judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The second charge of misconduct arising from the <em>Hensick </em>sentencing relates to the exchange between Judge Hocking and assistant prosecuting attorney Maas.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The sentencing proceeded in proper form. Ms. Maas argued first and urged that the sentence should be that recommended by the probation department; defense counsel then spoke and requested that the court deviate from the sentencing guidelines. After defense counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>argument, Ms. Maas addressed the court a second time and objected to any deviation from the guidelines. Each party apparently spoke as long as they wished and neither was interrupted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">When allocution had been completed, Judge Hocking began the formal pronouncement of sentence. Although the parties had scored the guidelines identically, it was immediately apparent that Judge Hocking had decided to lower the scoring. As he began to explain his justification for a lower score, Ms. Maas rose to her feet. Judge Hocking ordered Ms. Maas to sit down stating that it was his turn to speak and that Maas had a right to appeal anything she considered improper. The following colloquy ensued at this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\"><em>Ms. Maas: </em>Your Honor, if I can just indicate: the Guidelines were not contested by Mr. McIntyre, and I had case law which I could present . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\"><em>The Court: </em>I have . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\"><em>Mr. McIntyre: </em>... to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\"><em>The Court: . . . </em>already told you that the <em>Milboume </em>[sic] \u2014 sit down. I\u2019m talking, and I\u2019m not done. And you\u2019re not going to interrupt me. If you don\u2019t like what I say, appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\"><em>Ms. Maas: </em>Your Honor, I just feel that it is my duty to bring before the Court . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-12\"><em>The Court: </em>Fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-13\"><em>Ms. Maas: . . . </em>additional case law . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-14\"><em>The Court: </em>Bring it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-15\"><em>Mr. McIntyre: </em>... on the specific issue that . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-16\"><em>The Court: </em>You bring it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-17\"><em>Ms. Maas: . . . </em>his Court raised before and . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-18\"><em>The Court: </em>You bring it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-19\"><em>Ms. Maas: . . . </em>I\u2019ve been denied my opportunity before this Court to raise it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-20\"><em>The Court: </em>Overruled. Sit down. The <em>Milboume </em>case makes it very clear that whether you say anything or whether he says anything, it\u2019s my job to fashion a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>that is proportionate, and it\u2019s my job to talk and to make comments, suggestions, about the Michigan Sentencing Guidelines, and I\u2019m going to do that, whether you like it or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The commission unanimously concurred with the master\u2019s finding, that \u201c [unfortunately, in this instance, as well as in another,[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] courtesy was lost and rudeness took over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">We agree, and Judge Hocking does not dispute,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that he clearly lost his temper in this exchange and that he should have handled the interruption in a less acrimonious manner. As we have observed, however, every angry retort or act of discourtesy during the course of a proceeding does not amount to judicial misconduct. The facts of each instance must be evaluated separately, and a judge is only subject to discipline when the comment amounts to \u201cconduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice . . . .\u201d MCR 9.205(E).</p>\n<p id=\"ANf\">Having reviewed the videotape of the <em>Hensick </em>sentencing, we find that the exchange with Ms. Maas was not clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice. Ms. Maas was given two opportunities to fully advise the court of her views on the sentence. Obviously distressed by the direction she saw the judge was taking, she interrupted the pronouncement of sentence. Lapses in decorum sometimes occur when attorneys are startled by a judge\u2019s action, and Ms. Maas\u2019 reaction is understandable. However, the interruption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>sentencing was clearly a breach of the unwritten rules of courtroom etiquette, and Judge Hocking\u2019s reaction, while overly strong, is also understandable. Having been given an unlimited opportunity to present her views, Ms. Maas breached courtroom convention by interrupting the judge during the one portion of a criminal trial when by tradition and custom a judge speaks without interruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The third charge of misconduct involves conduct occurring outside a judicial proceeding that followed the <em>Hensick </em>trial. The amended complaint alleged that Judge Hocking filed an unwarranted grievance against attorney Bonnie Miller to retaliate for the request for investigation she had filed with the commission on behalf of the Livingston Area Council Against Spouse Abuse (lacasa). The request for investigation was signed by all lacasa board members, and the cover letter was signed by Ms. Miller. The complaint arose from Judge Hocking\u2019s handling of the <em>Hensick </em>sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">A great deal of controversy erupted in the immediate wake of the <em>Hensick </em>sentencing. Judge Hocking\u2019s justifications for departing downward were cited in the local and national media as evidence that he was grossly deficient in gender sensitivity. Ms. Miller was a vocal critic of Judge Hocking\u2019s comments, and an interview with her appeared in a tabloid called the <em>Weekly World News.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The <em>World News </em>article contained quotes from Ms. Miller that suggested that Judge Hocking imposed a lenient sentence because he had attended law school with the defendant\u2019s brother and that Judge Hocking delayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ruling on the motion for a new trial in an attempt to dissuade the victim from testifying at a subsequent trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Asserting that the article was defamatory, Judge Hocking filed a request for investigation with the Attorney Grievance Commission. The commission notified Ms. Miller of the request for an investigation and asked that Miller file an answer. In her response, Ms. Miller explained that while she had spoken with a reporter about the case, the reporter mischaracterized her statements and inaccurately quoted her comments out of context. After reviewing Ms. Miller\u2019s response and investigating the matter further, the commission dismissed the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The master concluded, and the Judicial Tenure Commission accepted and adopted the master\u2019s conclusion, that Judge Hocking filed the grievance against Ms. Miller in retaliation for her role in filing the lacasa grievance. The commission quoted the master\u2019s finding that \u201c \u2018certainly there was no basis to file such a grievance; and filing such a grievance constitutes a failure to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety, in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2(A).\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">A request for investigation with the Attorney Grievance Commission is a proper response to arguably defamatory statements made by attorneys. Direct response by the judge in the media is itself problematic. Regardless of the merits of the dispute, a media war of words may erode public confidence in the judiciary. Further, depending on the context and substance of a public response, the judge may expose himself to charges of ethical violations. See Canon 3A(6).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>The preponderance of the evidence does not support the conclusion that Judge Hocking filed the grievance for retaliatory purposes. The Judicial Tenure Commission found that the record \u201cindicates that Respondent filed the grievance . . . simply to \u2018get even\u2019 with Ms. Miller . ...\u201d We find no record basis for the finding that the respondent filed the grievance to get even. To the contrary, if, as the record indicates, Judge Hocking believed that Ms. Miller recklessly made defamatory statements against him, Rule 8.3(a)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> of the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct imposed on him a duty to report Ms. Miller\u2019s conduct to the Attorney Grievance Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">We decline to endorse the commission\u2019s implicit rationale that unless the commission finds independent justification for a grievance, the grievance was filed for retaliatory purposes. There may be situations in which the filing of a grievance is so patently frivolous as to evidence ill will on the part of the complainant. The record in this case does not present such a situation. The Attorney Grievance Commission did not treat the grievance as insufficient or patently frivolous,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> but instead conducted an investigation. Although the commission even<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>tually dismissed the grievance because Ms. Miller denied the context of the statements cited in the <em>Weekly World News </em>article, if Ms. Miller had acknowledged that the article was accurate, it is possible that the commission would have found grounds for discipline. There being no record evidence that the grievance was filed to \u201cget even,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> or any basis for an inference that it was so motivated, we find no misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The final charge of misconduct relates to Judge Hocking\u2019s behavior in the postjudgment custody proceedings in <em>McPherson v McPherson, </em>Eaton Circuit Court, File No. 82-409-DM. The amended complaint alleged that Judge Hocking was intemperate and abusive with respect to attorney Elaine Sharp and that he abused his contempt power.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Ms. Sharp represented the father in the proceedings and appeared before Judge Hocking on December 5, 1991, to challenge the court\u2019s previous ruling terminating joint custody. Speaking in a harsh tone, Judge Hocking quickly informed Ms. Sharp that he perceived the motion before the court as simply a disguised second motion for rehearing. He demanded to know in what way the motion was new. As Ms. Sharp attempted to argue the merits of the motion, Judge Hocking quickly interrupted her, ruled that the motion was nothing more than a motion for reconsideration, and awarded costs and attorney fees as punishment for filing a frivolous motion. The following excerpt illustrates the caustic and abusive exchange between Judge Hocking and Ms. Sharp:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>The Court: </em>I\u2019m not going to get into the merits.

We agree with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>After reviewing the audiotape of the <em>McPherson </em>hearing, it is readily apparent that Judge Hocking\u2019s behavior was shockingly injudicious. Unlike the exchange with Ms. Maas in <em>Hensick, </em>we find that Judge Hocking instigated a confrontational exchange with Ms. Sharp by challenging her to tell him why her motion was not the frivolous action he clearly had predetermined it was, made caustic comments in an abusive tone, and personally attacked Ms. Sharp, conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct. Unlike the exchange with Ms. Maas, in which Judge Hocking was abrupt and briefly abrasive, the entire exchange with Ms. Sharp illustrates a total lack of self-control and an antagonistic mind-set predisposed to unfavorable disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Attorney Sharp acted improperly in arguing the merits of the motion when she had been instructed not to do so and in continuing to argue after the court had ruled. Fortunately, such behavior is rare, but a judge has undoubted authority to control runaway behavior up to and including contempt. To hold that a trial judge may not express strong displeasure or even anger, would ignore the reality that the potential for such reactions induces a level of civility in the process, without which the system literally could not function.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">However, in this incident, in which Judge Hocking also admits he was rude and discourteous, we find misconduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. We adopt the master\u2019s findings and affirm the commission\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>vn</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Finally, while not charged as a separate allegation in the complaint, the master made an explicit finding that Judge Hocking\u2019s actions did not illustrate gender bias. The commission found \u201ca strong indication of gender bias in Respondent\u2019s conduct, but since the complaint did not formally charge a pattern of gender bias, we [the Commission] make no findings in this regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Although evidence of gender bias certainly would be grounds for discipline,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we cannot conclude that the record in this case establishes such prejudice. The fact that attorneys Maas and Sharp are both women and both happen to have been the object of respondent\u2019s anger does not evidence a discriminatory pattern. We strongly suspect that had the attorneys in these situations been male, Judge Hocking would have reacted in the same fashion. Thus, because the complaint did not charge, and the evidence does not establish, gender bias, we agree that such a conclusion is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">vm</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In assessing the appropriate sanction in judicial disciplinary proceedings, our primary charge is to fashion a penalty that maintains the honor and the integrity of the judiciary, deters similar conduct, and furthers the administration of justice. See <em>In re Seitz, </em>441 Mich 590, 624; 495 NW2d 559 (1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">The purpose of judicial discipline is to protect the court system and the public it serves from unacceptable judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>behavior. The discipline to be imposed, then, is to be determined by the extent of the protection needed, based upon the seriousness of the judge\u2019s misconduct and the likelihood that it would recur. <em>[In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Gorenstein, </em>147 Wis 2d 861, 873; 434 NW2d 603 (1989).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">We must carefully maintain the distinction between protection and punishment. In disciplining Judge Hocking it is not our intention to obstruct any judge\u2019s ability to exercise judicial discretion or freedom of thought and expression, as long as such exercise does not blemish the fair administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Although we do not condone Judge Hocking\u2019s intemperate language in addressing Ms. Maas during the sentencing proceeding, or his inept expression of his reasons for finding mitigating circumstances in the <em>Hensick </em>incident, we find that these comments, individually or in combination, do not constitute judicial misconduct. Nor can we conclude that the request for investigation filed against Ms. Miller constitutes misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The scathing attack on Ms. Sharp during the <em>McPherson </em>hearing clearly constitutes misconduct in violation of Canons 1,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>2A,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> 2B,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> 3A(3),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> 3A(8)<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> of the Code of Judicial Conduct and was clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice. MCR 9.205(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Judges demand respect for and responsibility to the law. But respect for those who are officers of the law, on whose shoulders the consent of the governed ultimately rests, cannot be simply commanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Judges must be examples of responsible behavior. The process of self-mastery through which a judge strives to approach the judicial ideal requires us to exercise the power we are given over others by seeing ourselves as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>those who must trust us do. If the mirror we hold before us reflects a person who uses authority as an experiment in the use of power or as displacement for personal disappointment, introspection is necessary and correction is essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u201c[T]he respect due . . . judicial officers\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> has been earned by the men and women who, for more than two-hundred years, have borne with honor and dignity the burden of bringing order to civic life in the courtrooms of our republic. Respect for the judiciary is a legacy that each generation of judges must nurture and foster in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that Judge Hocking\u2019s conduct in the Sharp incident merits the censure of a brief suspension. Judge Hocking is suspended without pay for three days effective the day following the date of issuance of the Court\u2019s judgment order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-6\">Brickley, C.J., and Riley, Mallett, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-10\"> The Judicial Tenure Commission was created by Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30(1), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">A judicial tenure commission is established consisting of nine persons selected for three-year terms as follows: Pour members shall be judges elected by the judges of the courts in which they serve; one shall be a court of appeals judge, one a circuit judge, one a probate judge and one a judge of a court of limited jurisdiction.

However, I would hold that Judge Hocking is not guilty of any judicial misconduct and would dismiss this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">I agree with the majority that Judge Hocking is not guilty of any judicial misconduct with respect to the <em>People v Hensick, </em>Livingston Circuit Court, File No. 91-6537-FC, sentencing proceeding. However, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion with respect to Judge Hocking\u2019s conduct during the <em>McPherson v McPherson, </em>Eaton Circuit Court, File No. 82-409-DM, proceeding. After listening to the audiotape of the hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ing, it becomes clear from the exchange with Ms. Sharp that Judge Hocking had read her motion before taking the bench. As the majority notes, \u201cJudge Hocking quickly informed Ms. Sharp that he perceived the motion before the court as simply a- disguised second motion for rehearing.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 20. I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation that Judge Hocking \u201cinstigated a confrontational exchange with Ms. Sharp . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. Instead of answering Judge Hocking\u2019s question about what was \u201cnew\u201d in this motion, Ms. Sharp continued to argue the merits. It was after her refusal to answer his question by continuing to argue the merits that Judge Hocking denied her motion. At that point, I find that Ms. Sharp\u2019s behavior became \u201cshockingly\u201d unprofessional.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Ideally, a judge should not instigate or engage in confrontational behavior or react to such behavior \u2014 no matter how provoked. Yet, every attorney who regularly appears before the judges of our state \u2014 judges who are forced to operate with limited resources and under great pressure from the docket \u2014 will immediately recognize that outbursts like Judge Hocking\u2019s are far from infrequent. Most judges wrestle with their self-control, and all hear motions they are predisposed against and antagonistic toward. I join the majority in wishing we could populate our courtrooms with judges devoid of temper and full of angelic patience. But if such perfect creatures exist, their planetary origin is truly unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">This practical observation means the Court either says today what it does not mean, or will not do tomorrow what it says today. Inevitably, the interpretation of today\u2019s new standard pressed on Judge Hocking will never be applied so stringently again. If it were, our docket would be clogged with similar cases. Judge Hocking will have been censured under a standard designed uniquely for him, a result so contrary to our role as judges that <em>perhaps </em>this holding itself is prejudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>cial to the administration of justice, although not clearly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Despite our lofty expectations, some judges from time to time will stumble. From the record before me, I see evidence that Judge Hocking lost his temper only once at one attorney who was herself discourteous and contemptuous. If Judge Hocking regularly behaved this way, routinely raising his voice at advocates and closing his mind to their arguments, the administration of justice would indeed be in jeopardy. This isolated incident, although cause for concern, poses no such threat. The majority properly dismisses the allegation of misconduct during the <em>Hensick </em>proceedings because of its isolated nature. I would urge the same reasoning be applied to place the incident with Ms. Sharp in its proper perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Judges play a central role in our system of justice and therefore are appropriately held to exceptionally high standards of conduct. I would emphasize that Judge HocMng\u2019s behavior should not be excused. Judges should struggle to maintain their temperament and view the cases before them unobscured by passion. When violations of this standard are drastic or repeated, we should not hesitate to censure them. But, we do the judiciary a disservice when we condemn human failings as judicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">An isolated incident of rudeness should be identified, privately reprimanded, and hopefully prevented from recurring. Such an incident is not, however, \u201cclearly prejudicial to the administration of justice,\u201d MCR 9.205(C)(4), and should not be the subject of any suspension from the state\u2019s highest court.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Therefore, I would reject the recommendation of the Judicial Tenure Commission.</p>\n<judges id=\"b153-9\">Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
