We conclude that the rebuttal evidence was properly admitted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, but for the reasons stated in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In August of 1981, Linda Figgures married defendant. Unfortunately, the marriage was a troubled one that ended in divorce on November 22, 1989. On the evening of February 2, 1990, defendant arrived at the Figgures\u2019 house and began to pound on the living room, dining room, and bedroom windows. Fearing for her life, Ms. Figgures telephoned the police. As she was giving the police her location, the phone went dead. Shortly thereafter, defendant entered through the front door.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He kicked in a bedroom door and confronted Ms. Figgures. According to Ms. Figgures, defendant held a hammer above his head and violently swung it at her. She responded by taking a baseball bat and jamming it in his stomach. A struggle ensued, and Ms. Figgures was thrown backward across a table onto a couch. Defendant fled when the police arrived. The arriving police officers observed the broken door and the cut telephone wires.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Defendant, however, tells another story. He admits that he was not on the best terms with his ex-wife and that he had come over on the night in question to get some of his possessions. He testified that he still had a key to the front door and he used it to let himself in. After exchanging words with the complainant, he admits that he knocked down the bedroom door.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He claims that as a result of this entry, his hammer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>fell from his tool belt. As he was picking it up and placing it into his tool belt, the complainant struck him with a baseball bat. Upon seeing the police, he fled. Defendant contends that he had no intention of committing any felony at this house and his only reason for being there was to retrieve some of his possessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Subsequently, defendant was captured by the police and brought to trial. At trial, the prosecutor questioned him about the police reports and injunctions that were filed against him. Defendant maintained that this line of questioning was improper and overly prejudicial. However, the judge allowed it. The prosecutor then offered a sealed criminal ex parte injunction against defendant, which was accepted. The judge instructed the jury that this evidence was only to be used to rebut defendant\u2019s claim that he and Ms. Figgures were getting along.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The jury found defendant guilty of breaking and entering an occupied dwelling with intent to commit felonious assault, and defendant was sentenced to seven to fifteen years in prison. Defendant, however, pleaded guilty to being a third-felony offender. As a result, Muskegon Circuit Court Judge R. Max Daniels vacated the earlier sentence and imposed a prison term of seven to thirty years. The Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction in an unpublished per curiam opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">Although the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the prosecutor to engage in improper rebuttal, we conclude, on the record before us, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. [Unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 1, 1994 (Docket No. 131600), p L]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Defendant petitioned this Court for leave to appeal, which was granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The essence of this case at trial revolved around whether defendant intended to commit a felony once he broke into the house. Defendant argued that he had no intent to commit such a felony and that he went to the house only to retrieve his possessions. On direct examination, he testified that, since their divorce, he and complainant had made attempts at reconciling.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\"><em>Q. </em>After you moved, did you maintain any contact with Linda?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\"><em>A. </em>Yes, most definitely I did maintain contact with Linda. Linda was at my residence quite frequently and I was at her residence frequently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\"><em>Q. </em>Did you ever try to reconcile with Linda?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\"><em>A. </em>Oh, yes. We tried to reconcile a number of times, and what would seem to happen was that we would get back together and it would be ten, twenty days or so and we would be separated again. At my own volition I would just leave again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\"><em>Q. </em>Did that pattern continue up to February of this year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-12\"><em>A. </em>Yes, it did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\"><em>Q. </em>Can you give me the last couple times that you stayed for any length of time at Linda\u2019s house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-14\"><em>A. </em>I stayed at Linda\u2019s house December 8 of 1989 until December 21st of 1989. I stayed there January the 2nd of 1990 until January 20th or so of 1990.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-15\"><em>Q. </em>While you were back in December and January, did you have any of your property on the premises?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>A. </em>Yes, I did. I had clothing there and I also had all my bedroom outfit (sic). I had my dishes, just extensive amount of clothing, my bedroom suite, dishes, a couple of chairs. I had a bench that I had made for my stereo unit, also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\"><em>Q. </em>OK. During that period of time where [sic] you sleeping at that house \u2014 sleeping at that place on Sixth Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\"><em>A. Yes, I most definitely was sleeping with Linda. We were having a conjugal relationship. It was just like being back in my marriage. I was trying to get back together with Linda and see if we couldn\u2019t work our problems out. </em>I was seeing if we couldn\u2019t in fact go through some counseling and alleviate the problems that existed between us. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">According to defendant, this reconciliation process began soon after their separation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\"><em>Q. </em>Just for clarification, you testified that you were trying to reconcile your marriage in December of \u201889?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\"><em>A. </em>Yes. At the time that I was living with Linda, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\"><em>Q. </em>And you were trying to reconcile in July, in any previous months?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\"><em>A. </em>Yes. Linda \u2014 Yes. Linda saw me quite frequently. Linda was at my residence quite a few times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-13\"><em>Q. </em>When did this start?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-14\"><em>A. </em>This has been ongoing ever since our separation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor attempted to impeach defendant\u2019s testimony by asking if there were police reports filed against him showing that he and the complainant were <em>not </em>on happy terms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>Q. </em>Isn\u2019t it true in fact that you have been harassing her over the past year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\"><em>A. </em>No, it is not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\"><em>Q. </em>That you have been following her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\"><em>A. </em>No, I haven\u2019t been following her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\"><em>Q. </em>That there have been several police reports made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\"><em>A. </em>There has [sic] been police reports.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">The prosecutor then submitted as evidence an ex parte criminal injunction filed against defendant on December 18, 1989.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant contends that this manner of impeachment was improper because on cross-examination he had admitted that he and complainant had their ups and downs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\"><em>Q. So </em>you are not saying that you were rocky \u2014 In July you were rocky, also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\"><em>A. </em>Yes. We were having a rocky relationship, but Linda always tended to come back to me or find me or come over to my house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-12\"><em>Q. </em>What do you mean when you say \u201crocky\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-13\"><em>A. </em>What do I mean when I say \u201crocky\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-14\"><em>Q. </em>Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-15\"><em>A. </em>We had our ups and downs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">Defendant contends that this admission prevented the prosecutor from being able to impeach him. We disagree. Defendant testified at length that he and complainant were reconciling and, in fact, had lived together amicably on two separate occasions: December 8 to 21, 1989, and January 2 to 20, 1990. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>described these times in a favorable light comparing it to marriage.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">\n<em>Yes, I most definitely was sleeping with Linda. We were having a conjugal relationship. It was just like being back in my marriage.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Even though defendant admitted that he had a \u201crocky\u201d relationship with complainant this did not change the essence of his testimony on direct examination regarding their reconciliation. Consequently, the prosecutor was justified in rebutting defendant\u2019s portrayal.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Admission of rebuttal evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>People v DeLano, </em>318 Mich 557, 570; 28 NW2d 909 (1947); <em>People v Wilson, </em>55 Mich 506; 21 NW 905 (1885). Because the scope of rebuttal is based on the trial judge\u2019s discretionary authority to preclude the trial from filming into a trial of secondary issues, it is the trial court that must, of necessity, evaluate the overall impression that might have been created by the defense proofs. As the United States Supreme Court noted over twenty years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">A criminal trial does not unfold like a play with actors following a script; there is no scenario and can be none. The trial judge must meet situations as they arise and to do this must have broad power to cope with the complexities and contingencies inherent in the adversary process. To this end, he may determine generally the order in which parties will adduce proof; his determination will be reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>[Geders v United States, </em>425 US 80, 86; 96 S Ct 1330; 47 L Ed 2d 592 (1976).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>This discretion flows from the trial judge\u2019s authority to exclude evidence that is substantially more prejudicial than probative pursuant to MRE 403. See <em>People v Lavergne, 4 </em>Cal 3d 735; 94 Cal Rptr 405; 94 P2d 77 (1971); 22 Wright <em>&amp; </em>Graham, Federal Practice <em>&amp; </em>Procedure, \u00a7 5222, p 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Rebuttal evidence is admissible to \u201ccontradict, repel, explain or disprove evidence produced by the other party and tending directly to weaken or impeach the same.\u201d <em>DeLano, supra, </em>at 570, quoting <em>People v Utter, </em>217 Mich 74, 83; 185 NW 830 (1921). See <em>People v Kelly, </em>423 Mich 261, 281; 378 NW2d 365 (1985). The question whether rebuttal is proper depends on what proofs the defendant introduced and not on merely what the defendant testified about on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s insinuation, the test of whether rebuttal evidence was properly admitted is not whether the evidence could have been offered in the prosecutor\u2019s case in chief, but, rather, whether the evidence is properly responsive to evidence introduced or a theory developed by the defendant. <em>People v Bettistea, </em>173 Mich App 106; 434 NW2d 138 (1988); <em>Nolle v Port Huron Bd of Ed, </em>152 Mich App 637, 645; 394 NW2d 54 (1986). As long as evidence is responsive to material presented by the defense, it is properly classified as rebuttal, even if it overlaps evidence admitted in the prosecutor\u2019s case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Once defendant testified on direct examination that he and the complainant were \u201creconciling,\u201d in an attempt to create the impression with the jury that he would not have assaulted the complainant because the two had been living together and getting along well in the months before the illegal entry, \u201che <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>opened the door to the presentation of further evidence bearing on the actual state of their relationship . . . <em>People v Schwerbel, </em>638 NYS2d 198, 199 (NY App Div, 1996). The evidence introduced by the prosecutor responded to evidence and impressions raised by defendant during direct examination. Admission of the rebuttal evidence was within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and that discretion was not abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">This conclusion is further justified by defendant\u2019s specific denial of having harassed complainant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">. <em>Q. </em>Isn\u2019t it trae in fact that you have been harassing her over the past year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\"><em>A. </em>No, it is not true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">This blanket denial exposed him to impeachment. Thus, we conclude that the prosecutor had every right to use the injunctions and police reports to show that defendant had harassed the complainant by following her, punching her in the nose, and slashing her tires outside a restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Moreover, any concern that the injunctions were used improperly by the jury at trial is dispelled because of the cautionary instruction given by the trial judge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">I want to make something clear to the jury. It gets confusing here. These restraining orders \u2014 He is not charged with violation of the restraining order. He is not charged with any violation in connection with that. That\u2019s a different matter. That\u2019s a different court. The only purpose that these restraining orders were offered and the only reason I allowed them \u2014 to rebut his testimony that he said that we were reconciling and were getting along fine. That\u2019s the only purpose they\u2019re offered as to what was filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The dissent, however, argues that under <em>People v Losey, </em>413 Mich 346, 352; 320 NW2d 49 (1982), and <em>People v Bennett, </em>393 Mich 445, 449; 224 NW2d 840 (1975), it was error to admit this evidence. <em>Losey </em>and <em>Bennett </em>address</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">[t]he other generally applicable rule governing the admission of rebuttal testimony] \u2014 ]that \u201cthe device of eliciting a denial on cross-examination may not be used to inject a new issue into the case. Similarly, cross-examination cannot be used to revive the right to introduce evidence that could have been, but was not, introduced in the prosecutor\u2019s case in chief.\u201d <em>[Post </em>at 411.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Specifically, in <em>Losey, supra </em>at 351-352, this Court stated \u201cnothing in the defendant\u2019s case made [the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal evidence] any more relevant to [the issue the prosecutor made in the case in chief].\u201d Similarly, in <em>Bennett, supra </em>at 449, the Court noted that the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal evidence did not \u201cbear on an issue raised by the defense.\u201d These two situations simply are not relevant to the case at hand. While it is true that a denial cannot be elicited on cross-examination simply to facilitate the admission of new evidence, that is <em>not </em>what occurred here. On direct examination, defendant specifically stated that he was in the process of reconciling with complainant. Consequently, whether he was reconciling with her or harassing her at this time was already a part of the case <em>before </em>cross-examination. This line of questioning by the prosecutor did not inject a new issue into the case, instead, it served as the basis for a thorough and proper exploration regarding the veracity of defendant\u2019s prior testimony. As a result, the dissent\u2019s citation of <em>Losey </em>and <em>Bennett </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Assuming there was error in the admission of this evidence, which there was not, that error was not decisive of the outcome. This Court noted in <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535, 553; 520 NW2d 123 (1994), that where there is unpreserved<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> nonconstitutional plain error, the error will not be considered by an appellate court unless the error was decisive of the outcome or the case falls into the group of cases, yet to be defined, where prejudice is presumed or reversal automatic. Obviously, this case does not fit into the latter category.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Here, the error was not decisive of the outcome. It is undisputed that defendant broke into complainant\u2019s home. Defendant himself admitted this fact.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\"><em>Q. </em>The front door. What about the bedroom door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\"><em>A. </em>The bedroom door? I hit up against the bedroom door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\"><em>Q. </em>You hit up against it. What do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\"><em>A. </em>I hit up against it with my forearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\"><em>Q. </em>Enough to break the casing at the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-13\"><em>A. </em>The door opened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-14\"><em>Q. </em>The door opened. By your force?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-15\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I did force the door open.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Thus, there can be little dispute that defendant violently broke into complainant\u2019s bedroom. Numerous eyewitnesses substantially described the event in the same manner. Sandra Sladovnik, the complainant\u2019s daughter, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\"><em>Q. </em>Did he [defendant], before he went to the back door\u2014 did he go anyplace else around the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\"><em>A. </em>He just was walking around the house. First he went to the back door and knocked on the door and then he went to the window and was looking in the windows. While he was at the back door I told my mom that Ernie was at the back door banging on the door. That\u2019s when she called the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\"><em>Q. </em>So you heard a noise at the front door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\"><em>A. </em>Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\"><em>Q. </em>OK. And then what happened after words were exchanged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\"><em>A. </em>He came through my brothers\u2019 room. He kicked the door down through my brothers\u2019 room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-13\"><em>Q. </em>Were you in a position where you could see him kick the door down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-14\"><em>A. </em>I seen him kick the door down, yes. He didn\u2019t see from \u2014 where I was from the outside, but I seen him come through the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-16\"><em>Q. </em>What did you see her do with the bat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-17\"><em>A. </em>She was pushing, just trying to push him away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-18\">Q. And then what happened after she was pushing him with the bat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-19\"><em>A. </em>I guess \u2014 She got thrown over the table and the lamp and then the cops came and everything happened so quickly. My mom said, \u201cOh, good, the cops are here,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>then he just got scared or something and took off out the door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">James Crews, complainant\u2019s companion that evening, testified about the swinging of the hammer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\"><em>Q. </em>And can you tell \u2014 did he have anything in his hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\"><em>A. </em>He had a hammer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\"><em>Q. </em>And how was he holding the hammer as he went through that door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\"><em>A. </em>When he come in the door \u2014 in the door \u2014 he was raising the hammer. I don\u2019t know if he was going to go at her or me. I don\u2019t know which one, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\"><em>Q. </em>Was he looking at you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\"><em>A. </em>I couldn\u2019t really say. Couldn\u2019t say right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\"><em>Q. </em>And was he saying anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-12\"><em>A. </em>Was saying something, but I don\u2019t remember what it was, but I do know the hammer was raised a couple of times and I don\u2019t know if it was coming after me or her, but she had the bat to try to protect herself from the hammer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-13\"><em>Q. </em>Was he swinging the hammer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-14\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-15\"><em>Q. </em>How many times did you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-16\"><em>A. </em>I saw at least twice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-17\"><em>Q. </em>And what \u2014 How did Linda respond to the swinging of the hammer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-18\"><em>A. </em>She kind of jabbed the bat at him and I think, from what I saw, when the bat went she was back on the floor and knocked over the lamp and the table right there and then- \u2014 and by that time that\u2019s when the cops, the policemen, appeared.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-19\">Michael Davis, Sandra Sladovnik\u2019s boyfriend, testified similarly.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-20\"><em>Q. </em>What did you first see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-21\"><em>A. </em>I saw Mr. Figgures enter the room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-22\"><em>Q. </em>Did he have anything in his hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>A. </em>Yes. He had a hammer in his hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\"><em>Q. </em>How was he holding the hammer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\"><em>A. </em>Like above his head (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\"><em>Q. </em>Did you see him swing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\"><em>Q. </em>In what manner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">A. In a manner that he wanted to cause some serious injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\"><em>Q. </em>Can you show the jury how he was swinging the hammer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-12\"><em>A. </em>He had it above his head.

The contested legal issue at trial was defendant\u2019s intent in doing so. The prosecution\u2019s theory was that defendant broke into the home with the intent to assault the complainant. Defendant\u2019s theory was that, after numerous unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, he realized their relationship was over and that he went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>to his former wife\u2019s residence solely for the purpose of reclaiming items of his personal property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The prosecution theory also included the allegation that defendant attempted to assault the complainant with a hammer.

Under th\u00e9 circumstances of this case, I believe that there is a reasonable probability that the evidentiary errors affected the outcome of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">I agree with the unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeals panel that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting improper rebuttal evidence. I also agree with Judge Griffin\u2019s conclusion that the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">\u201cRebuttal testimony may be used to \u2018contradict, repel, explain or disprove evidence produced by the other party and tending directly to weaken or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>impeach the same.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Kelly, </em>423 Mich 261, 281; 378 NW2d 365 (1985), quoting <em>People v DeLano, </em>318 Mich 557, 570; 28 NW2d 909 (1947), cert den 334 US 818 (1948). The other generally applicable rule<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> governing the admission of rebuttal testimony is that \u201cthe device of eliciting a denial on cross-examination may not be used to inject a new issue into the case. Similarly, cross-examination\u2019 cannot be used to revive the right to introduce evidence that could have been, but was not, introduced in the prosecutor\u2019s case in chief.\u201d <em>People v Losey, </em>413 Mich 346, 352; 320 NW2d 49 (1982), citing <em>People v Bennett, </em>393 Mich 445, 449; 224 NW2d 840 (1975). This rule against division of the prosecution\u2019s evidence is well established in our case law. See <em>People v Quick, </em>58 Mich 321, 322-323; 25 NW 302 (1885), setting forth the rule that the prosecution may not divide the evidence supporting its case by saving some of it for rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">I am persuaded, as were all three judges on the Court of Appeals panel, that the trial judge\u2019s admission of the police reports and ex parte injunctions as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>rebuttal evidence was clearly erroneous. The prosecutor offered the police reports \u201cfor the purpose to rebut [defendant\u2019s] testimony. He said that they were peaceful together during the period of July through January.\u201d The court then ruled: \u201cI will allow that for that purpose . . . because he indicated they were reconciling during that period of time and they were friendly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">As the transcript excerpt clearly shows, the trial judge mistakenly characterized defendant\u2019s testimony. Defendant testified that he was <em>trying </em>to reconcile with his ex-wife, not that they were in fact reconciling.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And, more importantly, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s statement, \u201cYou were friendly with Linda [defendant\u2019s ex-wife]. You were on a good, congenial, happy relationship with her in July,\u201d defendant immediately responded, \u201cNo, we weren\u2019t. Our relationship ever since our separation has been quite rocky. Our whole marriage for the last few years has been quite rocky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Defendant never indicated that he and his ex-wife were friendly. In fact, his testimony was directly contrary to the trial judge\u2019s characterization of it. Therefore, the trial judge committed a clear error and his admission of the rebuttal evidence was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The majority cites an excerpt from defendant\u2019s testimony on direct examination that contains the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you ever try to reconcile with Linda?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u201cA Oh, yes. We tried to reconcile a number of times, and what would seem to happen was that we would get back together and it would be ten, twenty days or so and we would be separated again.\u201d <em>[Ante, </em>p 395.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Unaccountably, however, the majority ignores defendant\u2019s actual words and asserts that he \u201ctestified at length that he and [his ex-wife] <em>were </em>reconciling . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>p 397. The majority notes defendant\u2019s statement that the interludes of attempted reconciliation were \u201cjust like being back in my marriage,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 398, but alters defendant\u2019s meaning by asserting that defendant \u201cdescribed these times in a favorable light,\u201d <em>id., </em>thereby putting its own idyllic gloss on defendant\u2019s statement, a gloss not borne out by the actual marital history, as the majority is aware: \u201cUnfortunately, the marriage was a troubled one . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 393. On the basis of defendant\u2019s actual testimony and intended meaning, the evidence at issue here was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument that even if the police reports and ex parte injunctions were improperly admitted as rebuttal evidence, their admission was proper under MRE 404(b) and <em>People v VanderVliet, </em>444 Mich 52; 508 NW2d 114 (1993), is without merit. Plaintiff asserts that this \u201cevidence was relevant to Defendant\u2019s motive, the truth of his testimony on direct examination, and credibility of the complaining witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Even assuming the admitted rebuttal evidence is relevant to motive (which I do only for purposes of this analysis), it would still violate the prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>against division of the prosecution\u2019s evidence. And because, as plaintiff is obviously well aware, \u201c[t]he ex-wife\u2019s refusal to release Defendant\u2019s property back to him, and Defendant\u2019s knowledge that his ex-wife was dating another man provide motive for Defendant to commit the [alleged] assault,\u201d the rebuttal evidence constitutes \u201cneedless presentation of cumulative evidence,\u201d and, in this case, \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . .\u201d MRE 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The same analysis applies to the alleged admissibility of this evidence as being relevant to the issues of the truthfulness of defendant\u2019s testimony on direct examination and the. credibility of the complaining witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The mere fact that the complainant filed ex parte police reports and obtained ex parte injunctions does not directly rebut any portion of defendant\u2019s testimony. That testimony was that they were <em>\u201ctrying </em>to reconcile,\u201d always unsuccessfully, and not, as the majority would have it, that they had in fact reconciled and recovered some never-existent connubial bliss. Furthermore, the reports and injunctions are substantively inadmissible because they are hearsay. And to the extent the evidence at issue here relates to the credibility of the complainant, who was called as a witness only in the prosecutor\u2019s case in chief, it violates the rule of <em>Losey, supra, </em>and is therefore improper.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Plaintiff argues that the issue of the admission of the ex parte criminal injunctions is not properly before this Court because defendant failed to object specifically to those documents. Were I forced to confront this argument, I would find defendant\u2019s objection readily discernible from the relevant context.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> MRE 103(a)(1). However, I rely on the following provision of the Michigan Rules of Evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court. [MRE 103(d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">This Court recently acknowledged \u201cthat the distinction between issue preservation and harmless error has not been clearly defined.\u201d <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535, 552; 520 NW2d 123 (1994). We then established a rule \u201cwhich first requires assessing the merits of an issue presented for the first time on appeal,\u201d <em>id., </em>and ultimately held that \u201ca plain, <em>unpreserved </em>error may not be considered by an appellate court for the first time on appeal unless the error could have been decisive of the outcome . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553 (emphasis in original). Therefore, because witness credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>was the crucial factor in the evidence presented to the jury, I would hold that the plain error committed by the trial court could have been decisive of the outcome. Accordingly, this issue is properly before this Court. See also <em>People v George, </em>213 Mich App 632; 540 NW2d 487 (1995), holding that substantial rights of the defendant were affected because credibility was the critical issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The majority misreads the rule articulated in <em>Grant. </em>The standard is not whether the error <em>was </em>decisive of the outcome (as the majority would have it), <em>ante, </em>p 402, but whether the error <em>could have been </em>decisive of the outcome (as five members of this Court established in <em>Grant, </em>445 Mich 553). And regardless of the standard used, the majority\u2019s application of it would be flawed because of the improper incursion on the exclusive realm of the factfinder: evaluation of credibility. The majority quotes prosecution witnesses at length and simply asserts that the testimony of these witnesses substantially and irrefutably disproves defendant\u2019s version of events. This is an inappropriate exercise of appellate review.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In detennining whether the trial court\u2019s plain error was harmless, \u201c[o]ur responsibility is to determine how the error might have affected the jury\u2019s decision. The inquiry is \u2018what effect the error had or reasonably may be taken to have had upon the jury\u2019s decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Young (After Remand), </em>425 Mich 470, 505; 391 NW2d 270 (1986). If it is clear that the erroneous admission of the evidence did not prejudice defendant, then the error is harmless. <em>Id. </em>And the burden of proving that defendant suffered no prejudice must be borne, as it has been since the formulation of the original common-law harmless error rule, by the beneficiary of the error. See <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18, 24; 87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967), stating that, at common law, the \u201cbeneficiary of the error [had] either to prove that there was no injury or to suffer a reversal of his erroneously obtained judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">This case presented a classic credibility contest. In quantitative terms, defendant was at an obvious disadvantage because he was the sole witness testifying in support of his version of events, while the prosecution had the complainant and three other persons with obvious loyalties to the complainant as witnesses. Therefore, defendant\u2019s credibility was the crux of his defense, a fact that heightens the prosecutor\u2019s burden to prove that there clearly is no reasonable possibility that the challenged evidence might have contributed to the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">I would hold that plaintiff has not met its burden. I think it manifestly reasonable to assume that the offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>cial nature of \u201cpolice reports\u201d and \u201ccriminal injunctions\u201d might cause the average juror to give such evidence substantial credence, which, in this case, would have significantly undermined defendant\u2019s credibility, thereby contributing to the conviction. And I also think it reasonable to assume that the jurors would not be aware of the ex parte nature of these documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The majority opines that the jury could not have improperly used this erroneously admitted evidence \u201cbecause of the cautionary instruction given by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 400. The judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">I want to make something clear to the jury. It gets confusing here. These restraining orders \u2014 He is not charged with violation of the restraining order. He is not charged with any violation in connection with that. That\u2019s a different matter. That\u2019s a different court. The only purpose that these restraining orders were offered and the only reason I allowed <em>them' </em>\u2014 to <em>rebut his testimony that he said that we were reconciling and were getting along fine. </em>That\u2019s the only purpose they\u2019re offered as to what was filed. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">In fact, this instraction virtually ensured that the jurors would improperly use this evidence because it instructed them to treat the evidence as substantive proof rebutting defendant\u2019s consistently mischaracterized testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">My opinion in this regard should not be read as an assertion that the improperly admitted evidence <em>did </em>contribute to the conviction, but, rather, only that plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of proving that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>it is clear there is no reasonable possibility that this improperly admitted evidence might have contributed to the conviction. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b543-8\">Brickley, C.J., and Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-9\"> MCL 750.110; MSA 28.305.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-10\"> Defendant originally received a sentence of seven to fifteen years for the underlying charge, but, after pleading guilty to the supplemental information charging him with habitual offender, third offense, that sentence was vacated and defendant was resentenced to the seven- to thirty-year term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b532-19\"> On cross-examination, the complainant testified that defendant had left some record albums and a television set at the residence, but claimed that they became her property when defendant failed to pick them up by a date allegedly established by a Judge Kobza.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\"> The majority refers to my alleged \u201cinsinuation\u201d that <em>the </em>test for whether rebuttal evidence was properly admitted is whether that evidence could have been offered in the prosecutor\u2019s case in chief. <em>Ante, </em>p 399. This aspect of the majority\u2019s analysis is regrettable in three respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The word \u201cother\u201d signifies to any objective reader that the referent of that word, in this case the word \u201crule,\u201d is only one of two applicable rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Second, the majority\u2019s alternative statement of <em>the </em>rule conveniently ignores the fact that I had already cited the rule that rebuttal evidence must respond to evidence actually offered by the opposing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Finally, the majority neglects the fact that in support of my citation of this \u201cother generally applicable rule\u201d I cite opinions of <em>this </em>Court (of both recent and venerable vintage), whereas the majority relies on decisions of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\"> This is true of defendant\u2019s testimony on both direct and cross-examination. See majority opinion, <em>ante, </em>pp 395-396.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\"> The majority\u2019s contention that <em>Losey </em>and <em>Bennett </em>are \u201csimply not relevant to the case at hand,\u201d <em>ante, </em>p 401, cannot stand unless one accepts the majority\u2019s characterization of defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\"> Referring to the criminal injunctions, defense counsel stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">If they are in fact admissible in regards to what she is trying to impeach, then I will not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The injunctions, like the police reports, were offered to rebut defendant\u2019s alleged testimony that he and his ex-wife were \u201cfriendly\u201d or <em>\"peacefully </em>living together\u201d during the relevant periods of time. As already noted, this characterization of defendant\u2019s testimony, subscribed to by the trial judge, the prosecutor, and the majority of this Court, is erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\"> In support of the improper conclusion that \u201cthe error was not decisive of the outcome,\u201d the majority also emphasizes that \u201c[i]t is undisputed that defendant broke into complainant\u2019s home. Defendant himself admitted this fact.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 402. The majority then dramatically concludes that \u201cthere can be little dispute that defendant violently broke into complainant\u2019s bedroom.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 403. It is of course true that defendant admitted breaking into his ex-wife\u2019s home. However, the majority\u2019s inference that this fact is probative of defendant\u2019s alleged intent to commit felonious assault is wholly inappropriate, as indeed is any inference by an appellate court from facts that can support an alternative theory. In this case, defendant\u2019s admitted act of breaking into the home is equally probative of his theory that he was merely attempting to reclaim items of his personal property. This is especially true in the specific factual context of this case where it is equally undisputed that there were items of defendant\u2019s personal property in the home and that defendant was refused admission into the home.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
