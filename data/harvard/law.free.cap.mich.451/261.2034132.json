We hold that the trial court erred and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>error was not harmless. We reverse the Court of Appeals, vacate the convictions, and remand for new trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Codefendants Mark Barrera, Fred Johnson, and Patrick (Mike) Musall were prosecuted in a consolidated trial before three separate juries for the murder of Deborah Haynes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Another defendant, Matthew Copeland, was tried in a separate trial. The undisputed facts were that the victim was stabbed to death during the night of October 27, 1988, or in the early morning hours of October 28, 1988, in Balduck Park in Detroit. The victim was a part-time prostitute. The next morning, a passerby discovered the mostly nude body of the victim and the police were notified. The police discovered several items of clothing strewn about the area. An autopsy revealed that the victim had died of multiple stab wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">At first, the police investigation focused on the victim\u2019s live-in boyfriend who was also her pimp. Within a week, the investigation turned to the four defendants. During the course of the night of November 3, 1988, and into the early morning hours of November 4, 1988, all four defendants gave written state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>merits to the police. They revealed that they had been driving around in Barrera\u2019s car on October 27, 1988, and had picked up the victim. The four stated that they negotiated with her for sex. They proceeded to the park. All four further stated that Copeland did have oral sex with her and each defendant identified Copeland as the sole stabber. There were several additional facts that were in dispute, which will be discussed later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Each defendant\u2019s statement was used by the prosecution against him in the respective prosecutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Barrera, Musall, and Johnson called Copeland to testify at the consolidated trial. After Copeland asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to \u2022 testify, Barrera, Musall, and Johnson each sought to use Copeland\u2019s statement for exculpatory purposes under MRE 804(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Copeland alleged in his statement that the victim also had oral sex with Musall. Copeland admitted that he was acting under the influence of mescaline and alcohol, and that he began to believe that the victim was \u201cSpooner,\u201d his former girlfriend. He stated that he had previously caught his girlfriend having sex with someone else and that he had threatened to kill her if he caught her again. Copeland stated that while watching the victim and Musall having oral sex, he told the victim that he was going to kill her, and then he pulled a knife out of his sleeve and stabbed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The trial court refused to allow admission of Copeland\u2019s statement because it found that the statement was not against Copeland\u2019s penal interest and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>there was insufficient corroborating evidence of Copeland\u2019s statement. Barrera and Musall were convicted of first-degree felony murder by their respective juries and were sentenced accordingly to mandatory life in prison without parole. Johnson was acquitted by his jury. In a subsequent trial, Copeland was convicted by a jury of first-degree premeditated murder and was sentenced to mandatory life without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions of Barrera and Musall.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted leave to appeal limited to the issue whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the request of the two defendants to admit Copeland\u2019s confession. 448 Mich 868 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">At issue is the admissibility of Copeland\u2019s out-of-court statement, which Barrera and Musall proffered to prove the truth it asserted: that Copeland spontaneously acted alone in stabbing the victim. The defendants maintain that this hearsay statement falls within MRE 804(b)(3), the statement against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They additionally argue that exclusion of this evidence violated their federal due process right to present witnesses in their defense. <em>Chambers v </em>Mississippi, 410 US 284, 302; 93 S Ct 1038; 35 L Ed 2d 297 (1973); <em>Washington v Texas, </em>388 US 14, 19; 87 S Ct 1920; 18 L Ed 2d 1019 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>MRE 804(b) provides that if a declarant is unavailable, as defined in MRE 804(a), his out-of-court statement against interest may avoid the hearsay rule if certain thresholds are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We have previously considered MRE 804(b)(3) from the reverse position: where the prosecution seeks to use a statement against penal interest to <em>inculpate </em>a defendant. <em>People v Poole, </em>444 Mich 151; 506 NW2d 505 (1993); <em>People v Watkins, </em>438 Mich 627; 475 NW2d 727 (1991). Although many of the separate opinions in <em>Poole </em>and <em>Watkins </em>speculated about the requirements for use of a statement against penal interest to <em>exculpate </em>the defendant, we are now required to address the relevant issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">MRE 804(b)(3) is modeled after its Federal Evidentiary Rule 804(b)(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we can look to federal precedent for guidance. <em>Poole, </em>444 Mich 160-162.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">A. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We must first determine the appropriate standard of review for evaluating a trial court\u2019s decision to exclude a statement against penal interest offered under MRE 804(b)(3) to exculpate a defendant. Although many federal courts have tersely stated that the standard of review is abuse of discretion,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we find that there are four subissues that may be presented on review: (1) whether the declarant was unavailable, (2) whether the statement was against penal interest, (3) whether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would have believed the statement to be true, and (4) whether corroborating circumstances clearly indicated the trustworthiness of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">In the instant cases, we need not address the standard of review of a trial court\u2019s determination whether the declarant was unavailable at trial, because the prosecutor concedes that Copeland, who invoked his right not to testify, was unavailable. We find that the determination whether a \u201cstatement was against the declarant\u2019s penal interest presented \u00bf question of law.\u201d <em>United States v Bagley, </em>537 F2d 162, 165-166 (CA 5, 1976). Therefore, appellate review is de novo. See <em>United States v </em>Arthur, 949 F2d 211, 216 (CA 6, 1991) (no deference to the trial court\u2019s determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">We further find that the determination whether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s shoes would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>have believed the statement to be true and the determination whether circumstances sufficiently indicated the trustworthiness of the statement depend in part on the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and in part on its application of the legal standard to those facts. <em>Bagley, </em>537 F2d 166. Accordingly, like many federal courts, we will use a clearly erroneous standard in reviewing the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude the evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In exercising its discretion, the trial court must conscientiously consider the relationship between MRE 804(b)(3) and a defendant\u2019s constitutional due proces\u00e1 right to present exculpatory evidence. See <em>United States v Barrett, </em>539 F2d 244, 253 (CA 1, 1976). Likewise, appellate review necessarily requires a review of the importance of the statement to the defendant\u2019s theory of defense in determining whether the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">B. AGAINST PENAL INTEREST</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The next issue is the extent to which the declarant\u2019s statement must be against his penal interests, as defined by MRE 804(b)(3). That rule requires that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u201cstatement ... at the time of its making ... so far <em>tended </em>to subject the declarant to . . . criminal liability, .. . that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After reviewing federal cases that have applied the actual language enacted by Congress, we believe that the phrase \u201ctended to subject\u201d includes a broad scope of inculpatory statements. See, e.g., <em>United States v Satterfield, 572 </em>F2d 687, 691 (CA 9, 1978) (in enacting FRE 804[b][3], Congress rejected a restrictive approach by choosing the phrase \u201ctended to subject\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Federal case law has developed some general parameters that can guide our determination when a statement sufficiently \u201ctended to subject\u201d the declarant to criminal liability. First, the mere fact that the declarant invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify does not make the statement against penal interest. <em>United States v Thomas, </em>62 F3d 1332, 1338 (CA 11, 1995). On the other hand, statements against penal interest are not limited to direct confessions. <em>United States v Slaughter, </em>891 F2d 691, 698 (CA 9, 1989); <em>Barrett, </em>539 F2d 251 (it is sufficient if the statement would be \u201cimportant evidence\u201d against the declarant). Moreover, it is well established that a par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ticular piece of evidence need not by itself prove the declarant guilty. The proffered statement need only be \u201ca brick in the wall\u201d of proving the declarant\u2019s guilt. MRE 804(b)(3), like its federal counterpart, \u201cencompasses disserving statements by a declarant that would have probative value in a trial against the declarant.\u201d <em>United States v Thomas, </em>571 F2d 285, 288 (CA 5, 1978).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By the same token, the statement would be against the declarant\u2019s penal interest if it intensified his culpability, such as by shifting criminal liability away from the accused and toward the declarant. <em>United States v Lopez, 777 </em>F2d 543, 554 (CA 10, 1985). Furthermore, the statement need not have been incriminating on its face, as long as it was self-incriminating when viewed in context. <em>Williamson v United States, </em>512 US 594,_; 114 S Ct 2431, 2436-2437; 129 L Ed 2d 476 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">However, in order to be probative of the declarant\u2019s guilt, the statement must be against the declarant\u2019s interest in \u201ca real and tangible way.\u201d <em>Arthur, </em>949 F2d 216. It must actually assert the declarant\u2019s own culpability to some degree \u2014 -it cannot be a statement merely exculpating the accused. <em>United States v Oropeza, </em>564 F2d 316, 325 (CA 9, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Furthermore, as required by MRE 804(b)(3), a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s shoes must have realized that the statement could implicate the declarant in a crime. <em>Williamson, </em>114 S Ct 2437. This flows from the underlying rationale of the exception: the statement\u2019s reliability flows from the postulate that a reasonable person will not incriminate himself by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>admitting a damaging fact unless he believes that fact to be true. See 4 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Evidence, \u00b6 804(b)(3)[01], P 804-138. If the declarant faces no reasonable threat of punishment, the justification underlying the exception would not be met. <em>United States v Fowlie, </em>24 F3d 1059, 1068 (CA 9, 1994) (a statement made by a declarant while out of the country and facing no threat of punishment would not be against penal interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In short, whether a declarant\u2019s statement was sufficiently against penal interest is whether the statement would be probative of an element of a crime in a trial against the declarant, and whether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would have realized the statement\u2019s incriminating element. If so, then the statement tended to subject the declarant to criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">C. TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THE STATEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Beyond the requirement that a statement must be against penal interest, MRE 804(b)(3) further requires that exculpatory statements must be trustworthy. We note that the rule \u201cdoes not require that the statements themselves be clearly corroborated.\u201d <em>United States v Garcia, </em>986 F2d 1135, 1141 (CA 7, 1993). We make a further preliminary observation that federal courts are split over whether the court must assess the credibility of the witness,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or of the declarant, or of only the statement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the credibility of the declarant inherently affects the trustworthiness of the statement, and therefore it is not inappropriate for a court to exclude a statement where the declarant\u2019s veracity is seriously doubtful or entirely lacking. <em>United States v Moore, </em>936 F2d 1508, 1517 (CA 7, 1991); <em>United States v MacDonald, </em>688 F2d 224, 233 (CA 4, 1982); <em>Satterfield, </em>572 F2d 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Therefore, we are faced with two remaining questions respecting the corroborating circumstances requirement: (1) what facts may a judge properly consider, and (2) what level of corroboration is necessary?</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">APPROPRIATE FACTORS</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">There is no clear rule in the federal cases regarding which factors should be considered.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Fundamentally, the determination of trustworthiness invokes \u201ctwo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>distinct elements. . . . [T]he statement must actually have been made by the declarant, and it must afford a basis for believing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Bagley, </em>537 F2d 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">We also note that MRE 104(a) provides that, in determining the admissibility of evidence, the trial court generally \u201cis not bound by the Rules of Evidence,\u201d which supports a broad scope of permissible considerations. Although the defendant\u2019s statement may often be self-serving, we believe that the trial court may consider it as a factor of corroboration if appropriate. <em>Slaughter, </em>891 F2d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">In <em>Poole, </em>a majority of this Court adopted a totality-of-the-circumstances test and listed eight nonexclusive factors to consider in determining whether a statement against penal interest was sufficiently reliable to be used to <em>inculpate </em>the defendant without violating his constitutional right of cross-examination. <em>Poole, </em>444 Mich 165. The majority explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">In evaluating whether a statement against penal interest that inculpates a person in addition to the declarant bears sufficient indicia of reliability to allow it to be admitted as substantive evidence against the other person, courts must evaluate the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement as well as its content.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">The presence of the following factors would favor admission of such a statement: whether the statement was (1) voluntarily given, (2) made contemporaneously with the events referenced, (3) made to family, friends, colleagues, or confederates \u2014 that is, to someone to whom the declarant would likely speak the truth, and (4) uttered spontaneously at the initiation of the declarant and without prompting or inquiry by the listener.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">On the other hand, the presence of the following factors would favor a finding of inadmissibility: whether the statement (1) was made to law enforcement officers or at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>prompting or inquiry of the listener, (2) minimizes the role or responsibility of the declarant or shifts blame to the accomplice, (3) was made to avenge the declarant or to curry favor, and (4) whether the declarant had a motive to lie or distort the truth. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><em>Poole </em>also directed courts to consider any other relevant factor in the case in order to analyze whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the statement was sufficiently reliable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">With respect to custodial statements, we find useful the three-factor inquiry developed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. <em>United States v Garcia, </em>986 F2d 1140. Under that test, the court should first consider \u201cthe relationship between the confessing party and the exculpated party and . . . [whether] it was likely that the confessor was fabricating his story for the benefit of a friend. Thus, if the two involved parties do not have a close relationship, one important corroborating circumstance exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The second factor is \u201cwhether the confessor made a voluntary statement after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d <em>United States v Nagib, </em>56 F3d 798, 805 (CA 7, 1995), citing <em>Garcia, </em>986 F2d 1140. The third 4s \u201cwhether there is any evidence that the statement was made in order to curry favor with authorities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In sum, we believe that the totafity-of-the-circumstances test adopted in <em>Poole, </em>444 Mich 165, may be applied in the instant context. It requires the trial court to consider the contents of the statement itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the circumstances surrounding the declarant making the statement, and all other relevant facts in the case. In addition, where the statement was made to the authorities while the declarant was in custody, the trial court should consider the three-factor inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">EXTENT OF CORROBORATION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Perhaps the consideration with the greatest range of divergent views is the level of corroboration that should be required with respect to exculpatory statements against penal interest. Defendant Musall asks us to adopt the threshold suggested in Weinstein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">The court should only ask for sufficient corroboration to \u201cclearly\u201d permit a reasonable man to believe that the statement might have been made in good faith and that it could be true. If, for example, the proof is undisputed that the person confessing to a shooting could not have been at the scene of the crime because he was in prison, it will be excluded. But if there is evidence that he was near the scene and had some motive or background connecting him with the crime that should suffice. [Weinstein, \u00b6 804(b)(3)[03], pp 804-154 to 804-155.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">In contrast, the prosecutor argues for a higher standard, contending that it is legally insufficient for a defendant to offer his own statement as the only corroborating circumstance for the declarant\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">For guidance, we turn to the legislative history of FRE 804(b)(3) for assistance in ascertaining Congress\u2019 intent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The abbreviated version of the evolution of FRE 804(b)(3) is that the United States</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Supreme Court proposed rules of evidence, which in turn went through various changes in the House of Representatives and the Senate before final enactment. For our purposes, important changes occurred with respect to the corroboration requirement. The Supreme Court\u2019s version of what became FRE 804(b)(3) provided: \u201cA statement tending to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless <em>corroborated.\u201d </em>11 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed), \u00a7 804.01[12.-2], p VIII-230 (emphasis added). The House of Representatives revised and subsequently enacted this sentence, deleting \u201ccorroborated\u201d and adding \u201ccorroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The House Committee Report stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">As for statements against penal interest, the [House] Committee shared the view of the Court that some such statements do possess adequate assurances of reliability and should be admissible. It believed, however, as did the Court, that statements of this type tending to exculpate the accused are more suspect and so should have their admissibility conditioned upon some further provision insuring trustworthiness. The proposal in the Court Rule to add a requirement of simple corroboration was, however, deemed ineffective to accomplish this purpose since the accused\u2019s own testimony might suffice while not necessarily increasing the reliability of the hearsay statement. The Committee settled upon the language \u201cunless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement\u201d as affording a proper standard and degree of discretion. It was contemplated that the result in such cases as <em>Donnelly v United States, </em>228 US 243 [33 S Ct 449; 57 L Ed 820] (19 [13]), where the circumstances plainly indicated reliability, would be changed. [Moore, \u00a7 804.01(12.-2), p VHI-231, quoting House Conference Committee Report to Rule 804(b)(3), pp 16-17.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Accordingly, although we need not decide the issue in the instant cases, if the only corroborating circumstance was the individual defendant\u2019s statement, standing alone, we might have a different situation. See, for example, <em>United States v Rodriguez, </em>706 F2d 31, 40 (CA 2, 1983).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, we find other corroborating circumstances presented in this case, which we will explain below.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Although Congress indicated what it believed would <em>not </em>be sufficient corroboration, it left the answer to what <em>would </em>be sufficient to case-by-case development. However, we need to be cognizant of the competing interests that were at issue in <em>Donnelly. </em>The state\u2019s interest in ensuring that evidence be credible has been recognized for centuries. As noted by the Court in <em>Donnelly.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201cIt was very justly observed by a great judge that \u2018all questions upon the rules of evidence are of vast importance to all orders and degrees of men; our lives, our liberty, and our property are all concerned in the support of these rules, which have been matured by the wisdom of ages, and are now revered from their antiquity and the good sense in which they are founded.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Donnelly, </em>228 US 276, quoting Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Queen v Hepburn, </em>11 US (7 Crunch) 290, 295; 3 L Ed 348 (1813), quoting Lord Kenyon in <em>Rex v Eriswell, </em>3 TR 721 (1790).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">However, Congress, in enacting FRE 804(b)(3), expressly rejected the result in <em>Donnelly </em>and indicated that the historic rules of evidence should not be rigidly applied to exclude reliable exculpatory evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>dence. Justice Holmes\u2019 dissent in <em>Donnelly </em>persuasively explained why:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">The confession of Joe Dick, since deceased, that he committed the murder for which the plaintiff in error was tried, coupled with circumstances pointing to its truth, would have a very strong tendency to make any one outside of a court of justice believe that Donnelly did not commit the . crime. I say this, of course, on the supposition that it should be proved that the confession really was made, and that there was no ground for connecting Donnelly with Dick.\u2014 The rules of evidence in the main are based on experience, logic and common sense, less hampered by history than some parts of the substantive law. There is no decision by this court against the admissibility of such a confession; the English cases since the separation of the two countries do not bind us; the exception to the hearsay rule in the case of declarations against interest is well known; no other statement is so much against interest as a confession of murder; . . . and when we surround the accused with so many safeguards, some of which seem to me excessive, I think we ought to give him the benefit of a fact that, if proved, commonly would have such weight. <em>[Id., </em>228 US 277-278.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In short, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present exculpatory evidence in his defense and the rationale and purpose underlying MRE 804(b)(3) of ensuring the admission of reliable evidence must reach a balance. We believe they may be viewed as having an inverse relationship: the more crucial the statement is to the defendant\u2019s theory of defense, the less corroboration a court may constitutionally require for its admission. <em>Rivera v Illinois Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>915 F2d 280, 281 (CA 7, 1990) (excluding vital evidence was an abuse of discretion); <em>Slaughter, </em>891 F2d 698 (excluding crucial evidence was an abuse of discretion). In contrast, the more remote or tangential a statement is to the defense theory, the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>likely other factors can be interjected to weigh against admission of the statement. <em>Thomas, </em>62 F3d 1338 (where evidence was cumulative, exclusion was not an abuse of discretion); <em>Fowlie, </em>24 F3d 1069 (exclusion of tangential evidence was not an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Nevertheless, the constitutional background of this balancing test must be of foremost consideration. Because there can be no bright-line rule in this area, resolution must be case by case. But, as Justice Holmes observed, \u201cexperience, logic and common sense\u201d should guide us in reaching a point where the appellate court will find that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We turn now to the instant cases. There is no question that Copeland\u2019s statement was in fact made, which is a considerable factor when reviewing whether a witness should be allowed to repeat the statement at trial. <em>Donnelly, </em>228 US 277 (Holmes, J., dissehting). The entire text of Copeland\u2019s statement is reprinted in the appendix following this opinion. Copeland\u2019s custodial statement was given after he had been advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> rights. Additionally, in the statement, he expressly stated that he had not been promised anything to make the statement. Indeed, Copeland was later convicted of first-degree premeditated murder in large part on the basis of this statement. He was subsequently sentenced to life in prison without parole. We find no facts surrounding the making of the statement that suggest that Cope-</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>land was promised a deal or that he would not face the full punishment of the law for anything that he would say. Given that he had been advised that anything he said could have been used against him, we find that a reasonable person in Copeland\u2019s position would have realized that any admissions by him could implicate him in a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The trial court found that Copeland\u2019s statement was not inculpatory. We disagree. We find that Copeland\u2019s statement would have been probative of many possible crimes. He admitted taking an illegal controlled substance: \u201cWe took hits of mescaline.\u201d He admitted negotiating with a prostitute for a sex act. More importantly, he admitted to stabbing the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">We took her back to Chandler Park \u2014 Balduck. The girl told us that she would give us all a good price for sex. I . . . was doing all the talking to the girl because my friends Fred, Mike and Mark are id[io]ts they don\u2019t know how to talk to the girl. So we got there and we started taking her clothes off because she told me that she liked it rough. So we all proceeded to take her clothes we was ripping the clothes off her. That\u2019s when I started to get hyperactive. From then on she gave Mike head. I kept thinking about that and the more I thought about that that\u2019s when I had it in me that she was Spooner. Jen[n]ifer Spooner is a girl that I use[d] to go out with. I walked over while she was giving Mike head and I looked at her and it appeared to be Spooner to me. I became upset because about 7 months ago I caught Spooner having sex with another guy. Then I told the girl I would kill her. I told her I\u2019m going to kill you. I called her Spooner. Then that\u2019s when I did it. I pulled the knife down out of my sleeve. My left sleeve is where I keep my knife. I grabbed [the] knife out of my sleeve, pulled it out and I stabbed her in her body I\u2019m not sure where. All I could do then was feel confused and happy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>After the defendants sought to use this statement as exculpatory evidence, the prosecutor argued before the trial court that the statement was not against Copeland\u2019s penal interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\"><em>Mr. Less: </em>Yes. In that statement Mr. Copeland[] denies any plan with anyone. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\"><em>The Court: </em>The statement says no premeditation on anyone\u2019s part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\"><em>Mr. Less: </em>Correct. His statement \u2014 to use Mr. Rex\u2019s words \u2014 in essence, while this sex was going on with the girl who, quote, liked \u2014 not Mr. Rex, Mr. Copeland \u2014 liked it rough. So everybody [was] tearing her clothes off. Mr. Copeland experienced a psychotic experience from taking mescaline, and lsd and started hallucinating; that it was someone else. That\u2019s not against penal interest. What you are saying \u2014 almost exculpatory \u2014 saying, I\u2019m under the influence of something. I\u2019m not in the right mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The trial court excluded that statement in part because it found that Copeland was \u201creally making an excuse for his conduct\u201d rather than making \u201ca clear statement of his own criminal responsibility.\u201d However, MRE 804(b)(3) merely requires that the statement be probative against the declarant. We find that we can present no argument more persuasive than the prosecutor\u2019s later position regarding why Copeland\u2019s statement was probative of criminal responsibility. At Copeland\u2019s trial, the prosecutor argued during his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\"><em>[Mr. Less:] </em>Now, Mr. Copeland makes a statement to Sergeant Sanders, and that statement, you heard it yesterday afternoon, and you can take that into the jury room with you. There are certain things that I went through when I read that statement that just struck me as being \u2014 jumping out at me, jumping out. And I\u2019m going to tell you ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Mr. Copeland, in his statement, kind of sets the mood. Yeah, he\u2019s out with his friends, he says, and they\u2019re going to drive around, have some laughs. He tells you: \u201cWe decided to get together and have a few laughs.\u201d Him and Mr. Barrera and Mr. Musall and Mr. Johnson. They\u2019re going to have a few laughs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">Then he tells you, going to take some mescaline and drink some beer. And then he tells in the statement all about mescaline because, in his words, \u201cI took a drug class. That\u2019s how I know.\u201d He\u2019s an expert, man. He\u2019s a self-made expert on drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">So what does he do? He\u2019s going to tell you how these drugs inflamed his mind and clouded his mind and he couldn\u2019t form an intent to do any crime. Well, let\u2019s see what he tells us. He takes the mescaline. \u201cWe were out cruising around, looking for people to laugh at.\u201d Mr. Copeland is going to drive around, and that\u2019s a fun way to have a date. We\u2019re just going to go up and down Van Dyke, out of our neighborhood, look for people to laugh at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">Page 4 is where his contradictions start. After he claims they pick up the deceased, the victim in this: \u201cWe left that neighborhood because there is racial problems over there, you know.\u201d And his next sentence after he says that is: \u201cBy that time, I had the full effect of the mescaline going.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">Well, let\u2019s think about something. If you leave a neighborhood because you perceive there to be some kind of problem, what does that show you? If you can think of that \u2014 I mean, if you can make that determination, doesn\u2019t it show that you\u2019re conscious? Doesn\u2019t it show that you\u2019re purposeful? Doesn\u2019t that show that you know where you\u2019re at and what\u2019s going on and you can make a decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">Then we come on page 5, while the victim is \u201cgiving Mike head, I kept thinking about that, and the more I thought about that, that\u2019s when I had it in me that she was Spooner.\u201d Well, he\u2019s thinking about it. I mean, he\u2019s out here . . . and he\u2019s weighing it in his mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Then, on page 6, he says, \u201cI told her, \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you.\u2019 \u201d Well, what could be clearer of a person\u2019s intent? If someone says, \u201cI\u2019m going to\u201d \u2014 if someone comes up to me and says, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d I\u2019m going to take that kind of seriously because, if someone\u2019s saying that, ... it shows what they\u2019re doing. And then, if they do something, if they pull a gun out or get something pointed at me after they said those words, I would have no doubt of what their intent is. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">On page 9, Sergeant Sanders asked him some questions and he says: \u201cI forced myself to stab her.\u201d No one is \u2014 -the drugs aren\u2019t forcing him. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s not aware of what\u2019s going on. . . . [T]here\u2019s something else on page 9. . . . [H]e says, \u201cI got some head from her, but I stopped because I was afraid of getting a disease.\u201d Here\u2019s a guy that\u2019s supposed to have the full effect of the mescaline going. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. The drugs have obliterated his good judgment and he can\u2019t form any intent, and yet he can think about communicating diseases. . . . [T]hat shows a consciousness, that shows a sense of surrounding, that shows a mind free and clear of any wild and \u2014 you know, hallucinations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The prosecutor obviously found Copeland\u2019s statement to be reliable probative evidence of Copeland\u2019s guilt. He cannot now argue that it was not. <em>Green v </em>Georgia, 442 US 95, 97; 99 S Ct 2150; 60 L Ed 2d 738 (1979) (the statement was sufficiently reliable for the state\u2019s case); Rivera, 915 F2d 282 (\u201cThe confession was reliable enough to be used to put [the declarant] away for the rest of his life, and no reason is suggested why, if only it had been made to a close friend \u2014 but not otherwise \u2014 it would be reliable evidence of [the defendant\u2019s] innocence as well\u201d); <em>United States v Brainard, </em>690 F2d 1117, 1125 (CA 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>1982) (\u201cThe government\u2019s attempt to have it both ways strikes us as imprudent and unfair\u201d); <em>Thomas, </em>571 F2d 289 (\u201cThe statement may be offered by the government to inculpate the declarant or by the accused to exculpate himself\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The trial court also found that Copeland\u2019s statement was not exculpatory with respect to Barrera, Musall, and Johnson. We disagree. In the statement, Copeland was asked: \u201cDid Mark, Mike or Fred stab the woman]?]\u201d He replied: \u201cThey had knives on them but not to my knowledge.\u201d This statement was exculpatory with respect to Barrera\u2019s and Musall\u2019s defense: they admitted being there, but denied stabbing her. In addition, Musall himself admitted that he possessed a knife that night. The prosecutor argued to Musall\u2019s jury that Musall also stabbed the victim. Therefore, Copeland\u2019s statement that Musall did not stab the victim did exculpate Musall on a critical issue in the case. More importantly, the statement provided a motive for the killing (Copeland thought the victim was Spooner) and established that the idea of stabbing the victim was spontaneous. This was exculpatory evidence with respect to the defendants\u2019 theory that they did not anticipate Copeland\u2019s actions. Therefore, the trial court erroneously held that the statement was not against Copeland\u2019s penal interests and that it was not exculpatory with respect to Barrera and Musall.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The trial court also found that there was insufficient corroborating evidence of statements made within the context of the confession. The Court of Appeals likewise held that there were insufficient corroborating circumstances to support admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Copeland\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The panel did not address the defendant\u2019s constitutional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In order to address whether there were sufficient corroborating circumstances of the trustworthiness of the statement to satisfy constitutional requirements, we first must separately consider the evidence and the theories of both the prosecution and the defense with respect to each defendant to ascertain the level of each defendant\u2019s need for presenting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\n<em>PEOPLE v BARRERA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">In Barrera\u2019s statement to the police, he indicated that he was the driver that night. He also stated that he had kicked the victim in the head:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">I kicked her in the head before Matt stabbed her because she was on her knees when I kicked her and she was yelling and screaming[.] [T]hat\u2019s why I kicked her in her head.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>He denied that there was any plan to rob or rape the woman. He admitted that a cassette tape that was found at the scene was his. He also admitted that he ripped up the victim\u2019s jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Barrera was tried for first-degree premeditated murder and first-degree felony murder. With respect to the first count, the prosecution\u2019s theory was that Barrera aided and abetted in the killing, in particular by driving the car and by kicking the victim down before her throat was cut. The prosecutor repeatedly argued that this was a \u201c[f]our against one,\u201d planned gang attack. Further, he argued that Barrera was in control of the car and drove to a remote, secluded spot to accomplish the rape, robbery, and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">With respect to felony murder, the prosecutor argued that Barrera helped create the situation with knowledge that death or great bodily harm would occur. He argued that this was the requisite malice.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The prosecutor also argued that even if the crime was spontaneous, Barrera was guilty of second-degree murder because he helped destroy her clothes and left her to die behind a secluded building.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In contrast, Barrera\u2019s defense was that there was no premeditation because there was no plan to rob, rape, or kill the victim. He only thought that they had hired a prostitute, and that they would have sex and then leave. He thought that they were there \u201cto party.\u201d He did not know that Copeland had a knife with him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>He further argued that kicking the victim, an assault and battery, did not amount to an intent to create a high risk of death by multiple stab wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In his statement, Barrera described his version of the stabbing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">We all got out of the car and we went behind the bathrooms. I can\u2019t remember exactly who made the first move but Matt and Fred grabbed the hooker and ripped her shirts and pants off. They grabbed her and pulled her shirt off and she fell on the ground and that\u2019s when they, Matt and Fred tore her pants off. Matt made her suck his dick and after she was done he slapped her and then Mike stepped up and made her suck his dick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\"><em>Q. </em>What were you and Fred doing at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\"><em>A. We </em>were drinking Labatts Beer watching and talking to each other. Fred was saying how sick it was what Matt and Mike was doing. Then while she was sucking Mike\u2019s dick, Mike stepped back and Matt started [to] beat the girl with his fist. He kicked her and then he pulled out this big Rambo knife. I think he had it in the back of his pants. He pulled the knife out and stabbed her. Fred said \u201cOh my God.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. I turned around and went to the car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Barrera was convicted of first-degree felony murder. Under <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672; 299 NW2d 304 (1980), the jury was required to find that Barrera himself had malice.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In this case, Barrera\u2019s intent was the critical issue. Barrera\u2019s jury was told through Barrera\u2019s statement that Copeland did the stabbing. However, by excluding Copeland\u2019s statement, the trial court did not permit the jury to hear <em>why </em>Copeland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>killed the victim.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We find that this explanation of the stabbing was evidence crucial to Barrera\u2019s defense that he had no reason to expect that someone would kill the victim and that Copeland acted spontaneously and without warning. There was no evidence suggesting that Barrera could have anticipated that the prostitute resembled Copeland\u2019s former girlfriend, or that Copeland would hallucinate and believe that she was his old girlfriend, or that Copeland would pull out a knife and stab her to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Because the explanation for the stabbing was evidence crucial to Barrera\u2019s theoiy of defense, his constitutional right to present this evidence limited the threshold of corroborating circumstances that the court could require of Copeland\u2019s statement. We find that the trial court improperly focused on minor inconsistencies in the statement. Those inconsistencies go to the weight of the evidence \u2014 not to its admissibility. <em>Garcia, </em>986 F2d 1140-1141. The <em>primary </em>statement in the confession was corroborated by the statements of all three codefendants: Copeland spontaneously acted alone in the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Additionally, we find the following factors further corroborated the trustworthiness of Copeland\u2019s statement. Applying the three-factor inquiry set out above, we find that there was not a close relationship between Copeland and Barrera that would induce Copeland to \u201ctake the rap\u201d for Barrera.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Further, Copeland made a voluntary statement after being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Moreover, there was no evidence that Copeland did so in order to curry favor with the authorities: he said that he was not promised anything for giving the statement,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and, more importantly, he was later sentenced to life without parole on the basis of his statement.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Under the <em>Poole </em>factors, we note that although the statement was made to law enforcement officers, instead of shifting blame to the other three participants, Copeland directed blame <em>to himself </em>by explaining his personal motive for the killing, and by expressly stating that to his knowledge no one else stabbed the victim. However, \u201c[h]is incentive, one might think, was to inculpate as many other persons as possible and minimize his own involvement.\u201d <em>Rivera, </em>915 F2d 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Copeland\u2019s statement and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This preserved constitutional error is not harmless because we cannot declare beyond a reasonable doubt that the exclusion of this evidence did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>not contribute to the jury verdict by undermining Barrera\u2019s defense. <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18, 24; 87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967). We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, vacate Barrera\u2019s conviction, and remand the case for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\n<em>PEOPLE v MUSALL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Musall recounted in his statement that he had hit the victim in her face while they were traveling in the car. He also stated that he started to engage in fellatio with the victim, but then stopped because he was scared. He further admitted that he had been carrying a six-inch knife that night, and that he threw it away at the top of a hill after he and Fred started running when Copeland began stabbing the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">There was also evidence that Musall cut his right hand during the evening. In his statement, Musall asserted that he cut it later in the car while looking for a lighter on the floor. In contrast, Copeland\u2019s girlfriend, Carol Keane, testified that Musall cut his hand by hitting a beer bottle on a mirror on Barrera\u2019s car. On cross-examination, she testified that Musall\u2019s hand was not cut when she first saw him on the morning of October 28, 1988. However, the prosecutor argued that Musall cut his hand while he was stabbing the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Musall was tried on alternate counts of first-degree premeditated murder and first-degree felony murder. As in Barrera\u2019s case, the prosecutor repeatedly argued that this was a \u201cfour against one\u201d gang attack. The prosecutor presented essentially three theories. First, as in the <em>Barrera </em>case, the prosecutor argued that Musall was guilty of premeditated murder under an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>aiding and abetting theory because this was a thought-out plan to rape, rob, and then kill the victim. Second, the prosecutor argued that Musall actually stabbed the victim,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> drawing on inferences that he cut his hand sometime during the night.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> And finally, the prosecutor argued that Musall was guilty of felony murder because his conduct demonstrated a wilful and wanton act, knowing that death or great bodily harm might occur because he participated in the four-against-one scheme, hit her in the car, and got to the park and stayed there, while forcing her to engage in oral sex with him. The prosecutor contended that this conduct satisfied the malice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Musall\u2019s defense was that he had not intended that the victim die, that he did not participate in killing her, and that there was no preconceived plan to kill her. He admitted hitting her in the car, but contended that that occurred well before they reached the park. He argued that Copeland was the instigator of the group\u2019s activities and that Copeland, alone and spontaneously, stabbed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">We note that Musall\u2019s jury did hear testimony from a police officer that all of the defendants had stated that Copeland had done the actual stabbing. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>as in Barrera\u2019s case, the jury did not hear <em>why </em>Copeland stabbed her. This explanation of Copeland\u2019s motive for killing her was crucial to Musall\u2019s defense that he did not anticipate Copeland\u2019s actions. For the same reasons explained above with respect to Barrera, here too we consider the three-factor inquiry along with the <em>Poole </em>factors and reach the same conclusion: we believe that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Copeland\u2019s statement. This violated Musall\u2019s constitutional right to present his defense, and the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We find that the reasons for finding prejudicial error are even more compelling in Musall\u2019s case because the prosecutor\u2019s theory before the Musall jury was directly contradictory to his theory before Copeland\u2019s jury. In his closing statement before the Copeland jury, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">I\u2019m not quite sure how Mike avoided getting parts of his body cut off because, if this woman is performing oral sex on him, and [Copeland is] looking at them and, all of a sudden, [Copeland] pulls out a knife and starts chopping, Mike is, I guess, miraculously, not chopped up out there, too.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">If the prosecutor is not sure whether Musall stabbed the victim or whether he \u201cmiraculously\u201d avoided being stabbed, then this Court cannot be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Musall\u2019s jury was sure either. Had the jury heard Copeland\u2019s explanation of why he killed the victim, it may have accepted Musall\u2019s defense, as the prosecutor apparently did in the subsequent trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Therefore, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, vacate the conviction, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">RESPONSE TO DISSENTING OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The dissent argues that Barrera and Musall were not constitutionally entitled to use Copeland\u2019s statement as exculpatory evidence with respect to proving their state of mind at the time of the stabbing because the dissent believes that Copeland\u2019s state of mind was not relevant to his co-participants\u2019 defenses to aiding and abetting felony murder. <em>Post </em>at 316-317. However, the respective juries did not articulate whether they convicted the defendants of felony murder as principals or as aiders and abettors. Nevertheless, in Michigan, an aider and abettor must possess the same requisite intent as that required of a principal. <em>People v Kelly, </em>423 Mich 261, 278; 378 NW2d 365 (1985). <em>Kelly </em>explained the aiding and abetting felony-murder theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">The requisite intent is that necessary to be convicted of the crime as a principal. <em>Meister v People, </em>31 Mich 99 (1875). hi this instance, under <em>Aaron, </em>it therefore must be shown that the aider and abettor had the intent to kill, the intent to cause great bodily harm or wantonly and willfully disregarded the likelihood of the natural tendency of his behavior to cause death or great bodily harm. <em>Aaron, </em>409 Mich 733. Further, if the aider and abettor participates in a crime with knowledge of his principal\u2019s intent to kill or to cause great bodily harm, he is acting with \u201cwanton and willful disregard\u201d sufficient to support a finding of malice under <em>Aaron. </em>[423 Mich 278-279.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Hence, it would not be sufficient for the jury to conclude only that Barrera or Musall had assisted another in committing or attempting to commit a larceny or rape.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Aaron </em>requires the jury to take the additional step of finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant himself possessed the requisite intent with respect to the <em>murder.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That requisite intent is <em>malice, </em>whether proven or inferred from the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The dissent states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">Copeland\u2019s statement regarding his hallucination speaks only of his own state of mind. The relevant inquiry is whether Barrera and Musall possessed the requisite state of mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">Stated otherwise, that Copeland confessed to stabbing the woman does not negate <em>the possibility </em>that Barrera and Musall also possessed a state of mind sufficient to be found guilty of felony murder. <em>[Post </em>at 319 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>We do not disagree with the dissent that there is \u201ca possibility\u201d that a jury, even after hearing Copeland\u2019s statement, may find that the defendants also acted with malice. However, \u201ca possibility\u201d of malice is insufficient \u2014 malice must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">It is in this respect that the dissent is missing the forest for the trees. Four defendants were involved in some way with the events that occurred that night. All four defendants stated that one, and one alone, stabbed the victim. All four stated that the stabbing was spontaneous, and three stated that it was unanticipated by them. The decisive question before the respective juries was whether Barrera or Musall <em>intended </em>to create a very high risk of serious harm to the victim and <em>knew </em>that such harm was a <em>probable </em>result of his actions. The dissent contends that Copeland\u2019s statement \u201cdoes not support a defense that the defendants did not aid or abet a felony murder.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 320. We disagree. Copeland\u2019s motive and thought process in killing the victim, \u201cshe resembled Spooner,\u201d would have a direct effect on the required felony-murder element of malice, whether under a co-felon theory as addressed in <em>Aaron, </em>or under an aiding and abetting theory as addressed in <em>Kelly, </em>because the spontaneity of the killing was probative of the defense theory that the stabbing was unanticipated and beyond the scope of the alleged common enteiprise of rape or larceny. <em>People v Pitts, </em>84 Mich App 656, 662; 270 NW2d 482 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Michigan case law requires the jury to find a causal link between the felony and the <em>death. People v Datema, </em>448 Mich 585, 601-602; 533 NW2d 272 (1995). The dissent points to evidence that Barrera kicked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the victim and that Musall hit the victim in her face. <em>Post </em>at 322. However, the dissent must concede that a mere intent \u201cto injure\u201d falls short of <em>malice, Paterna, supra </em>at 606, and that mere participation in committing the underlying felony, without a finding of malice with respect to the death, likewise falls short of felony murder, <em>id. </em>at 601. Accordingly, evidence that would tend to prove that Barrera\u2019s and Musall\u2019s respective intents fell short of malice would indeed support the defendants\u2019 theories that they did not have any reason to anticipate that <em>death </em>or <em>great bodily injury </em>would occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Finally, we do not hold that a trial court should allow a defendant to present unreliable evidence as suggested by the dissent. <em>Post </em>at 304. Instead, we hold that a trial court cannot place too many hurdles in front of admitting evidence that is not only crucial to the defense theory and uncontradicted by any other evidence in the case, but also has some common-sense basis of trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">As to redacting the portions of the statement that do not directly inculpate Copeland, we note that the prosecutor has not argued that such redaction is required. We leave this issue for the trial court for further analysis. We do note that in <em>Williamson, </em>the Supreme Court did not address application of the carry-over rule in the context presented by the instant cases. We also note that <em>Carson v Peters, </em>42 F3d 384 (CA 7, 1994), a case on which the dissent relies, expressly recognized that <em>Williamson </em>dealt with situations in which the <em>prosecution </em>seeks to use a codefendant\u2019s statement and further stated that \u201cdefendants have an easier time under the second sentence of Rule 804(b)(3) . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 386. We find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that the critical portions of Copeland\u2019s statement, where he described why and how he stabbed the victim, and that the other three did not stab the victim (which would be inculpatory because it intensified his culpability and depravity through the number of stab wounds), were against his penal interests and should be admitted on retrial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b422-6\">Brickley, C.J., and Levin, Riley, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">MATTHEW COPELAND\u2019S STATEMENT</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\"><em>Q. </em>Mr. Copeland, were you advised of your constitutional rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\"><em>Q. </em>Do you have any questions regarding your rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-12\"><em>A. </em>No I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-13\"><em>Q. </em>Have you been threatened or promised anything to make a statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-14\"><em>A. </em>No I haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-15\"><em>Q. </em>Do you now wish to make a statement of your own free will and accord?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-16\"><em>A. </em>Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-17\"><em>Q. </em>Tell me what your involvement was regarding the murder of a black female in Balduck Park last Thursday night Octfober] 27th and Friday morning Oct[ober] 28th\u2014 early morning hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-18\"><em>A. </em>Me, my three friends Mark, Fred and Mike we decided to get together and go out last Thursday night and to have a few laughs and get high off Mescaline drugs.

Indeed, many aspects of Copeland\u2019s statement were at odds with evidence offered by defendants. In particular, Copeland stated that both he and Barrera had used mescaline, with Copeland attributing his actions to the effects of mescaline, while Barrera never mentioned the use of mescaline in his own statement. Moreover, Copeland contended that the victim voluntarily engaged in the sexual acts which occurred before the killing, which is contrary to the statements of both defendants in this case. Similarly, Copeland claimed that everyone involved in the offense participated in taking off the victim\u2019s clothes, while both defendants here denied doing so in their respective statements. Finally, Copeland stated that he stabbed the victim while she was performing fellatio on Musall, while Musall claimed that he had finished and was walking away when Copeland came over and stabbed the victim.

The Court concludes that the Constitution of the United States<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and MRE 804(b)(3) compel the admission of Matthew Copeland\u2019s self-serving statement. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">The jury in each case learned of Copeland\u2019s causative act through other evidence. What was contained in the statement that the juries did not know was denial and disavowal: Copeland did not rob, Copeland did not rape, Copeland did not premeditate, and Copeland did not know what he was doing because he was under the influence of drags. Thus, the Court\u2019s conclusion that the statement is self-incriminating to the degree that a reasonable person would not have said it unless it were true is clearly not warranted. The statement was not truly inculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">Second, the statements regarding the defendants were neutral or self-serving and were not exculpatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>of them. Finally, there are insufficient, corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate the trustworthiness of Copeland\u2019s statement. Nothing in the constitution or MRE 804(b)(3) compels the admission of Copeland\u2019s statement. The trial court properly suppressed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The test for admissibility under MRE 804(b)(3) is not whether the statement would be probative in the declarant\u2019s trial. Nor is admissibility determined by how \u201ccrucial the statement is to the defendant\u2019s theory of defense . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 279. While the importance of the evidence in relation to the theory of defense is critical to a claimed due process violation, the foundation of the exception is circumstances indicating trustworthiness. The preliminary question of admissibility clearly cannot turn on rote application of the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Just as clearly, necessity does not determine admissibility. The Court\u2019s formulation construes the Due Process Clause as if it guaranteed the use of unreliable evidence, provided it is crucial. Correctly understood, due process requires the state to put reliable third-party statements before the jury, despite the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">THE DEFINITION OF STATEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The Court does not address a preliminary question regarding the definition of the tenm \u201cstatement\u201d for statements against penal interest. MRE 804(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>MRE 804(b)(3) tracks the language of FRE 804(b)(3) and in pertinent part provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">A statement which was at the time of its making s\u00f3 far . . . tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability . . . that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In <em>People v Watkins, </em>438 Mich 627, 636, 646; 475 NW2d 727 (1991), Justice Cavanagh concluded that the term \u201cstatement\u201d should not be read broadly to encompass the declarant\u2019s entire confession. In the context of hearsay \u201cstatements\u201d inculpating an accused, Justice Cavanagh reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">[O]ur confidence in the trustworthiness of a purported statement against interest extends only insofar as the specific factual assertions contained within the statement are, in fact, against the declarant\u2019s interest. . . . Each factual assertion . . . must be viewed as narrowly and specifically as reasonably possible, and the court must separately ask whether <em>each specific assertion </em>is so intrinsically against the declarant\u2019s interest that a reasonable person would not have said it unless it were true. [Emphasis in the original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Statements not against interest \u201ctaken by themselves\u201d are <em>not </em>to be trusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">After our decision in <em>Watkins, </em>the United States Supreme Court explored the definition of the term \u201cstatement\u201d in 804(b)(3). As in <em>Watkins, </em>the issue was the scope of the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest, and the context was use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>of statements inculpatory of a defendant. In <em>Williamson v United States, </em>512 US 594; 114 S Ct 2431; 129 L Ed 2d 476 (1994), the Court held that the term refers not to the declarant\u2019s entire narrative, but covers only the parts of it that are individually self-inculpatory. Depending on the circumstances, statements that are ostensibly disserving may be either neutral or self-serving. While <em>Williamson </em>was remanded to determine whether the declarant\u2019s statement that he transported drugs was truly against his own interest, five justices felt it was not, because they concluded the declarant\u2019s primary purpose was to keep himself out of prison by confessing and handing over the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">After <em>Williamson, </em>the methodology of analyzing each portion of a statement to determine whether it is against penal interest has been applied to statements offered to exculpate the defendant by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, e.g., <em>United States v Butler, </em>71 F3d 243 (CA 7, 1995), and by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, <em>United States v Thomas, </em>62 F3d 1332 (CA 11, 1995). Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence in <em>Williar/ison </em>observes that \u201cthe Court\u2019s decision applies to st\u00e1tements against penal interest that exculpate the accused as well as to those that inculpate the accused.\u201d Thus, Justice Kennedy opined that, \u201cif the declarant said, T robbed the store alone,\u2019 only the portion of the statement in which the declarant said \u2018I robbed the store\u2019 could be introduced by a criminal defendant on trial for the robbery.\u201d 114 S Ct 2443.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The Court explains its failure to address the question by correctly observing that the prosecutor did not raise the argument. However, because the initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>question before us is what this Court meant in the rule we promulgated, the failure to explain that the word \u201cstatement\u201d is to be analyzed differently for exculpatory purposes than it is for inculpatory purposes, and differently than the identical language construed by the United States Supreme Court, is problematic. In my view, use of the <em>Watkins-Williamson </em>methodology clearly demonstrates that specific portions of the statement are not admissible because they are either neutral or self-serving. However, whether viewed individually or as a whole, I submit that Copeland\u2019s statement was not admissible under the hearsay exception of MRE 804(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">COPELAND\u2019S STATEMENT WAS NOT TRULY SELF-INCULPATORY</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Copeland\u2019s \u201cstatement\u201d regarding his state of mind was not inculpatory. Speaking for the Court in <em>Williamson, </em>114 S Ct 2435, Justice O\u2019Connor observed, \u201cOne of the most effective ways to lie is to mix falsehood with truth, especially truth that seems particularly persuasive because of its self-inculpatory nature.\u201d First, Copeland\u2019s denial of rape, robbery, and any preplanned felony is wholly self-serving. Second, although Copeland\u2019s excuse for stabbing the victim, voluntary drug-induced intoxication, would not negate the element of malice for second-degree murder as a matter of law, <em>People v Langworthy, </em>416 Mich 630; 331 NW2d 171 (1982), it is also a classically self-serving attempt to avoid responsibility \u2014 i.e., I did it, but I wasn\u2019t in my right mind. Despite being linked to a self-inculpatory admission of stabbing, these statements, considered either individually or as a whole, are not inculpatory. Thus, the trial court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that Copeland\u2019s statement was inadmissible in the defendants\u2019 trial because it did not furnish a basis for concluding that it would not have been made unless it were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Copeland was asked four times whether he forced the victim to have sex. He denied forcible sex and said the victim willingly had oral sex with him after her clothes were tom off because \u201cshe liked it rough.\u201d Copeland was asked once whether he, along \u201cwith [his] friends . . . attempted to rob [the victim].\u201d He answered, \u201c[n]o.\u201d Copeland thus denied involvement in forcible sex or in a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Before he began to speak about the events in the pairk, Copeland established that he had taken three hits of mescaline and was feeling \u201cthe full [e]ffect\u201d when they picked up the victim. Before he described the stabbing, Copeland said \u201cI had it in me that [the victim] was Spooner.\u201d When squarely confronted twice with questions regarding his state of mind when he stabbed the victim, Copeland claimed he could \u201ctaste the color of a tree\u201d and that it was that he thought she was his cheating ex-girlfriend, Spooner, that \u201cmade me go off like I did.\u201d In total, on four separate occasions in the course of a three-page interview, Copeland denied any intent to kill the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">As the United States Supreme Court has cautioned, \u201c[t]he question under rule 804(b)(3) is always whether the statement was sufficiently against the declarant\u2019s penal interest \u2018that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true,\u2019 and this question can only be answered in light of all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>114 S Ct 2437. Thus, the most significant flaw in the Court\u2019s analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>is the failure to evaluate Copeland\u2019s disavowals of responsibility and his acceptance of responsibility for the stabbing in light of the facts. Copeland denied the acts he could anticipate the codefendants also would deny: rape and robbery. However, Copeland previously had told three other noninvolved persons that he had stabbed the victim and believed that \u201ceveryone else\u201d knew about it. He admitted the only act he anticipated could be contradicted, the stabbing, but did not accept responsibility for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Copeland\u2019s statement was therefore against his interest in only one particular, (a fact known to the defendants\u2019 juries) \u2014 namely, that he stabbed the victim. Confronted with the fact that he was being questioned in connection with the murder by stabbing of a person whom he had indiscriminately admitted stabbing, Copeland gave the most likely false statement he could give, that he was not in his right mind when he committed the act. Regardless of whether the penal-interest exception for statements that exculpate a defendant requires analysis of the entire statement or its discrete assertions, the statement is not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">As Judge Guy noted for the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <em>Turpin v Kassulke, </em>26 F3d 1392 (CA 6, 1994), in distinguishing the case from <em>Chambers v Mississippi, </em>410 US 284; 93 S Ct 1038; 35 L Ed 2d 297 (1973), and <em>Donnelly v United States, </em>228 US 243; 33 S Ct 49; 57 L Ed 820 (1913), the declarant\u2019s statement was not truly inculpatory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">Most important, although Brown\u2019s statement arguably was against her penal interest, a reading of the statement as a whole reveals that Brown\u2019s purpose in making the statement was to <em>avoid </em>criminal liability to the extent possible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>not to accept it. . . . The rationale supporting the hearsay rule\u2019s penal-interest exception \u2014 that persons generally \u201cwill not make damaging statements against themselves unless they are true\u201d \u2014 therefore does not apply to Brown\u2019s statement. <em>[Id. </em>at 1398 (citations omitted; emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Copeland\u2019s statement fails the threshold test of reliability that a reasonable person would not have made the statement unless it were true. Cf. <em>United States v Magana-Olvera, </em>917 F2d 401 (CA 9, 1990); <em>United States v Tovar, </em>687 F2d 1210 (CA 8, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The Court\u2019s response to the fact that Copeland\u2019s drug abuse excuse was not <em>\u201cprecisely, </em>and <em>only, </em>to the extent that it is, in fact, against [his] interest,\u201d <em>Watkins, supra </em>at 638, is a legal non sequitur and a factual misstatement. First, the Court employs a presumption that suspects in custody will shift blame to someone else, from which it concludes that Copeland\u2019s statement was against his interest because he did not explicitly shift blame to Barrera and Musall. Although blame-shifting statements are traditionally suspect, the Court errs in suggesting that the fact that Copeland did not shift the blame is evidence of reliability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the contrary, post-arrest statements are suspect because of the strong motivation to exonerate oneself, of which blame-shifting is a typical example. <em>Williamson, </em>114 S Ct 2435.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">In the criminal context, any statement that tends to reduce the charges or mitigate the punishment for which the declarant might be liable is considered self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>serving. See Graham, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure (interim ed), \u00a7 6795, p 810, n 10. Shifting blame to another is one method of exoneration. It does not logically follow that if that method is not employed, another excuse is made more reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Copeland\u2019s disincentive for not stating that the others also stabbed the victim is not the issue. The issue is whether Copeland\u2019s denial of any felonious intent and his claim that he was not in his right mind at the time of the stabbing is against his interest. The rationale in <em>Turpin </em>applies to any method of avoiding criminal responsibility and Copeland used the only out he thought was available to him: admitting to hiring a prostitute who liked \u201crough sex\u201d and claiming that he should not be held responsible for his actions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Additionally, the Court errs in suggesting that Copeland\u2019s statement was not against his interest because he stated that he alone stabbed the victim, and the others did not participate. In fact, Copeland said:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">They had knives on them, but not to my knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">In <em>Carson v Peters, </em>42 F3d 384, 386 (CA 7, 1994), the court recently addressed a similar factual scenario. In <em>Carson, </em>the defendant sought to admit the declarant\u2019s statements because they failed to men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tion the defendant as a participant. Judge Easter-brook concluded that failure to mention the defendant did not directly inculpate the declarant. Likewise, in this case, that Copeland stated that he did not know whether Barrera and Musall stabbed the victim is not directly inculpatory of Copeland. He did not state that he alone stabbed the decedent, he did not say that he alone ripped off her clothes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and he did not say that he alone had sex with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">THE TEST OF ADMISSIBILITY FOR STATEMENTS OFFERED IN EXCULPATION IS NOT WHETHER THEY ARE PROBATIVE OF THE DECLARANT\u2019S GUILT</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The test for admissibility of statements offered in exculpation is not whether they are probative of the declarant\u2019s guilt. The Court erroneously cites <em>Rivera v Illinois Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>915 F2d 280, 282 (CA 7, 1990), to conclude that \u201cMRE 804(b)(3) merely requires that the statement be probative against the declarant.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 282. Judge Easterbrook explicitly recognized in <em>Carson, supra, </em>that the rationale of <em>Rivera, supra, </em>had been undermined by <em>Williamson.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">If a statement is reliable enough to condemn its author, how can it be too unreliable to use when it cuts against the prosecutor? The answer is that different parts of a statement may have radically different degrees of reliability. . . . Portions of inculpatory statements that pose no risk to the declarants are not particularly reliable; they are just garden variety hearsay. That recognition supplies the basis of <em>Williamson v United States, </em>[512] US [594]; 114 S Ct 2431; 129 L Ed 2d 476 (1994), which holds that in federal cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>judges must separate the incriminatory portions of statements from other portions for purposes of FRE 804(b)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\"><em>Williamson </em>tells us that portions of a confession that do not inculpate the declarant are not reliable enough for prosecutors to use against anyone other than the declarant. The Constitution therefore did not compel Illinois to let [defendant] use the omissions [the fact that neither of the confessions mentioned the defendant as a third party] from the . . . statements. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Copeland\u2019s statement that \u201cnot to my knowledge\u201d had defendants stabbed the victim is a neutral statement regarding defendant\u2019s participation that is garden variety hearsay. The Court\u2019s use of the prosecutor\u2019s argument in Copeland\u2019s case does not address the question. The statement comes in against its maker because, regardless of its inculpatory aspects, it is an admission that is not hearsay. MRE 801(d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">In fact, the prosecutor\u2019s argument in Copeland\u2019s case is an argument that Mr. Copeland\u2019s statement that drugs had obliterated his intent was a lie and ought not to be believed by the jury. Thus, the state\u2019s theory of liability in the Copeland trial did not contradict the theory it followed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The essential disagreement between my view and that of the Court is whether Copeland\u2019s statement that he had no felonious intent and killed the victim while hallucinating is reliable enough to be used by the jury to exonerate Barrera and Musall. But it is precisely because the \u201cwhy\u201d is the most clearly untrustworthy aspect of the statement as a statement of exculpatory motive made to diminish Copeland\u2019s criminal liability that the statement does not satisfy the penal interest exception of MRE 804(b)(3). As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Justice O\u2019Coimor observed for the majority in <em>Williamson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">And when part of the confession is actually self-exculpatory, the generalization on which Rule 804(b)(3) is founded becomes even less applicable. <em>Self-exculpatory statements are exactly the ones which people are most likely to make even when they are false; </em>and mere proximity to other, self-inculpatory, statements does not increase the plausibility of the self-exculpatory statements. [114 S Ct 2435 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The rationale that persons generally will not make damaging statements against themselves unless they are true does not apply to Copeland\u2019s reason for stabbing the victim: that, although he forced himself to stab the victim because he thought she was Spooner, in effect, the devil made him do it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That self-exculpatory statement is exactly one \u201cwhich people are most likely to make even when they are false . . .

It does not satisfy the rationale of MRE 804(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">COPELAND\u2019S STATEMENT WAS NOT EXCULPATORY OF THE DEFENDANTS</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Additionally, the defendants were not constitutionally entitled to the admission of Copeland\u2019s statement regarding his state of mind because the presence or absence of malice on Copeland\u2019s part was not exculpatory of the state of mind of the codefendants. The Due Process Clause does not require the admission of statements proffered by the defense that are of \u201cdubious exculpatory value.\u201d <em>Turpin, supra </em>at 1397.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Analysis of the exculpatory value of Copeland\u2019s acts and state of mind is more difficult than the question whether Copeland\u2019s statement was truly against his interest. We have not had occasion since <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672; 299 NW2d 304 (1980), to revisit the question of the extent to which a co-felon may be convicted of felony murder where it is claimed that the death of a victim was not within the contemplation of the aider and abettor co-felons or reasonably foreseeable. <em>People v Pitts, </em>84 Mich App 656; 270 NW2d 482 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">While not free from doubt, it appears that the Court\u2019s analysis of the exculpatory value of Copeland\u2019s statement is actually directed to this causation question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The thrust of that analysis is that Copeland acted impulsively in the stabbing, and that his action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>is probative of defendants\u2019 theory that they were merely present and that the stabbing was not within their common enterprise and was not reasonably foreseeable. This was the theory of defense that the jury actually heard. The question of causation is related to, but analytically distinct from, the question before us, which is whether Copeland\u2019s professed lack of malice is exculpatory of Barrera and Musall\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The jury convicted Barrera and Musail on the prosecution\u2019s theory of aiding and abetting first-degree felony murder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The crimes underlying this charge were larceny and criminal sexual conduct. The trial court properly instructed the jury that it could find the defendants guilty of felony murder if convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a death, the death was caused by the defendant, and, at the time of the act that caused the victim\u2019s death, the defendant was committing or assisting another in the commission of either a larceny or criminal sexual conduct and possessed the requisite intent for second-degree murder.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>First, as a matter of law, Copeland\u2019s lack of intent would not negate his own malice for second-degree murder.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>People v Langworthy, supra, </em>we rejected the claim that voluntary intoxication caused by drugs or alcohol negates the malice for second-degree murder. Accordingly, Copeland\u2019s intoxication excuse does not negate the mens rea for felony murder or criminal sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Second, Copeland\u2019s lack of malice would not negate malice on the part of either Barrera or Musall. Although Copeland\u2019s felonious intent is not to be vicariously imputed to Barrera and Musall, <em>People v Aaron, supra, </em>Barrera and Musall could be convicted of felony murder if they aided or assisted the commission of the felony of criminal sexual conduct with a life-endangering state of mind, that is, either intent to kill, intent to do great bodily harm, or under circumstances indicating their own wanton and wilful disregard of the likelihood that the natural tendency of their behavior was to cause \u201cdeath or serious injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">In <em>Sharlow v Israel, </em>767 F2d 373 (CA 7, 1985), the petitioner appealed the exclusion from evidence of alleged exculpatory statements of two defense witnesses. One witness would have testified that the codefendant said he was the one who had shot a person six times in the head. Another would have testified that the codefendant said he solicited the defendant to participate in a robbery and that the defendant refused and struggled with the codefendant to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>him from shooting. The court found the first statement not to be exculpatory under <em>Chambers.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">While [the] testimony did inculpate [the codefendant], her testimony was not critical to Shadow's [the defendant\u2019s] case because it did not exculpate Shadow from being a party to the crime of murder; thus, under the facts presented to the jury, Shadow could still be found guilty for [the] murder under Wisconsin\u2019s party to a crime statute. <em>[Id. </em>at 378.][<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Similarly, in this case, even assuming that Copeland\u2019s statement inculpated Copeland, it did not exculpate the defendants under a theory of aiding and abetting forcible sex. As long as the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Barrera and Musall committed or assisted in committing either larceny or criminal sexual conduct with any of the life-endangering states of mind constituting malice, each could be convicted of felony murder even if Copeland was the sole stabber.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The question is not whether Copeland\u2019s statement that he \u201cspontaneously\u201d stabbed the victim is relevant to the defense;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the only question is whether state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>merits describing Copeland\u2019s mental state<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> support the defense theory that the defendants did not possess the requisite mental state for second-degree murder. Copeland\u2019s statement regarding his hallucination speaks only of his own state of mind. The relevant inquiry is whether Barrera and Musall possessed the requisite state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Stated otherwise, that Copeland confessed to stabbing the woman does not negate the possibility that Barrera and Musall also possessed a state of mind sufficient to be found guilty of felony murder. The requisite intent to be convicted as an aider and abettor is that necessary to be convicted of the crime \u201cas a principal.\u201d <em>People v Kelly, </em>423 Mich 261, 278; 378 NW2d 365 (1985). Malice as used in the context of second-degree murder for felony murder is a general intent crime and \u201cif the aider and abettor participates in a crime with knowledge of the principal\u2019s intent to kill <em>or to cause great bodily harm, </em>he is acting with \u2018wanton and willful disregard\u2019 sufficient to support a finding of malice under <em>Aaron.\u201d Id. </em>at 278-279 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Copeland is deemed in law to have acted with intent to kill. His professed absence of intent to kill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>would not exculpate defendants from responsibility for intent to do great bodily harm malice, or for reckless disregard malice \u2014 that; is, a life-endangering state of mind involving forcible sex by four men that included ripping off the victim\u2019s clothes and kicking her. Evidence that Copeland had no malice because he was not capable of forming the mens rea is therefore no more exculpatory of Barrera and Musall\u2019s lack of malice than Musall\u2019s lack of malice would be if offered to exculpate Barrera or Barrera\u2019s lack of malice if offered to exculpate Musall.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Nor is the remainder of Copeland\u2019s statement exculpatory of the defendants. Barrera\u2019s and Musall\u2019s defense was that they merely were present at the scene of the crime. While Copeland\u2019s statement may support the defense that the murder was not preplanned, it does not support a defense that the defendants did not aid or abet a felony murder. Instead, Copeland said in his statement that Barrera was driving the car they used to pick up the prostitute, that Musall received fellatio from the victim, and that they all proceeded to rip off her clothes and to throw them around. When Copeland had the opportunity to tell the investigating officer that the defendants did nothing and were merely present, he failed to do so. For instance, when asked what his friends did once they arrived at the park, Copeland responded, \u201c[Musall], he got some head from the woman, I don\u2019t recall what [Johnson] and [Barrera] were doing exactly.\u201d When asked whether his friends participated in the stabbing, Copeland answered, \u201c[t]hey had knives on them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>but not to my knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> When questioned about who kicked the woman, he stated, \u201cI might have, I don\u2019t remember exactly.\u201d These statements are equivocal at best, and collateral to any arguably self-inculpatory statements. They are neutral, nonself-inculpatory statements that would appear to be excluded under <em>Williamson. </em>114 S Ct 2435. Where Copeland could have said his friends were merely present, he instead claimed lack of memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Viewed in this light, this case is distinguishable from <em>Chambers, supra. </em>In <em>Chambers, </em>the prosecution\u2019s theory against the defendant was that he was the sole killer. As the Court stated, \u201c[t]he State\u2019s proof at trial excluded the theory that more than one person participated in the shooting of Liberty. To the extent that McDonald\u2019s sworn confession tended to incriminate him, it tended also to exculpate Chambers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297. When McDonald confessed to firing the fatal shot, the confession exonerated Chambers because the single person responsible for the crime was established to be McDonald, not the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">While the Court recognizes that expert testimony could not establish or exclude multiple assailants, its analysis seems to assume that Copeland was the sole stabber. Copeland\u2019s statement does not indicate this, and the medical testimony indicated multiple stab wounds. In this case, the fact that Copeland stabbed the victim does not exculpate Barrera and Musall from also stabbing her, nor does it exculpate them from aiding and abetting the felony murder by participating in the underlying larceny and criminal sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>conduct in circumstances indicating malice. Barrera\u2019s statement admitted that he kicked the victim in the head because she was screaming and that he was the driver of the car. Musall\u2019s statement indicated that Copeland demanded the victim\u2019s money in the car, that she began hitting him, that he hit her three or four times in the face, and that he had sex with her after they got to the park and after she said, \u201cdon\u2019t, don\u2019t.\u201d Accordingly, unlike McDonald\u2019s statement in <em>Chambers, </em>Copeland\u2019s admission that he stabbed the victim does not exculpate Barrera and Musall to the extent that it inculpates Copeland. Further, MusaU\u2019s statement that he threw his knife away is consistent with the prosecution\u2019s theory that Barrera and Musall aided and abetted Copeland.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">THERE ARE NO CORROBORATING CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATING TRUSTWORTHINESS</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Finally, the suppression of Copeland\u2019s confession does not violate the defendants\u2019 constitutional right to due process because the majority fails to identify any \u201ccorroborating circumstances [that] clearly indicate [its] trustworthiness . . . .\u201d MRE 804(b)(3). As the Advisory Committee for the Federal Rules of Evidence noted, statements against penal interest that tend to exculpate an accused are more suspect than other statements against penal interest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">\u201cThe refusal of the common law to concede the adequacy of a penal interest was no doubt indefensible in logic [citing Holmes\u2019 <em>Donnelly </em>dissent], but one senses in the decisions a distrust of evidence of confessions by third persons offered to exculpate the accused arising from suspicions of fabrication either of the fact of the making of the confession or in its contents, enhanced in either instance by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>required unavailability of the declarant. Nevertheless, an increasing amount of decisional law recognizes exposure to punishment for crime as a sufficient stake. The requirement of corroboration is included in the rule in order to effect an accommodation between these competing considerations. When the statement is offered by the accused by way of exculpation, the resulting situation is not adapted to control by rulings as to the weight of the evidence, and hence the provision is cast in terms of a requirement preliminary to admissibility. The requirement of corroboration should be construed in such a manner as to effectuate its purpose of circumventing fabrication.\u201d <em>[United States v Barrett, </em>539 F2d 244, 250-251 (CA 1, 1976) (quoting Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules, 28 USCA, FRE 804, p 448).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The presumption behind this rule is that a suspect in custody has a strong motivation to lie in order to exonerate himself. Thus, \u201c[t]he requirement of corroboration was written into the Rule to guard against the inherent danger that third party confessions tending to exculpate a defendant are the result of fabrication.\u201d <em>United States v Guillette, </em>547 F2d 743, 754 (CA 2, 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In this regard, the Court\u2019s newly created balancing rule is fundamentally flawed. The Court states that the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present exculpatory evidence and the requirement of reliability under MRE 804(b)(3) \u201cmay be viewed as having an inverse relationship: the more crucial the statement is to the defendant\u2019s theory of defense, the less corroboration a court may constitutionally require for its admission.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Corroboration of hearsay statements is a constitutional requirement, even if the evidence is sought to be admitted by the defense. <em>Chambers </em>held that an accused has a due process right to the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>exculpatory hearsay provided it is accompanied by \u201cpersuasive assurances of trustworthiness.\u201d 410 US 302. <em>Chambers </em>stated: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">The testimony rejected by the trial court here bore persuasive assurances of trustworthiness and thus was well within the basic rationale of the exception for declarations against interest. That testimony also was critical to Chambers\u2019 defense. In these circumstances, where constitutional rights directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In other words, <em>Chambers </em>indicates that due process requires hearsay rules to admit rehable declarations against penal interest. <em>Lee v McCaughtry, </em>933 F2d 536, 538 (CA 7, 1991). <em>Chambers </em>does not hold that unreliable evidence <em>may </em>be admitted simply because it is extremely significant to the defense case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Further, the admission of only slightly corroborated evidence because it is crucial to the defense is contrary to the intent of the Rules Committee. The Rules Committee purposely imposed the corroboration requirement as a prerequisite to admissibility because it recognized that statements exculpating the accused are \u201cnot adapted to control by rulings as to the weight [not admissibility] of the evidence . . . .\u201d <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 251. The balancing rule, however, allows evidence that is not sufficiently corroborated under the constitution to be heard and weighed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The Court adopts a three-part test to determine whether a custodial confession bears sufficient indicia of reliability to be admitted under MRE 804(b)(3). That test, taken from <em>United States v Garcia, </em>986 F2d 1135, 1140 (CA 7, 1993), is (1) whether the confess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>ing party and the exculpated party have a close relationship, (2) whether the confessor made a voluntary statement after being advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> rights, and (3) whether there is any evidence that the statement was made in order to curry favor with authorities. <em>Ante </em>at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">This test is flawed in two respects. First, while a truly inculpatory and voluntary statement to police officers while in custody would indicate reliability, the fact that a statement is deemed voluntary under <em>Miranda </em>has no logical bearing on whether the declarant\u2019s confession was free of the motive to mitigate the declarant\u2019s role in the offense. <em>Lee v Illinois, </em>476 US 530, 544; 106 S Ct 2056; 90 L Ed 2d 514 (1986); <em>United States v Flores, </em>985 F2d 770, 782 (CA 5, 1993). As set forth above, even though Copeland\u2019s statement was made voluntarily, his purpose in making the statement was to avoid criminal liability to the extent possible.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Second, the test uses the absence of evidence of currying favor as indicating trustworthiness. As the court in <em>Flores </em>observed, however, \u201cstatements by suspects to law enforcement officials inculpatory of third parties are excluded because of the <em>presumption </em>that such motives exist, and the absence of evidence does not remove this presumption.\u201d 985 F2d 782 (emphasis in original). A like presumption exists when, as in this case, the declarant attempts to minimize his own participation in the crime. By contrast with the situation where the absence of a motive to fabricate indicates reliability, Copeland\u2019s drug-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>induced excuse indicates fabrication in an attempt to gain whatever he could in the difficult situation he faced. Thus, two of the three prongs of the <em>Garcia </em>test do not aid the determination of the reliability of the custodial statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The third <em>Garcia </em>factor inspects the relationship between the confessor and the party exculpated in the confession. In applying the test to the facts of this case, the opinion simply states, \u201cwe find that there was not a close relationship between Copeland and Barrera that would induce Copeland to \u2018take the rap\u2019 for Barrera.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 289. (The Court does not apply the test to the facts of Musall\u2019s case.) The conclusion is belied by the evidence in this case. First, in Copeland\u2019s confession, he refers to Barrera, Musall, and Johnson as \u201cmy friends\u201d several times. In discussing the night in question, Copeland says that \u201c[m]e, my three friends Mark, Fred and Mike we decided to get together and go out last Thursday night and to have a few laughs and get high off Mescaline drugs.\u201d Thus, it was not fortuitous that the four suspects were together on the night of the murder; they had arranged the evening previously. In fact, their relationship was such that all four could agree to have sex with the same woman and Copeland, as the ringleader, did the talking for them because his friends did not know how to talk to girls. In addition, Barrera and Copeland were together on the night that they were arrested.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Finally, given that Copeland had rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>son to believe that the fact that he stabbed the victim was known by \u201ceveryone else,\u201d he might well have thought that he had no choice but to accept blame, yet claim that he did not know what he was doing. The analysis also distinguishes this case from <em>Donnelly, supra. </em>In <em>Donnelly, </em>Justice Holmes noted that \u201cthere was no ground for connecting Donnelly with Dick [the confessor].\u201d 228 US 277. The evidence in this case was to the contrary \u2014 Copeland and the defendants were friends and \u201crunning buddies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">That leaves only one source of corroboration for Copeland\u2019s statements \u2014 the statements of the defendants. Yet, as the Court recognizes, \u201cif the only corroborating circumstance was the individual defendant\u2019s statement, standing alone, we might have a different situation.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 278. Such corroboration is constitutionally deficient. <em>Turpin, supra </em>at 1397-1398; <em>United States v Rodriguez, </em>706 F2d 31, 40 (CA 2, 1983); <em>United States v Annese, </em>631 F2d 1041, 1045 (CA 1, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The legislative history of the rule demonstrates that the House committee rejected the notion that penal statements \u201csimpliciter\u201d contained sufficient corroboration, because even the accused\u2019s own testimony might meet this test and inserted the language requiring corroborating circumstances that \u201c \u2018clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement\u2019 . . . .\u201d 1974 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News, pp 7089-7090.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Indeed, as the trial court and Court of Appeals noted, Copeland\u2019s statements and those of the codefendants were inconsistent in several respects. Defendants contend in effect that Copeland said they did nothing, while Barrera admitted that he kicked the victim in the head before Copeland killed her and that Musall had oral sex with her after the forcible sex began.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The Court points to no corroborating circumstances indicating the statement is trustworthy. While purporting to recognize that statements of the codefendants do not furnish corroboration, <em>United States v Rodriguez, supra, </em>the application of the balancing rule uses the purported consistency between defendants\u2019 statements and Copeland\u2019s statement as corroboration of the reliability of the excluded evidence. The only other corroboration offered is that Copeland spoke after being advised of his rights, and the conclusive statement that there was not a close relationship between Barrera and Copeland. <em>Ante </em>at 289-290.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In conclusion, because the defendants failed to establish that Copeland\u2019s statement fulfills the requirements of MRE 804(b)(3) and was sufficiently reliable that its exclusion denied the constitutional right to due process, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b452-7\">Weaver, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-15\"> US Const, Am XIV.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"> <em>Rivera v Illinois Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>915 F2d 280, 281-282 (CA 7, 1990) (the declarant confessed that <em>he alone </em>had beaten decedent; there was no suggestion of any motive to exculpate or that the declarant might simply have failed to notice; due process was violated by the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the confession for no better reason than that it was hearsay).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\"> While a different question might be presented had Copeland said he alone stabbed the victim, Copeland\u2019s incentive not to make a blame-shifting assertion does not logically lend any credibility to separate, even though closely associated assertions. <em>Watkins </em>at 639.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b435-9\"> Because hiring a prostitute negated rape and using mescaline negated his mental state, neither of these admissions are in context truly inculpatory. As the court observed in dictum in <em>United States v Evans, </em>635 F2d 1125 (CA 4, 1980), when a statement technically constitutes a confession, but, in actuality, its principal and perhaps only function is to support a defense against a charge of a more serious crime, \u201cin reality, looked at in its totality, the statement is one <em>for </em>the declarant\u2019s penal interest, not <em>against.\" </em>(Emphasis in the original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b436-8\"> Moreover, like the declarant in <em>Carson </em>who sought to protect a brother or fellow gang member, Copeland\u2019s asserted lack of knowledge was likely motivated by a desire to protect his friends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\"> In context, it is clear that Copeland was avoiding blame:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\"><em>Q. </em>You knew exactly what you were doing when you pulled the knife out and stabbed the woman, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\"><em>A. </em>I was in a different state of mind.

While the jury did not hear Copeland\u2019s statement, it did receive through other evidence the substance of his confession, including that he was the stabber.

This is a different question than whether a codefendant is chargeable with felony murder when a co-felon has killed the intended felony victim. Michigan\u2019s party to a crime statute, MCL 767.39; MSA 28.979, like that of Wisconsin, abolishes the distinction between principals and accessories.

Intent to kill is but one of the possible mental states sufficient to establish the malice element of second-degree murder. \u201cWhile the intent to kill satisfies the malice requirement, it is not a necessary element of second-degree murder.\u201d <em>Langworthy, supra </em>at 650. If the perpetrator possesses the intent to kill, that does not transform second-degree murder into specific-intent crime. <em>Id. </em>at 651. Moreover, in a case involving multiple participants, any of the participants may possess any of the mental states that compromise malice and satisfy the mens rea element of second-degree murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b445-6\"> Copeland never told the officer that Barrera and Musall did not stab the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\"> See, e.g., <em>Turpin, supra </em>at 1397, which observed that the declarant\u2019s statement was unreliable in part because it was made to a police interrogator and was not a spontaneous utterance to a close acquaintance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\"> To the extent that the Court concludes that MRE 804(b)(3) \u201cmerely requires that the statement be probative against the declarant,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 282, it is in error. <em>Garcia </em>correctly notes that once the evidence is determined admissible, its weight is for the jury.
