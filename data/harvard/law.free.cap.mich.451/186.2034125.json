Specifically, we must decide whether the land contract vendees in default were prohibited by fraud from redeeming the property in question. Alternatively, we must determine whether the vendees exercised their statutory right of redemption by placing the default amount in escrow with a title insurance company on the afternoon of the last day of redemption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are unable to conclude, on the facts of this case, that the vendors perpetrated fraud in obtaining the writ of restitution. Furthermore, in order to effectuate the right of redemption, the full amount, not merely an offer, must be tendered without qualification or condition. <em>Kaiser v Weber, </em>301 Mich 609; 4 NW2d 29 (1942). Plaintiffs\u2019 placement of the judgment amount in escrow was merely an offer to redeem the property. We therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">On February 1, 1980, Michael and Marylou Baghdoian purchased a large residence situated on a valuable parcel of waterfront property on land contract from Sam and Pamela Piunti. Plaintiffs in the present proceeding, Wendell and Margaret Flynn, pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>chased the Baghdoians\u2019 interest and are the current vendees of the land contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, plaintiffs failed to pay a $376,040.71 balloon payment that became due on February 1, 1988.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Thereafter, the vendors, the Piuntis, declared the contract forfeit and began summary proceedings in the 33rd District Court. The Flynns neither answered the complaint nor defended their interest in the summary proceedings. On March 30, 1988, the district court entered a judgment of forfeiture and possession for breach of land contract. After entry of default, plaintiffs\u2019 ninety-day period of redemption commenced.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To perfect this right, plaintiffs were obligated to pay approximately $450,000, inclusive of unpaid real estate taxes. While these proceedings were pending, the current defendants and vendors, Curtis and Maureen Komeffel, purchased the Piuntis\u2019 interest and were substituted in the summary proceedings action. The redemption period was scheduled to expire June 28, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The facts surrounding the attempted redemption and subsequent procedural history are lengthy but important to the disposition of this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During the redemption period, plaintiffs were able to obtain a loan from a third party, Consumers Petroleum Company, to redeem the property. A week before expiration of the redemption period, Mr. Flynn arranged a closing at Lawyers Title Insurance Company in Troy, Michigan. The closing was tentatively scheduled for June 28, 1988, the last day of redemption.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During this time, it was discovered that the property in question had previously been encumbered.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>One day before the expiration of the redemption period, on the afternoon of June 27, 1988, Mr. Flynn made a telephone call to Mr. Komeffel and told him that he had the money to redeem the property and would do so the following day.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Mr. Flynn also advised Mr. Komeffel that he had a title commitment for the property and asked Mr. Komeffel whether he had the discharges of the mortgages. Mr. Komeffel replied that the mortgages had been paid. Mr. Flynn called Mr. Komeffel\u2019s attorney, Anthony Smereka, but he was out of town.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Mr. Flynn returned the call to Smereka the following morning between 9:30 and 10:00 A.M.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Mr. Flynn told Smereka that he wanted both him and Mr. Korneffel to attend a closing in Troy. Mr. Flynn advised Smereka that he had a title insurance commitment that revealed undischarged mortgages and requested a warranty deed discharging the mortgages. Smereka was surprised that the discharges had not been recorded and told Mr. Flynn that he would investigate the problem and call him back in an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The telephone conversation continued, however, and Smereka further inquired about the redemption money. Smereka told Mr. Flynn to tender the money if he had it and he would receive whatever was necessary for clear title. Although Mr. Flynn had set up the closing and made arrangements to borrow the redemption money a week earlier, he did not tell Mr. Korneffel or his attorney about the closing until this conversation on the morning of June 28, 1988.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Smereka apparently hung up abruptly and did not call back.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">After the telephone conversation, Smereka went on a previously arranged shopping trip with his wife.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Before leaving, he advised his client of his telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>conversation with Mr. Flynn.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Mr. Komeffel left his office, but told his staff to accept the redemption money from Mr. Flynn. Mr. Flynn later left several messages on Smereka\u2019s answering machine, advising him of the details of the closing for the first time. The closing was set for 2:00 P.M. that afternoon at Lawyers Title Insurance Company in Troy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Smereka did not learn these details until late in the afternoon when he checked his answering machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">When it was clear that neither Smereka nor Mr. Komeffel would appear at the closing, plaintiffs placed a check for the redemption amount in escrow with Lawyers Title. At Mr. Flynn\u2019s request, Mr. Brink-man from the Lawyers Title Insurance Company prepared a letter late in the afternoon on June 28, 1988, addressed to Anthony R. Smereka at his office/residence in Northville, Michigan. The letter advised Smereka that the Flynns appeared at the office of Lawyers Title Insurance Company on that date and placed in escrow the sum of $466,510.95, plus additional money to compensate for any discrepancies. The letter conditioned payment on delivery of a warranty deed from the Komeffels along with mortgage discharges to Brinkman\u2019s office. Mr. Flynn then took a copy of the letter to the residences of Smereka and the Komeffels.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>On the following day, June 29, 1988, the Komeffels obtained a writ of restitution in the 33rd District Court. However, on June 30, 1988, the Flynns filed a complaint in circuit court to enforce their right of redemption.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The circuit court issued an order restraining enforcement of the writ of restitution obtained in district court. At a hearing on July 12, 1988, the circuit court judge determined that because the proceedings originated in district court, the Flynns should return to that court to pursue their remedy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Flynns then motioned the district court to set aside the default judgment. On August 12, 1988, the district court issued a memorandum opinion denying the Flynns\u2019 motion to set aside the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">On February 13, 1989, the circuit court dissolved its preliminary injunction and enforced the writ of restitution previously issued by the court on June 30, 1988.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At the request of the circuit court judge, the Flynns filed a motion to enforce the right of redemption in district court on February 16, 1989. Meanwhile, the Flynns appealed the earlier decision of the district court denying their motion to set aside the default judgment to the circuit court. The district court dismissed the Flynns\u2019 motion to enforce the right of redemption sua sponte on March 2, 1989, stating that it was without jurisdiction to hear the motion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Ultimately, on November 8, 1989, the circuit court restrained the Komeffels from enforcing the district court writ of restitution. In response, the Komeffels moved for summary disposition, MCR 2.116(C)(6),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in the circuit court. The circuit court entered a dismissal of the action on January 12, 1990.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Plaintiffs filed an application for leave to appeal that decision with the Court of Appeals. In an unpublished per curiam opinion, the Court affirmed the decision of the circuit court, but remanded the matter to the district court for further fact finding. After an evidentiary hearing, the district judge issued an opinion enforcing the writ of restitution.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Subsequently, in its January 5, 1994, order, the Court of Appeals stated that the judgment of forfeiture was properly entered and that the writ of restitution should be enforced against plaintiffs.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>held that the writ of restitution extinguished any right of redemption that plaintiffs may have claimed under the land contract. Plaintiffs filed leave to appeal in this Court, which was granted April 5, 1995.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We must determine whether the writ of restitution is enforceable. The writ is not enforceable if defendants fraudulently prevented plaintiffs from redeeming the property. Alternatively, the writ may not issue if placement of the judgment amount in escrow on the last day of redemption constituted a valid redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The equitable right of redemption is governed by MCL 600.5744(6); MSA 27A.5744(6):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">When a judgment for possession is for nonpayment of money due under a tenancy or for nonpayment of moneys required to be paid under or any other material breach of an executory contract for purchase of the premises, the writ of restitution shall not issue if, within the time provided, the amount as stated in the judgment, together with the taxed costs, is paid to the plaintiff and other material breaches of an executory contract for purchase of the premises axe cured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">The Legislature has provided vendees in default a ninety-day period to redeem in cases in which less than fifty percent of the purchase price has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>paid. MCL 600.5744(3); MSA 27A.5744(3). In order to comply with the statute and exercise this right of redemption, however, it is incumbent on the vendee in default to pay the entire balance <em>within that period. </em>This Court must apply the clear language of the statute \u201c[a]bsent some unusual circumstances or additional considerations not within the ambit of the statute . . . .\u201d <em>Grossman Bldg Co v Elliott, </em>382 Mich 596, 603; 171 NW2d 441 (1969). In fact this Court has exercised its equitable power in <em>unusual circumstances </em>such as fraud to effectuate a redemption where one has not been executed within the statutory period.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Marble v Butler, </em>249 Mich 276; 228 NW 677 (1930). These situations are necessarily limited because fraud requires proof by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Two cases are instructive for purposes of determining what constitutes fraud. First, in <em>Marble, </em>the plaintiff and his co-vendees were in default for eleven consecutive monthly land contract payments. The defendant vendor served a notice of forfeiture and almost immediately commenced summary proceedings before a circuit court commissioner to regain possession of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Before the expiration of the redemption period, the vendor refused to reveal the amount remaining due on the land contract and failed to furnish an abstract of the property in accordance with the contract. Further, the vendee attempted to tender the entire balance due under the contract, and the vendor refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>to accept the payment and execute a deed.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The redemption amount, together with a copy of the contract and deed to be executed by the vendor, was filed with the clerk of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The Court properly remanded the case \u201cfor further action in accordance with this opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280. <em>Marble </em>presents an archetypal case of fraud that demonstrates the necessity of this Court\u2019s equitable intervention in cases of fraud. In <em>Marble, </em>the plaintiff tendered in earnest the full amount due under the contract, <em>and it was refused.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\"><em>Marble </em>stands in sharp contrast to the case now before the Court. Here, there was no evidence on remand that a tender was made or refused by Mr. Komeffel or Smereka. In fact, the district court concluded that Smereka did not intentionally make himself unavailable to Mr. Flynn for purposes of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Similarly, in the second informative case, <em>Gross-man, supra, </em>the purchasers of a house on land contract defaulted, and the vendor foreclosed. Approximately two weeks before the statutory redemption period was scheduled to expire, the vendees\u2019 attorney wrote a letter to the vendor\u2019s attorneys requesting the vendor to execute a warranty deed. The vendees stated that they had found a purchaser<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> for the property and that the bank had approved the loan. An attorney for the vendor responded that his client was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>not going to send the deed and that \u201c[a]s far as [they] [we]re concerned, that [was] it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">After the redemption period expired, the vendees filed a motion in circuit court requesting the plaintiff to execute a warranty deed and comply with the terms of the contract. The circuit court ordered the vendor to execute a valid warranty deed to fulfil the terms of the land contract. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and the vendor appealed in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">This Court acknowledged the general rule that the right to redeem is a statutory, legal right that may not be enlarged or abridged by the courts.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Court noted that deviation from that rule is justified only under unusual circumstances such as fraud. Confirming that fraud must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">Granting defendant [vendee] every presumption of integrity and good faith, the only view we can take of the facts of this case is that the negotiations between the parties\u2019 attorneys came to an impasse. However, this situation does not amount to an act of fraud which would justify the intervention of equity. <em>[Grossman, supra </em>at 605.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Consistent with <em>Grossman, </em>we uphold the district court\u2019s finding that there is no clear and convincing evidence of fraud in the present case. Therefore, we conclude that fraud will not prevent enforcement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the Komeffels\u2019 writ of restitution. Although Mr. Komeffel and Smereka had doubts regarding whether Mr. Flynn had the money to redeem,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>both were prepared to accept the redemption money if tendered. </em>We believe that the present case is one similar to <em>Grossman, </em>where the \u201cnegotiations between the parties\u2019 attorneys came to an impasse.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Having thus concluded that defendants did not perpetrate fraud, we must otherwise determine whether placement of the funds in escrow constituted a redemption. Plaintiffs analogize to <em>Birznieks v Cooper, </em>405 Mich 319; 275 NW2d 221 (1979). In <em>Birznieks, </em>this Court held that the judgment to recover real property was \u201cpaid\u201d when mailed on the final day of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The Court based its decision on the fact that the increasingly customary means of payment between creditor and debtor is by mailing personal checks. In an attempt to effectuate the remedial purpose of the redemption statute, the Court held that the words \u201cwithin the time provided\u201d and \u201cpaid\u201d should be defined in accordance with the understanding of the vendees and tenants. Noting that land contract payments are routinely sent and received through the mail system, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">The large number of cases where, because of a course of dealing, personal checks or mailing within the time provided or both have been treated as timely payment demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>strates that there are no intractable problems in treating the mailing of personal checks as payment. <em>[Birznieks </em>at 334.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The decision merely recognized the means by which the modem debtor renders payment. The Court concluded that this particular means of payment fully implements the remedial purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Plaintiffs maintain that placement of the redemption money in escrow on the final day of redemption is actually preferable to the means of payment in <em>Birznieks. </em>We are, therefore, requested to conclude that plaintiffs \u201cpaid\u201d the judgment amount by depositing it in escrow. We are persuaded, however, that relevant statute and case law require the opposite conclusion. In this case, we are constrained by <em>Kaiser, supra, </em>holding that an offer to redeem, pending presentment of a deed is not within the ambit of the statute or within this Court\u2019s equitable power.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In <em>Kaiser, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s attorney made a similar arrangement to obtain a loan to redeem forfeited property purchased on land contract. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated that payment would be made when the vendors delivered a deed to the property. It was admitted that no legal tender was made to the vendors or their attorney. The Court held that the vendee\u2019s willingness to tender payment was not sufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201cWe would import into the law an unsafe and litigious element if we should hold an offer to perform, with ability to do so, accomplishes the purpose of a tender, or constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>ground for equitable relief.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 616, citing <em>Pappas v Harrah, </em>221 Mich 460; 191 NW 221 (1922).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Tender must, therefore, be without qualification or condition.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Placement of the judgment amount in escrow in the present case amounted only to an offer to close pending fulfillment of the third-party conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Additionally, as distinguished from <em>Birznieks, </em>placement of the redemption money in escrow on the final day of redemption without actual notification of the defendants is not a customary means of payment in contemplation of the parties. The conditions could only have been fulfilled if defendants knew about the closing. Details of the closing were <em>never </em>communicated directly to defendants. Plaintiffs had one week to communicate their intent to close and make their requests known to defendants. Moreover, plaintiffs had the same opportunity on the morning of June 28, 1988, when Mr. Flynn spoke to both Mr. Komeffel and Smereka. In this regard, we find the district court\u2019s opinion on remand instmctive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">Unfortunately, Flynn never explained to Komeffel or Smereka that he was borrowing the funds from a third party and that the third party had turned the money over to Lawyers Title Insurance Company and that the monies could only be disbursed upon the submitting of certain documents to finalize the transaction. It is apparent that Flynn chose to keep the details of his borrowing private from Komeffel and Smereka and did not disclose them to Komeffel or Smereka and chose to unilaterally schedule a closing date with Lawyers Title and then only informed the opposite side of such closing a day prior thereto and only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>advised the other side of the time of the closing by leaving a phone message on Smereka\u2019s recorder. Smereka did ask Flynn on June 28, 1988 as to whether he was borrowing the money and Flynn would not verify such fact. As a result, Flynn never told either Korneffel or Smereka of the necessity or reason for them to travel a distance to Lawyers Title to receive the redemption money. The court would also find that Korneffel and Smereka were not aware that Flynn was borrowing the redemption money from a third party and they were not aware that the monies were not authorized to be distributed for the purpose of the redemption without a deed and discharges being tendered in a hand-to-hand exchange.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We are, therefore, unable to extend the attenuated principles of <em>Birznieks </em>to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Further, we note that in <em>Grossman, supra, </em>it was not incumbent on the vendors to meet the demands of the vendees in default. Instead, it was the responsibility of the vendees to pay the defaulted amount without condition. Pursuant to the facts of this case, the vendors, therefore, had no further obligation than to accept payment upon tender. <em>Grossman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The unilateral act of depositing redemption funds in escrow at the eleventh hour is clearly not within the purview of the statute. Moreover, it is uncontested that both parties knew the mortgages were discharged and that clear title could be passed. In fact, the Komeffels\u2019 warranty deed from the Piuntis was recorded and the deed did not show outstanding mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The dissent would engraft upon the statute an obligation to convey \u201cmarketable title\u201d even though plaintiffs had not met their obligations under the statute. Marketable title, as used by the dissent, evidently would obligate the vendors to produce that which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>would fulfill the requirements of a third-party lender.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Because such a case is not before us, we do not decide the case in which a vendee notifies the vendor in a reasonable manner and within a reasonable time of a third-party lender\u2019s conditions on disbursement of redemption funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The funds must be paid to the vendor.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In the present case, the funds were not paid to the vendor. The Flynns were prohibited from making an unconditional tender by the conditions placed on disbursement of the money by the third-party lender. Even assuming an obligation to comply with the conditions, the vendor must have sufficient notice of the conditions. Certainly, that notification must be directly communicated to the parties. Communication by means of an answering machine on the afternoon of the final day of redemption is not sufficient. The circumstances of this case simply do not appeal to the conscience of the Court. <em>Grossman, supra </em>at 603. This result is compelled if we are to remain faithful to the well-established rule that \u201cthe right to redeem under present statutes is a legal right and can neither be enlarged nor abridged by the courts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Pursuant to the statute and case law cited, plaintiffs could have tendered the money in person or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>mail to defendants by the end of the last day of the redemption period. In the present case, neither a reasonable closing date nor a time was ever communicated or agreed upon. Instead, plaintiffs unilaterally scheduled a closing and notified defendants of the closing and their responsibilities at the eleventh hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Although the right to redeem is statutory, a court may exercise its discretion in unusual circumstances such as fraud to extend the redemption period. We uphold the findings of the district court and conclude no fraud was perpetrated by defendants. Mr. Flynn did not tender payment within the statutory period, and the district court found that Mr. Korneffel and his attorney did not refuse to make themselves available for payment. Additionally, the placement of the redemption money into escrow under the particular circumstances of this case did not effectuate a redemption because the money was not \u201cpaid\u201d to defendants. The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-5\">Brickley, C.J., and Boyle and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-10\"> MCL 600.5744(6); MSA 27A.5744(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\"> The Flynns also purchased an adjacent lot not subject to the land contract in question in the present case.

In the application of this principle, regard shall be given to the special opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses who appeared before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Unable to find clear error, we uphold the district court\u2019s findings of fact.

It is undisputed that the commitment showed that the property was used by the Piuntis as collateral for several mortgages to Trenton Bank and Trust Company. The mortgages amounted to a cumulative sum of approximately $505,000. Additionally, the commitment showed an assignment of the seller\u2019s interest in the land contract to Trenton State Bank as collateral for a $425,000 loan. It is unclear whether this was additional security for the existing loans or security for a new loan. The title commitment also showed that Mr. Flynn deeded his interest in the subject property to Joe Stewart as security for a loan in the sum of $189,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>However, a recorded warranty deed from the Piuntis to the Komeffels indicated that the mortgages, as well as the back taxes, had been paid. <em>In fact, Flynn had been told by Lawyers Title that a deed without restrictions had been recorded from, the Piuntis to the Komeffels, which evidenced that the mortgages had been discharged.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b316-11\"> However, the evidence at the fact-finding hearing showed that Flynn <em>did not </em>have the money to redeem in his name or at his immediate disposal at the time this call was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b316-12\"> Plaintiffs assert that defendants\u2019 attorney, Anthony Smereka, should not have been allowed to testify at the remand hearing because Mr. Komeffel previously asserted an attorney-client privilege when Smereka was noticed for deposition. In letters to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, Philip Gillis, dated September 21, 1988, and March 27, 1989, defendants\u2019 counsel, Leo Carrigan, Jr., did not assert the attorney-client privilege, but rather inquired about what matters Gillis expected to question Smereka. It appeared that the information was essential to Mr. Komeffel in order to determine whether to exercise a valid waiver of the privilege. There is no evidence in the record that Gillis responded to the letters. Therefore, the attorney-client privilege was not clearly asserted by Mr. Komeffel.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">Moreover, we agree with the district judge on remand. In allowing Smereka to testify at the evidentiary hearing, the judge noted that no final decision had been made by the circuit court with regard to Mr. Korneffel\u2019s attorney-client privilege. Therefore, it was not finally determined that he could claim the privilege. The judge stated that the privilege would not likely apply to all contact between Mr. Komeffel and Smereka. The judge further noted that Smereka had considerable contact with third parties that would not be subject to an attorney-client privilege. Finally, Smereka was called as an adverse witness at the evidentiary hearing by <em>plaintiffs, the Flynns. </em>For these reasons, we conclude that the district judge properly allowed Smereka to testify at the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\"> Upon his return on the evening of June 27, 1988, Smereka attempted to return Mr. Flynn\u2019s call.

The summary proceedings <em>were </em>properly instituted in district court which had original jurisdiction over the action. MCL 600.5704; MSA 27A.5704. Plaintiffs, however, attempted to enforce their right of redemption by commencing the circuit court action.

Therefore, the <em>only </em>means by which the circuit court could obtain jurisdiction was by appeal from the district court. MCR 7.101(A)(2). The circuit court action was properly abated.

We find the Court of Appeals holding persuasive in this regard:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Here, the parties are the same in both the district court and circuit court actions, and both actions arise out of a dispute over whether the parties have satisfied the terms of their land contract. Further, by granting district courts jurisdiction to enforce writs and orders, the summary forfeiture proceedings statute, MCL 600.5732; MSA 27A.5732, evinces a legislative intent that the district court\u2019s summary proceedings jurisdiction may continue until the writ of restitution is executed. See also 52A CJS, Landlord &amp; Tenant, \u00a7 783, p 195 (\u201cThe court issuing the warrant has supervision and control over it until there has been a full and final execution\u201d).

A judgment of forfeiture and possession for breach of the land contract was entered, stating that the Flynns owed $455,833.35, and that they had until June 28, 1988, to cure the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Flynn and Smereka, the lawyer designated by the Komeffels to represent them in further dealings with the Flynns, spoke on the telephone before 10:00 A.M. on the morning of the last day, June 28. Flynn advised Smereka that he would have the redemption money before the end of the day and that he would need a deed from the Komeffels pursuant to the land contract conveying the premises to the Flynns and discharges of mortgages from the original seller to a bank aggregating, in original amount, $505,000 \u2014 more than the amount of the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">At one point in the conversation, Smereka said that he would call Flynn back later in the day.

Before doing so, Smereka advised his client that he need not remain in his office, and that he too could leave for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Smereka did not prepare a deed of conveyance to be signed by the Komeffels.

Neither Smereka nor Korneffel could be reached until after 6:00 P.M.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">At that hour, Flynn hand delivered to Smereka at his home/office a letter from Lawyers Title advising that the Flynns had placed in escrow the sum of $466,510.95 to satisfy the judgment, and that they had also left additional monies should there be any discrepancies in the account.

The majority\u2019s construction is strained, and is contrary to the legislative intent<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to codify the law\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>abhorrence of forfeitures into a straightforward procedural system.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The statute creates a <em>legal </em>right in vendors to initiate forfeiture proceedings and a <em>legal </em>right in vendees to redeem after judgment. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the right is no longer \u201cequitable.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 198. The \u201creasonableness\u201d of the vendee\u2019s actions is not determinative if he has complied with the terms of the statute. As the majority notes, \u201cthe right to redeem is a statutory, legal right that may not be enlarged or abridged by the courts.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Although acknowledging this principle, the majority abridges the rights of a vendee to redeem pursuant to the land contract by refashioning the tender rule into an absolute reprieve of any obligation on the part of the vendor to participate in the redemption except for having someone available to accept an unconditional payment \u2014 documentation to follow when the vendor decides it is convenient to fulfill his obligations under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">There is no need to consider whether the land contract and the accompanying duty of good faith and fair dealing obliged the Komeffels or their lawyer, Smereka, to attend a closing at the Lawyers Title office \u2014 to travel from Grosse He (where the Komeffels reside) or Northville (where Smereka had his home/office) to Troy, where Lawyers Title office was located, to receive a Lawyers Title check for $466,510.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Nor was it of any significance that Flynn obtained the money and offered to redeem at the eleventh hour, or whether Smereka made himself unavailable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>by leaving, after hanging up on Flynn on the morning of June 28, on the assertedly long-planned shopping trip with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Smereka, aware of Komeffel\u2019s desire to thwart redemption, maintained (and the district court subsequently agreed) that the Komeffels had no obligation to facilitate the redemption by exchanging the deed and discharges upon receipt of the money. Smereka maintained that it was the Flynns\u2019 obligation to pay the $466,510.95 to redeem without simultaneous delivery of a deed or discharges of encumbrances, and that the Komeffels could, thus, at their convenience\u2014 possibly their leisure \u2014 provide the requisite deed and discharges at some indefinite time after receipt of the redemption money.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">After speaking to Flynn on the morning of June 28, Smereka did not prepare the discharges for recording or seek to have them available<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> so that he would have them in hand to deliver to the Flynns should they offer to redeem. Nor did Smereka prepare a deed of conveyance to be signed by the Komeffels, and request that the deed be signed and returned to him so that he would have a deed should the Flynns offer to redeem. Smereka told Korneffel that he too could take the rest of the day off and need not remain in his office. He too could be unavailable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In Smereka\u2019s and the district court\u2019s analysis, this obstructionism would have been legally justified even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>if Flynn had earlier deposited the money with Lawyers Title (e.g., on the tenth or the seventy-fifth day) and had offered to redeem in exchange for delivery of the deed and discharges, or even if Smereka had remained in his office throughout the last day, June 28, and had not gone on the long-planned shopping trip, and even if Lawyers Title had tendered a check at Smereka\u2019s office in Northville.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Because Smereka maintained that he had no obligation on June 28 to have ready the mortgage discharges, and no obligation to prepare and have in hand a signed deed of conveyance from the Korneffels, even if Smereka had remained in his office all day and the Lawyers Title check had been presented in his office, he would have been unable to deliver, and asserted he had no obligation simultaneously then to deliver, a deed and the discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The true and only issue in this case is thus simply whether the Komeffels were obliged simultaneously to exchange deed and discharges for the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">If, as the district court ruled, a vendor has no obligation to cooperate during the ninety-day redemption period, by simultaneously furnishing a deed and discharges of any vendor-created encumbrances in exchange for the money, and thereby facilitate new financing, or a sale to a purchaser, then the law permits the vendor to frustrate new financing or a sale needed to redeem, whether on the tenth or seventy-fifth day or at the eleventh hour on the last day.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">But the law is not so foolish. The case law does not negate the obligation of the vendor to provide the deed and requisite discharges simultaneously in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>exchange for payment in full of the contract balance and redemption amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The majority states that \u201cin order to effectuate the right of redemption, the full amount, not merely an offer, must be tendered <em>without qualification or condition. Kaiser v Weber, </em>301 Mich 609; 4 NW2d 29 (1942).\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The statement that a tender must be \u201cwithout qualification or condition\u201d is an accurate generalization, but does not fully state the law, which recognizes that a debtor making tender may interpose conditions that have a \u201cfoundation in the contractual relation,\u201d and that there are certain conditions that a \u201cdebtor has the right to insist on\u201d as \u201cwhen the performance of an act on the part of the creditor is to be precedent to or <em>concurrent </em>with the payment by the debtor.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>A number of courts have ruled that a \u201ctender is not conditional ... if the condition is one which the person making the tender has a legal right to insist upon.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The stipulation, in the letter delivered on June 28 from Lawyers Title to Smereka, that the Komeffels furnish a deed of conveyance and discharges of the mortgages had a \u201cfoundation in the contractual relation\u201d; the land contract obliged the Komeffels \u201cupon\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>receipt of full payment to convey a marketable title. Those stipulations regarding the furnishing of a deed and discharges were ones \u201cwhich the debtor ha[d] the right to insist on.\u201d The timely furnishing of the deeds and discharges was \u201cthe performance of an act on the part of the creditor\u201d that was to be \u201cconcurrent with the payment by the debtor,\u201d and thus the Flynns could make their offer depend on the due performance by the Komeffels of those obligations under the contract.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In <em>Kaiser, </em>five years after the vendor had reobtained possession of the premises in the course of land contract forfeiture proceedings during the Great Depression, the plaintiffs sought to reopen the matter by an action in chancery. They claimed that their lawyer had made an arrangement to obtain a loan to redeem the property. The lawyer testified that he advised the vendor that the payment would be made when the vendors delivered the deed. But no formal written tender was made to the vendors or their attorneys. This Court ruled that it would introduce an \u201cunsafe and litigious element\u201d if this Court were to hold that \u201can offer to perform, with ability to do so,\u201d was a sufficient tender. <em>Id., </em>p 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The majority states that Komeffel and Smereka \u201cwere prepared to accept the redemption money if tendered. We believe that the present case is one similar to <em>Grossman [Bldg Co v Elliott, </em>382 Mich 596; 171 NW2d 441 (1969)], where the \u2018negotiations between the parties\u2019 attorneys came to an impasse.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In <em>Grossman, </em>the vendor declined to forward a deed to a bank where the vendee may have arranged a new loan. In the instant case, Smereka took obstructionism one step further in taking the position that Komeffel was not obliged to provide a deed and the discharges simultaneously in exchange for the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In contrast with the instant case, the vendee in <em>Grossman </em>did not deposit the money with a recognized escrow agent, and did not make a formal tender together with a demand for the deed. The vendee\u2019s response in <em>Grossman </em>was to do nothing; it was not until after the time for redemption had expired that he commenced proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\"><em>Grossman </em>stands for the proposition that an anticipatory breach by the vendor \u2014 the refusal to forward a deed to a lender \u2014 did not relieve the vendee of the obligation to make a formal tender, and to show that it had the money to back up the tender. <em>Grossman </em>does not stand for the proposition that if the vendee makes a formal tender with irrefutable evidence that the money is there, the vendor has no obligation to simultaneously provide a deed conveying a marketable title in exchange for the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">In <em>Kaiser </em>and <em>Grossman </em>there were only promises to pay from vendees who had already failed to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>their promises of payment, resulting in an action to foreclose in <em>Grossman </em>and an action to forfeit in <em>Kaiser. </em>Placing money in escrow with a recognized escrow agent is not just another promise. Placing money in escrow is concrete evidence of ability to perform. It does not introduce an \u201cunsafe and litigious\u201d inquiry regarding the ability to perform pursuant to the terms of the tender. Placing the money in escrow with a title company, with notice to the vendor that it will be released to him upon performance of his obligations under the land contract, is tender.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The majority at no point adverts to the vendor\u2019s responsibility to provide, \u201cupon\u201d receipt of payment in full, a warranty deed conveying a marketable title.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The majority affirms the trial court\u2019s decision that Korneffel was entitled to require payment of the redemption money without simultaneously delivering in exchange a deed of conveyance and the mortgage discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The majority asserts that it does not decide the case of a vendee who notifies the vendor in a reasonable manner and within reasonable time of a third-party lender\u2019s conditions on disbursement of redemption funds. But the majority is deciding that case also if its opinion is read as accepting Smereka\u2019s and the district court\u2019s analysis that there is no obligation to furnish a deed and discharges simultaneously in exchange for the money. Deposit of the redemption money with the district court would not have provided the requisite deed and discharges needed to authorize Lawyers Title to release the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>If the law does not require simultaneous exchange of money and deed and discharges during the redemption period, no court could lawfully require simultaneous exchange even if the money had been on deposit with an escrow agent for over a month, and a month still remained in the redemption period.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">If the majority truly is not deciding this issue, it is introducing an \u201cunsafe and litigious element\u201d into land contract law by requiring that cases be brought to define what is \u201ca reasonable manner\u201d of notification and what constitutes \u201ca reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">There is no need to decide what is \u201creasonable\u201d because the Legislature has already done so. The statute provides that vendees who have not yet paid fifty percent of the principal owing under the contract have ninety days to redeem. While ideally notifications and redemption will be done earlier, a party may need the full ninety days to find a lender or purchaser. If this does not happen until \u201cthe eleventh hour,\u201d <em>ante, </em>p 207, the statute does not authorize a court to ignore the vendee\u2019s efforts because he uses a full twelve hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">If \u201creasonableness\u201d is judicially written into the statute, the majority abridges the legal right to redeem under the statute as written by shortening the time to acquire financing from ninety days, to a \u201creasonable\u201d period before ninety days that a particular judge believes to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u201cNinety days\u201d is not subject to judicial interpretation. This Court should apply the statute as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Either both the vendor and vendee must cut square comers, or only the vendee is required to do so. All else \u2014 whether Smereka purposefully made himself unavailable, whether Smereka was obliged to cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the street or travel to Troy to obtain the redemption money, or whether the Flynns should have acted before the eleventh hour \u2014 is a sideshow.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Either the vendee may require, to facilitate refinancing or a sale, that the deed and discharges be delivered simultaneously with payment in full, or the vendor has a right to insist on payment in full before bothering to assemble discharges and prepare and sign a deed conveying a marketable title.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">I acknowledge that the statute does not address the question whether the vendor is required to deliver a deed of conveyance and discharges of any encumbrances created by the vendor simultaneously in exchange for payment of the redemption money. That is left to the contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">I also acknowledge that the land contract does not in so many words address the question whether a simultaneous exchange is required. I contend however, that the contract <em>contemplates </em>a simultaneous exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">I would hold that the contractual obligation to convey \u201cupon receiving payment in full\u201d obligates the vendor to provide a simultaneous exchange of marketable title sufficient to meet the demands of a reasonable title insurer, which, ordinarily, almost always, will be neither more nor less than what the vendee\u2019s third-party lender would require.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\"><em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Second Edition Unabridged, </em>defines \u201cupon\u201d as meaning \u201cimmediately or very soon after.\u201d It is not a stretch of the English language to define \u201cupon\u201d as meaning \u201cimmediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>This Court has the power, of course, to rule that \u201cupon\u201d means \u201cvery soon after,\u201d with the result that a land contract vendor can stonewall the vendee, as the Komeffels did on the advice of Smereka.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Whether one definition or another is to be adopted is the issue posed by this appeal. This Court has a choice. It can define \u201cupon\u201d in a way that makes it impossible for a land contract vendee in default to refinance or sell the property \u2014 because if the vendor does not have an obligation to convey and furnish discharges of mortgages until \u201cvery soon after,\u201d that will never be soon enough for a lender or a purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Or the Court can, as I think it should, define \u201cupon\u201d as meaning \u201cimmediately,\u201d to facilitate refinancing or sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">There is only one construction that is consistent with the history and spirit of the summary proceeding statute, the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing, and the expectations of the profession generally.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Practitioners, I am confident, would expect this Court to adopt the view that the vendor is obliged, simultaneously upon receipt of the redemption money, to furnish, in these circumstances, a deed and any discharges necessary to clear the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Most lawyers, I believe, would also agree that the obligation of good faith and fair dealing would oblige a vendor to cross the street<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> to obtain the redemption money, possibly even to travel from Northville or Grosse He to Troy to obtain the redemption money at a closing, and certainly to have ready the documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>necessary to complete the contract once the redemption money is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">vn</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In sum, the land contract expressly obliged the Komeffels to deliver to the Flynns a warranty deed of conveyance free from all encumbrances<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>\u201cupon </em>payment in full of all sums owing on the land contract.\u201d Absent delivery of such a deed and discharges of the mortgages aggregating $505,000 in original amount, the Flynns would not have a marketable title justifying disbursement by Lawyers Title of $466,510.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The Flynns needed and were justified in requiring simultaneous delivery of the deed and discharges; the land contract expressly provided that <em>\u201cupon </em>full payment\u201d the seller would convey a marketable title. This, coupled with the obligation implicit in contracts generally of good faith and fair dealing, obliged the Komeffels minimally to have available in Smereka\u2019s office in Northville such a deed and those discharges to be exchanged for a Lawyers Title check for $466,510.95 at Smereka\u2019s convenience at some time designated by him in response to the many telephone calls from Lawyers Title beginning at 2:30 P.M. on June 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The money was there. It was on deposit with Lawyers Title, nationally recognized as an escrow agent, to facilitate the exchange of money and documents affecting real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">The case law relied on by the Komeffels does not hold that a land, contract vendee may not insist on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>simultaneous exchange of payment in full and of documents of conveyance and discharge needed to vest a marketable title in the vendee. Rather, the law is to the contrary: a vendee may insist on performance of an act by the vendor that is to be concurrent with payment in full by the vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The tender by Lawyers Title in behalf of the Flynns imposed no stipulation other than performance by the Komeffels of their contractual obligations to convey a marketable title \u201cupon\u201d receipt of full payment, a stipulation that the Flynns were legally entitled to impose. Because the stipulation concerned only the Komeffels\u2019 express obligations under the contract, the tender was sufficient to redeem. Because the tender was sufficient, and timely, the Flynns did not have the burden of establishing fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-8\">Cavanagh and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> The mortgages had been fully paid, but discharges had not been recorded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\"> The district court judge found that Brinkman \u201cdelayed making any calls to Korneffel or Smereka until after he had the cashier\u2019s check in his possession which the court finds to be at approximately 2:30 P.M. on June 28, 1988. Flynn testified that he telephoned Smereka on June 28, 1988, and left a message on Smerelca\u2019s phone recorder that he had set up the closing for 2:00 p.m and the evidence shows that this is the first time that Flynn actually advised Smereka of the time of the closing ....

All that Smereka needed to do was to copy the very same deed, substituting the Komeffels as grantors and the Flynns as grantees.

Even if there were no doctrine of good faith and fair dealing, the Komeffels nevertheless were contractually obliged to simultaneously exchange a warranty deed and mortgage discharges \u201cupon\u201d payment of the amount owing. They refused to do so, insisting on the erroneous view, advanced by their lawyer (Smer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>eka), the district court judge, and now by the majority, that they were not under a legal obligation to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">One need not go so far as to say that the Komeffels were guilty of bad faith. Assuming arguendo that they were not, it would not follow that their conduct and that of their lawyer, Smereka, could properly be described as conduct commensurate with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. Smereka testified that he would not walk across the street to accept the redemption money, and advised Komeffel that he did not have to be available on June 28 because his sole obligation was to accept the check (which his staff could do) if it was tendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">I would be hard-pressed to make an argument in support of the district court finding that the Komeffels\u2019 and Smereka\u2019s conduct did not evidence bad faith.

For example, some land contracts may call for a quitclaim deed or a deed with covenants only respecting the vendor\u2019s own acts.

The vendor\u2019s obligation under the land contract was to convey a marketable title, not to satisfy a lender. What constitutes a marketable title is a factual matter that depends on the judgment and opinions of persons qualified to express such an opinion. Generally, today, reliance is placed on the judgments and opinions of the title insurer. Obviously, its judgment and opinion are subject to review\u2014 the vendors are not obliged to produce anything that a third-party lender might require. In the instant case, however, the third-party lender required only delivery of a deed and the discharges. Indisputably, what it required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>was absolutely necessary to evidence the marketable title required by the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"> The majority states that because the Flynns \u201cwere in default,\u201d they were <em>\u201cthus </em>\u2018beyond the contract,\u2019 <em>Birznieks [v Cooper, </em>405 Mich 319, 329; 275 NW2d 221 (1979).]\u201d (Emphasis added.)

The moment the money is paid, all the obligations of the parties under the land contract would become fully enforceable, even if they were dormant during the period of default and while the time for redemption was running.

The majority holds that a vendor has <em>no </em>obligation beyond accepting unconditional tender. In the factual setting presented in the instant case, I would find a limited duty on the part of the vendor to cooperate with a vendee\u2019s attempts to redeem when the vendee is ready, willing, and able to effectuate redemption but for commercially reasonable conditions imposed by a third-party lender, and the said conditions attached to the tender are a result of the vendor\u2019s use of the property after executing the land contract. This duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>would comport with the customary means of finalizing a transfer of real property, which is a closing where the funds are simultaneously exchanged for the necessary title documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">I believe that there are two primary reasons for imposing on such a vendor a duty to cooperate with the vendee in a closing. First, when the sale of land is accomplished through the use of an installment land contract that provides for a balloon payment arrangement, it is not an unreasonable expectation that the vendee will not be able to make the balloon payment absent another loan arrangement. Accordingly, a vendor should be on notice that a commercial lender will not loan an amount of funds sufficient to cover a balloon payment without proof of clear title. Second, and more importantly, when the vendor seeking forfeiture, or his predecessor, has created a postexecution cloud on the title that prevents the vendee from obtaining an unconditional loan to cover the default judgment, it would be manifestly unfair to allow the vendor to sit back, refuse to cooperate with the vendee\u2019s redemption attempts, and then reap the rewards of forfeiture by recovering the property in its improved condition as well as by keeping the payments already made.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The relevant statutory right of redemption provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">When the judgment for possession is for nonpayment of money due under a tenancy or for nonpayment of moneys required to be paid under or any other material breach of an executory contract for purchase of the premises, the writ of restitution shall not issue if, <em>within the time provided, </em>the amount as stated in the judgment, together with the taxed costs, is <em>paid </em>to the plaintiff and other material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>breaches of an executory contract for purchase of the premises are cured. [MCL 600.5744(6); MSA 27A.5744(6) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In <em>Birznieks v Cooper, </em>405 Mich 319, 334; 275 NW2d 221 (1979), this Court considered the modem means by which a debtor renders payments on a land contract: \u201csending personal checks through the mails.\u201d The Court then concluded that \u201cpaid\u201d would be satisfied if the vendee mailed to the vendor (or his lawyer) a personal check for the full amount \u201cwithin the time provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335. Likewise, in determining whether the statute requires the vendor to \u201cdo\u201d anything beyond waiting for the check, we should not ignore that in-person closings are the customary modem means by which transfers are accomplished. We should also consider the financial dynamics of the particular sale method chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">First, we must keep in mind the financial reasons why land contracts are used. In general, a seller finds many advantages in selling real property by an installment land contract rather than by a mortgage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For instance, unlike a mortgagee, during the life of the installment land contract the vendor may often use the property as collateral for other loans, as was expressly provided for in the instant contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unlike a mortgagee, the vendor also has the additional rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>edy of forfeiture<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by which the vendor can recover the property, retain all payments made under the contract, and avoid a court-ordered sale of the property in a foreclosure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the property\u2019s value is substantially greater than the forfeiture judgment, the vendor will receive a windfall. In contrast, a mortgagee must pay any excess to the mortgagor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Forfeiture is usually a quicker remedy to pursue than foreclosure,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and is also accompanied by the statutory provision that abolishes any equitable right of redemption.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">For these reasons, a purchaser generally would prefer acquiring land by a mortgage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, installment land contracts are a viable alternative method of acquiring property for purchasers who do not have the means to secure a substantial down payment required by mortgage lenders, or in times when interest rates for mortgages are higher than the statutorily limited rate for installment land contracts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>of high interest rates, a frequently used payment plan involves monthly payments over a short period of years, with a large balloon payment at the end of the life of the contract.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This financial arrangement is beneficial to sellers because it increases the pool of potential purchasers. In addition, vendors should know that purchasers may agree to the balloon payment arrangement with the expectation that financial conditions will have improved by the time that the balloon payment would be due, perhaps because their own personal financial situation will have improved to the extent that a mortgage lender would be more willing to loan the funds to cover the balloon payment, or because interest rates will fall, making mortgages a more affordable alternative. Whether these above expectations ever become reality does not change the fact that any installment land contract vendor who agrees to a balloon payment plan should reasonably expect that more often than not the vendee will only be able to secure the funds to cover the balloon payment through another financial loan arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">After concluding that a vendor who agrees to a balloon payment plan should have a reasonable expectation that the vendee may seek funds from a commercial lender, the focus should be on whether a vendor can then frustrate the vendee\u2019s attempts to do so. Unlike a mortgage, a land contract will often provide that the vendor has a limited ability to use the property as collateral for other loans during the life of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>installment land contract. Therefore, when a vendor takes advantage of this contractual provision and mortgages the property, and those mortgages remain undischarged <em>on the record </em>(whether paid off or not), and those undischarged mortgages are the reason why a lender places a condition on the disbursement of the redemption funds, the vendor has in effect prevented unconditional tender. This is not unlike the situation presented in <em>Karakas v Dost, </em>67 Mich App 161; 240 NW2d 743 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">In <em>Karakas, </em>the vendees\u2019 attorney repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to locate the vendors\u2019 attorney in order to redeem the property. A writ of restitution was entered. On appeal, the vendees\u2019 attorney claimed that the vendors\u2019 attorney later told him that the vendors had instructed him <em>not </em>to accept payment because they wanted to keep the property. The panel held that \u201cactual transfer of the entire amount of money due is generally required for compliance with redemption statutes. A mere showing of ability and intent to pay is insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167 (citations omitted). However, the panel further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">Nevertheless, case law involving other situations requiring tender of payment holds that valid tender is unnecessary where plaintiff is ready, willing and able to tender, but defendant, by his acts or words, shows that tender would not be accepted. <em>Hanesworth v Hendrickson, </em>320 Mich 577; 31 NW2d 726 (1948), <em>Ranck v Springer, </em>333 Mich 671; 53 NW2d 678 (1952), <em>Frakes v Eghigian, </em>358 Mich 327; 100 NW2d 297 (1960). <em>[Karakas, </em>67 Mich App 167.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In that same vein, I would hold that the vendor is under a duty to provide the necessary documents to satisfy the vendee\u2019s lender\u2019s reasonable condition of providing recordable documents to clear title when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>(1) it is the vendor\u2019s postexecution use of the property that led to the condition and, (2) the vendee has in fact secured the funds before the end of the final day of the redemption period. When that duty has been breached, tender should be excused. Accordingly, in the instant case I would hold that unconditional tender was unnecessary because the vendees were ready, willing, and able to tender before the redemption period had expired but for the conditions imposed by their lender as a result of the vendors\u2019 postexecution actions and because the vendors refused to cooperate in satisfying those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">I do not believe that <em>Grossman Bldg Co v Elliott, </em>382 Mich 596; 171 NW2d 441 (1969), precludes this conclusion. First, <em>Grossman </em>involved redemption from a foreclosure sale \u2014 not a forfeiture. The Court emphasized this fact in stating its concern that to grant relief \u201cwould set a dangerous precedent which would deprive every title to real estate purchased at foreclosure sale of the finality and security clearly intended under the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606. In contrast, a forfeiture does not involve a title acquired at a public sale. Until the writ of restitution is entered, legal title has not been altered in any way. Second, it is unclear from the <em>Grossman </em>facts whether the mortgage at issue was recorded before or after the foreclosure sale, or even before or after the execution of the land contract. Further, there was no indication that the <em>Grossman </em>land contract required a balloon payment, which would be distinguishable from the instant case where the vendors should be reasonably expected to provide clear title in order for the vendees to obtain requisite financing to cover the balloon payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>And perhaps most importantly, the <em>Grossman </em>Court emphasized that the vendee \u201cdid nothing to preserve her right of redemption until after it had expired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statutory redemption period expired on March 30, 1967. And although the vendee\u2019s attorneys sent a letter to the vendor two weeks before the end of the redemption period asking for a warranty deed in order to consummate the loan that would cover the redemption amount, after receiving the vendor\u2019s letter refusing to do so, the vendee <em>did nothing further </em>until April 7, 1967. I do not believe that we should read <em>Grossman </em>as anything more than a \u201cfailure to preserve rights\u201d case. In sharp contrast, the instant vendees placed the funds in escrow with a reputable title company <em>before </em>the redemption period had expired. This escrow, which occurred in addition to the vendors\u2019 refusal to cooperate, distinguishes this case from <em>Grossman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The instant majority\u2019s holding that a vendor need not cooperate will continue effectually to destroy any meaningful statutory right of redemption. Twenty-five years ago, Professor Campbell argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">The purpose of the Michigan statute is to give the land contract vendee a statutory right of redemption not unlike that which has long been accorded the mortgagor. The statute\u2019s enactment surely indicates that the legislature intended to give a land contract vendee meaningful redemption rights. Yet, in practice, his rights have been substantially emasculated. With a purchaser or mortgagee ready and willing to provide the necessary funds for redemption, the vendee, through no fault of his own, is powerless to obtain legal title which is vital to complete the funding transaction. To get legal title, he must first redeem. As noted above, the mortgagor, who retains legal title pending expiration of the redemption period, encounters no such obstacle. If the vendee can persuade the vendor to place a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>deed of legal title in escrow during the redemptive period, the vendee\u2019s rights of redemption are substantially enhanced. If the vendor is unwilling to so cooperate, the vendee\u2019s redemptive rights are diminished. It becomes apparent then, that in many instances, any meaningful rights of redemption for the vendee exist at the pleasure and in the discretion of the vendor, notwithstanding the redemption statute. [Campbell, <em>Real Property, </em>1970 Annual Survey of Michigan Law, 17 Wayne L R 641, 643 (1971).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Turning to the instant case, I would hold that equitable considerations should prompt us to excuse unconditional tender and to relieve the Flynns from an unreasonable forfeiture. <em>Rothenberg v Follman, </em>19 Mich App 383, 388-389; 172 NW2d 845 (1969). I tend to agree with the majority that a vendee cannot unilaterally set up a closing without reasonable notice to the vendor of the time and place. However, I believe that in this case the original vendors\u2019 postexecution mortgages on the property, and attorney Anthony Smereka\u2019s failure to record the discharges or to offer them to the Flynns ahead of tender, should factor in favor of equitable relief by excusing tender.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>On remand, the district court found that the purchase price of the property was $672,500 and that the market value of the property exceeded the default judgment amount. Further, a title commitment ordered four days before the end of the redemption period revealed undischarged postexecution mortgages on the original vendors\u2019 interest totaling $505,000. In contrast, the default judgment was $455,833. It would be commercially reasonable for a lender to question undischarged mortgages that exceed the amount of the requested loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Mr. Smereka testified that he expected all along that the Flynns would redeem and that he would have to deliver clear title. His testimony also revealed that he expected the Flynns to acquire the redemption money through a mortgage company. Knowing that undischarged mortgages would cloud title and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>lenders do not loan money on collateral with clouded title, and further expecting that the vendees would be redeeming with money acquired through a mortgage company, Smereka\u2019s argument that he did not need to attend a closing or even to cooperate with the vendees\u2019 attempts to clear title seems inequitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">On the morning of the last day of redemption, after being advised by Flynn that the discharges had not been recorded, Smereka stated that he was \u201csurprised\u201d that they were not recorded \u2014 even though it had been his obligation to do so. Smereka told Flynn that he would investigate the situation and call back in an hour. He did not call back. Smereka did in fact have possession of the discharges. Instead of offering to provide the discharges, Smereka told Flynn to pay over the money first, and <em>then </em>he would produce the requested documents.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">It is clear that the Komeffels bought into this land contract dispute for the express purpose of obtaining the property. They did not want the Flynns to redeem.

A warranty deed, in and of itself, would not necessarily prove clear title when there were undischarged mortgages remaining on the record \u2014 especially when those mortgages together total more than the default judgment. The issue is whether the undischarged mortgages placed a cloud on title. (It has long been held that an undischarged land contract on record will cloud title. <em>Fletcher v Moore, </em>42 Mich 577, 579 [1880].) The definition of marketable title has been noted as:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The Michigan courts have defined the term <em>marketable title </em>in several cases. In <em>Barnard v Brown, </em>112 Mich 452; 70 NW 1038 (1897), the Michigan Supreme Court said that <em>marketable title </em>is title that is free from encumbrance and is of such a character as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>assure to the purchaser the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of the premises. ... In <em>Madhaven v Sucher, </em>105 Mich App 284; 306 NW2d 481 (1981), the court of appeals reaffirmed this rule and said that (1) title may be regarded as unmarketable if a reasonably prudent person, familiar with the facts, would refuse to accept title as presented in the ordinary course of business, and (2) it is not necessary that title actually be bad to render it unmarketable. [1 Cameron, Michigan Real Property Law (2d ed), \u00a7 12.4, p 400.]</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">That being the rule, it is highly persuasive, on the basis of the testimony at the hearing on remand, that the instant property\u2019s title was unmarketable without recordable discharges of the record mortgages in hand. Anthony Brinkman, an escrow officer at Lawyer\u2019s Title Insurance Corporation (a reputable title company), testified that without valid discharges in hand it would not be safe to draw any conclusions about a subsequently recorded warranty deed. Mr. Smereka, the Komeffels\u2019 attorney at the time of the relevant events, testified that undischarged mortgages will affect clear title. He also admitted that he understood that in the normal course of commercial transactions, lending institutions generally will not accept collateral that is subject to another mortgage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\"> The district court also noted a conversation between Flynn and Smereka in which Smereka stated \u201che wouldn\u2019t walk across the street to accept the money . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
