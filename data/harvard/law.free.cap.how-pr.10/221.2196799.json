We also expressed the opinion in that case, and briefly stated the reasons therefor, although the points were not presented, as they are distinctly in this case, that the provision of the section allowing an appeal \u201c from an order made at a special term,\u201d &amp;c., \u201cwhen it sustains or overrules a demurrer,\u201d is applicable to all cases where leave to amend is given in connection with the decision on the demurrer, and also to decisions on demurrer to part only of a complaint or answer, containing several alleged causes tif action or defences. To that opinion we adhere; and it follows, that the objection to the appeal in this case is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Objection to the appeal, as not warranted, overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
