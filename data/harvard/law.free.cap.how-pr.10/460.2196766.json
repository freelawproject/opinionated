Rhinelander.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b468-8\">The expression, \u201c <em>at his place of residence,\u201d </em>used in \u00a7 411 of the Code, m reference to service of papers by mail, is to be deemed to relate to the <em>post-office, </em>and not to any particular locality in a town or city\u2014(street and number.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b468-9\">Therefore, <em>held, </em>that service of a copy complaint, mailed at Fonda, N. Y., directed to the defendant\u2019s attorneys, <em>\u201cNew-York,\u201d </em>was good, although it appeared that the latter attorneys signed their notice of appearance, &amp;c., \u201c No. 52 Grove-street, in the city of New-York.\u201d</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-10\">\n<em>Essex Special Term,</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AEH\"><em>March, </em>1855.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-11\">This was a motion to dismiss the complaint, because a copy of it had not been served on the attorneys of the defendant, pursuant to demand. Messrs. Morris &amp; King gave notice of appearance, and demanded that a copy of the complaint should be served upon them at their \u201c office, No 52 Grove-street, in the city of New-York.\u201d They never received a copy of the' complaint; but by the affidavits of the attorney for the plaintiff, and the deputy post-master at Fonda, it appeared that a copy was mailed in season, directed to \u201c Morris &amp; King, Esqs., Counsellors, &amp;c.\u2019, New-York.\u201d On that fact appearing, the defendant insisted that the service was insufficient.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-12\">F. W. King, <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-13\">R. S. <em>Hale, for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b468-14\">Hand, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AmW\">I-think the service sufficient, notwithstanding the address did not state the number of the street, or even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the street; but was merely directed to the attorneys of the defendant in \u201c New-York.\u201d The latter required the direction to include the street and number designated by them. This is safer; and sometimes, when directed to a person in a city, has been deemed necessary on service of notice of non-acceptance of bills of exchange, &amp;c., at least in England. <em>(Chit, on Bills, </em>474; <em>Bayl. on Bills, </em>280, 283; <em>and see </em>3 M. &amp; <em>W. </em>166; <em>Ry. </em>&amp; <em>Mood. </em>149, 249; <em>Story on Bills, </em>\u00a7 298, <em>and note.) </em>And, probably, the package in this case was lost for want of more particularity. Still, I think it is better to have a uniform rule; and I believe the expression, \u201c at his place of residence,\u201d used in \u00a7 411 of the Code, has been deemed to relate to the post-office, and not to any particular locality in a town or city. <em>(See Rowell </em>agt. <em>M'Cormick, </em>5 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>337.) That will generally be sufficient. Had the attorney for the plaintiff been informed there were other firms of the same style, or of any other circumstance rendering further designation necessary, a non-compliance with the request to specify the locality might have been evidence of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The motion to dismiss must be denied; but the plaintiff must serve another copy, or file the complaint with the clerk.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
