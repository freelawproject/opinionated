The law, especially as now administered, looks to the substantial intent of the parties, and not to mere shifts or verbal distinctions. And above all,\u2014perhaps I may say, in spite of all,\u2014it studies the dictates of good faith, and struggles to enforce them.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Admitting the right of the plaintiffs to a transfer of the patents, by way of mortgage, the advances of the plaintiffs, which the mortgage was to cover, are sought to be extinguished by a set-off, or counter-claim\u2014in other words, by confession and avoidance. And the question is, as a point of practice, can this new matter on the part of the defendant, be met by opposing affidavits on the part of the plaintiffs. The same principle, it seems to me, which gives to the defendants the right of answering the plaintiffs\u2019 case, must give to the plaintiffs the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of rebutting the defendants. And the Code accordingly (\u00a7 226) provides, in effect, that, if the defendant, instead of relying on the supposed insufficiency of the case made on the part of the plaintiff, rests his motion for a dissolution in any degree \u201cupon affidavits on the part of the defendant,\u201d he gives his adversary the right to oppose the same \u201c by affidavits or other proofs, in addition to those on which the injunction was granted.\u201d Such I understand to be the meaning of this section\u2014a meaning most consonant also with the attainment of justice. The Code contemplates two modes of dissolving an injunction\u2014one, the insufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s papers on which the injunction was granted; the other, the countervailing force of the defendant\u2019s. If the defendant uses any papers \u201c on his part,\u201d they must be \u201c affidavits.\u201d An answer without an affidavit is of no avail. An affidavit\u2014one or more\u2014either distinct and independent, or shaped in reference to the contents of the answer, is indispensable. A jurat, so called, usually attached to an answer, is as much an affidavit as if written out at length on a different paper. Like other affidavits, it may be either positive or upon mere information and belief,\u2014and, like other affidavits, where upon mere information and belief, it is entitled generally to little weight. In whichever form, however, if used at all, it may, in the language of the Code, (\u00a7 226,) be \u201c opposed \u201d by counter affidavits on the part of the plaintiff. Some difference of opinion, I am aware, has existed on this point; but the practice now is generally recognized as above stated, namely, that where a defendant moves, not upon \u201c affidavits \u201d as distinguished from an \u201c answer,\u201d but upon affidavits with or without answer, \u201c <em>on his part,\u201d </em>as distinguished from the original papers, solely, <em>on the part of the plaintiff, </em>in such case the plaintiff may introduce \u201c additional \u201d affidavits to oppose the motion, and to sustain the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The defendants insist further, that their motion, if not granted absolutely, should be conditionally; that is, unless the plaintiffs give security for any damages should they ultimately fail in their suit. It is sufficient, to meet this suggestion, to say, that no such objection is stated in the notice given by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>defendants. And as the <em>2-2d </em>section of the Code prescribes that the judge issuing the injunction shall require an undertaking from the plaintiff, I am bound to presume that an undertaking was given, and in such amount, and with such sureties as, in the exercise of a sound discretion, he deemed proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The motion to dissolve must, therefore, be denied with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
