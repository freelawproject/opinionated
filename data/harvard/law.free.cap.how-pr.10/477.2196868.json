F. Schland.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b485-7\">A person, an <em>emigrant, </em>having left for ever his native land, is living in the state of New-York, without any determination to reside anywhere else\u2014where is his <em>residence 1 </em>Most clearly, in the state of New-York.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b485-8\">\n<em>JVew- York Special Term,</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Akx\"><em>May, </em>1854.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AbY\">Motion, by defendant, to set aside attachment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-9\">\n<em>\u2014 \u2014, for defendant.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-10\">\u2014 \u2014, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-11\">Morris, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A-K\">Attachment issued against the property of the defendant, under \u00a7 229 of the Code, upon the ground that the defendant was \u201cnot a resident of this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">The clause of the affidavit, which is claimed to establish that defendant is not a resident of this state, is as follows:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">\u201c The defendant is not a resident of the state of New-York; that said defendant has but just emigrated to this country, and has no permanent residence, except his staying as a boarder and lodger with this deponent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">This shows the facts upon which the plaintiff forms the conclusion, that the defendant is \u201c not a resident of this state,\u201d viz.: he \u201c has but just emigrated to this country.\u201d This fact shows he has left his native land for ever, and has come to reside permanently in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">The plaintiff also states, he \u201c has no permanent residence, <em>except </em>his staying as a boarder and lodger with this deponent.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The word <em>\u201cexcept\u201d </em>as here placed, would certainly imply that his permanent residence was at the plaintiff\u2019s; this, however, I presume was not the intent and meaning of the plaintiff : he intended to convey the idea that defendant had no permanent residence, but merely boarded and lodged with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The question under this affidavit is this: If a person, an emigrant, having left for ever his native land, is living in the state of New-York, without any determination to reside any where else, is he, or not, a resident of this state under the statute <em>1 </em>In my judgment, he is a resident. He is here\u2014 living here\u2014having abandoned his native country for ever, and has no determination to reside in any other place.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The facts, however, disclosed by the moving affidavits, conclusively show that the defendant came here with the intention of making the state of New-York his residence, and that the debt he incurred to the plaintiff, upon which this suit is instituted, was contracted in settling himself permanently in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Attachment set aside, with costs of motion to defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
