A requisition to the sheriff, requiring him to take the property and deliver it to the plaintiffs, was endorsed by them on the affidavit required for that purpose; upon the receipt of which, together with the prescribed undertaking, the sheriff made the usual seizure. The property, however, was afterwards returned to the defendants on their requisition, accompanied by a counter undertaking.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-10\">The d\u00e9fendants insist that the seizure by the sheriff was illegal, and a motion is made to set aside all the proceedings, on the ground that the affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiffs did not show, as required by the Code, (\u00a7 207,) that the plaintiffs were the owners of the property.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-11\">\n<em>\u2014 \u2014, for defenants.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-12\">\u2014 \u2014, <em>for plaintiffs.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b384-13\">Roosevelt, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Alr\">True, the person making the affidavit swears positively that the plaintiffs \u201c are the owners;\u201d but then, it is said, he does not <em>show </em>that they are; on the contrary, he admits facts, it is said, which go to show that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>are not. That they were once the owners is undisputed\u2014that the) made a sale is undisputed; but if that sale, as is alleged, was fraudulent, they remain the owners still. Can I say that, on the face of the affidavit, there was no fraud <em>1 </em>That is the precise issue to be tried. Until it is tried, what hardship can result in leaving the undertaking of the defendants to stand 1 They have the property, and can dispose of it as they see fit. Should the trial result, as they insist it will, in a verdict in their favor, their undertaking will then, by its very terms, be discharged, and they will have that of the plaintiffs to look to for damages. Should it result otherwise, however, as it may, the plaintiffs, in that event, might be seriously prejudiced should they be without any undertaking to secure them the fruits of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Under the circumstances, justice, it seems to me, is most likely to be done by leaving the parties in <em>statu quo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Motion denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
