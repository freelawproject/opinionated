Judgment of foreclosure and sale was rendered for the plaintiffs on the 30th. July, 1853; and the premis\u00e9s were sold under said judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>upon due notice, by the sheriff, to Charles Parsons, of the city of New York, who was the highest bidder, and became the purchaser; and to whom the 'sheriff, on the 26th Oct., 1853, executed a deed of the premises; which deed had been duly recorded. On the 28th of January, 1854, Parsons demanded possession of said premises from the- defendant, Rachel Snediker, (widow of the mortgagor, and who executed the mortgage with her husband,) who was then in possession. She refused to deliver possession\u2014claiming that she had a right to occupy the premises for the same length of time after the sale upon a foreclosure, as upon a sale by the sheriff under an execution\u2014 (one year.) Parsons now moved for a writ of assistance, to be put into possession of said premises. The motion was opposed by Mrs. Snediker.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-5\">Archibald Hilton, <em>for Parsons.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-6\">S.

Her counsel insists that, like a judgment debtor after a sale on execution, she has the right of <em>redemp</em>tion.i and the consequent right of possession for twelve months after the sale. If such be a correct view of the present state of the law, both bar and bench, and the whole community,' have been laboring under a serious error for the last six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The mortgage redemption act was repealed, it is admitted, \u00e1s early as 1838; but the legislature,by an act, it is said, passed Nov. 20,1847, <em>\u201c </em>to amend title five of chapter six of the third part of the Revised Statutes,\u201d inadvertently, it may be, restored the privilege. In that act, it was declared that \u201c <em>all </em>the provisions of the said title shall extend and apply to <em>liens by </em>mortgage, in the same manner as they do to liens by judgment or decree.\u201d Now, among the provisions of the title referred to, is that which gives to judgment debtors the right of redemption. And hence it is inferred that, by the act of 1847, the same right of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>demption is extended to debtors by mortgage. The answer is, that every law must be construed according to its subject matter. The title in question, by its very terms, had reference exclusively to \u201c personal actions,\u201d as understood before the Code, and to \u201c executions against property,\u201d in such actions. It had no reference to equity suits, or to sales on foreclosure, except in a single particular\u2014a junior creditor by chancery decree, not of foreclosure, but for the recovery of a specific sum of money, was placed upon the same footing, in respect of the right of redemption, as a junior creditor by ordinary common law judgment. Both were treated as alike holding liens on the premises sold under the older execution, and alike entitled to redeem as against such sale. It was soon discovered, however, that a lien by mortgage, where no decree had been obtained, possessed at least as strong claims, in respect of the privilege of redemption, as either of the other two. And accordingly the fifty-first section- of the title in question was amended by inserting, after the words \u201c any creditor having a decree-' or judgment,\u201d the words \u201c or having a mortgage duly recorded.\u201d Having done this, it became obviously necessary that all the other provisions, some twenty odd'in numb\u00e9r, which related to \u201c <em>liens by judgment or </em>decree,\u201d should be \u201c extended, and applied to <em>liens by mortgage </em>such, for instance, as allowing a redemption of one or more of- several lots, or of an unundivided share of a-single lot or parcel, and defining the time when the title of the judgment debtor shall be divested, and how the redeeming creditor may himself be' subjected to redemption in favor of some other holder of a like lien, and how the sheriffs\u2019 deeds are to be given, and when, and to whom, &amp;c. The object of the act was to provide for the holders, and not for the givers of mortgages, and in cases not of foreclosure, but of <em>\u201c </em>sales under execution \u201d in personal actions. Mortgagors had already a right to redeem as against such sales, and this act extended the right to mortgagees. The former, too, for twelve months had the preference\u2014the rights of the latter, even by the amendment, could only be exerted after the former had, by his omission, signified a determination to forego the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>privilege. If the mortgage debtor would not, or could not redeem from the execution sale, there seemed a peculiar fitness in allowing the mortgage creditor to save himself, and, in doing so, virtually to save the debtor. In other words, the evil to be remedied was obvious, and the act to effect it should, therefore, be so construed as to attain that end, and not an end never dreamed of by its framers, and never imagined, as I believe, by any of its expounders\u2014until now. New discoveries, whether real or imaginary, are calculated to flatter the natural vanity of man. But, in the interpretation of laws made for a business community, and by business legislators, such discoveries are to be lightly received. Cotemporaneous and long continued, uninterrupted exposition is a safer guide. The intention of the law-maker is the law; and, in a republic like ours, the best evidence of that intention is the practical exposition of the whole community.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The motion of the purchaser, therefore, for a writ of assistance to compel the immediate, delivery of possession must be granted, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
