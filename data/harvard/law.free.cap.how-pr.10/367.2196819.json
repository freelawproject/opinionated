They should not be involved in a law suit in <em>anticipation </em>that they might foreclose and sell the plaintiff\u2019s lots first. When they undertake proceedings touching the plaintiff\u2019s rights, it will then be time enough for him to move.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-10\">\n<em>New- York Special Term,</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AeJ\">1854.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AC9\">Demurrer to complaint.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A--\">The plaintiff alleges that he purchased of defendant, Draper, four lots on 107th street, for $840, paying ten per cent, in cash; that thirty per cent, was to be paid on the delivery of the title, and the remainder to be secured by mortgage; that, although ready on his part, the defendant, Draper, has not complied with his bargain, but has put the plaintiff off with excuses. He, therefore, prays for a decree of specific performance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-11\">The four lots in question, it appears, are part of a tract owned by Draper, containing about fourteen acres, or between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>one and two hundred lots, previously mortgaged by him for several thousand dollars to the other defendants, who insist that they have nothing to do with the controversy, and ought not to have been made parties to the suit.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b376-5\">Roosevelt, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ANBh\">The demurrers, it seems to me, are well taken. It is said they ought to be compelled, when they come to foreclose, to sell first the lots not embraced in plaintiff\u2019s contract. But it is not alleged that they intend to do otherwise. They have done no wrong to the plaintiff, and threaten none. Their rights, too, are paramount to his, and he\u2018had legal notice of those rights when he made his purchase. <em>Sic utere tuo ut alienum non loedas, </em>is a maxim, I admit, both of . law and of morals. But in this case there is no pretence that the prior mortgagees contemplate so using their own as to injure their neighbor\u2019s. When they commence their foreclosure suits \u25a0\u2014should they ever do so\u2014they will, no doubt, conduct them with a due regard to the equities of all parties. It will be time enough to act on a contrary presumption when a contrary purpose is developed. To allow each purchaser of a single lot, out of nearly two hundred, to involve the innocent mortgagees of the whole tract in as many law suits, by anticipation, as there are lots, would be as oppressively unjust, as it is palpably unnecessary. Such a practice once established, and generally understood, would render loans on blocks, or parcels of lots, nearly, if not entirely, unattainable, and the securities, if taken, unavailable, unless at a ruinous discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s bill, therefore, as against the defendants, Edward C. West and The Society of the New-York Hospital, must be dismissed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
