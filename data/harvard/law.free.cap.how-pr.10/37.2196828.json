The plaintiff had judgment for the property, and also seventy dollars for damages for the detention. An execution was issued against the property of the defendant, and returned unsatisfied. Ah execution against the person was then issued, and the defendant arrested. This motion is made to set aside the execution as irregular, because it does not state the nature of the action,, the defendant insisting that it should appear on the face of the execution; that it was issued in an action wherein the party against whom the judgment is rendered is liable to imprisonment. The defendant also moves to set it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>aside, because an' execution cannot issue against the body in this action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-5\">Monell and Dunning, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-6\">M.

Though it might be better to state the nature of .the action in the execution, yet, where, by a reference to the judgment it appears that the execution is regular, the person .can not be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">But the second objection is a serious and, in my judgment, ah insuperable one. The complaint states that the plaintiff derived title from Reuben Van Allen; that at the time he so acquired.title, the defendant was in the occupatiomof the premises under Van Allen; that the defendant, on demand, delivered to the plaintiff th\u00e9 possession, by giving to his agent the key of the outer door of the house on the premises. The answer denies all the allegations in the complaint, and then sets up that the defendant was in possession of the premises as tenant in common, and other facts, from all of which it is clear that the ' action was one to try the title to the premises, and not to.recover damages for a forcible entry upon them. The complaint also alleges that thirty dollars per year is a reasonable sum for the rents and profits, and concludes by demanding \u201cjudgment for the <em>possession of the </em>premises, and also <em>\u00f3n\u00e9 hundred dollars for the rents and profits </em>of the same.\u201d The question arises, therefore, whether, in an action of this nature, the unsuccessful party can be imprisoned. I think that the whole issue tried in this case was one. which must have arisen on contract, express or implied, and that when a plaintiff claims to recover for rents and profits he cannot deny that his action was founded on contract -. for rents never accrue except where a contract can be proved or implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">But whatever may have been the rights of the parties under the nonimprisonment act, so far as the decision of this motion is concerned, I db nbt deem material; for the Code has prescribed the cases in which an execution against the body may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>issue. By \u00a7 288 it is provided that an execution against the body may issue in an action in which the defendant may be arrested, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 179,181. For the purposes of the present motion it will only he necessary to examine the first subdivision of \u00a7 179. That is confined to \u201c an action for the recovery of damages on a cause of action not arising out of contract, where the defendant is not a'resident of the state, or is about to remove therefrom; or where the action is for an injury to person or character, or for injuring, or for wrongfully taking, detaining, or converting property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">This subdivision confines the right of arrest to actions for the recovery of \u201c damages,\u201d where the cause of action did not arise on contract in the following cases:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">1. Where the defendant is not a resident of the state, or is about to remove therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">2. Where the damage sought is for an injury to person or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">character. \u25a0 -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">3. Where the damage to he recovered is for injuring, wrongfully detaining, or converting property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">An action of ejectment is not \u201c an action for the recovery of damages \u201d for any purpose; but if it were, no lawyer will say that the legislature intended to include it in an action for <em>\u201c </em>injuring, detaining, or converting property.\u201d In an action to recover possession of personal property the defendant cannot be imprisoned unless he can be brought within the third subdivision of \u00a7 179, which is equivalent to making out a case of actual fraud in the disposition of the property. There is no reason why an action to recover possession of real property should give to the plaintiff any more stringent remedies. The execution must be set aside, and the defendant discharged from imprisonment: but, as the question seems to be a new one, without costs to either party on this motion; and the defendant must stipulate not to bring an action for false imprisonment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
