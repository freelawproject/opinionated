Strong, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AMP\">In my opinion, the complaint is sufficient, both under \u00a7 162 of the Code, and independent of that section. It alleges the making of the note, which includes delivery to the <em>payee;\u2014(Churchill </em>agt. Gardner, 7 <em>Term Rep. </em>596; <em>Russell </em>agt. Whipple, 2 <em>Cow. </em>536;)\u2014gives a copy of the note, in which \u00a3\u00a3 J. Chappell \u201d is named as the payee; and avers that there is due to the plaintiff, on the note, a sum named, for which, with interest, the plaintiff demands judgment. Here is a full compliance with \u00a7 162 referred to; and also with subdivision 2 of \u00a7 142. It must be implied, in support of the pleading, that \u201c J. Chappell \u201d is the plaintiff, as much as it would be that\u00a3\u00a3 James Chappell \u201d and the plaintiff are identical, if the full name had been given as' payee; The production of the note in evidence, by the plaintiff, ivould clearly be sufficient evidence of title without endorsement; it would be presumed, from his possession of the note, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>similarity of the name therein to his, that the plaintiff is the <em>payee;\u2014(Forman </em>agt. <em>Steblins, </em>4 Hill, 181;)\u2014and the same thing should he intended, and regarded as impliedly alleged, from the pleading containing the facts raising such a presumption. The name, <em>\u201cJ. </em>Chappell,\u201d may mean the plaintiff as much as <em>\u201c </em>James Chappell.\u201d It may mean another person, as \u201c James Chappell \u201d might. But it will he construed, in like manner as \u201c James Chappell \u201d would he, to mean the plaintiff, in order to sustain the complaint. <em>(Wyatt </em>agt. <em>Aland, Salk. </em>325; <em>King </em>agt. <em>Stevens, </em>3 <em>East. </em>244.) From the plaintiff suing on the note, it must he assumed, so far as the pleading is concerned, to he in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The plaintiff must have judgment on the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
