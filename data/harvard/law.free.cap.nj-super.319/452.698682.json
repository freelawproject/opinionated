Plaintiff also appeals from an order of July 16, 1997, granting summary judgment to defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>dants Collier High School (Collier High) and its principal, Raymond Bock, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Defendants Collier High and Bock, as third party plaintiffs, cross appeal from the same order of July 16,1997, dismissing their third party complaint. The cross-appeal \u201cis made solely for the purpose of restoring the third party complaint in the event plaintiffs appeal is successful.\u201d The third party complaint was filed against the Township of Monroe, the Monroe Township Board of Education (\u201cBoard\u201d) and H.C. (\u201cC.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> C. is alleged to have sexually harassed plaintiff on the school bus they mutually rode to and from Collier High, a private high school for children with special needs. Plaintiff was placed there by the Board which was responsible for the busing of plaintiff to and from school. The third party complaint sought \u201ccommon law indemnification\u201d and contribution from all three third party defendants and \u201ccontractual indemnification\u201d from the Board and Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Plaintiff endeavored to sue Monroe Township and the Monroe Township Board of Education as well as Collier High and Bock who, she claims, failed to \u201cprotect and care for\u201d her while she was in their \u201ccustody.\u201d However, the Law Division declined to permit the late filing of the tort claim notice. The motion judge concluded that there were no \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to warrant the late filing (more than ninety days after, but within a year of, plaintiffs eighteenth birthday). <em>See N.J.S.A </em>59:8-1, -8, -9. <em>Vedutis v. Tesi, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 340-41, 343 A.2d 171 (Law Div. 1975), <em>aff'd </em>o.b., <em>Vedutis v. South Plainfield Bd. of Educ., </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492, 362 A.2d 51 (App.Div.1976)); <em>Rost v. Fair Lawn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>Bd. of Educ., </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 347 <em>A.2d </em>811 (App.Div.1975). Plaintiff challenges that order and the order which granted summary judgment to Collier High and Bock on the grounds that they owed \u201cno duty\u201d to plaintiff because she was on the school bus over which they had \u201cno control.\u201d Plaintiff contends that \u201cCollier and Bock had an obligation to notify plaintiffs parents of her allegations of criminal sexual contact and abuse on the school bus\u201d and argues that \u201c[t]he fact that the third party defendants were responsible for setting up the transportation of students to and from Collier, has no bearing upon the liability of Collier and Bock in failing to protect the plaintiff when she went to them for help.\u201d Under plaintiffs version, she went to Bock several times and he promised to do something about it, but took action which was inadequate and ineffective. Plaintiff alleges that because Bock\u2019s efforts were so inadequate and ineffective, the harassment became progressively worse. Under plaintiff\u2019s version, Bock, as an agent for Collier High, was advised of the facts and assumed the responsibility as principal to correct the problem. Plaintiff also contends that neither Collier High nor Bock is protected by charitable immunity which was an alternative basis for the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Collier High, which is located in Monmouth County, is an \u201calternative\u201d high school that serves over forty school districts from several counties. Students are enrolled there upon referral by their local school district\u2019s child study teams.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The school is part of Collier Services, \u201ca non-sectarian, not-for-profit, private agency sponsored by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd.\u201d Collier Services \u201cqualifies as a non-profit entity organized exclusively for charitable, religious or educational purposes for tax exemption status and files IRS Form 990.\u201d Bock has been the principal of Collier High since 1987. As principal, Bock is primarily responsible for student behavior and \u201coversee[s] transportation issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Plaintiff, a Jamesburg resident, was enrolled in Collier High since 1992. At the time of her enrollment, plaintiff was a sophomore. Plaintiff was transported to and from the school by \u201ca minibus\u201d provided by the Monroe Township Board of Education. During plaintiffs junior year (1992-93), there were approximately five passengers on the bus, including plaintiff and C. The passengers did not have assigned seats. The bus had different drivers over the course of the school year. At the end of plaintiffs junior year, the bus was driven by Joseph Sabba, who continued to hold that position through plaintiffs senior year. During plaintiffs senior year (1993-94), there were six passengers who rode the bus, including plaintiff and C.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">For purposes of summary judgment, we must accept the facts as alleged by plaintiff and give her the benefit of all inferences those facts support. <em>Baird v. American Medical Optics, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>54, 58, 713 A.2d 1019 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Plaintiff testified that she first met C. at \u201cthe beginning of [her] junior year\u201d (1992-93). By November or December, they \u201cstarted talking ... as Mends,\u201d although plaintiff denied that they \u201cfool[ed] around ... verbally.\u201d The friendship was limited to the time spent on the bus. They did not socialize or speak either in or out of school.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">According to plaintiff, C. started making \u201crude comments, sexual comments\u201d to her in early 1993. Initially, plaintiff responded by telling him either to \u201cshut up\u201d or to \u201cstop\u201d making the comments. However, when he did not do so, plaintiff would \u201csay something back to him or ... hit him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">When C. began to make the remarks, plaintiff at first did \u201cnothing\u201d after she got off the bus. She simply hoped that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d However, as the situation intensified and the comments continued, plaintiff went to Bock in February or March 1993 and informed him that C. \u201cwas bothering [her] and making rude ... and sexual comments\u201d and that she wanted it to stop. Bock told plaintiff that \u201che would speak to\u201d C. and that \u201cit shouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Although plaintiff did not know whether Bock, in fact, talked to C., the comments subsided for a few days. However, shortly thereafter C. not only resumed making the remarks but also began to \u201cgrab [plaintiffs] chest [and] genital area.\u201d Plaintiff continued to tell C. to stop. She also moved to other seats on the bus to get away from him, but he would \u201cfollow\u201d her. By April 1993, C. was \u201cgrabbing [her] and putting [her] into sexual positions.\u201d Plaintiff admitted that she responded by hitting C. and calling him a \u201cnig_\u201d and \u201c[b]lack piece of__\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Plaintiff met with Bock again in either late April or early May of 1993. She told Bock that C. was still making the remarks, that he was grabbing her, and that she could neither defend herself nor \u201ctake it any more.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bock said that he would meet with C. again \u201cand that it should stop.\u201d Bock asked plaintiff if she wanted to attend the meeting, but plaintiff declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">After the meeting with Bock, C.\u2019s offensive behavior subsided for up to a week, but then resumed. Plaintiff told C. that she would go back to Bock if he did not stop. However, she never went back to Bock because the school year was almost over.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Plaintiff did not see C. during the summer. By either the end of September or early October of her senior year (1993-94), the comments and grabbing started again. After a few weeks, plaintiff had another meeting with Bock. During this meeting, an administrative assistant named Buchanan was called in. When Bock again asked plaintiff if she wanted to be present when he spoke to C., plaintiff said that she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">C. was then called to the meeting. Bock told him that his behavior was \u201ca criminal offense,\u201d that it would not be tolerated, and that he could be \u201ckicked off the bus\u201d if it continued. According to plaintiff, C. apologized and said nothing about plaintiffs behavior during the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Following the meeting, there was a period of good behavior. However, around Christmas time, a Collier High administrative assistant named Collins found plaintiff \u201ccrying\u201d in the ladies room. Plaintiff told Ms. Collins \u201cwhat was happening,\u201d and Collins took her to Bock. Consistent with the past practice, after plaintiffs meeting with Bock, C. stopped harassing her for a short time and then started up again after the Christmas break. Plaintiff met with Bock a few more times as the circumstances required, and Bock continued to warn that C. \u201ccould be kicked off the bus or C. could be suspended ... or kicked out of school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Plaintiff did not tell her mother about these events until some time in her senior year. On May 24, 1994, plaintiff reported that she \u201cwas never going back\u201d on the bus again. The next day, plaintiffs mother went to school with plaintiff and met with Bock. Plaintiff subsequently submitted a written request that she be permitted \u201cto drive to school for the rest of the year.\u201d The request was ultimately denied by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">At the May meeting, Bock \u201cfilled out a complaint\u201d and told plaintiff that she should \u201cpress charges\u201d against C. Plaintiff and her mother thereafter went to the police station and filed charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Bock also sent plaintiff to see her social worker \u201cto get more information about it.\u201d Plaintiff informed the social worker, Lisa Nussbaum, about the situation. Plaintiff had not previously told Nussbaum about C.\u2019s harassment because she had spoken to Bock about it and Bock said that \u201cit was going to be taken care of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Plaintiff graduated from Collier High in June 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Bock recalled that plaintiff first complained to him about C. in November or December 1993, at the beginning of her senior year. The complaints focused on his \u201cbothering her\u201d and \u201ccalling her names.\u201d Bock did not consider the reports of C.\u2019s action to constitute sexual harassment until May 1994 when plaintiff told him that C. \u201ctouched her breast.\u201d While plaintiff previously complained that C. was bothering her, she made no prior complaints that C.\u2019s behavior was sexual in nature. Bock nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>met with C. following his meetings with plaintiff, and she was given the option of attending. C. told him that plaintiff was the-aggressor, who hit him and called him a \u201cnig <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, C. promised Bock that he would leave plaintiff alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Bock talked to the bus driver about plaintiffs complaints. According to the bus driver, plaintiff was the instigator who approached C. Sometimes they appeared to argue; sometimes they appeared friendly. Bock did not call plaintiffs parents because he did not believe there was a \u201creason\u201d to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Bock described C. as \u201cdistractible\u201d and said that he was \u201cwritten up quite a bit\u201d \u201cfor mischievous kind of behavior.\u201d School records documented that C. \u201ctouches the girls too much, ... much more than they want him to touch them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Joseph Sabba, the bus driver, testified that, while he saw plaintiff approach C. and hit or slap him, he never saw C. get up from his seat and approach plaintiff. Sabba considered it \u201cordinary teenage horseplay.\u201d Sabba also stated, however, that he may not have heard what C. said prior to what he observed plaintiff do. He could not always see what was going on in the back of the bus while he was driving. .</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Bock wrote a \u201char[ ]assment report\u201d after the May 1994 meeting with plaintiff and her mother. Thereafter, the Board\u2019s administrative assistant and affirmative action officer, Myra Bugbee, conducted an investigation. In her June 9, 1994 report, Ms. Bugbee noted that plaintiff and C. \u201chave a relationship that swings from friendship to one that is also adversarial in nature\u201d and concluded that \u201cneither party is clearly at fault nor innocent in this situation.\u201d She made certain recommendations, but by then plaintiff was about to graduate.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The motion for leave to file a late notice under the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-8, was dated August 22, 1995. A transcript of the argument on the motion reveals it was served on the Township Clerk and Board of Education on August 24, 1995.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff had turned eighteen on September 7,1994, and the application stated: The delay in filing the late <em>Notice of </em>Tort Claim is excusable in that the defendants assured [S.P.] that they could handle the matter internally within the school system. Based upon the defendants\u2019 representations that they would handle the matter and also [S.PJ\u2019s own youth and ignorance, a Notice of Tort Claim was not filed within a 90-day time period following TS-P-l\u2019s 18th birthday. However, [S.P.] has always diligently pursued her rights and must be allowed to file a late Notice of Tort Claim against the defendants who refused and failed to protect her while she was a student under their custody and care.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Plaintiff also asserted that the Township and Board would suffer no prejudice because of the Board\u2019s investigation into her complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The motion judge denied the application, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">I have to deal with what I\u2019ve been noticed on and basically you don\u2019t give me any reason to grant this notice of late claim at this stage other than the fact she reached the age eighteen, she reached age eighteen last September and that she graduated from school in June and that she didn\u2019t come to you until she received a subpoena for the criminal case. And not knowing that she might have a claim against the town or not being aware of the need to file a late notice of claim is not a sufficient reason. You have to give me more. So I think I, under the statute my hands are tied. I have to deny your motion. I\u2019ll deny it without prejudice so that if you wish to refile the motion with specific reasons that fit the statute which would show extraordinary circumstances, obviously I would consider that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Plaintiff never reffled the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">The Tort Claims Act prohibits a suit against a public entity unless the entity is given notice of the claim \u201cnot later than the ninetieth day after accrual of the cause of action.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-8; <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-1 (defining \u201caccrual\u201d); <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:8-3; <em>Rost v. Fair Lawn Bd. of Educ., supra; Vedutis v. Tesi, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 340-41, 343 A.2d 171, regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>rights of minors. \u201cThe purpose of the 90 day limit is to \u2018compel a claimant to expose his intention and information early in the process in order to permit the public entity to undertake an investigation while witnesses are available and the facts are fresh.\u2019\u201d <em>O\u2019Neill v. City of Newark, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>543, 549, 701 A.2d 717 (App.Div.1997) (quoting <em>Lutz v. Township of Gloucester, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 466, 380 A.2d 280 (App.Div.1977)); <em>see also, e.g., Wood v. County of Burlington, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>371, 375-76, 695 A.2d 377 (App.Div.1997). Failure to satisfy the ninety-day requirement constitutes a bar to recovery against the public entity unless the claimant is a minor or incompetent at the time the cause of action accrues in which case the matter is tolled. Here, the matter was tolled until plaintiffs eighteenth birthday on September 7, 1994. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>59:8-8; <em>Rost v. Fair Lawn Bd. of Educ., supra; Vedutis v. Tesy supra; </em>Margolis and Novack, <em>Claims Against Public Entities </em>(Gann 1998), Comment to <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:8-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>59:8-9 grants the court discretion to permit a claimant, who failed to file a timely notice, leave to do so \u201cat any time within one year after the accrual of his claim provided that the public entity or the public employee has not been substantially prejudiced thereby.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-9; <em>Lamb v. Global Landfill Reclaiming, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>134, 146, 543 A.2d 443 (1988) (trial court\u2019s decision on motion for leave to file a late notice of claim \u201cwill be sustained on appeal in the absence of a showing of an abuse [of discretion]\u201d); <em>O\u2019Neill, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 550, 701 A.2d 717. The statute sets forth the requirements of an application for leave to file a late notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">Application to the court for permission to file a late notice of claim shall be made upon motion supported by affidavits based upon personal knowledge of the affiant showing sufficient reasons constituting <em>extraordinary circumstances </em>for his failure to file notice of claim within the period of time prescribed by section 59:8-8 of this act or to file a motion seeking leave to file a late notice of claim within a reasonable time thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>59:8-9 (emphasis added).]<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Plaintiff clearly failed to <em>meet </em>the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-9. She submitted no affidavit based upon personal knowledge that showed \u201csufficient reasons constituting extraordinary circumstances for [her] failure to file notice of claim within\u201d ninety days of her eighteenth birthday. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-9. She submitted only an affidavit of counsel, and the affidavit included no facts constituting \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d for plaintiffs failure to comply with the notice requirement. According to the affidavit, plaintiffs failure to file a notice within ninety days of her eighteenth birthday was due to defendants\u2019 assurances to plaintiff that \u201cthey could handle the matter internally within the school system,\u201d plaintiffs \u201cyouth,\u201d and plaintiffs \u201cignorance.\u201d Indeed, it appears that plaintiff did not even consider instituting an action against defendants until after she sought counsel in June 1995 as the result of having been subpoenaed in the criminal investigation arising out of the charges she filed against C.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-9 does not define \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d and \u201c[w]hether such circumstances exist must therefore be determined by the courts on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Epstein v. State, </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 359, 709 A.2d 1353 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>589, 715 A.2d 992 (1998). And, as we recently observed in comparing a dismissal without prejudice when not obtaining an affidavit of merit in a malpractice action with the need for a showing of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to permit a late notice under the Tort Claims Act, \u201cignorance of the law or failure to seek legal advice will not excuse failure to meet the filing deadline\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-8. <em>Hyman Zamft and Manard v. Cornell, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>586, 593, 707 A.2d 1068 (App.Div.1998). Stated differently, ignorance of the ninety-day notice period \u201cwithout more, does not constitute sufficient reason for [the] delay.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neill, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 552, 701 A.2d 717. <em>Cf. Blank v.

In fact, nothing in the record expressly addresses the ninety-day period following plaintiffs eighteenth birthday. Moreover <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:8-8 tolls an action until an infant becomes eighteen. Contrary to plaintiffs counsel\u2019s suggestion, she is not entitled to more time merely because of her young age and inexperience. Moreover, under her version, plaintiff was aware of the facts giving rise to her claim since well before her eighteenth birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the denial of the late filing of plaintiffs claim under Tort Claims Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Plaintiff contends that the Law Division erroneously granted summary judgment to Collier High and Bock because they did not owe her a duty of care with respect to events that took place on the bus over which Collier High and Bock had no control. Plaintiff argues, however, that her cause of action against the school and its principal is not limited to events that took place on the bus. Her claim also encompasses acts that took place at school when she reported C.\u2019s behavior to Bock who, she claims, thereafter did nothing to protect her.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">To the extent a legal issue is involved, the trial court\u2019s opinion is \u201cnot entitled to any special deference,\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Township Committee of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).

Caruso, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>171, 177, 711 A.2d 398 (App.Div.1998); <em>Connolly v. Burger King Corp., </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 348, 703 A.2d 941 (App.Div.1997). It is true, as defendants argue, that <em>Jackson v. Hankinson, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>505, 229 A.2d 267 (App.Div.1967), <em>aff'd, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>230, 235, 238 A.2d 685 (1968), held that a board of education which provides transportation to its students must take reasonable precautions for their safety and well-being while they are on the bus. However, the opinion does not preclude the imposition of a concomitant duty upon a high school and its principal, who have knowledge of potentially criminal or otherwise wrongful conduct taking place on the bus while en route to or from the school, to take steps to prevent injury to their students while on the bus. <em>See Jackson, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 511-13, 229 A.2d 267; <em>see also Home State Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>584, 713 A.2d 557 (App.Div.1998). This is particularly so in this ease since Bock had assumed responsibility for resolving plaintiffs complaints at the time they were made. <em>See Titus v. Lindberg, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>66, 74, 228 A.2d 65 (1967). Because C. was enrolled in Collier High, defendants \u201chad sufficient control, opportunity, and ability to have avoided the risk of harm,\u201d <em>J.S., supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 339, 714 A.2d 924, at least by informing the Board of what plaintiff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>alleged. Thus, here \u201c[t]he nature of the parties\u2019 interests\u201d reflects \u201cthe need to recognize a duty of care\u201d on the part of Collier High and Bock, <em>id. </em>at 343, 714 A.2d 924, and \u201c[p]ublic policy considerations based in large measure on the comparative interests of the parties support overwhelmingly the recognition of a duty of care in these circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346-47, 714 A.2d 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Plaintiff contends that the Law Division also committed reversible error when it ruled that charitable immunity precluded her action against Collier High and Bock. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7. She argues that \u201cBock is not entitled to charitable immunity in that he is an individual.\u201d With respect to Collier High, a non-profit corporation or entity organization for education purposes, plaintiff contends that, because charitable immunity precludes only negligence actions, and does not \u201cextend to actions brought for fraud, intentional conduct, recklessness, gross negligence or willful or wanton conduct,\u201d <em>see Seiderman v. American Inst. for Mental Studies, </em>667 <em>F.Supp. </em>154 (D.N.J.1987), her complaint was wrongly dismissed. According to plaintiff, her complaint alleges fraud, misrepresentations, recklessness and gross negligence, but we agree with the motion judge that there were \u201cno proofs of willful or wanton conduct or gross negligence\u201d by Bock on the record produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Plaintiff also claims that because C.\u2019s conduct involved \u201csexual abuse,\u201d the immunity afforded by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7 does not apply. While we must accept plaintiffs allegations as true, the critical conduct addressed by the complaint as the basis for liability of these defendants is Bock\u2019s negligence, not C\u2019s sexual harassment. Moreover, the 1995 amendments to N.J.S.A 2A:53A-7 granting employees and agents immunity, but excepting from that immunity liability for \u201ca willful, wanton or grossly negligent act of commission or omission, including sexual assault and other crimes of a sexual nature,\u201d suggest the immunity for the charitable or non-profit organization itself is not lost. We, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>fore, agree with the motion judge that the charitable immunity doctrine applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">However, this cause of action accrued before July 24, 1995, and as of then employees of charitable institutions were not immune from suit. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:53A-7.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the motion judge erroneously dismissed the action against Bock. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In light of our reversal of the dismissal of the complaint against Bock, we must address Bock\u2019s protective cross-appeal from the order dismissing his third party complaint. Because of the reversal of summary judgment in his favor, we reverse the dismissal of his third party complaint, and in doing so, we have to consider an issue not specifically addressed by the parties, \u2014 the impact of the Tort Claims Act notice requirement on a third party complaint against a public entity. <em>Cf. Kimmel v. Dayrit, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>337, 712 A.2d 1129 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In <em>Markey v. Skog, </em>129 <em>N.J.Super. </em>192, 196-97, 322 A.2d 513 (Law Div.1974), an automobile negligence case, the defendant filed a third-party complaint seeking contribution from the State. The plaintiff neither made a direct claim against the State nor sought leave to amend the complaint to assert a direct claim against it. <em>Id. </em>at 197, 322 A.2d 513. The State\u2019s first notice of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>dant\u2019s third-party claim was the third-party complaint, which was \u201cserved upon [the State] some 11 months after the event.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>By way of affirmative defense, the State asserted that the defendant\u2019s contribution claim was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. <em>Ibid. </em>The State conceded that tort claims could be asserted against it but only if \u201csuch claims [were] processed, presented and proceeded upon in accordance with the strict procedural requirements of the [Tort Claims] act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197-98, 322 A.2d 513. According to the State, \u201cif a plaintiff fail[ed] to perfect his claim against the State by having failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the act, the State [was] not only not liable to the plaintiff but [was] also relieved of liability in respect of all consequences of its alleged negligence, including liability to a joint tortfeasor for contribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 322 A.2d 513. The State also argued that \u201cif the primary claim is barred by the primary claimant\u2019s inaction during the 90-day period, the State is no longer liable to the primary claimant and, therefore, cannot be liable to any derivative claimant, including a joint tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Judge Pressler, then a County Court judge temporarily assigned to the Law Division, rejected the State\u2019s position as misconceiving the \u201chistory, purpose and construction\u201d of both the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law (Contribution Law), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-1 <em>et seq., </em>and the Tort Claims Act. <em>Id. </em>at 199, 322 A.2d 513. She concluded that a plaintiffs failure to file timely notice was not a bar to a defendant\u2019s claim for contribution from a public entity and held that the defendant had the right to seek contribution from the State under the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law. <em>Id. </em>at 205, 322 A.2d 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Judge Pressler first observed that the purpose of the Contribution Law was \u201cto alleviate the evident harshness and inequity of the common-law rule ... pursuant to which there was no right of joint tortfeasors to seek allocation among themselves of the burden of their fault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 322 A.2d 513. She next observed that \u201ca defendant\u2019s right to contribution ... is ... an inchoate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>right which does not ripen into a cause of action until he has paid more than his pro rata portion of the judgment obtained against him by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 322 A.2d 513. Thus, \u201c[i]t is at that point that his cause of action for contribution <em>accrues.\u201d Ibid. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The <em>Markey </em>opinion further observed that a defendant\u2019s right to file a third-party complaint seeking contribution from a joint tortfeasor before the plaintiff had obtained a judgment was merely a device of \u201cprocedural convenience afforded by the rules of practice.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Though a defendant was not required to proceed against joint tortfeasors in the same action at the time <em>Markey </em>was written, Judge Pressler noted that a defendant would ordinarily seek contribution in the same case because to do so was \u201cthe most orderly and logical manner.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In addition, she pointed out that \u201ccommon liability at the time of the accrual of plaintiffs cause of action ... is the <em>sine qua non </em>of defendant\u2019s contribution right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 322 A.2d 513. Thus, if common liability existed at the time the plaintiffs cause of action accrued, the \u201cdefendant [could not] be deprived of his inchoate right by reason of plaintiffs loss thereafter of his own right of direct action against the joint tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200-01, 322 A.2d 513. Judge Pressler concluded: \u201cAny other rule would not only be contrary to the conceptual basis of ,the cause of action for contribution but would also be contrary to the policy of the contribution statute, which seeks to prevent plaintiffs, by their unilateral actions, from electing where to place the burden of a common fault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 322 A.2d 513. Moreover, though the Tort Claims Act was \u201csilent with respect to any time limitations or other bar to the assertion of a contribution claim against the State,\u201d Judge Pressler believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that the Act clearly contemplated that the State could be liable as a joint tortfeasor given the monetary limitations imposed upon the State\u2019s contribution obligation. <em>Id. </em>at 202, 322 A.2d 513.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\"><em>Markey </em>therefore rejected the State\u2019s argument that it had no liability \u201cbecause of [defendants\u2019] failure to have filed a 90-day notice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 204, 322 A.2d 513, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">Common liability for contribution purposes is, as noted, determinable as of the date of the accrual of plaintiffs claim. That a plaintiff is barred from pursuing his cause of action after 90 days \u2014 and \u2018barred\u2019 is the word used by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-8 \u2014 does not mean he did not have the right to do so at the time his cause of action accrued. The subsequent loss of the remedy, therefore, as in the statute of limitations case, does not operate retroactively, for contribution purposes, to wipe out the right of action which existed before the bar to the remedy was raised by plaintiffs inaction. <em>That is to say, the 90-day notice is not a condition precedent to the existence of liability on the part of the State. </em>It is a condition only upon a <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>right thereafter to pursue his remedy against the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Finally, Judge Pressler noted that her conclusion was similar to eases from \u201cthe majority of jurisdictions which have considered this question in the context of governmental tort claims acts substantially similar to ours.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 322 A.2d 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Two Law Division decisions by another judge, decided subsequent to <em>Markey, </em>held that a defendant could not file a third-party contribution or indemnification action against a public entity because the plaintiff failed to present a claim against the public entity within the time prescribed by the Act and did not bring a direct action. <em>Kingan v. Hurston, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>383, 354 A.2d 109 (Law Div.1976); <em>Cancel v. Watson, </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 329 A.2d 596 (Law Div.1974). However, in <em>D\u2019Annunzio v. Wildwood Crest, </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>85, 91-92, 410 A.2d 1180 (App.Div.1980), we suggested that we would follow <em>Markey </em>and <em>Dambro v.

We held that it did not, <em>id. </em>at 92, 410 A.2d 1180, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">Although [the <em>Markey </em>] issue has not been raised on this appeal, the result we reach is consistent with <em>Markey v.
