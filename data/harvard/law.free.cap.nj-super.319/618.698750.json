Lark lost his motion to suppress the evidence of his crime, reserved his right to appeal on that issue, and pleaded guilty to first degree possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-5(a)(l) and 5(b)(1). In accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>with the terms of the negotiated plea, defendant received a twelve-year sentence of imprisonment, four years to be served without parole. The appropriate statutory penalties were imposed. The only issues raised on appeal are the propriety of the order denying the motion to suppress and the length of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We hold that the investigating police officer violated defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution when, following a motor vehicle stop for a minor traffic violation, he opened the door of defendant\u2019s vehicle to search for proof of defendant\u2019s identity without probable cause to believe that contraband or instrumentalities of a crime were within or that some criminal activity was afoot. Because we have decided to reverse the order denying defendant\u2019s suppression motion, the sentencing issue is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The facts leading to the search and subsequent arrest of defendant are undisputed. On May 22, 1996, at about 12:38 p.m., Berkeley Heights Police Officer Michael Gallaro was on motor patrol when he saw an Acura Legend automobile driving without a front license plate. A computer cheek indicated the vehicle\u2019s registration was valid and that it had not been reported as stolen. Nonetheless, Officer Gallaro stopped the vehicle because of the missing license plate. The driver was defendant Brent D. Lark. Seated beside him was the co-defendant Jason Lewis, who promptly handed the officer a valid registration, insurance card, and his own driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Defendant told the officer that he had a license to drive, but it was not on him. At Officer Gallaro\u2019s request, defendant wrote down on a note pad his name, address, and date of birth, as that information appeared on the supposed license. Officer Gallaro twice checked the validity of the information defendant had given him using his mobile computer and had his headquarters check a third time with its computer. There was no record of a license issued in the name defendant had provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Having received what appeared to be false information from defendant, Officer Gallaro became concerned for his safety and called for additional officers. Shortly thereafter, two officers arrived. During further questioning, defendant told Officer Gallaro he could not produce his license because he had been mugged the week before and his wallet containing his license had been stolen. Suspecting defendant had lied to him, Officer Gallaro ordered defendant out of the vehicle and searched him for his license or some form of identification. When none was found, Officer Gallaro \u201cplaced him with [his] back-up officers.\u201d One of the officers then ordered the passenger to exit the vehicle, so the police could search it for some papers that might identify defendant. Officer Gallaro testified he needed defendant\u2019s identification in order to write him a summons and also to determine whether his license had been suspended. He stated that on many occasions he had been able to locate a driver\u2019s license inside a car even when the driver claimed that he had no identification. He acknowledged, however, that he could have detained or arrested defendant instead of searching the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The passenger exited the vehicle and was patted down by one of the back-up officers. While defendant and the passenger were detained by the other officers, Officer Gallaro opened the driver\u2019s side door to search for defendant\u2019s wallet or identifying papers. Upon opening the door, Officer Gallaro saw a bag containing drug paraphernalia wedged behind the driver\u2019s seat, which he seized. Defendant and the passenger were placed under arrest and seated in separate patrol cars. Officer Gallaro then returned to the vehicle and continued to search the passenger compartment. That search produced six plastic bags containing approximately ten ounces of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In a written decision, the Law Division upheld the search. The court determined \u201cit was reasonable for the officer to search the vehicle for a clue to defendant\u2019s identity \u2014 whether that be a license, an envelope or some labeled possession, because he had a well-founded suspicion that the defendant was \u2018hiding something\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>because he had given a false name.\u201d Although the court conceded that it could not \u201cequate this suspicion with probable cause to believe a crime had been committed and that evidence of the crime or contraband would be found in the vehicle,\u201d it was satisfied the officer\u2019s belief that proof of identity might well be found within the car was reasonable, justifying at least a limited search of the passenger compartment for such proof. The court thus concluded that the \u201cFourth Amendment is not violated by such reasonable police investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that his constitutional rights have been violated because there was no probable cause for the search or a valid exception to the probable cause requirement permitting the search and, therefore, the evidence should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The State counters that the search was valid. It argues that because every operator of a motor vehicle is statutorily required to have a driver\u2019s license in his possession and to present the license to a police officer upon request, the officer may conduct a limited search of the passenger compartment of the vehicle for the operator\u2019s license or proof of his identity if the operator is unable or unwilling to present his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">In so arguing, the State relies on the <em>dictum </em>in <em>State v. Boykins, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>73, 232 A.2d 141 (1967), which says a \u201ctraffic violation ... will justify a search for things related to it,\u201d such as a search for registration if the operator is unable to produce proof of ownership. <em>Id. </em>at 77, 232 A.2d 141. Based on this premise and the fact that defendant lied about his identity, the State maintains the officer was justified in believing that defendant was an unlicensed or suspended driver and that <em>Boykins </em>allowed him to conduct a limited search of the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment for proof of defendant\u2019s identity. Implicit in the State\u2019s argument is that <em>Boykins </em>established an exception to the probable cause requirement to allow a limited search of a vehicle\u2019s interior for driving credentials whenever a driver\u2019s identity is in question. The State asserts that because of the lesser expectation of privacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>in the interior of a motor vehicle, and the fact that the police could have detained defendant or even arrested him for failing to present his license, the officer\u2019s slight intrusion into the vehicle to look for proof of defendant\u2019s identity was objectively reasonable. The State also relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Wilcox, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 435 A.2d 569 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>491, 443 A.2d 706 (1981), where a search for identification was upheld on less than probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">We reject the State\u2019s arguments and reverse. Although there is a lessened expectation of privacy attendant to the interior of an automobile, and although the intrusion here seems minimal, in the absence of one of the recognized exceptions to the constitutional requirement of probable cause and a warrant, the evidence seized must be suppressed. <em>State v. Patino, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7, 414 A.2d 1327 (1980); <em>State v. Woodson, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>537, 539, 566 A.2d 550 (App.Div.1989); <em>see also State v. Hill, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>169, 173, 557 A.2d 322 (1989) (\u201cAny warrantless search is <em>prima facie </em>invalid, and the invalidity may be overcome only if the search falls within one of the specific exceptions created by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to the warrant requirement applies in this case. <em>See State v. Pierce, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>184, 204, 642 A.2d 947 (1994). That notwithstanding, the police must still have probable cause to justify a search of the interior of a motor vehicle. <em>See State v. Young, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>132, 143, 432 A.2d 874 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Notably, none of the frequently recognized exceptions to the probable cause requirement would allow the search here. For example, there is nothing in the record to suggest that this was a \u201cprotective search\u201d for weapons allowing the officer to open the car door out of concern for his safety, or that there was even cause for such concern. <em>See Michigan v. Long, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>1032, 1049, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>3469, 3481, 77 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>1201, 1220 (1983); <em>Pierce, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 205, 642 A.2d 947; <em>see also Woodson, supra, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 539, 566 A.2d 550. In addition, defendant had already left the vehicle and was detained by the back-up officers when Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Gallaro returned to search for proof of his identity. Hence, the passenger compartment was no longer accessible to him. <em>See Pierce, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 214-15, 642 A.2d 947 (citing <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>752, 762-63, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>2034, 2040, 23 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 685, 694 (1969)) (recognizing as constitutionally permissible a contemporaneous search of a vehicle incident to arrest when the vehicle is in arrestee\u2019s immediate control).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Moreover, the State does not suggest that the officer observed the bag of vials in \u201cplain view\u201d when defendant first exited the vehicle. <em>See State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 235-39, 463 A.2d 320 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, 79 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 695 (1984) . Nor do they contend that permission had been requested or given to enter the vehicle. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>349, 353-54, 346 A.2d 66 (1975). Certainly, the State does not argue, for it cannot, that there was any reasonable basis to believe that the vehicle contained contraband or evidence of a crime. <em>See State v. Zutic, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>103, 109, 713 A.2d 1043 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">As previously noted, to support its argument that Officer Gallaro\u2019s search for proof of defendant\u2019s identity did not offend the Fourth Amendment, the State relies on the <em>dictum </em>in <em>State v. Boykins, supra. </em>That <em>dictum </em>appears to approve of registration searches without probable cause. We view the <em>Boykins dictum </em>as somewhat problematic support for an identification search. Since <em>Boykins, </em>no Supreme Court has allowed a search based solely on a driver\u2019s inability to present driving credentials. In every ease we examined, the facts supported probable cause to search or arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Notably, the search in <em>Boykins </em>itself was based on probable cause. <em>See Boykins, supra, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>at 77-78, 232 A.2d 141. In any event, because this case does not involve a registration search, we need not determine the full import of the <em>Boykins dictum </em>here.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In this case, the passenger produced a valid registration for the vehicle. Hence, the officer could not reasonably conclude that the Acura was stolen. Although defendant lied about his identity, claiming he could not produce his license because he had been mugged and his wallet containing his license had been stolen, that fabrication may have suggested to the officer that defendant did not have a license, or even that his license had been suspended, but it did not establish probable cause to believe there was \u201ccriminal activity afoot.\u201d <em>See Hill, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 174, 557 A.2d 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Nor did the missing driver\u2019s license constitute further proof of the offense committed. The offense of driving without a license is complete upon the driver\u2019s inability to present his license to the police upon request. <em>See State v. Scheer, </em>99 <em>Or.App. </em>80, 781 P.2d 859 (1989) (holding invalid a search of suspect for identification to uncover further evidence of the offense of failing to present a driver\u2019s license); <em>cf. Knowles v. Iowa, </em>525 U.S.-,-, 119 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>S.Ct. </em>484, 488, 142 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 492, 499 (1998) (observing that no further evidence of speeding could be found in the passenger compartment of the stopped vehicle and therefore search of vehicle incident to traffic citation was invalid). Consequently, since defendant\u2019s identity was unnecessary to prove the motor vehicle offense committed here, the officer could not justify entering the vehicle to look for defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license or other proof of identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Of course we recognize that Officer Gallaro needed to know defendant\u2019s true identity in order to issue him a summons, and he may even have had reason to believe he could find proof of defendant\u2019s identity inside the vehicle, but neither the Fourth Amendment nor our state constitution permits the warrantless entry of a vehicle to search for identification without probable cause. Moreover, as the State itself acknowledges, the officer was not left without legal alternatives for ascertaining his identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">New Jersey law prescribes exactly what an officer should do when, during a traffic stop, a driver fails to present his license and then lies about his identity. The officer may either detain the driver for further questioning until he satisfies himself as to the driver\u2019s true identity, <em>see State v. Dickey, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>468, 476-78, 706 A.2d 180 (1998), or arrest the driver for operating a vehicle without a license, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-29, 39:5-25; <em>see also State v. Campbell, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>230, 237, 250 A.2d 1 (1969).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The officer may not, however, absent probable cause to believe that a further offense has been committed, enter the vehicle to look for identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The most that can be said is that the officer here had a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that defendant\u2019s license had been suspend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>ed. But a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d is not \u201cprobable cause,\u201d and therefore the entry was constitutionally impermissible. <em>See State v. Scanlon, </em>84 <em>N.J.Super. </em>427, 436, 202 A.2d 448 (App.Div.1964) (holding that where the passenger produced his license and the registration for the vehicle, the driver\u2019s failure to produce his license was insufficient to support probable cause to search the vehicle); <em>cf. State v. Holmgren, </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>212, 215, 659 A.2d 939 (App.Div.1995) (\u201cAlthough the inability of a driver to produce driving credentials raises a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle was stolen, it does not constitute probable cause to believe that the vehicle was stolen.\u201d) Because there was no probable cause to search the vehicle here, the search was invalid under the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Similarly, the State\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Wilcox, supra, </em>is unavailing. There, a search warrant had been issued to search the person, vehicle, and business of Daniel Roberson based on information that he was involved in the sale of narcotics. 180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 454, 435 A.2d 569. Shortly before the police executed the warrant, the defendant, James Wilcox, arrived as a passenger in Roberson\u2019s vehicle. Roberson entered his business, a barbershop, while Wilcox entered a sandwich shop next door. Upon execution of the warrant, packets of heroin and cocaine were found on Roberson\u2019s person. Meanwhile, the police saw Wilcox standing by the door to the barbershop. <em>Ibid. </em>When an officer approached him and asked for identification, Wilcox appeared' nervous and gave a false name. The officer saw what appeared to be the bulge of a wallet in Wilcox\u2019s pocket and asked him if he had any identification in his wallet. <em>Id. </em>at 454-55, 435 A.2d 569. Wilcox removed the wallet, and as he thumbed through it, the officer recognized the driver\u2019s license of a man who he knew was incarcerated. <em>Id. </em>at 455 &amp; n.l, 435 A.2d 569. The officer then searched Wilcox and discovered eighteen packets of heroin. <em>Id. </em>at 455, 435 A.2d 569. Despite recognizing that \u201c[n]o United States Supreme Court opinion [was] squarely in point,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>the <em>Wilcox </em>court held that the officer\u2019s \u201csearch of [Wilcox]\u2019s person was not an unreasonable intrusion in view of the evident need to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>[the] defendant\u2019s identity in the investigation of a suspected crime or crimes,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 457, 435 A.2d 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">To the extent <em>Wilcox </em>appears to recognize an exception to the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment to search for identification, we decline to follow its holding. In any event, <em>Wilcox </em>is clearly distinguishable on its facts. In that case, the defendant had just arrived with a person who possessed a quantity of heroin and cocaine; he was nervous, he was evasive, and more than lying about his identity, he actually possessed a wallet containing another person\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Although those factors might not amount to probable cause to search or arrest, they are certainly more suspicious than the facts here, where defendant only lied about his identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In <em>State v. Pierce, supra, </em>our Supreme Court criticized \u201cjudicially-created exceptions\u201d to the probable cause requirement, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">Because probable cause \u201cis the constitutionally-imposed standard for determining whether a search and seizure is lawful\u201d and \u201coccupies a position of indisputable significance in search and seizure law,\u201d vehicle searches sustainable under the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d and based on probable cause stand on firmer ground than those that depend for their validity on a judicially-created exception to the warrant requirement, such as the <em>Belton </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rule, which requires no proof of probable cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">[136 <em>N.J. </em>at 214, 642 A.2d 947 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">The <em>Pierce </em>Court held the search of the passenger compartment of a vehicle incident to the arrest of the driver for a motor vehicle offense violated the state constitution because the passenger compartment was not within the driver\u2019s immediate control upon arrest. <em>See </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 208-10, 642 A.2d 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">Recently, in <em>Knowles v. Iowa, </em>525 <em>U.S. </em>-, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>484, 142 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 492 (1998), the Supreme Court of the United States refused to condone a motor vehicle search incident to a traffic citation even though such a search might have been permissible had the investigating officer decided to arrest the driver for the offense. The Court held that an Iowa statute permitting a \u201csearch incident to citation\u201d violates the Fourth Amendment. 525 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>U.S. </em>at-, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 488, 142 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 499. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist rejected Iowa\u2019s argument that an exception to the probable cause requirement is appropriate in such circumstances. <em>See </em>525 <em>U.S. </em>at---, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 487-88, 142 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 498-99. Noting the \u201ctwo historical rationales\u201d for searches incident to arrest, \u201c(1) the need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody, and (2) the need to preserve evidence for later use at trial,\u201d 525 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 487, 142 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 498, the Chief Justice refused to accept Iowa\u2019s contention that a \u201csearch incident to citation\u201d was constitutional because the suspect may attempt to destroy evidence related to his identity, such as a driver\u2019s license or a vehicle registration, or evidence of another as yet undetected crime. The Chief Justice observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">As for the destruction of evidence relating to identify, if a police officer is not satisfied with the identification furnished by the driver, this may be a basis for arresting him rather than merely issuing a citation. As for destroying evidence of other crimes, the possibility that an officer would stumble onto evidence wholly unrelated to the speeding offense seems remote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-11\">[525 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 119 <em>S.Ct </em>at 488, 142 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 499.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">A new judicially created exception to the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment for \u201cidentification searches\u201d cannot be reconciled with <em>Knowles </em>or <em>Pierce. </em>Where a driver has failed to produce his license and an investigating officer is merely trying to determine the driver\u2019s identity so he can issue a citation, no search of the passenger compartment can be justified. This is especially so where, as here, the unlicensed driver no longer has access to the vehicle\u2019s interior. <em>See Pierce, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 214-15, 642 A.2d 947; <em>see also People v. Fulton, </em>289 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>970, 225 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>210, 683 <em>N.E.2d </em>154 (1997)(holding that police officer was not authorized to enter defendant\u2019s car without permission and drive it away following arrest for driving without valid license, and therefore, seizure of cocaine found in car violated state and federal constitutions).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">Significantly, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire recently rejected the invitation to adopt an \u201cidentification search exception\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>under its state constitution in a similar circumstance. In <em>State v. Webber, </em>141 <em>N.H. </em>817, 694 A.2d 970 (1997), the court considered a New Hampshire State Trooper\u2019s search of a driver\u2019s wallet for identification following a valid stop for a traffic offense. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">[Although] denying an officer the ability to at least ascertain the identity of an individual \u201ccould have a perplexing effect on law enforcement efforts!,]\u201d [ulnder part I, article 19 of our constitution, ... the protection from unreasonable searches is not diminished by the desire, no matter how laudable, to aid law enforcement. In addition, the warrantless search in this case cannot be sanctioned as a necessary means to aid law enforcement; Trooper Holdsworth had lawful alternatives that he could have followed to ascertain the defendant\u2019s identity____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">The State has failed to persuade us that the need for Trooper Holdsworth to discover the defendant\u2019s identity justifies nibbling away at the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches. Because the search of the defendant\u2019s wallet was \u201cmanifestly exploratory in nature,\u201d it violated both the letter and the spirit of part I, article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 972-73 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">This rationale is sound and should be adopted in this state. Practical convenience in aid of law enforcement administration is laudable, but it is not an objectively reasonable basis to justify \u201cnibbling away\u201d at our constitutional rights. Indeed, other jurisdictions agree that a search of a motor vehicle for proof of identity when a driver cannot produce his license is an impermissible constitutional intrusion absent probable cause to believe a crime has been committed or evidence of a crime may be destroyed. <em>See State v. Green, </em>103 <em>N.C.App. </em>38, 404 S.E.2d 363 (1991) (holding search of glove compartment for identification violated Fourth Amendment); <em>see also State v. Smith, </em>82 <em>Or.App. </em>636, 729 P.2d 10 (1986) (holding that warrantless search of defendant\u2019s automobile for identification was not permissible incident to arrest under the Oregon state constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Accordingly, the order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-10\"> In those cases, the police had probable cause to believe that either the vehicle was stolen or other criminal activity was afoot. <em>See, e.g., State v. Young, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 132, 143-44, 432 A.2d 874 (1981) (the driver's failure to produce a registration, and the presence of a counterfeit driver's license and a marijuana cigarette in plain view justified search of the vehicle); <em>State v. Patino, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12, 414 A.2d 1327 (1980) (the officer's plain view observation of what appeared to be marijuana, plus the inability of the driver to present his driver's license, justified arrest of the occupants and a limited search of the interior compartment of the vehicle); <em>State v. Gray, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>563, 567-68, 285 A.2d 1 (1971) (the driver's failure to produce a registration, furtive movements, and other criminally suspi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>cious activity justified entry of the vehicle and search of driver's gloves); <em>State v. Hock, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>526, 533, 257 A.2d 699 (1969) (a missing registration plus the fact that the license plates on the car came from a different vehicle supported \"a well-grounded suspicion that the car was stolen[and] warranted arrest of its occupants\"), <em>certif. denied, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>930, 90 <em>S.Ct </em>2254, 26 <em>L.

Campbell, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>230, 237, 250 A.2d 1 (1969) (the driver's inability to produce a license or registration or suitable identification, together with his statement to \"the officer that he didn't know whose car it was and that he had borrowed it from some fellow in a garage,\u201d established a sufficient basis for believing the car was stolen and justified the driver's arrest); <em>see also State </em>v. <em>Branham, </em>191 <em>Ariz. </em>94, 952 P.2d 332, 334-35 (Ct.App.1997) (recognizing a driver's inability to produce a registration in itself may well be an entirely innocent event); <em>State v. Hayburn, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 393-94, 409 A.2d 802 (App.Div.1979) (observing \"[t]he cases [cited by <em>Boykins </em>and <em>Hock </em>] invariably have other elements to justify the search\"), <em>certif. denied, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>397, 420 A.2d 321 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\"> However, Officer Gallaro could not have arrested defendant for responding to his request for identification with a false name because such conduct is not a criminal offense in New Jersey. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>14, 23, 519 A.2d 322 (1987).
