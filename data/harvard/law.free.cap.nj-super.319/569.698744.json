Halm appeals from an order denying his motion for reconsideration of a decision which denied his application into the Somerset County Pre-Trial Intervention Program (\u201cPTI\u201d). Defendant\u2019s initial application to PTI was denied, because in addition to the third-degree crime that was the subject of his application he was also charged by separate indictment with crimes of the first-degree, second-degree, and one crime in the third-degree. After he was acquitted of the crimes of the first-degree and the one third-degree crime, and after the then-pending indictment counts charging crimes of the second degree were dismissed on the State\u2019s motion, defendant sought reconsideration of his PTI application solely as to a crime of the third degree as originally charged in the separate indictment. The motion judge considered defendant\u2019s motion as time-barred. <em>See R. </em>3:28(h). Defendant appeals from the decision denying his reconsideration motion. Our decision is guided by principles enunciated in <em>State v. Baynes, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>434, 690 A.2d 594 (1997); <em>State v. Wallace, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>576, 684 A.2d 1355 (1996); and <em>State v. Nwobu, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>236, 652 A.2d 1209 (1995). We conclude that, where pending first-degree and second-degree criminal charges preclude the consideration on the merits of a defendant\u2019s application to PTI, defendant is entitled upon favorable resolution of those charges to a consideration of his amenability to PTI on a separate criminal charge involving a crime of the third degree. We also conclude that defendant\u2019s third-degree criminal conviction does not constitute a <em>per se </em>bar to a reconsideration of his PTI application. We reverse and remand to the Law Division and direct that the Law Division refer defendant\u2019s PTI application to the PTI coordinator for consideration <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">On July 23,1994, J.S. reported to the Franklin Township Police Department that she had been sexually assaulted by defendant. J.S. indicated that defendant had used a rope, described as a white clothesline, to tie her to a bed and then forced her to engage in vaginal intercourse and fellatio. When she was untied she fled defendant\u2019s home leaving her peach-colored underpants and her driver\u2019s license in defendant\u2019s bedroom. Based upon J.S.\u2019s complaint, the police sought and obtained a search warrant authorizing a search of defendant\u2019s premises for those items as well as the white clothesline, and the mattress upon which the alleged sexual assaults were performed. The search warrant also authorized the police to obtain exemplars of defendant\u2019s hair, swabbings of his bodily fluid, and his blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">During the execution of the search warrant, defendant immediately gave the police J.S.\u2019s driver\u2019s license, pointed to the white clothesline on the floor of his bedroom, and readily admitted that J.S.\u2019s underwear could be found in a nightstand in his bedroom. When one of the investigating officers opened the nightstand drawer, he observed a pair of women\u2019s peach-colored underwear which was then photographed and then removed for placement in an evidence envelope. When the underwear was removed, in plain view, was a small amount of a white substance, which appeared to be cocaine, a metal object which appeared to be a utensil with a white residue on it, and an object(s) wrapped in cellophane. These items were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Defendant was thereafter indicted in two separate indictments. Indictment Number 94-08-0392-1 charged defendant with two counts of first-degree kidnapping, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C: 13 \u2014 1 (b)(1) and <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:13 \u2014 1(b)(2) (counts one and two); two counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a)(3) (counts three and four); two counts of second-degree sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(c) (counts five and six); and one count of third-degree terroristic threats, N.J.S.A 2C:12-3(b) (count seven). Indictment Number 94-10-0464-1 charged defendant with one count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of third-degree possession of a controlled dangerous substance, cocaine, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Following defendant\u2019s indictments, he applied for entry into the PTI program. Defendant received a written communication dated September 6, 1996, from the PTI office indicating that \u201cthe Guidelines for Operation of Pretrial Intervention provide that the Prosecutor consent to the filing of an application for enrollment in P.T.I. where a defendant ... :(3) is currently charged with a first or second degree offense.\u201d Affixed to this communication was the signature of the prosecutor indicating, \u201cI hereby [do] not consent to the filing of this defendant\u2019s application for P.T.I.\u201d The written communication advised defendant of his \u201cright to be heard\u201d as is required by <em>R. </em>3:28(c)(3). Defendant did not appeal the prosecutor\u2019s decision; thus, a formal order was not entered by the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">On February 1, 1996, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized during the search of his residence was denied. Thereafter, defendant was tried to a jury on all counts of both indictments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, the trial judge dismissed count seven of Indictment Number 94-08-0392-1 charging terroristic threats. On the remaining counts of the indictment, defendant was acquitted of both counts charging first-degree kidnapping (counts one and two), and both counts charging first-degree aggravated sexual assault (counts three and four). The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the two counts of the indictment charging second-degree sexual assault (counts five and six). Defendant was convicted of third-degree possession of cocaine as charged in Indictment Number 94-10-0464-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Defendant was subsequently retried twice on the two indictment counts charging second-degree sexual assault. In each trial the court declared a mistrial. Counts five and six of the first indictment were then dismissed on the State\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Prior to the date scheduled for sentencing for third-degree possession of cocaine, the only charge upon which defendant was convicted, defendant filed a motion seeking \u201creconsideration of the September 6, 1994 denial of his PTI application.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motion judge, who had presided at defendant\u2019s trial, denied defendant\u2019s motion. The judge concluded that defendant\u2019s motion was untimely as it was not filed within ten days after rejection,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>R. </em>3:28(h), and, alternatively, concluded that defendant had failed to demonstrate that the prosecutor\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s application was a patent or gross abuse of discretion or \u201cone of those rare cases in which judicial intervention is warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">On September 26, 1997, defendant was sentenced to probation for a period of two years with credit for ninety-eight days served in the Somerset County jail and subject to the additional condition that he submit to a drug and alcohol evaluation and treatment if required. Appropriate statutory penalties were imposed and defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">On appeal, defendant raises two points of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">THE DECISION TO REFUSE TO SUPPRESS THE EVIDENCE OF THE CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE FOUND IN DEFENDANT\u2019S DRAWER WAS REVERSIBLE ERROR IN THAT THE SEARCH OF THE DRAWER WAS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE SEARCH WARRANT (RAISED BELOW).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">THE DECISION TO DISALLOW DEFENDANTS ADMISSION INTO THE PRE-TRIAL INTERVENTION PROGRAM WAS REVERSIBLE ERROR (RAISED BELOW).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We have carefully reviewed the first point in light of the record of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the arguments of counsel, and the applicable law, and conclude that defendant\u2019s contention is clearly without merit and a written opinion on that point would have no precedential value. <em>See R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E). <em>See Texas v. Brown, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>730, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983); <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>443, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971); <em>State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 216, 463 A.2d 320 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, 79 L.Ed.2d 695 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">With respect to the PTI issue, we commence our analysis with an abridged discussion of <em>Baynes, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>434, 690 A.2d 594. There, defendant was observed purchasing .44 grams of heroin on a street in Long Branch within nine hundred feet of an elementary school. <em>Id. </em>at 439, 690 A.2d 594. \u201cBaynes was arrested and subsequently indicted by the Monmouth County Grand Jury for Possession of a Controlled Dangerous Substance (CDS), namely heroin, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-10a(l) and Possession of CDS Within 1,000 Feet of a School Zone, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(l).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thereafter, Baynes applied for PTI. \u201cThe Director of the PTI program <em>accepted Baynes\u2019s application for admission. </em>Further, the head of the narcotics team that arrested Baynes did not object to Baynes\u2019s diversion. The prosecutor, however, advised Baynes ... that his PTI application was rejected because of that prosecutor\u2019s acknowledged policy to deny PTI admission to defendants charged with \u2018school zone offenses,\u2019 including those involving possession of CDS for personal use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 690 A.2d 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">On appeal to the Law Division, the judge reversed the prosecutor\u2019s decision and remanded Baynes\u2019s application to the prosecutor for reconsideration. <em>Ibid. </em>On reconsideration, the prosecutor again denied Baynes\u2019s application. <em>Ibid. </em>Baynes again sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>reconsideration. The Law Division ordered Baynes\u2019s admission into PTI over the prosecutor\u2019s objection. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>State v. Baynes, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 671 A.2d 211 (Law Div.1995)). We affirmed <em>per curiam. State v. Baynes, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 671 A.2d 146 (App.Div.1996). The State\u2019s petition for certification was granted, and thereafter the Court affirmed. <em>Baynes, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>434, 690 A.2d 594. The Court\u2019s decision restated several principles: (1) A prosecutor\u2019s decision to reject a PTI applicant is regarded with \u201cenhanced deference\u201d or \u201cextra deference,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 443, 690 A.2d 594 (citing <em>Nwobu, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 246, 652 A.2d 1209); (2) \u201cAbsent evidence to the contrary, a reviewing court must assume that all relevant factors were considered by the prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 444, 690 A.2d 594 (citing <em>Nwobu, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 249, 652 A.2d 1209, and <em>State v. Dalglish, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>503, 509, 432 A.2d 74 (1981)); and (3) \u201cA reviewing court may order a defendant into PTI over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, only if the defendant can \u2018 \u201cclearly and convincingly establish that the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to sanction admission into the program was based on a patent and gross abuse of ... discretion.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>State v. Wallace, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 582, 684 A.2d 1355, and <em>State v. Bender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>84, 93, 402 A.2d 217 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Since defendant\u2019s appeal focuses only on the denial of his motion seeking reconsideration of the initial consideration of his PTI application, we need not consider the third <em>Baynes </em>principle, except to note that the motion judge erred in articulating his alternative reason for denying defendant\u2019s motion. Defendant was not seeking admission into the PTI program over a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to sanction admission to which the patent and gross abuse of discretion standard applies, <em>Wallace, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 582, 684 A.2d 1355, but was simply seeking an opportunity to present anew his original application for PTI with reference to an indictment charging a crime in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">This case does not involve a review of a prosecutor\u2019s decision which entailed a review of all pertinent factors alleged by a defendant demonstrating his amenability to PTI diversion. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>noted, had the prosecutor\u2019s decision encompassed a review of all pertinent factors, the prosecutor\u2019s decision would have been entitled to \u201cenhanced deference\u201d or \u201cextra deference.\u201d <em>Baynes, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 443, 690 A.2d 594 (citations omitted). Here, the record reflects that the PTI coordinator, and thereafter the prosecutor, denied defendant\u2019s application without considering any facts presented by defendant other than the pendency of the second separate indictment which charged crimes of the first, second, and third degree. That decision, both by the PTI coordinator and the prosecutor, may have been unassailable at the time it was made. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12(e); <em>R. </em>3:28 Guideline 3(i); <em>Wallace, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 585-86, 684 A.2d 1355; <em>Baynes, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 434, 690 A.2d 594. The consequent unlikelihood of judicial relief therefrom explains defendant\u2019s decision not to seek review on an appeal to the Law Division. Yet, we do note that in <em>Wallace, </em>our unreported decision remanded the rejection of defendant\u2019s PTI application to the prosecutor after defendant entered a negotiated plea to a crime of the third degree and after the State dismissed the indictment charges of a crime of the second degree and a different crime of the third degree. On appeal, the Court reversed and specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">The reality of this case is that the prosecutor weighed the relevant and material factors and reached a conclusion that defendant was not an appropriate candidate for PTI---- The problem is the Appellate Division failed to view the prosecutor\u2019s decision through the filter of the highly deferential standard of review. The court essentially evaluated the ease as if it stood in the shoes of the prosecutor, whereas it should have been focused on whether it amounted to an \u201carbitrary, irrational or otherwise an abuse of discretion\u201d for the prosecutor to have assigned as much weight to the gravity of the offense as she apparently did in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\"><em>[Wallace, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 589, 684 A.2d 1355 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Implicit in the Court\u2019s decision is that, even where a defendant is charged with crimes of the first or second degree (or both), the prosecutor is charged with the responsibility to \u201cweigh[] the relevant and material factors [in reaching] a conclusion that [a] defendant [is] not an appropriate candidate for PTI.\u201d <em>Ibid. Wallace </em>directs that upon review of a prosecutor\u2019s decision the reviewing court must \u201cfocus[] on whether [the prosecutor\u2019s decision] amounted to an \u2018arbitrary, irrational or otherwise an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>discretion\u2019 for the prosecutor to have assigned as much weight to the gravity of the offense as she apparently did in this case.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In <em>Baynes, </em>the Court, in reviewing the procedural history, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">On June 23,1995, a hearing was held before the trial court for reconsideration of the prosecutor\u2019s decision. In reversing the prosecutor\u2019s decision and referring the matter back to the prosecutor for reconsideration, the court observed that \u201cthe prosecutor [had] fail[ed] to consider all the relevant factors\u201d in this case. The decision to refer the matter back to the prosecutor follows our past decisions, <em>finding remand to the prosecutor useful where \u201c \u201cthe prosecutorial decision was based upon a consideration of inappropriate factors or not premised upon a consideration of all relevant factors\u2019 [or] where the denial resulted from an incorrect evaluation of relevant factors.\"</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">[148 <em>N.J. </em>at 440, 690 A.2d 594 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">We <em>conceive </em>it should have been clear to the motion judge that the initial decision by the PTI coordinator and the prosecutor, although probably appropriate when made, <em>see R. </em>3:28, Guideline 3(i), did not consider any other relevant factors. <em>Cf. State v. Kraft, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106, 625 A.2d 579 (App.Div.1993) ((suggesting the nature of the crime charged itself can be the basis to bar a defendant\u2019s application to PTI); see <em>also </em>Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 2 on <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-12 1998). The initial decision was premised solely upon the nature of some of the pending charges, crimes in the first and second degree. Defendant\u2019s amenability for PTI on the sole third-degree offense charged in the separate indictment was never considered on its own merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">The motion judge concluded that defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration was time-barred. <em>R. </em>3:28(h) establishes time constraints as to PTI applications which specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">Application for pretrial intervention shall be made at the earliest possible opportunity, including before indictment, but in any event no later than twenty-eight days after indictment. The criminal division manager shall complete the evaluation and make a recommendation within twenty-five days of the filing of the application. The prosecutor shall complete a review of the application and inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the court and defendant within fourteen days of the receipt of the criminal division manager\u2019s recommendation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">An appeal by the defendant shall bo made on motion to the Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division or to the judge to whom the case has been assigned within ten days after the rejection and shall be made returnable at the next status conference or at such time as the judge determines will promote expeditious disposition of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">Where application is made pre-indictment, the prosecutor may withhold action on the application until the matter has been presented to the grand jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Additionally, <em>R. </em>3:28(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">Denial of acceptance [into PTI] pursuant to this rule may be reviewed on appeal from a judgment of conviction notwithstanding that such judgment is entered following a plea of guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">It seems abundantly clear that, provided a defendant files a timely application for PTI as required by <em>R. </em>3:28(h), the denial of his or her application may be reviewed prior to trial, and may also be reviewed on direct appeal following conviction either after trial or the entry of a guilty plea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither <em>R. </em>3:28(g) nor (h) limits a defendant from seeking reconsideration of a decision denying a PTI application. Since defendant\u2019s conviction on Indictment Number 94-10-0464-1 would not have precluded defendant\u2019s appeal from the initial decision denying his application to PTI, we conclude the motion judge erred when he deemed defendant\u2019s post-conviction motion for reconsideration as time-barred. This is particularly so where, as here, it is clear that the decision of the PTI coordinator and the prosecutor was predicated solely on the nature of the original charges (first-and second-degree offenses) returned in the initial indictment and did not encompass any consideration of the other seventeen criteria enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-12(e). <em>See Wallace, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>576, 684 A.2d 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">We are particularly mindful that Indictment Number 94-10-0464-1 charged defendant with one count of third-degree possession of a controlled dangerous substance, cocaine, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(l). The criminal act occurred when defendant came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>into possession of the controlled dangerous substance, although its discovery was coincident -with an investigation of separate criminal acts involving the victim, J.S., alleged to have occurred on July 23, 1994. Had defendant not been charged under Indictment Number 94-08-0392-1, the third-degree offense charged in Indictment 94-10-0464-1 would have been considered within the parameters of all criteria enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-12(e). Defendant\u2019s motion sought a new referral by the Law Division to the prosecutor of defendant\u2019s PTI application to allow reconsideration by the prosecutor focusing solely upon Indictment Number 94-10-0464-1. Under the unusual factual circumstances of this case, we conclude that the motion judge\u2019s decision based solely upon time constraints, <em>R. </em>3:28(h), constituted an abuse of discretion as the judge is specifically permitted pursuant to this same rule to consider a defendant\u2019s appeal from prosecutor\u2019s decision \u201cat such time as the judge determines will promote an expeditious disposition of the case.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Reversed and remanded to the Law Division, which is directed to refer defendant\u2019s application to PTI to the PTI coordinator for reconsideration <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-10\"> The record on appeal does not reflect any pre-trial proceeding or pre-trial order consolidating the two indictments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-11\"> Since a judge in the Law Division never entered an order denying defendant's application for entry into PTI, defendant\u2019s motion should have denominated a motion to compel the prosecutor to reconsider defendant's initial application for entry into the PTI program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-12\"> In the judge's oral decision he incorrectly cited the ten-day time limitation as <em>R. </em>3:28-4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b609-12\"> A defendant may not seek leave to appeal pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:2-4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\"> Although defendant\u2019s brief on appeal asserts that defendant\u2019s initial PTI application demonstrated facts that he was particularly amenable to rehabilitation within the criteria delineated within <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12(e), our decision does not address the merits of defendant\u2019s contention. Defendant's application has not been provided as an exhibit with defendant\u2019s appendix to his brief. Had defendant\u2019s application to PTI been included as an exhibit we would not have considered same, as a review of the initial application is specifically entrusted first to the PTI coordinator and thereafter to the prosecutor. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
