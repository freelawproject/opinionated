Judge Mochary granted summary judgment against plaintiff Triffin, a commercial discounter and purchaser of dishonored instruments, in an action he brought as assignee of a negotiable instrument. <em>See Triffin v. Cigna Ins. Co., </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 687 A.2d 1045 (App.Div.1997); <em>Triffin v. Dillabough, </em>552 <em>Pa. </em>550, 716 A.2d 605 (1998). We affirm the decision in the Law Division which was based on the efficacy of a \u201crisk-shifting\u201d agreement between plaintiffs assignor and defendant\u2019s predecessor, First Fidelity Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">On October 6,1995 First Fidelity and American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. jointly issued a $929.15 Holiday Club check to Cheryl Gardner. Later in October 1995, Cheryl Gardner, or someone purporting to be her, cashed this Holiday Club cheek at D &amp; S Cheek Cashing (D &amp; S) in Newark, New Jersey. Plaintiff alleges that when D &amp; S cashed the check, it had no knowledge of any defenses or claims by any party to the check. At oral argument speculation arose that the check was lost or stolen and the payee Gardner\u2019s endorsement was forged before presentation at this inner-city check-cashing agency housed in a liquor store, but no one really knew the operative facts surrounding the negotiation or reason for stop-payment on the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Sometime after Gardner, or someone else, cashed the check at D &amp; S, payment was stopped on the check. The record is unclear why payment was stopped but again the parties speculated at argument that the check might have been reported to the bank as lost or stolen. There is no claim in this action that First Fidelity was at fault or acted in bad faith in connection with the stop payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Since March 7,1994 D &amp; S and First Fidelity had operated pursuant to a written Cash Management Services Agreement. The parties refer to the Agreement as an \u201cexculpatory\u201d clause or agreement. We prefer to characterize it as a \u201crisk-shifting\u201d agreement, at least in respect to this context and this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Paragraph four of the Agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">4. WARRANTY. <em>Although Bank [First Fidelity] shall provide the Services in accordance with the prevailing reasonable commercial standards of the banking industry, Bank shall not be responsible for any loss sustained by Customer [D &amp; S Check Cashing] unless and to the extent that such loss was caused by Bank\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct. </em>Except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Service Schedules, Bank makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, with respect to the Services or this Agreement or the Service Schedules. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION HEREOF, IN NO EVENT SHALL BANK BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT OR TORT, FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>WHETHER OR NOT THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES WAS KNOWN TO BANK IN ADVANCE, [emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Paragraph eleven states the Agreement is to be construed in accordance with and governed by New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">On April 10, 1997 plaintiff purchased by assignment D &amp; S\u2019s $929.15 claim on the instrument against First Union and then filed this suit. On November 7, 1997 after the motion judge denied plaintiffs initial summary judgment motion, the judge executed a consent order between plaintiff and defendant First Union in which the parties stipulated to certain material facts. The parties stipulated that D &amp; S assigned all its rights in the check to plaintiff as alleged in the complaint. The parties stipulated that D &amp; S had the legal status of a holder in due course of the check. The parties stipulated that D &amp; S had an agreement with First Union \u201cthat provided for the exculpation of all manner of liability by First Union to D &amp; S.\u201d The parties stipulated that First Fidelity issued the check and that all signatures \u201cappearing thereon\u201d were authentic and authorized. Finally, the parties stipulated that \u201cthe only issue for the court to resolve in this litigation ... is the scope and enforceability of the referenced exculpatory clause\u201d in the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">On January 15, 1998 plaintiff filed a renewed motion for summary judgment and defendant cross-moved. Judge Moehary granted defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, holding that under New York law the risk-shifting clause in the Agreement was enforceable against plaintiff, as successor to D &amp; S.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">From what we can tell in the record, the parties agreed that New York law applied, as the Agreement recited. We conclude that choice of law is of no real moment because under either New York or New Jersey law, the Agreement is enforceable as written and bars plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">We reject plaintiffs argument that this clause in the Agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Although Bank [First Fidelity] shall provide the Services in accordance with the prevailing reasonable commercial standards of the banking industry, Bank shall not be responsible for any loss sustained by Customer [D &amp; S Check Cashing] unless and to the extent that such loss was caused by Bank\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">covers only contract or tort claims and not statutory claims under the UCC. The clause clearly shifts the risk of \u201cany loss sustained by Customer\u201d to D &amp; S without limitation or characterization relevant to this case. The gross negligence or willful misconduct condition or limitation does not apply here \u2014 the bank is not accused of any kind of fault or bad faith. Nor is the argument that the \u201cexculpatory\u201d clause should be either narrowly construed or ignored as violative of public policy persuasive. The bank is not seeking exculpation fpr fault or other wrongdoing but rather is seeking enforcement of a commercial risk-shifting clause, one desired by the bank in this high-risk type of relationship with a check cashing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The agreement was reached by commercial parties \u2014 a bank and a check-cashing agency, which apparently handles a high volume of transactions. Shifting the risk of loss is generally permitted by New York\u2019s UCC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">The effect of provisions of this Act may be varied by agreement, <em>except as otherwise provided in this Act </em>and except that the obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness and care prescribed by this Act may not be disclaimed by agreement____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">[N.Y.U.C.C. \u00a7 1-102(3) (McKinney 1962, emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Comment two to \u00a7 1-102(3) states, \u201cfreedom of contract is a principle of the code,\u201d and \u201can agreement can change the legal consequences which would otherwise flow from the provisions of the Act.\u201d N.Y.U.C.C. \u00a7 1-102(3), comment 2. In addition, Article Four of N.Y.U.C.C., which governs bank deposits and collections, also states that parties can generally shift the risk of loss by agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">The effect of the provisions of this Article may be varied-by agreement <em>except that no agreement can disclaim a bank\u2019s responsibility for its own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care </em>or can limit the measure of damages for such lack or failure; but the parties may by agreement determine the standards by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>which such responsibility is to be measured if such standards are not manifestly unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">[N.Y.U.C.C. \u00a7 4-103(1) (McKinney 1962, emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u201cIn the absence of a showing that the standards manifestly are unreasonable, the agreement controls.\u201d N.Y.U.C.C. \u00a7 4-103(1), comment 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The Annotation to N.Y.U.C.C. \u00a7 4-103(1) states the section is \u201c[generally in accord with present law in permitting variation by agreement,\u201d \u201cbut contra to the [older] ease law rule permitting banks to limit their liability for lack of ordinary care where the limitation is explicit.\u201d The provisions of N.Y.U.C.C. \u00a7 4-103(1) do not allow a bank to disclaim liability for its failure to exercise ordinary care, a circumstance not before us in the present case. <em>See Broadway National Bank v. Barton-Russell Corp., </em>154 Misc.2d 181, 585 N.Y.S.2d 933, 939 (Sup.Ct.1992) (\u201can agreement may not eliminate the Code\u2019s duty of reasonable care\u201d); <em>Levy v. Chemical Bank, </em>124 Misc.2d 207, 475 N.Y.S.2d 771, 772 (District Court, Small Claims 1984) (\u201cNo agreement between the bank and its depositors can disclaim a bank\u2019s responsibility for its own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The OFFICIAL COMMENT to N.Y.U.C.C. \u00a7 4-103(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">2. Subsection (1) confers blanket power to vary all provisions of the Article by agreements of the ordinary kind. The agreements may not disclaim a bank\u2019s responsibility for its own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care and may not limit the measure of damages for such lack or failure, but this subsection like Section 1-102(3) approves the practice of parties determining by agreement the standards by which such responsibility is to be measured. In the absence of a showing that the standards manifestly are unreasonable, the agreement controls. Owners of items and other interested parties are not affected by agreements under this subsection unless they are parties to the agreement or are bound by adoption, ratification, estoppel or the like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-11\"><em>See also </em>New Jersey\u2019s similar Study Comment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-103; <em>Hy-Grade Oil Co. v. New Jersey Bank, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>112, 119, 350 A.2d 279 (App.Div.1975), <em>certif. denied, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>518, 361 A.2d 532 (1976); <em>Best v.

We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>conclude that paragraph four of the Agreement is enforceable and effectively shifted the risk of loss to the customer D &amp; S. We enforce it as written against plaintiff as assignee of D &amp; S because in this context the Agreement is not invoked to exonerate the bank from its own fault or lack of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
