(DECO) appeal from a judgment entered on an $11,300 jury verdict in favor of plaintiff. Defendant William M. Kemp cross-appeals from the trial judge\u2019s order denying his summary judgment motion and the judge\u2019s denial of his motion for involuntary dismissal pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:37-2. On appeal, DeLosso and DECO argue: (1) plaintiffs expert\u2019s testimony was a net opinion and thus insufficient to establish a prima facie case of professional negligence against them; (2) DECO\u2019s and DeLosso\u2019s reliance on the Kemp survey was in compliance with the parties\u2019 contract and consistent with accepted standards of architectural practice; (3) plaintiffs damages were not proximately caused by the conduct of DeLosso and DECO; and (4) DeLosso and DECO were entitled to a new trial because of evidentiary errors committed by the trial judge. We reverse the judgment in plaintiffs favor and remand for the entry of a judgment of dismissal. We dismiss Kemp\u2019s cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">In 1985, plaintiff purchased a structure on Washington Street, Cape May, for the purpose of operating a beauty salon and guest house. She contacted William M. Kemp, a professional land surveyor, to prepare a survey of the property for submission to the Cape May Zoning Board of Adjustment for a special reasons variance and site plan waiver in order to utilize the structure as a beauty shop. The survey dated February 12,1985, was submitted to the Zoning Board. The survey located a thirty-inch diameter maple tree on the site. The Zoning Board denied plaintiffs request for a site plan waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Plaintiff thereafter contacted defendant Sabatino Architects to prepare a full site plan. DeLosso, employed at the time by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Sabatino Architects, prepared a site plan dated February 10,1986. DeLosso testified that he relied on the Kemp survey \u201cas the basis\u201d for the Sabatino site plan because it contained all of the information required by the City of Cape May. Specifically, DeLosso relied on the survey for the outline of the lot and location of physical features, including the maple tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">After the Zoning Board denied plaintiffs application for a special reasons variance, she filed an action in lieu of prerogative writs, which resulted in a remand to the Zoning Board with direction that the application be reconsidered. According to the record, plaintiff received her variance approval by \u201cdefault.\u201d She thereafter contacted DeLosso in 1989 requesting his appearance before the Cape May Planning Board on her site plan application. DeLosso had since been hired by DECO. On April 6, 1989, DeLosso appeared at the hearing and the Board granted site plan approval, based on the Sabatino plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">On November 20, 1990, plaintiff again contacted DeLosso for the purpose of revising the site plan to reflect a proposed deck, a parking and lighting plan, and a handicap ramp. Pursuant to a November 28, 1990 written agreement between plaintiff and DECO, plaintiff agreed to \u201cfurnish a legal description and certified land survey of the site, ... and complete data pertaining to existing buildings, other improvements and trees----\u201d Plaintiff thereupon sent DeLosso the February 10,1986 Sabatino site plan. According to DeLosso, he did not use a land survey in preparing the revised site plan, nor did he personally inspect the property. DeLosso completed the DECO site plan on April 16, 1991, certifying that he had supervised the preparation of the site plan and that all dimensions and information set forth thereon were correct. The Planning Board approved the DECO site plan on September 4,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Construction of the structure\u2019s alterations and revisions to the site layout commenced in December 1991. During construction, plaintiffs contractor determined that the thirty-inch diameter maple tree was actually located in the proposed driveway area, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>rather than as shown on the DECO site plan. The contractor was forced to stop construction. Plaintiff was advised by the City that she needed a new site plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In December 1991, plaintiff contacted Joseph Courter, an architect, to \u201cstart from scratch\u201d and to prepare a new plan. Plaintiff gave Courter Kemp\u2019s February 12,1985 survey and DECO\u2019s April 16, 1991 revised site plan. Based on these documents and an inspection of the site, Courter determined that the plans had mislocated the maple tree. According to Courter, the Kemp survey and DECO site plan situated the tree between eleven and fourteen feet from where it actually stood. Courter thereupon prepared a new site plan on January 14, 1992. The Planning Board approved the plan on July 29,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Courter charged plaintiff $5,814 for his services in connection with preparation of the revised site plan. According to plaintiff, she was unable to open her shop until October 1992, and suffered approximately $12,128 in lost earnings because she was not able to hire a second stylist. Moreover, she paid $1,625 to her contractor after construction was interrupted for reviewing site plans with zoning officers and appearing before the Board to obtain the new site plan approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Plaintiff called Courter as her expert witness. It was his opinion that \u201c[i]n working in a small parking lot where there\u2019s a 30 inch diameter tree in the proximity, I would think it would be prudent to determine the location of that tree, fairly accurately.\u201d Courter concluded that DeLosso\u2019s failure to accurately denote the thirty-inch diameter tree violated that standard of practice. He also opined that \u201ca prudent architect would go to the site and make sure that he knows where that tree is, because all his work is going to revolve around,that tree.\u201d Courter also testified that Kemp\u2019s 1985 survey was prepared for a special reasons variance and site plan waiver. Therefore, there was no need to include vegetation in the survey, and thus Kemp\u2019s mislocation of the maple tree had no impact on the validity of the survey. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>to Courier, unless specifically requested to do so, land surveyors do not indicate vegetation on a survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">At the close of plaintiffs case, DeLosso and DECO moved to dismiss. They argued that Courier\u2019s testimony was a \u201cnet opinion\u201d since he made no reference to any recognized standard, written or oral, requiring an architect to make a site inspection prior to preparation of a site plan. The trial judge recognized that the matter presented a \u201cclose question.\u201d However, he denied the motion, observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">Mr. Courter said that the reasonably prudent professional would either order a survey when confronted with the situation that Mr. DeLosso was confronted with here, or would look to the site himself to determine whether or not the tree was properly placed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">In my view, that articulates a sufficient basis on which to deny this motion to permit this case to go to the jury because the jury can consider whether that is a standard or it isn\u2019t a standard and whether or not it has been violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">However, the judge granted Kemp\u2019s motion for involuntary dismissal of plaintiffs case. Citing Courier\u2019s testimony that Kemp was not required to denote vegetation on the survey, the judge concluded that there would be \u201cno basis on which this jury could conclude at least as to the plaintiffs claim, that Mr. Kemp was negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">At the close of defendants\u2019 case, Kemp moved for an involuntary dismissal of DeLosso\u2019s and DECO\u2019s cross-claim against him on the basis that no expert testimony was presented establishing a deviation of accepted standards of care on Kemp\u2019s part. The judge denied the motion, concluding that expert testimony was not necessary to show that a misplaced thirty-foot diameter tree would cause damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">The jury returned a verdict in plaintiffs favor in the amount of $11,300 against DeLosso and DECO, and a no cause verdict in Kemp\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">In a professional negligence case, the standard of care must normally be established by expert testimony. <em>Rosenberg v. Cahill, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>318, 325, 492 A.2d 371 (1985); <em>F.G. v. MacDonell, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>262, 272, 677 A.2d 258 (App.Div.1996), <em>aff'd in part </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>and, rev\u2019d in part, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>550, 696 A.2d 697 (1997). This is so because a jury should not be allowed to speculate, without expert testimony, in an area where laypersons have insufficient knowledge or experience. <em>Kelly v. Berlin, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>256, 268, 692 A.2d 552 (App.Div.1997). Moreover, opinion testimony \u201cmust relate to generally accepted ... standards, not merely to standards personal to the witness.\u201d <em>Fernandez v. Baruch, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>127, 131, 244 A.2d 109 (1968). In other words, plaintiff must produce expert testimony upon which the jury could find that the consensus of the particular profession involved recognized the existence of the standard defined by the expert. <em>Ibid. </em>It is insufficient for plaintiffs expert simply to follow slavishly an \u201caccepted practice\u201d formula; there must be some evidential support offered by the expert establishing the existence of the standard. <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 528-29, 435 A.2d 1150 (1981). A standard which is personal to the expert is equivalent to a net opinion. <em>Crespo v. McCartin, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>413, 422-23, 582 A.2d 1011 (App.Div.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The crux of Courter\u2019s testimony was that DeLosso deviated from accepted standards of architectural practice by failing to make a site inspection of plaintiffs property to verify the location of the thirty-inch diameter maple tree when he prepared the April 16, 1991 DECO site plan. It was his view that when a plan involves a small site, a \u201cprudent architect would go to the site and make sure that he knows where that tree is, because all his work is going to revolve around that tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The problem is that Courier presented no authority supporting his opinion. No reference was made to any written document, or even unwritten custom or practice indicating that the consensus of the architectural community recognizes a duty to make a site inspection for \u201csmall sites.\u201d Courier simply explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">I\u2019m just using \u2014 I think general care in doing a small parking lot \u2014 I mean, I wasn\u2019t at the time referring to standards in my mind. I was referring to just the general care shown on a small project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>There\u2019s no standard that says on a small site, an architect has to verify the survey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A91\">Ultimately, Courter acknowledged that it was his personal opinion that \u201cit would be [a] prudent approach\u201d to make such a site inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Citing <em>Bellardini v. Krikorian, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 537 A.2d 700 (App.Div.1988), plaintiff argues that Courter was able to establish the pertinent standard of care based solely upon his personal experience and training. <em>Bellardini </em>was a medical malpractice case, where the defendant doctor in 1962 prescribed the drug Tofranil to treat plaintiffs mother for obesity and depression. <em>Id. </em>at 459, 537 A.2d 700. Plaintiff was born with birth defects allegedly resulting from the mother\u2019s ingestion of the drug. <em>Ibid. </em>In his written report and deposition, plaintiffs expert, who apparently was licensed to practice medicine after 1962, testified that based on the 1962 medical standards a physician should not prescribe Tofranil without continued testing of a female for pregnancy because it was then recognized that Tofranil affected fetal development in the first trimester. <em>Id. </em>at 460-61, 537 A.2d 700. The expert admitted that he had no \u201cmanuals\u201d to support his opinion as to the medical standard of care in 1962. <em>Id. </em>at 460, 537 A.2d 700. Noting that \u201can expert may rely on his own knowledge, as well as on facts supplied to him by others,\u201d the <em>Bellardini </em>court concluded that the expert could testify as to a standard of care based on his training and experience. <em>Id. </em>at 463, 537 A.2d 700. The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">A doctor who entered medical school after the asserted occurrence of the malpractice may still be able to express an opinion as to what accepted medical standards in the profession and in the community were at the time of the occurrence. Presumably, text books and treatises used or available to the witness would have been available the year before he entered medical school or even earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\"><em>Ubid. </em>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Apparently, in concluding that the expert\u2019s testimony was not a net opinion, the <em>Bellardini </em>court assumed that plaintiffs expert had derived his knowledge of the 1962 standard of care based in part on his access to \u201ctext books and treatises ... available to the witness____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>No such assumption can be made here, given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>the total absence in Courter\u2019s testimony of reference to any text book, treatise, standard, custom or recognized practice, other than his personal view.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Courter also made reference to various administrative rules regulating the preparation of site plans by architects. The first, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:27-6.5(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">The architect in responsible charge shall sign, date and seal all original tracings of construction drawings and the title page of the specifications prepared by the architect or under his or her supervision on the original tracing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Courter testified that by signing the April 16, 1991 DECO plan, DeLosso and DECO became \u201cresponsible\u201d for its accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Firstly, the rule refers to \u201cconstruction drawings\u201d; it is unclear whether it applies to site plans at all. Secondly, even assuming that DeLosso and DECO were \u201cresponsible\u201d for the accuracy of the site plan, the rule does not state that an architect must make a site inspection, or may not transfer site information provided by a licensed surveyor onto the site plan. In fact, <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:27-7.2(a)l provides that existing conditions and physical features of the site denoted on a survey \u201cmay be transferred to the site plan if duly noted as to the date of the survey, by whom, and for whom.\u201d DeLosso \u201ctransferred\u201d the physical features of the site depicted on Kemp\u2019s survey to the Sabatino site plan and from that site plan to the DECO plan dated April 16,1991. Although the DECO site plan did not \u201cduly\u201d note Kemp\u2019s survey, it cannot be seriously argued that that technical error was a proximate cause of plaintiffs damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Courter himself acknowledged he transferred physical features depicted on the Kemp survey to his site plan prepared for plaintiff and did not denote that fact on the plan as required by the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">More importantly, Courter admitted during cross-examination that an architect is not required to check the accuracy of a survey given to him by a client, and is entitled to rely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>survey in preparing a site plan. In fact, the contract between plaintiff and DECO addresses this point as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\n<em>OWNER\u2019S RESPONSIBILITY</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">1. <em>The Owner shall furnish a legal description and certified land survey </em>of the site, giving as applicable, grades and lines of streets, alleys, pavements and adjoining property; right-of-way, restrictions, easements, encroachments, zoning, deed restrictions, [boundaries] and contours of the site; locations, dimensions and complete data pertaining to existing buildings, other improvements and <em>trees; </em>and full information concerning available service and utility lines both public and private, above and below grade including inverts and depths.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">5. The services, information, <em>surveys </em>and reports required by Paragraphs 1 through 4 inclusive <em>shall be furnished </em>at the Owner\u2019s expense <em>and the Architect shall be entitled to rely upon the accuracy </em>and completeness thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">This language generally tracts a clause contained in form B-141 of the American Institute of Architects Standard Form Agreement (SFA), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">4.5 The Owner shall furnish surveys describing physical characteristics, legal limitations and utility locations for the site of the Project, and a written legal description of the site. The surveys and legal information shall include, as applicable, ... locations, dimensions and necessary data pertaining to existing buildings, other improvements and trees; and information concerning available utility services and lines, both public and private, above and below grade ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-11\">4.9 The services, information, surveys and reports required by Paragraph 4.5 through 4.8 shall be furnished at the Owner\u2019s expense, and the Architect shall be entitled to rely upon the accuracy and completeness thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Charles Surmonte, defendants\u2019 expert, testified that these provisions in the SFA were essential because an architect, in preparing a site plan, necessarily relies on surveys to locate the physical features on the lot in question. This is so, according to Surmonte, because by law architects cannot denote such features on a site plan and thus depend on their locations as depicted by a licensed surveyor. Surmonte testified that form B-141 represents an accepted standard of care in the architectural community.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">On cross-examination, plaintiffs expert Courter agreed that form B-141 of the SFA set forth an applicable standard defining the conditions of an architect\u2019s services to a client. Thus, Courter essentially agreed that, pursuant to form B-141, the architect had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the right to rely on a survey furnished by the client. He also acknowledged that the B-141 standard makes no exception for \u201csmaller sites,\u201d such as plaintiffs lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Courier explained, however, that the \u201creliance\u201d referred to by form B-141 meant such features as metes and bounds, dimensions of buildings and utilities, features required by law to be depicted on a survey. He pointed out that \u201cnormally\u201d a survey \u201cwould not show vegetation,\u201d including trees. Whether or not this assertion is correct, the survey in question here did in fact depict the mislocated thirty-inch diameter tree and, in accordance with form B-141, defendants were entitled to rely on that depiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Finally, plaintiff argues that form B-141 is inapplicable because DeLosso testified he did not rely on the Kemp survey when preparing the DECO April 16, 1991 site plan. However, even though DeLosso made no reference to the survey in preparing the DECO revisions, he testified that he relied on the Kemp survey \u201cas a basis\u201d for the Sabatino site plan, including the location of the thirty-inch diameter maple tree. He stated further that when plaintiff approached him in 1990 to revise the Sabatino site plan, plaintiff obtained the Sabatino site plan and gave it to DeLosso for the purpose of revising it. DECO\u2019s revised site plan denotes the Sabatino site plan as the source of information relied on by DECO. In short, the Kemp survey was the genesis of the mislocation of the thirty-inch diameter tree, and DeLosso and DECO relied on that survey by their reliance on the Sabatino site plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">We conclude that the \u201creliance\u201d provisions in form B-141 of the SFA, and in the written agreement between plaintiff and DECO, gave defendants an unqualified right to rely on the Kemp survey and Sabatino site plan in preparing their April 16, 1991 revisions. It also nullifies Counter's unsupported conclusion that defendant had a duty to make a site inspection to check the accuracy of the physical features contained in the Kemp survey. We therefore conclude that Courier\u2019s testimony constituted a net opinion, and defendants were entitled to a judgment of dismissal as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Because our reversal of the judgment in plaintiffs favor leaves the jury verdict of no cause in favor of Kemp undisturbed, we need not address Kemp\u2019s arguments raised on his cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Reversed and remanded for the entry of a judgment of dismissal in favor of DeLosso and DECO.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-10\"> DECO's site plan did note the Sabatino site plan as the source of some of the physical features contained on the plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
