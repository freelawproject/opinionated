Before his retirement in 1993, plaintiff served twenty-two and one-half years on the police force. Because plaintiff had served four years in the United States Coast Guard, he was allowed to \u201cbuy back\u201d the equivalent of two and one-half years to qualify for a full pension under the Police and Fireman\u2019s Retirement System. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-11.1. Relying on a collective bargaining agreement with the Police Benevolent Association (PBA), the Borough determined that the \u201cbuy back\u201d also entitled plaintiff to full medical insurance benefits upon his retirement. The Borough paid the benefits to plaintiff from January 1, 1993 until February 29,1996. At that point it notified plaintiff that he was not entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>to continued medical benefits, and accordingly terminated the benefits immediately. <em>See Wolfersberger v. Borough of Point Pleasant Beach, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>446, 702 A.2d 1294 (App.Div.1996) (holding that a policeman\u2019s purchase of service credits to qualify for a pension cannot be credited towards twenty-five years of service to qualify for medical benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23 as it read prior to a 1995 amendment to the statute), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>40, 702 A.2d 1284 (1997). The trial court held that the Borough was equitably estopped from terminating the benefits. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff was entitled to a \u201cspecial retirement\u201d pension pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-11.1 by virtue of his twenty-two and one-half years of actual service with the Borough, and his payment into the Police and Fireman\u2019s Retirement System of the amount required to purchase two and one-half years of \u201cservice credit\u201d to establish twenty-five years of \u201ccreditable service.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-11.1. At the time of plaintiffs retirement, Borough Ordinance No. 600 provided that the Borough would \u201cassume the entire cost of coverage and group insurance premiums for retired employees and their dependents, to the extent authorized by [N.J.S.A.] 40A:10-23.\u201d On January 1, 1993, the effective date of plaintiffs retirement, <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:10-23 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">Retired employees shall be required to pay for the entire cost of coverage for themselves and their dependents at rates which are deemed to be adequate to cover the benefits____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">The employer may, in its discretion, assume the entire cost of such coverage and pay all of the premiums for employees who have retired on a disability pension or after 25 years\u2019 or more service with the employer, or have retired and reached the age of 62 or older with at least 15 years of service with the employer, including the premiums on their dependents, if any, under uniform conditions as the governing body of the local unit shall prescribe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Plaintiff was covered by a collective bargaining agreement between the Borough and the PBA, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">Upon retirement under the Police and Fireman\u2019s Pension System, the Borough shall provide the retiring employee and his/her family with all insurance coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>listed in Section 1 of this Article, and shall continue said coverage until the death of said employee, subject to the provisions of Article VI, Section 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Article II, Section 2 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">If any provision of this Agreement or any application of this Agreement to any employees or group of employees is held to be contrary to law, then such provisions and application shall not be deemed valid and subsisting except to the extent permitted by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Plaintiff testified during his deposition that he considered retirement as early as March 1992. His main concern was whether the Borough would continue his health care benefits if he retired before completing twenty-five years of actual service. He testified that, based on the collective bargaining agreement, he expected that his health benefits would continue after retirement. Nevertheless, sometime prior to retirement, he discussed the issue with the acting Chief of Police, who agreed that plaintiff would be entitled to continued health insurance benefits in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Plaintiff was then referred to Mark Perka, the insurance liaison for the Borough; Robert Seattler, the Chief Financial Officer, and Kevin Yecco, the Borough Administrator. Each of these Borough representatives advised plaintiff that the continuation of plaintiffs health benefits would not be affected by his retirement. Plaintiff also met with the Borough Mayor to negotiate issues regarding reimbursement for sick time pay. According to plaintiff, at the meeting it was \u201cconfirmed [that he] would receive health benefits\u201d upon his retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">In reliance on these assurances, plaintiff filed the requisite paperwork to \u201cbuy back\u201d the two and one-half years of time in order to satisfy the twenty-five years of \u201ccreditable service\u201d requirement for retirement. Plaintiff thereupon paid the New Jersey Division of Pensions the sum of $32,000 representing the amount he would have contributed if he had worked the full twenty-five years. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-11.11. On May 8, 1992, plaintiff took a medical leave of absence until December 31, 1992. His retirement became effective January 1,1993. From that date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>through </em>February 29, 1996, the Borough paid plaintiffs medical benefits totaling $62,772.62</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The Legislature amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23, effective June 1995. The statute now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">The employer may, in its discretion, assume the entire cost of such [medical] coverage and pay all of the premiums for employees ... who have retired after 25 years or more of <em>service credit </em>in a State or locally administered retirement system____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>40A:10-23 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">In <em>Wolfersberger, supra, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>446, 702 A.2d 1294, we noted that under the retirement statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-11.11, an employee may satisfy the prerequisites for a \u201cspecial retirement\u201d pension by purchasing \u201ccredits\u201d based on his or her service with the armed forces because that statute defines \u201celigibility for such a pension\u201d in terms of \u201ccreditable service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, 702 A.2d 1294. We observed that, prior to the 1995 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23, no comparable statutory provision authorized counting \u201ccreditable service\u201d toward the twenty-five years of service called for by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23, pertaining to the payment of health benefits to a retiree. <em>Ibid. </em>Nothing in the pre-amendment version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23 provided that anything but \u201cservice with the employer\u201d could be credited toward the twenty-five years of service required to qualify for payment of health insurance premiums by a municipality. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, we held that Wolfersberger\u2019s application for health insurance benefits was properly denied by the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">According to the record, the 1995 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23 caused the Borough to determine that, based on the pre-amendment version of the statute, plaintiff was not entitled to health benefits after his retirement. Thus, by letter dated December 20, 1995, the Borough terminated payment of the benefits immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">Plaintiff filed suit seeking a declaration that he is entitled to continued health benefits during his retirement. The Borough counterclaimed, seeking to recover the $62,772.62 paid on plaintiffs behalf for health benefits. The motion judge granted plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>tiff summary judgment and dismissed the Borough\u2019s counterclaim, concluding that the Borough was estopped from terminating the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 Ass\u2019n of Cape May v. City of Cape May, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>493, 117 A.2d 585 (1955), our Supreme Court described the principle of estoppel <em>in pais,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>grounded in equity and justice, as embodying the doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">that one may, by voluntary conduct, be precluded from taking a course of action that would work injustice and wrong to one who with good reason and in good faith has relied upon such conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">The doing or forbearing to do an act induced by the conduct of another may work an estoppel to avoid wrong or injury ensuing from reasonable reliance upon such conduct. The repudiation of one\u2019s act done or position assumed is not permissible where that course would work injustice to another who, having the right to do so, has relied thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 503-04, 117 A.2d 585.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">\u201c \u2018Equitable estoppel is rarely invoked against a governmental entity,\u2019 \u201d <em>County of Morris v. Fauver, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>80, 104, 707 A.2d 958 (1998) (quoting <em>O\u2019Malley v. Department of Energy, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>309, 316, 537 A.2d 647 (1987)), particularly when it would \u201cprejudice essential governmental functions.\u201d <em>Vogt v. Borough of Belmar, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>195, 205, 101 A.2d 849 (1954). Nevertheless, equitable considerations are relevant in assessing governmental conduct, <em>Skulski v. Nolan, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>179, 198, 343 A.2d 721 (1975), and the doctrine may be invoked against a municipality \u201cwhere the interests of justice, morality and common fairness clearly dictate that course.\u201d <em>Gruber v. Mayor and Tp. Comm., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>1, 13, 186 A.2d 489 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">The <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 </em>Court held that, in deciding whether or not to invoke equitable estoppel against a municipality, a court must focus on the nature of the action taken by the municipality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>There is a distinction between an act utterly beyond the jurisdiction of a municipal corporation and the irregular exercise of a basic power under the legislative grant in matters not in themselves jurisdictional. The former are <em>ultra vires </em>in the primary sense and void; the latter, <em>ultra vires </em>only in a secondary sense which does not preclude ratification or the application of the doctrine of estoppel in the interest of equity and essential justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">[19 <em>N.J. </em>at 504, 117 A.2d 585.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\"><em>See also Gruber, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 15, 186 A.2d 489; <em>Bridge v. Neptune Tp. Board of Adjust., </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>587, 597, 559 A.2d 855 (App.Div.1989); <em>Juliano v. Borough of Ocean Gate, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>503, 508, 520 A.2d 418 (Law Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">An <em>ultra vires </em>contract has been defined as one which \u201cis not within the power of a municipal corporation to make <em>under any circumstances or for any purpose. </em>A contract that is merely the result of a defective exercise of existing authority is not ultra vires.\u201d 10 <em>McQuillin Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 29.10 (3rd Ed.1999) (emphasis added). However, the term <em>\u201cultra vires,\u201d </em>used in the context of municipal law, has engendered some confusion in its application. <em>See ibid, </em>and cases cited therein. In the circumstances of a particular case, <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 </em>Ass\u2019n\u2019s \u201cprimary/seeondary\u201d distinction may become obscured.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">For example, in <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>the city sold public land not needed for public use, but failed to comply with several statutory requirements which \u201cvitiated the statutory policy of public notice and free competitive bidding.\u201d 19 <em>N.J. </em>at 498, 117 A.2d 585. The Court nevertheless refused to set aside the sale, noting that although the \u201coriginal rule\u201d that a contract \u201cvoid <em>ab initio </em>\u201d was not subject to being validated by ratification or estoppel, the rights of persons innocently entering into municipal contracts had to be considered in order to avoid manifest injustice and legal wrong. <em>Id. </em>at 505-06, 117 A.2d 585. Noting that the challenge to the sale was made only after the \u201cerection of a structure of great value,\u201d the Court determined that the sale was \u201cwithin the municipality\u2019s essential jurisdiction!,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 506, 117 A.2d 585, and that elemental justice compelled invoking estoppel despite noncompliance with the statutory requirements. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>The <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 Ass\u2019n </em>dichotomy has been applied in the zoning field. In <em>Jantausch v. Borough of Verona, </em>41 <em>N.J.Super. </em>89, 94-95, 124 A.2d 14 (Law Div.1956), <em>aff'd, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>326, 131 A.2d 881 (1957), then Judge Weintraub held that when a municipal official issues a building permit in good faith and, within the ambit of his duty, makes an erroneous and debatable interpretation of an ordinance, estoppel will lie if the property owner reasonably relies on the permit. In <em>Scardigli v. Borough of Haddonfield Zoning Board of Adjust., </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>314, 319-20, 692 A.2d 1012 (App.Div.1997), we held that a municipality may be estopped if there is reasonable reliance on a good faith act of an administrative official, within the ambit of his or her official duty, which \u201cconstitutes an erroneous and debatable interpretation of an ordinance.\u201d And <em>see Township of Fairfield v. Likanchuk\u2019s, Inc., </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 332, 644 A.2d 120 (App.Div.1994) and cases cited therein. But <em>see Hilton Acres v. Klein, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>570, 581, 174 A.2d 465 (1961) (stating that \u201cmunicipal action in the land use control field taken in direct violation of law or without legal authority is void <em>ab initio </em>and has no legal efficacy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 </em>Ass\u2019n\u2019s analysis has also been applied in other contexts. For example, in <em>O\u2019Neill v. State, Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>211, 214, 428 A.2d 562 (App.Div.1981), we held, citing <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 Ass\u2019n </em>that, the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees Retirement System was not estopped from denying petitioner retirement eligibility where there is \u201can absolute and unambiguous statutory declaration which deprives the agency of jurisdictional authority to award pension benefits under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In contrast, in <em>Galvano v. Board of Trustees, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 542 A.2d 926 (App.Div.1988), a sixty-one year old municipal employee applied for veteran\u2019s retirement, effective October 1, 1984. The Board of Trustees of the Public Employees Retirement System approved his application. <em>Id. </em>at 390, 542 A.2d 926. The Division of Pensions thereafter advised the employee that he was ineligible for veteran\u2019s retirement because he had not attained his</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>sixty-second year as of October 1, 1984, and that his application was being processed as a \u201cservice\u201d rather than veteran\u2019s retirement. <em>Ibid. </em>The employee asked the Division to \u201creverse the mistake that [he] made when he accepted\u201d the service retirement benefits and award him veteran\u2019s benefits as of June 5, 1985, his sixty-second birthday. <em>Ibid. </em>We reversed the Board\u2019s denial of that application, noting that equitable factors must enter into the equation even in circumstances where the pension was improper. We concluded that the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">clearly had jurisdiction to approve [the veteran\u2019s] pension request, although its approval was incorrectly exercised in light of the age 62 requirement of <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:15A-61(b). The Board\u2019s inherent power to correct its mistake was subject, however, to the equitable considerations spelled out in <em>Skulski, [supra, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>at 179, 343 A.2d 721].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 395, 542 A.2d 926.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Finally, in <em>Juliano, supra, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>503, 520 A.2d 418, the defendant borough asserted that its acting chiefs original appointment as a regular police officer was void <em>ab initio </em>because, at the time of the appointment, she did not comply with the maximum age requirement under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 14-147. Citing <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>Judge Serpentelli held that the borough was estopped from asserting the illegality, despite the clear statutory violation in the application process. He observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARt\">the right of Ocean Gate to appoint police officers is not questioned. <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-118. It exercised that essential power and therefore did not act <em>ultra vires </em>in the primary sense. Its failure to abide by the age requirement is more accurately described as \u201can irregular exercise of a basic power\u201d as opposed to \u201can act utterly beyond its jurisdiction.\u201d Consequently it is, at most, <em>ultra vires </em>in the secondary sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-10\"><em>[Juliano, supra, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 508-09, 520 A.2d 418 [(citation omitted).]</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">The judge reasoned that \u201ca finding that plaintiffs appointment is <em>ultra vires </em>in the primary sense and thus void would result in a gross injustice[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 510, 520 A.2d 418, noting the absence of fraud, the borough\u2019s failure to raise the issue in a timely fashion, plaintiffs reliance, and that there was no showing that the legitimate policy justifications for the age limitation had been frustrated. <em>Id. </em>at 509-10, 520 A.2d 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>What is gleaned from <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 Ass\u2019n </em>and the subsequent cases is that, in many instances, as here, the facts of a particular case may not fit neatly within the <em>ultra vires </em>\u201cprimary or secondary\u201d designations as set forth in <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 Ass\u2019n. </em>In such circumstances, the court must consider whether \u201cequity and elemental justice,\u201d <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>at 506, 117 A.2d 585, precludes a municipality\u2019s abrogation of its act, provided that application of estoppel does not frustrate an essential governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Plaintiff presents a persuasive argument that the facts before us do not involve an act \u201cutterly beyond the jurisdiction of\u2019 the Borough, <em>id. </em>at 504, 117 A.2d 585, and that the case does not involve \u201can absolute and unambiguous statutory declaration which deprives\u201d the Borough from awarding health benefits to plaintiff. <em>O\u2019Neill, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 214, 428 A.2d 562. A municipality is empowered to enter into contracts for group hospitalization and medical insurance on behalf of its employees. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-17. At the time of plaintiffs retirement, it also had the discretion to provide such benefits to a retiring employee who had \u201c25 years\u2019 or more service with the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">While it is true that plaintiff did not comply strictly with the then pertinent requirement of serving \u201c25 years\u2019 or more service with the [Borough],\u201d that language at the time was the subject of fair debate; it was unclear whether \u201cservice with the employer,\u201d may include \u201ccreditable service\u201d afforded to veterans pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>43.T6A-11.1. There was no judicial determination as to the meaning of the language until our 1996 decision in <em>Wolfersberger. </em>Moreover, the record is clear that the Borough officials, in granting the benefits to plaintiff, relied in good faith on the Borough\u2019s own ordinance and the PBA collective bargaining agreement which provided that, upon the retirement of a police officer, \u201cthe Borough <em>shall </em>provide the retiring employee and his/her family with all insurance coverage listed____\u201d under the terms of the agreement. (Emphasis added). Plaintiff makes the compelling argument that the grant of benefits to him constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>an \u201cirregular exercise of a basic power____\u201d <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>at 504, 117 A.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">To label the contract as <em>ultra vires </em>in the primary sense and thus void would, as in <em>Juliano, supra, </em>constitute a \u201cgross injustice.\u201d 214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 510, 520 A.2d 418. There is no suggestion here that bad faith or fraud was in play in the grant of benefits to plaintiff. There is also no question that plaintiff reasonably relied on the representations of the Borough. Prior to his retirement he asked at least five Borough officials, from the acting Chief of Police to the Mayor, whether he would be entitled to health benefits upon his retirement. All of the officials assured him that, in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement, he would be entitled to the benefits. There is also no question that he suffered a detriment in relying on the Borough\u2019s assurances. Once he was assured of his eligibility for continued health benefits, he paid over $32,000 to achieve a \u201cspecial\u201d retirement in buying back the requisite two and one-half years to satisfy the retirement-eligibility requirements. He testified that his eligibility for health benefits was critical to his decision whether or not to retire. Had he been told otherwise, he could have deferred retirement until he had twenty five years of actual service with the Borough.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Finally, applying estoppel here does not frustrate an essential public function. There is no suggestion that the award to plaintiff resulted in a raid on the Borough\u2019s treasury by others, similarly situated, demanding benefits. Moreover, the legislative policy requiring twenty-five years of actual service with a municipality was tempered by the 1995 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-23, which now gives the municipal employer the discretion to grant benefits to retiring employees in plaintiffs circumstances. Fundamental fairness dictates in favor of applying equitable estoppel against the municipality in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-11\"> In modern usage the doctrines of equitable estoppel and estoppel <em>in pais </em>are convertible terms. <em>Anske v.
