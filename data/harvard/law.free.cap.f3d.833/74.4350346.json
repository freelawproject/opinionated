Donziger (collectively the \u201cDonziger Firm\u201d or \u201cFirm\u201d), and defendants-appellants Hugo Gerardo Camacho Naranjo (\u201cCamacho\u201d) and Javier Piaguaje Payaguaje (\u201cPiaguaje\u201d), appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Lewis A. Kaplan, Judge, granting certain relief against them in favor of plaintiff-appellee Chevron Corporation (\u201cChevron\u201d), in connection with an $8,646 billion judgment obtained against Chevron in Ecuador (\u201cEcuadorian Judgment\u201d), by several dozen named plaintiffs from Ecuador\u2019s Lago Agrio area (the \u201cLago Agrio Plaintiffs\u201d or \u201cLAPs\u201d) represented by the Donziger Firm, for environmental damage in connection with 1960s-1990s oil exploration activities in Ecuador by Texaco, Inc. (\u201cTexaco\u201d), whose stock was later acquired by Chevron. The district court\u2019s judgment, entered after a bench trial, principally (1) enjoins defendants-appellants from seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian Judgment in any court in the United States, and (2) imposes a constructive trust for Chevron\u2019s benefit on any property defendants-appellants have received or may receive anywhere in the world that is traceable to the Ecuadorian Judgment or its enforcement, based on the court\u2019s findings that the Ecuadorian Judgment was procured through, inter alia, defendants\u2019 bribery, coercion, and fraud, warranting relief against Steven Donziger (\u201cDonziger\u201d) and his Firm under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968, and against all defendants-appellants under New York common law. See Chevron v. Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d 862 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\u201cDonziger\u201d). Without challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support any of those factual findings, defendants-appellants challenge the district court\u2019s judgment, arguing principally that the action should have been dismissed on the ground that Chevron lacks Article III standing, and/or that the judgment should be reversed on the grounds, inter alia, that it violates principles of international comity and judicial estoppel, exceeds any legal authorization for equitable relief, and was entered without personal jurisdiction over defendants other than Donziger and his Firm. For the reasons that follow, including the absence of challenges to the district court\u2019s factual findings, the express disclaimers by the Ecuadorian appellate courts of their own jurisdiction to \u201chear and resolve\u201d the above charges of corruption, \u201cpreserving the parties\u2019 rights\u201d to pursue those charges in actions in the United States (Ecuadorian intermediate appellate court clarification order dated January 18, 2012, at 4; see also Opinion of Ecuadorian National Court of Justice at 120 (\u201cpreserving the rights and actions of the parties\u201d in \u201caeknowledge[ment of] the lack o[f] jurisdiction to decide whether or not there has been procedural fraud\u201d)), and the district court\u2019s confinement of its injunction to a grant of in personam relief against the three defendants-appellants without disturbing the Ecuadorian judgment, we find no basis for dismissal or reversal, and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">TABLE OF CONTENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">I.BACKGROUND... 82</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">A.

In 1964, the Republic of Ecuador (\u201cROE\u201d) had granted to a joint venture \u2014 which was then 50%-owned by a subsidiary of Texaco dubbed \u201cTexPet\u201d \u2014 a concession to explore for and produce oil in the Oriente (the \u201cConcession\u201d). In the 1970s, Ecuador\u2019s state-owned oil company, now known as PetroEcuador, acquired at first a minority, and then a majority, interest in the joint venture. TexPet was the operator of the Concession until the early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>1990s. In late 1989, PetroEcuador took over operation of the Trans-Ecuadoran Pipeline, see Jota v. Texaco, Inc., 157 F.3d 153, 156 n.4 (2d Cir. 1998) (\u201cJota\u201d); in mid-1990, PetroEcuador took over operation of the Concession drilling operations as well, see id.; Aguinda v. Texaco, Inc., 303 F.3d 470, 473 (2d Cir. 2002) (\u201cAguinda\u201d). In mid-1992, when the Concession expired, TexPet\u2019s interest in the joint venture reverted to PetroEcuador, leaving PetroEcuador as the sole owner and operator of the venture. See Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 386.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADJ\">In connection with the termination of TexPet\u2019s Ecuadorian operations, TexPet and Texaco in 1993 entered into a Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] with the ROE that provided that TexPet would be released from any potential claim for environmental harm once Tex-Pet performed an agreed-upon remediation in the area in which it had operated. In the Spring of 1995, the parties executed a Settlement Agreement and Scope of Work agreement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) that laid out specific tasks TexPet was required to complete before its remediation and wind down were complete, whereupon it would be entitled to a release. From 1995 through 1998, ROE inspectors issued 52 actas in which they confirmed TexPet\u2019s completion of each task. The final acta \u2014 the 52nd Certificate \u2014 was issued in September 1998 and stated that TexPet had complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement. The final release was signed on September 30, 1998. It stated that TexPet had fully performed its obligations under the MOU and Settlement Agreement and that TexPet was released from all potential claims by the ROE and PetroEcuador.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">Id. at 386-87 (footnotes omitted) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">In the meantime, a group of Oriente residents, represented by New York City lawyer Donziger, among others, commenced a class action against Texaco in the Southern District of New York in 1993, seeking billions of dollars in damages, as well as certain equitable relief within Ecuador, for alleged environmental damage in Ecuador and injury to the health of the plaintiffs, see Aguinda, 303 F.3d at 473-74. Thus began this conflict, which \u201cmust be among the most extensively [chronicled] in the history of the American federal judiciary.\u201d Chevron Corp. v. Naranjo, 667 F.3d 232, 234 (2d Cir.) (\u201cNaranjo\u201d), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 423, 184 L.Ed.2d 288 (2012); see id. at 234 n.l (noting that an \u201cunderinclusive Westlaw search for Chevron or Texaco &amp; Ecuador &amp; \u2019Lago Agrio\u2019 yield[ed] fifty-six results, all of which deal directly with this litigation\u201d); see, e.g., Jota, 157 F.3d 153 (vacating an unconditional forum non conveniens dismissal of class actions brought against Texaco in New York by, respectively, the Aguinda Oriente residents in 1993 and residents of Peru in 1994); Aguinda, 303 F.3d 470 (approving a forum non conveniens dismissal of the Oriente residents\u2019 1993 New York action against Texaco, conditioned on Texaco\u2019s agreement to submit to personal jurisdiction and waive certain statute of limitations defenses in Ecuador); Chevron Corp. v. Berlinger, 629 F.3d 297 (2d Cir. 2011) (requiring filmmaker, whom Donziger had commissioned to make a documentary film about his Ecuadorian case, to turn over to Chevron hundreds of hours of outtakes, some of which had initially been aired \u2014 showing, inter aha, Donziger discussing his litigation strategy and disparaging the Ecuadorian judiciary \u2014 but were later deleted at Donziger\u2019s insistence); Republic of Ecuador v. Chevron Corp., 638 F.3d 384 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201cRepublic of Ecuador\u201d) (affirming refusal to stay treaty-based arbitration proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>commenced by Chevron in 2009 alleging, inter alia, ROE\u2019s breach of the 1993 Settlement Agreement with TexPet and Texaco and the 1998 release); Chevron Corp. v. Republic of Ecuador, 795 F.3d 200 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (affirming confirmation of an arbitration award of approximately $96 million in favor of Chevron against ROE in a proceeding commenced by Chevron in 2006 for failure to resolve in a timely fashion lawsuits by TexPet against ROE), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 2410, 195 L.Ed.2d 780 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In 2003, following the affirmance of a forum non conveniens dismissal of the Aguinda case, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs\u2014 Camacho, Piaguaje, and 46 other named plaintiffs residing in or near Lago Agrio\u2014 represented by the Donziger Firm, sued Chevron in Ecuador, seeking to hold it responsible for extensive environmental damage allegedly caused by Texaco in the area covered by the Concession (the \u201cLago Agrio Litigation\u201d or \u201cLago Agrio Chevron case\u201d). The action was brought for the benefit of some 30,000 indigenous residents of the area, and the complaint requested that any money awarded for performance of the requested remediation\u2014 plus an additional 10% \u2014 be paid to the Frente de la Defensa de la Amazonia (\u201cADF\u201d) for its use in performing ordered remediation. See Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 391-92. Thus, the LAPs sought to have \u201cany and all sums recovered\u201d in the action controlled by the ADF. Id. at 392. The ADF was formed in 1993 by Donziger and Luis Yanza, his closest friend in Ecuador, to support the Aguinda litigation; the ADF was controlled by Donziger and Yanza. See, e.g., id. at 398-99. .</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">In February 2011, the trial court in Ecuador entered a judgment in favor of the LAPs awarding $8.646 billion in compensatory damages, plus $8.646 billion in punitive damages unless Chevron issued an apology, for a total of $17.292 billion (\u201cLago Agrio Judgment\u201d or \u201cInitial Judgment\u201d or \u201cJudgment\u201d). The punitive damages aspect of the award was eventually eliminated on appeal (see Part I.E.2. below), leaving the judgment against Chevron, as modified, at $8.646 billion (the Ecuadorian Judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The present action was commenced by Chevron in 2011 against Donziger, his Firm, and the named Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, including Camacho and Piaguaje (referred to in the district court and this opinion as the \u201cLAP Representatives\u201d), alleging that the LAPs procured the Lago Agrio Judgment by a variety of unethical, corrupt, and illegal means, including: making secret payments to industry experts who would submit pro-LAPs opinions to the court while pretending to be neutral; announcing multi-billion-dollar remediation cost estimates while knowing them to be without scientific basis; persuading an expert to sign blank pages that were then submitted to the court with opinions he did not authorize; employing extortion to coerce an Ecuadorian judge to curtail inspections of alleged contamination sites after the experts began to find pro-Chevron conditions at other such sites; using the same extortionate means to coerce that judge to appoint, as a supposedly neutral expert court adviser, an expert who was bribed to submit \u2014 as his own opinion \u2014 a report written by the LAPs; and providing ex parte to another judge \u2014 or to whoever wrote the $17.292 billion Lago Agrio Judgment \u2014 material that is not part of the record for inclusion in that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Chevron originally sought damages and a global injunction forbidding enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment. Initially, the district court bifurcated the case and granted Chevron\u2019s request for a global preliminary injunction, citing New York\u2019s Uniform Foreign Country Money-Judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ments Recognition Act (the \u201cRecognition Act\u201d), N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7\u00a7 5301-5309 (McKinney 2008). That injunction was reversed by this Court in Naranjo, on the ground that the Recognition Act allows a judgment debtor to challenge a foreign judgment\u2019s validity only defensively, in response to an attempted enforcement. See 667 F-.3d at 240. We declined to address other issues in this action, such as claims of lack of personal jurisdiction and \u201cthe parties\u2019 various charges and counter-charges regarding the Ecuadorian legal system and their adversaries\u2019 conduct of this litigation.\u201d Id. at 247 n.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">After our decision in Naranjo, Chevron waived its claims for damages, and the case was tried to the court without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">A. The Scope of the Trial in the Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The judgment now on appeal was entered after a seven-week trial at which the evidence included live testimony from more than 30 witnesses, 25 of whom were called by Chevron; deposition testimony of 22 witnesses, all presented by Chevron; and more than 4,000 documents. As is common practice in nonjury cases in federal court in the Southern District of New York, \u201cthe direct testimony of most witnesses was taken in the form of written statements, the truth of which was affirmed on the witness stand. The witnesses so testifying then were tendered for cross-examination, redirect, and any subsequent questioning as usual.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 546. The exhibits included emails among Donziger and members of the LAPs\u2019 litigation team; scenes or outtakes from \u201cCrude,\u201d the documentary film that had been commissioned by Donziger, in which, inter alia, Donziger made disparaging remarks about the Ecuadorian judiciary; and portions of a personal notebook maintained by Donziger during the Lago Agrio Litigation, in which he recorded, inter alia, his thoughts, concerns, aspirations, and strategies (the \u201cDonziger Notebook\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">The issues in the present case concerned the conduct of \u2014 not the environmental issues in \u2014 the Lago Agrio Litigation. Before making its findings of specific facts as to the issues in this case, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aev\">The Court assumes that there is pollution in the Orient\u00e9. On that assumption, Texaco and perhaps even Chevron\u2014 though it never drilled for oil in Ecuador \u2014 might bear some responsibility. In any case, improvement of conditions for the residents of the Orient\u00e9 appears to be both desirable and overdue....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-12\">The issue here is not what happened in the Orient\u00e9 more than twenty years ago and who, if anyone, now is responsible for any wrongs then done. It instead is whether a court decision was procured by corrupt means, regardless of whether the cause was just. An innocent defendant is no more entitled to submit false evidence, to coopt and pay off a court-appointed expert, or to coerce or bribe a judge or jury than a guilty one. So even if Donziger and his clients had a just cause \u2014 and the Court expresses no opinion on that \u2014 they were not entitled to corrupt the process to achieve their goal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-20\">Justice is not served by inflicting injustice. The ends do not justify the means. There is no \u201cRobin Hood\u201d defense to illegal and wrongful conduct. And the defendants\u2019 \u201cthis-is-the-way-it-is-done-in-Eeuador\u201d excuses \u2014 actually a remarkable insult to the people of Ecuador \u2014 do not help them. The wrongful actions of Donziger and his Ecuadorian legal team would be offensive to the laws of any nation that aspires to the rule of law, including Ecuador \u2014 and they knew it. Indeed, one Ecuadorian legal team member, in a moment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>panicky candor, admitted that if documents exposing just part of what they had done were to come to light, \u201capart from destroying the proceeding, all of us, your attorneys, might go to jail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 385-86 (quoting March 30, 2010 email from LAPs\u2019 attorney Julio Prieto to Donziger, Yanza, and LAPs\u2019 attorneys Pablo Fajardo Mendoza (\u201cFajardo\u201d), and Juan Pablo S\u00e1enz (emphases added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The district court found that throughout the Lago Agrio Chevron case, Donziger controlled all important aspects of the case, see Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 396, 398, as he, inter alia, \u201csupervised the Ecuadorian legal team, ... reviewed their court filings, directed the legal strategy, and coordinated the work between the lawyers in Ecuador and the scientists, experts, lawyers, litigation funders, politicians, and media consultants throughout the world,\u201d id. at 397. Although much of the Lago Agrio Litigation was funded by Philadelphia attorney Joseph Kohn, Don-ziger \u201cmade tactical and strategic decisions,\u201d and \u201clargely ... controlled the money.\u201d Id. at 388-89, 398; see also id. at 396 (the Ecuadorian lawyers \u201coften referred to [Donziger] as the \u2018cabeza,\u2019 or head, of the team\u201d (quoting Donziger Notebook)).

Specific Findings by the District Court as to Donziger\u2019s Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The court made extensive factual findings as to the acts undertaken by Donziger to procure the Lago Agrio Judgment, including the following. None of them is disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">1. Donziger Attempts To Intimidate Chevron Into Settling by Trumpeting a Huge Remediation Cost Estimate Based Only on \u201cSWAG\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">The initial phase of the Lago Agrio proceedings was to involve \u201cjudicial inspections\u201d to establish the level of contamination at various oil exploration sites throughout the Concession area under the supervision of the judge. The court appointed experts nominated and paid by each side, who were to take samples under judicial supervision, send the samples to a laboratory for testing and analysis, and then submit to the court written reports of their respective findings and conclusions. The court also appointed experts, known as \u201csettling experts,\u201d who, although ultimately paid by the parties, were neutral and not nominated by the parties; the settling experts attended the judicial inspections and were to resolve any disputes between the reports of the two sides\u2019 experts. See Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 411-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">Soon after the Lago Agrio Litigation was commenced, Donziger hired David Russell, an environmental engineer, to generate an initial estimate of the total cost of remediation for all polluted sites. Donziger hoped for an astronomic estimate that would have an in terrorem effect, impelling Chevron to agree to a settlement. See, e.g., id. at 406 <em>&amp; </em>n.166. At Donziger\u2019s direction, Russell went to the Oriente in the fall of 2003 to work on his damages estimate. However, Russell\u2019s site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>inspections were anything but complete or thorough.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">First, although there were more than 100 oil pits that were to be subjected to judicial inspection, Russell visited only about 45. He made his estimate of the total cost of remediation based on extrapolations from what he observed at the sites he visited. But even at the sites he did visit, he did not analyze any soil or water samples. Indeed, \u201chis visits to some of those sites, he acknowledged at trial, were no more searching than driving past them at 40 or 50 miles per hour.\u201d Id. at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Second, notwithstanding the facts that the ROE-owned PetroEcuador had long been a member of the oil-exploration and production joint venture with TexPet \u2014 and indeed was the majority owner of the venture from the mid-1970s until' mid-1992, when it became the sole owner, see id. at 386 \u2014 Donziger instructed Russell to make his cost calculations on \u201cthe assumption that Texaco was fully liable for all of the contamination in the region, even that caused by PetroEcuador after it took over operation of the [venture\u2019s] properties when TexPet left in 1992,\u201d id. at 406 (footnote omitted). In part, Donziger\u2019s desire to have Chevron alone held liable for all environmental damage to the region stemmed from a reluctance to attribute any such blame to an instrumentality of the ROE; but he also had an incentive that was purely monetary: The LAPs had \u201centered into an agreement with the ROE and Pe-troEcuador pursuant to which [the LAPs] were obliged to reduce the amount of any judgment they might obtain against Texaco by the amount of any contribution judgment that Texaco might obtain against the ROE and PetroEcuador.\u201d Id. at 414-15. \u201cThe LAPs therefore had an interest in obtaining a judgment that Chevron was entirely responsible for any and all pollution liability and remediation responsibility.\u201d Id. at 415 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">In his report to the LAPs\u2019 team, Russell estimated the cost of remediation at $6 billion; but he made clear to Donziger and the other members of the LAPs\u2019 team that that cost projection was very rough, and he cautioned \u201cthe team not to \u2018rush to judgment\u2019 based on a \u2018guesstimate.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 406 (quoting December 12, 2004 email chain with Russell, Donziger, and other LAPs\u2019 team members). Russell informed them that \u201cdue to \u2018the amount of unknowns and the lack of information [he] had with regard to not only levels of contamination but the extent of those levels of contamination[ ]\u2019.... his estimates were \u2018best guesses based upon a week of looking at the sites, without any scientific data.\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 406 (quoting testimony of Russell and December 12, 2004 email chain with Russell, Donziger, and other LAPs\u2019 team members (emphasis ours)). Russell testified that as a consequence, his $6 billion remediation cost estimate was \u201c \u2018SWAG,\u2019 an acronym for a \u2018scientific wild ass guess.\u2019\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 406 (quoting testimony of Russell).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Nonetheless, \u201cDonziger and his public relations operation avidly used Russell\u2019s $6 billion [SWAG] figure in the media to generate leverage despite the fact that they knew that it could not withstand serious analysis.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 407. Russell\u2019s \u201cexplicit\u201d warning \u201cto Donziger that [Russell\u2019s] cost estimate had been \u2018wildly inaccurate and that it should not be used\u2019.... did not stop Donziger and his public relations team from using the number, over Russell\u2019s protests, to pressure Chevron through the media.\u201d Id. (quoting testimony of Russell (emphasis ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">Donziger drafted a letter that ultimately was sent by Amazon Watch, a nongovern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>mental entity that supported Donziger and the LAPs, to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). The letter \u201cpromoted Russell\u2019s SWAG remediation estimate\u201d \u2014 despite Russell\u2019s disclaimer \u2014 and \u201casserted also that Chevron had creat[ed] toxic contamination over 30 times larger than the Exxon Valdez,\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 408 (internal quotation marks omitted), despite advice from scientists on the LAPs\u2019 team that that figure was \u201cvastly exaggerated,\u201d id. at 408 n.185. The letter urged the SEC to investigate Chevron\u2019s alleged failure to disclose its alleged potential liability. Donziger\u2019s references to the Exxon Valdez and statements about the cost of remediation \u201crelied upon estimates and comparisons that he knew were false or the truth of which he seriously doubted.\u201d Id. at 582 (emphasis added); see also id. at 409 (Donziger admitted in an email to his team that he felt that the SEC investigation he sought was \u201c \u2018bogus.\u2019 \u201d (quoting July 12, 2006 email from Donziger to LAPs\u2019 team members)).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">2. Donziger Causes a Change to Less Probative Tests When the LAPs\u2019 Experts Find Pollution that Likely Was Not Caused by Texaco</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Consistent with Donziger\u2019s insistence that Russell operate on the assumption that all environmental damage had been caused by Texaco, Donziger also sought to cease certain tests that were producing evidence to the contrary. In late 2004, Russell met in New York with Donziger and other leaders of the LAPs\u2019 legal team and reported that scientists at the site inspections were in fact \u201c \u2018finding BTEX, which is benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene; and GRO, which is gasoline range organics,\u201d\u2019 and that those findings were \u201c \u2018much more indicative of contamination from PetroEcuador rather than Texaco because these compounds are volatile and degrade quickly in [a] hot, wet, warm environment such as in the jungle.\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 415 (quoting Russell testimony (emphases ours)). Texaco had not operated in the Concession area since more than a decade earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Following this report, Russell and his team of scientists, at the request of Don-ziger and other LAPs\u2019 team members, \u201c \u2018stopped analyzing for [BTEX and GRO]\u2019 \u201d because their presence suggested \u201c \u2018more recent contamination,\u2019 \u201d implicating \u201c \u2018PetroEcuador rather than Texaco.\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 415 (quoting Russell testimony and Russell November 4, 2004 email to Donziger and others). They \u201c \u2018instead substituted] a less reliable measure^] which was total petroleum hydrocarbons,\u2019 or TPH,\u201d and used methods that could give \u201c \u2018a false positive\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cwere unable to distinguish between TPH attributable to recent activity and activity that occurred a considerable period earlier.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 415 (quoting testimony of Russell).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">3. Donziger Knowingly Submits to the Court Reports that Falsify a LAPs\u2019 Expert\u2019s Conclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">In 2004, Donziger and Russell nominated industrial hygienist Charles Calmbacher to serve as the LAPs\u2019 judicial inspection expert. See Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 412. Calmbacher served in that capacity at the first four judicial inspection sites; he was eventually fired by Donziger after falling ill and failing to meet deadlines set by Donziger and the LAPs\u2019 team. However, Calmbacher insisted that he would write his \u201cperito\"\u2014i.e., expert\u2014report to the court for the inspections in which he had participated because he had an obligation to do so. Calmbacher noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAJ\">\u201cit is highly unusual for a perito [expert] to allow others to contribute to the writing of a report. Comments or review is acceptable, but the perito\u2019s opinion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>findings are final. I therefore have and feel no obligation to allow your team of textile engineers and associated cron[i]es to review or edit my reports. I am assured, as perito of the court, that I am completely within my rights to write and submit my report independent of [t]hose who have nominated me for appointment as perito. My sole obligation is to tell the truth, as I see it, to the court, no matter the consequences for either party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Id. at 413 (quoting Calmbacher October 24, 2004 email to Donziger and Russell (emphases ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Thereafter, Calmbacher prepared two reports. The LAPs\u2019 lawyers in Ecuador edited them, and Calmbacher signed those edited versions because he \u201cagreed with the conclusions reached\u201d and had \u2018\u201cno problem signing [them] because that\u2019s what [he] felt.\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 413 (quoting Calmbacher deposition). However, \u201cthose reports were not the reports that the LAP team eventually filed.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 413. Calmbacher testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-12\">\u201c[w]hat happened after that ... was they asked me to initial some [blank] papers on the corner so [the report] could be printed on that because it had to be initialed. I said, no, I don\u2019t think so. David [Russell] implored ... me to do that, that it was honest, it was fair, it was okay. So I did it. I think it was about 30 pages. And I FedEx\u2019d it down ... I overnighted it. That was the last I\u2019ve heard on the project.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-15\">Id. (quoting Calmbacher deposition testimony (emphases ours)); see also Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 413 n.229 (noting evidence that Donziger was threatening not to pay Calmbacher for the work he had performed if he did not sign, and that \u201cRussell sent an email to Donziger on March 1, 2005\u201d stating \u201cthat he had \u2018communicated [Donziger\u2019s] threat to Calm-bacher,\u2019 and that Russell had \u2018also advised him that it was in his interest to comply by signing the documents and sending them to [Donziger].\u2019 \u201d (quoting Russell March 1, 2005 email to Donziger)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-17\">On February 14 and March 8, 2005, respectively, the LAP team submitted to the Lago Agrio court what purported to be the reports of their nominated expert for the judicial inspections of the Shu-shufindi 48 and Sacha 94 sites. They bore the signatures and initials of, and purported to have been written by, Dr. Calmbacher. The reports found that \u201chighly toxic chemicals\u201d contaminated the area and that TexPet\u2019s remediation was \u201cinadequate or insufficient.\u201d When shown these reports at a deposition several years later, however, Dr. Calmbacher testified: \u201cI did not reach these conclusions and I did not write this report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-21\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 414 (footnotes omitted) (quoting Judicial Inspection Report for Sacha Well 94 and Calmbacher deposition (emphasis ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-22\">Calmbacher had \u201cnever concluded that TexPet had failed to remediate any site or that any site posed a health or environmental risk.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 414 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). The submitted \u201creports were not the reports he wrote and did not reflect his views.\u201d Id'. \u201cThus, someone on the LAP team used the blank pages Calmbacher had initialed and his signature pages to submit over .his name two reports that contained conclusions he did not reach.... [S]omeone on the LAP Ecuadorian legal team revised his draft reports, printed them on the blank pages that Dr. Calm-bacher initialed, and filed them with knowledge of the falsity.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>4. Donziger Secretly Hires Industry Experts To Offer Their Supposedly Neutral Monitoring Services to the Court, But To Disagree With Any Pro-Chevron Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">An inspection site called Sacha-53 was of particular interest to the LAPs because Texaco had performed remediation on it pursuant to its Settlement Agreement with the ROE, and Donziger had expected the test results would provide \u201c \u2018the first definitive scientific proof in the case to put the lie to their claim they remediated.\u2019 \u201d Don-ziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 416 (quoting Don-ziger November 11, 2004 email to other members of the LAPs\u2019 team). When Don-ziger learned, however, \u201cthat the settling experts\u2019 conclusions with respect to Sacha-53 would not be favorable to the LAPs,\u2019\u2019 he attempted to insert \u201coutwardly credible,\u201d supposedly neutral experts into the process, in order to undermine the settling experts\u2019 anticipated conclusion. Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 416. He recruited two new experts: Gustavo Pinto, the president of the Association of Geological, Mining, Petroleum and Environmental Engineers of Ecuador, and Ramiro Fernando Reyes Cisneros (\u201cReyes\u201d), an Ecuadorian petroleum and environmental engineer. Donziger secretly paid Pinto and Reyes \u2014 an amount he characterized as modest but which he admitted may have been $50,-000 \u2014 to pose as \u201cindependent monitors\u201d and to criticize the settling experts\u2019 anticipated Sacha-53 conclusions, without disclosing to Chevron or the court that the LAPs were paying them. See id. at 416-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">' In addition to that fee, it was agreed that these experts could receive a bonus if the LAPs won the case, see id. at 417. Donziger elaborated that the LAPs were \u201c \u2018not paying for time, but for value,\u2019 \u201d id. at 418 (quoting Donziger Notebook). \u201cDon-ziger well understood that the arrangement was improper\u201d; he termed it his \u201c \u2018bargain with the devil.\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 417 (quoting Donziger Notebook (emphasis in Donziger)).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">Donziger\u2019s efforts in this regard proved futile. Judge Germ\u00e1n Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, who presided over the Lago Agrio case from January 2006 until October 2007, declined to appoint monitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">5. Donziger, Anticipating Additional Pro-Chevron Testing Results, Coerces then-Presiding Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez To Cancel Most of the Remaining Site Inspections</p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">The report on Sacha-53 filed by five settling experts in February 2006\u2014of which the LAPs\u2019 team apparently had an advance copy (see Plaintiffs Exhibit (\u201cPX\u201d) 1530 (Pinto and Reyes January 17, 2006 letter to Lago Agrio court, referring to settling experts\u2019 report \u201cdated Feb. 1, 2006\u201d)) \u2014 stated that \u201cTexaco had fully remediated\u201d that site. Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 418. \u201cDonziger characterized the report as \u2018disastrous\u2019 for the LAPs\u2019 team.\u201d Id. (quoting Donziger Notebook).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">Donziger promptly attempted to have Pinto and Reyes, the would-be monitors he had paid (see Part I.B.4 above), submit to the court a report of their own \u201c \u2018establishing]\u2019 \u201d that the settling experts were wrong and were biased in favor of Chevron, and that the settling experts\u2019 report should be disregarded. Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 418-19 (quoting Reyes declaration, the accuracy of which Reyes attested to at his deposition, see Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 416 n.247). However, the report Pinto and Reyes drafted ultimately concluded that the settling experts\u2019 report was sufficient to allow the court to reach its own conclusion, and Donziger instructed them not to file it with the court. See id. at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">Sacha-53 was the first site as to which the court requested a report from the set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tling experts. Seeking to reduce the risk of additional findings unfavorable to the LAPs, Donziger requested that the court cancel 26 of the remaining judicial inspections, characterizing them as unnecessary. Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">However, the LAPs then moved to forgo virtually all the remaining inspections, claiming that the evidence of contamination was clear and abundant; and after further communications from the LAPs\u2019 team, Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez decided to cancel most of the remaining planned judicial inspections, leaving to be performed only four that the LAPs wanted pursued. His decision came about as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">Donziger and the LAP team knew that Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez was in a weakened state. He recently had been accused of \u201ctrading jobs for sex in the court\u201d and was worried about his reputation and perhaps career. They were determined to use that to their advantage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Id. at 421 (footnote omitted) (quoting Don-ziger July 26, 2006 email to Kohn).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Fajardo, a relatively recent law graduate whom Donziger had made the LAPs\u2019 lead Ecuadorian trial counsel, informed Donziger that there was a belief at the court that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs were behind the sexual harassment complaint against Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez. Both Fajardo and Donziger\u2019s close friend Yanza felt that that belief \u2014 though it was erroneous \u2014 could be used to the LAPs\u2019 advantage. Donziger described his response to this information in his Notebook as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">\u201cAt [this] pt I launched into my familiar lecture about how the only way the court will respect us is if they fear us \u2014 and that the only way they will fear us is if they think we have ... control over their careers, their jobs, their reputations \u2014 that is to say, their ability to earn a livelihood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-16\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 421 (quoting Donziger Notebook (emphasis in Donziger)). Donziger decided to exploit the belief that the LAPs were the source of the sexual harassment complaint: \u201c[T]he LAP team \u2018wrote up a complaint against Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, but never filed it, while letting him know we might file it if he does not adhere to' the law and what we need.\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 421 (quoting Donziger Notebook).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-17\">Donziger explained in an email to Kohn that Fajardo then met with the judge, who \u201csaid he is going to accept our request to withdraw the rest of the inspections save the four we still want to do....

Thus, \u201cDonziger knowingly was complicit both in the preparation of a misconduct complaint against Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez and in threatening the judge with the filing of the complaint unless the judge did what the LAPs[] wished him to do.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 421 n.295.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-19\">Faced with this coercion, Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez granted the request to cancel the LAPs\u2019 remaining judicial inspections.

Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez balked, however, because both sides had previously agreed that the court\u2019s global expert would be one of the experts already appointed by the court.

Donziger Has Stratus Fabricate Objections To Be Submitted By the LAPs to the Cabrera Report that Stratus Wrote For the LAPs</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\">In order to enhance the false image of Cabrera\u2019s independence, Stratus proceeded, as instructed by Donziger, to prepare objections to the Cabrera Report for submission to the court by the LAPs. The goal was to create the impression that the LAPs \u201cw[ere] dissatisfied with the Report and that Cabrera had not gone far enough in assessing damages \u2014 notwithstanding the fact that the LAP team, including Stratus, itself had written it.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 444. Thus, \u201chaving written the bulk of the Cabrera Report, Stratus began preparing to ... respond to it on behalf of the LAPs as if the Cabrera Report actually had been written by Cabrera. ...\u201d Id. at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">\u201cThe plan was to maximize the deception. ... Fajardo wrote to the [LAPs\u2019] team the day after the Report was filed,\u201d urging them to respond to inquiries as he had, he., to say that the report is a \u201c \u2018good report,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018includes an item for recovery, but\u2019 \u201d does \u201cnot go[ ] far enough,\u201d and \u201c \u2018we are not happy_I think it is good to maintain a uniform line, PLEASE, WE ARE NOT HAPPY.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 444 (quoting Fajardo April 2, 2008 email to LAPs\u2019 team (emphasis ours)). \u201cThis appearance of dissatisfaction with the Cabrera Report was important because it supported the false pretense that Cabrera had acted independently.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-17\">Cabrera himself later echoed this pretense. He wrote to the Court stating, inter alia,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-18\">\u201cI am an honest man with nothing to hide, and my conduct as an expert in this case has been as professional, impartial and objective as possible, as can be seen from my expert report. The fact that neither of the two parties is fully satisfied with my report is clear evidence of my impartiality....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-21\">Id. at 445 (quoting Cabrera October 8, 2008 letter to the Lago Agrio court (emphasis ours)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-22\">This of course was blatantly false and misleading.... Stratus\u2019 criticism of its own work product that had been submitted over Cabrera\u2019s name[ ]was intended to feed the false impression that Cabrera had been independent. That was a key part of Donziger\u2019s strategy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-23\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-24\">Cabrera reiterated his claim of independence in response to objections by Chevron. He disputed Chevron\u2019s criticisms, saying, inter alia, that everything was \u201c \u2018objective, and deeply impartial.... The entire expert investigation procedure was completed by me personally.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Cabrera February 5, 2009 letter to the Lago Agrio court (first emphasis ours; second emphasis in Donziger)).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-26\">The submission of supposed objections by the LAPs also provided a basis on which Cabrera could increase his damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>assessment, and he did so. His November 2008 supplemental report, in which he purported to respond to the comments and questions submitted by the LAPs, \u201cadded another $11 billion to the initial damages assessment in the Cabrera' Report. This report, just like the one it was supplementing, had been written by Stratus and the LAP team.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 445 (footnote omitted); see, e.g., id. at 457 (\u201cunder the instruction and supervision of Mr. Donziger,\u201d Stratus, having \u201cessentially ... ghostwritten the Cabrera report, then ... act[ed] as experts for the plaintiffs [and] wrote comments to their own work, and then wrote the Cabrera report\u2019s responses to their own comments\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">11. When \u201cCrude\u201d Is Released and Chevron Gets Discovery Revealing the LAPs-Cabrera Collaboration, Donziger Hires New Consultants To \u201cCleanse\u201d the Cabrera Report</p>\n<p id=\"AskZ\">\u201cCrude,\u201d the documentary by filmmaker Joseph Berlinger, commissioned by Don-ziger and featuring him quite prominently, was first released in January 2009. Donziger had given the film crew expansive access to himself, his team, and some of its activities for nearly three years. See Don-ziger, \u25a0 974 F.Supp.2d at 453. \u201cOne scene showed Dr. Carlos Beristain \u2014 a member of Cabrera\u2019s supposedly neutral staff \u2014 working directly with the LAPs and their lawyers, including Donziger.\u201d Id. at 454. Don-ziger, having received an advance copy in December 2008, asked Berlinger to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6m\">delete the Beristain images and other material. Fajardo made the same request to [Berlinger\u2019s cameraman] Bon-figlio, emphasizing that if the scene with Beristain were left in the film, \u201cthe entire case will simply fall apart on us.... Those two guys [Beristain and Adolfo Maldonado, another supposed neutral] must not appear in the documentary at all! Please, remove them from it.

(footnote omitted) (quoting Fajardo December 25, 2008 email to Bonfiglio (emphases ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">Berlinger and Bonfiglio initially did not comply, and at a film festival in January 2009 the film was shown with the Beristain scene. See Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 454. When Fajardo persisted, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-15\">explaining] that the images were \u201cso serious that we could lose everything!,]\u201d Berlinger ultimately removed the Beris-tain images from the scene, and they were not included in the version released on DVD.

(footnotes omitted) (quoting Fajardo January 22, 2009 email to Bonfiglio (first emphasis in Donziger; other emphases ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-18\">The deleted images appeared to confirm Chevron\u2019s suspicion that Cabrera had been neither neutral nor independent. Chevron began to initiate \u00a7 1782 discovery proceedings in the United States, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782 (authorizing orders for testimony or document production for use in a proceeding in a foreign tribunal). First, in federal court in Denver, Colorado, it sought discovery of Stratus\u2019s communications with the LAPs\u2019 team, pointing out that there were similarities between, on one hand, the Cabrera Report, and on the other hand, papers published by Stratus employees and documents produced by Stratus in a mediation proceeding. Chevron argued that discovery was material to the questions of whether Cabrera had written his own report and whether the LAPs had been involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>LAPs\u2019 attorney Prieto urged Donziger not to let the Stratus-related emails be disclosed, stressing that it was \u201c \u2018NOT acceptable for the correspondence, the emails, between Stratus\u2019 \u201d and members of the LAPs\u2019 team \u201c \u2018to be divulged\u2019 Prieto said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">\u201cthe effects are potentially devastating in Ecuador (apart from destroying the proceeding, all of us, your attorneys, might go to jail).... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 461 (quoting Prieto March 30, 2010 email to Donziger, Fajardo, Yanza, and S\u00e1enz (emphasis ours)). Donziger\u2019s efforts notwithstanding, the federal court in Colorado granted Chevron\u2019s request for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Soon thereafter, Chevron also brought a \u00a7 1782 proceeding against Berlinger for discovery of outtakes from \u201cCrude\u201d \u2014 in particular, for footage of Cabrera and members of his team working directly with members of the LAPs\u2019 team. The LAPs opposed, characterizing the Beristain meeting with Donziger as \u201c \u2018innocuous\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018of no relevance to anything,\u2019 \u201d Don-ziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 464 (quoting LAPs\u2019 Memorandum of Law in Opposition to an Application for a \u00a7 1782 Order To Conduct Discovery), in contrast to the desperate efforts made by Donziger and Fajardo to have such scenes removed because \u201cthe images were \u2018so serious that we could lose everything,\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 454 (quoting Fajardo January 22, 2009 email to Bonfiglio (emphasis in Donziger)). Discovery was granted, and Berlinger produced more than 600 hours of raw footage.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">To guard against the possibility that the court-ordered disclosures might lead to the Cabrera Report\u2019s being discredited or stricken, the LAPs\u2019 team devised a plan to \u201ccleanse\u201d the Cabrera Report by having new experts \u201crepackage\u201d that report, proffering alternative grounds for the damages evaluation. Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 461. To gain time for implementation of that process, the LAPs sought to delay production of the Stratus-related emails by moving for a protective order on the ground of attorney-client privilege. In support of the motion, they submitted a declaration by Fajardo (\u201cFajardo Declaration\u201d) that was \u201chighly misleading.\u201d Id. at 462. It acknowledged that the LAPs had delivered materials to Cabrera, but</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYQ\">[i]t failed to mention that Fajardo, with Donziger\u2019s approval, had threatened the judge with a misconduct complaint unless the judge agreed to their demands to cancel the LAPs\u2019 remaining judicial inspections.... [I]t did not mention the March 3, 2007 meeting at which the LAPs laid out the plan for Cabrera\u2019s Report and indicated, in Cabrera\u2019s presence, that the work would be done by them. Nor did it reveal that Stratus and the LAPs\u2019 counsel in fact had written most of the Cabrera Report.... The declaration similarly neglected to report that the LAP[s] \u201cchang[ed] the focus of [Cabrera\u2019s] data at [their] offices.\u201d And it, of course, failed to disclose that the LAPs had made secret payments to Cabrera outside the court process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">Id. at. 462-63 (footnote omitted) (quoting Donziger July 17, 2007 email to Yanza and Fajardo (emphases ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">A subsequent petition filed by Fajardo in the Lago Agrio court (\u201cFajardo Petition\u201d), requesting permission to submit supplementary information to assist the court. in assessing global damages, disclosed a bit more than the Fajardo Declaration, as it admitted that the LAPs had given Cabrera proposed factual findings and economic valuations as to environmental and other damage caused by Texaco. The Fajardo Petition was later filed multiple times in United States courts, with the LAPs representing that it \u201c \u2018fully disclosed\u2019 their relationship with Cabrera.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 464. But the Fajardo Petition too</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">was deceptive. There was no disclosure of the fact that Cabrera was handpicked by Donziger because he would cooperate with the LAPs, that the report was planned and written by the LAPs and Stratus, and that Cabrera \u201cplay[ed] ball\u201d by simply affixing his name to it, acting all the while under the false pretense \u2014 \u25a0 fostered by the LAPs \u2014 that the report was Cabrera\u2019s independent work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Id. at 463-64 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">The Fajardo Petition in the Lago Agrio court was granted, and the LAPs submitted seven \u201ccleansing\u201d reports on September 16, 2010, at least some of which had been reviewed and commented upon by Donziger. See id. at 480. The experts who prepared those reports had not been informed that the Cabrera Report had in fact, without the court\u2019s knowledge, been written by Stratus, working for the LAPs, and the new experts treated the Cabrera Report with deference. See id. at 480-81. Indeed, some of the reports relied on it directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">12. The District Court\u2019s Summary</p>\n<p id=\"A43\">The district court summarized the fraudulent provenance of Cabrera\u2019s reports to the Lago Agrio court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">In the last analysis, the facts concerning the Cabrera Report are crystal clear. The remaining LAP judicial inspections were cancelled, the global expert proposal adopted, and Cabrera appointed in consequence of the coercion of and pressure placed upon Judge Y\u00e1-\u00f1ez. As Donziger admitted in a Crude outtake, Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez \u201cnever would have done [that] had we not really pushed him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-16\">Cabrera was not even remotely independent. He was recruited by Donziger. He was paid under the table out of a secret account above and beyond the legitimate court-approved payments. He was promised work on the remediation for life if the LAPs won. The LAPs gave him an office and life insurance, as well as a secretary who was a girlfriend of one of the LAP team members. Stratus and, to some extent others, wrote the overwhelming bulk of his report and his responses to Chevron\u2019s objections, as well as to the deceitful comments. Stratus had written on its own report. .And, in accordance with Donziger\u2019s plan to ratchet up the pressure on Chevron with a supposedly independent recommendation that Chevron be hit with a multibil-lion dollar judgment, he repeatedly lied to the court concerning his independence and his supposed authorship of the report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-27\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 446 (footnote omitted) (quoting June 13, 2007 \u201cCrude\u201d film clip (emphases ours)). Donziger</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-28\">had chosen Cabrera for the global expert position because Cabrera would cooperate with the LAPs. He and Fajardo procured his appointment by coercing Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez. They had caused Stratus to write all or most of his report and then falsely passed that report off \u2014 both to the court and to the world press \u2014 as the independent work of a neutral, court-selected expert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-29\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 459 n.563. \u201cDonziger was the architect of all that occurred with respect to the Cabrera Report,\u201d id. at 447 n.484; \u201c[h]e knew at all times that his actions were wrongful and illegal,\u201d id. at 448; and \u201che had no illusions about the impropriety of what he and his colleagues had done,\u201d id. at 459 n.563. \u201cIn sum, Donziger knew at every step that what he and the LAP team did with Cabrera was wrong, deceptive, and illegal.\u201d Id. at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>C. The February 14, 2011 Lago Agrio Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Largely because of the Ecuador court\u2019s system of assigning cases to judges for limited periods of time, a total of six judges presided over the Lago Agrio Chevron case from the time it was filed in 2003 until the Judgment was entered in 2011. Three of them figure prominently in the present case; two of them testified at trial. When the case was filed in May 2003, it was assigned to then-Judge Alberto Guerra Bastidas (\u201cGuerra\u201d), and he presided over it until January 2004; Guerra, who was removed from the bench in May 2008 because of misconduct, became an important witness at trial in the present case. From January 2006 until October 2007, Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, as discussed in Parts I.B.4.I.B.6. above, was presiding. Nicol\u00e1s Zam-brano was a judge from July 2008 until he was removed from the bench for misconduct in February 2012. Zambrano first presided over the Lago Agrio Chevron case for a four-month term beginning in September 2009; he again presided over the litigation beginning in October 2010 and issued the $17.292 billion Judgment in February 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The Lago Agrio Judgment awarded the LAPs $8.646 billion in damages for at least seven categories of injury, including harm to the environment and human health, and another $8.646 billion unless Chevron issued a public apology within 15 days. See Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 481. In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">the Judgment ordered that the LAPs establish a trust for the benefit of the ADF \u201cor the person or persons that it designates\u201d and that Chevron pay the damages awarded to that trust. It directed that the trust\u2019s board of directors be made up of the \u201crepresentatives of the Defense Front,\u201d he., the ADF, and provided that the board would choose the contractors who would perform the remediation. Thus, the Judgment did exactly what the complaint had asked \u2014 it put the ADF in complete control of any proceeds of the Judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Id. at 481-82 (footnotes omitted) (quoting Lago Agrio Judgment (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">In explaining the Judgment, the court \u201cprofessed to disclaim reliance on the Cabrera Report.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 481.

(quoting Lago Agrio Judgment). The court also noted some of Chevron\u2019s charges of misconduct on the part of Donziger but said they were not attributable to the LAPs because the LAPs had not granted Donziger a formal power of attorney. See Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 481.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">Chevron issued no apology.

Findings by the District Court as to the Sources and Authorship of the Lago Agrio Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Zambrano, who was the judge presiding over the case when the Lago Agrio Judgment was issued, testified in the present action that he had written the single-spaced, 188-page Lago Agrio Judgment without any assistance from anyone other than an 18-year-old typist to whom he dictated the entire decision. The Judgment and the clarification order stated that the court had not relied on the Cabrera Report. And Zambrano testified that he relied only on evidence in the record. The district court found that each of these representations was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">1. The Lago Agrio Judgment Drew Heavily on the Cabrera Report</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Notwithstanding the disclaimers in the Lago Agrio Judgment and clarification order, the district court found that the principal aspects of that Judgment were drawn from the Cabrera Report. For example, of the $8.646 billion awarded for, inter alia, harm to the environment and human health, $5.4 billion was awarded for remediation of soil at \u201c \u2018880 [waste] pits\u2019 \u201d in the Concession area, supposedly \u201c \u2018proven through aerial photographs\u2019 \u201d in \u201c \u2018the record,\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 682 n.53 (quoting Lago Agrio Judgment). However, an expert witness opined that it would have been exceedingly difficult for the Judgment\u2019s author to glean that exact number of pits from those aerial photographs because the black and white images were \u201cof such low resolution that it would have been \u2018difficult for even an experienced photogrammetrist to identify and map pits,\u2019 much less someone with no special training or equipment.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 684 (footnote omitted) (quoting expert trial testimony). (See also Part I.D.2. below re Zambrano\u2019s lack of assistance and lack of civil-case experience.) Indeed, enhanced resolution of some of the photographs in the Lago Agrio record revealed that some of what were identified by the Lago Agrio decision as waste pits were in fact \u201ctrees, above-ground tanks, and other objects.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 684 n.65. Thus, the district court found that, given the quality of the aerial photographs in the record, it was \u201cimpossible\u201d that those photographs were the source of the Lago Agrio Judgment\u2019s conclusion that remediation was required in 880 pits. Id. at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">The Cabrera Report, on the other hand, provided a source for exactly 880 pits: It targeted 916 pits for remediation (the number that appeared \u201cin a spreadsheet produced by Stratus, upon which [the relevant Cabrera Report chart] likely was based\u201d). Id. at 683 n.58, 684. But 36 of those pits \u201ceither had been operated by PetroEcuador,\u201d rather than Texaco, or had shown \u201cno impact and for [them], therefore, no remediation was necessary. With those pits excluded, the net pit count in the Cabrera Report was 880.\u201d Id. at 684 (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted (emphases ours)). The district court noted that the LAPs had been desperate to \u201ccleanse\u201d the Cabrera Report and had submitted seven purportedly supplementary expert reports; yet in support of pit count, their penultimate alegato \u2014 or written summation \u2014 to the Lago Agrio court used the Cabrera Report\u2019s 916 figure and cited nothing other than the Cabrera Report. The district court thus found that it was \u201cimpossible that the pit count in the Judgment came from anything but the Cabrera Report.\u201d Id. at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">As another example, the Lago Agrio Judgment awarded $150 million for pota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ble water damage. The Cabrera Report had recommended in that category an award of $428 million; the report of a Chevron expert cited in the Judgment characterized the Cabrera Report as recommending an award of $430 million and criticized the recommendation as grossly exaggerated. The Lago Agrio court agreed that the Cabrera Report\u2019s recommendation was too high, as it found that only 35% of the people in the Concession area lacked potable water. The district court inferred that the author of the Lago Agrio decision simply took 35% of $430 million, which came to $150,500,000, and rounded it to an even $150 million. Noting that no other evidentiary basis for the $150 million award was cited in the Judgment, the district court found that \u201cthe figure awarded was derived directly from the ... recommendation contained in the Cabrera Report.\u201d Id. at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The district court also found that the Lago Agrio Judgment relied on the Cabrera Report by relying on one of the supplemental \u201ccleansing\u201d reports submitted by the LAPs, authored by Dr. Lawrence Barnthouse, to award $200 million for restoration of flora and fauna in the Concession area. This flowed from \u201cthe Judgment's] recognition] that \u2018Dr. Barnthouse testified that he reviewed expert Cabrera\u2019s report, but did not prepare a damage report himself.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Lago Agrio Judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Thus, the Court found that a total of $5.75 billion of the $8.646 billion non-punitive damages awarded was based on the Cabrera Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">In sum, the Court finds that the Judgment, although it ... purported not to rely on the Cabrera Report, did so rely at least (1) for the pit count \u2014 which drove its largest damages award [$5.4 billion], (2) for the potable water damages award [$150 million], and (3) by virtue of its reliance on the Barnthouse report [$200 million]. The Court thus finds that the Cabrera Report was material to the Judgment at least in those respects, which collectively were very important indeed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">2. Then-Presiding Judge Zambrano Did Not Write the Lago Agrio Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">The district court also found that \u201cZam-brano did not write the Judgment, at least in any material part.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 482. Zambrano, a judge on the Lago Agrio court only since July 30, 2008, had been a prosecutor but had had little experience in civil matters. When Zambrano arrived on the court, Guerra had been removed from the bench for misconduct, see id. at 505, and \u201c[h]e and Guerra entered into an agreement by which Zambrano paid Guerra $1,000 per month to assist Zambrano in drafting his \u2018writs and rulings\u2019 in civil cases,\u201d id. (quoting Guerra trial testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">Zambrano first presided over the Lago Agrio Chevron case for a four-month period beginning in September 2009. Zambra-no \u201cadmitted ... that \u2018Guerra helped [him] with the drafting of orders in [Zambrano\u2019s] cases,\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 506 (quoting Zambrano trial testimony). Although Zambrano testified that the arrangement did not include the Chevron case, see Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 506\u2014 and the district court did not find that the LAPs had an arrangement with Zambrano during that first period in which Zambrano presided, see id. at 513 \u2014 the court found that \u201cthe LAPs, with Donziger\u2019s authorization, paid Guerra during this period to ghostwrite Zambrano\u2019s orders on the Chevron case and to do so to their advantage,\u201d id. at 513 n.983 (emphases added). (See Part I.D.4. below.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Zambrano began his second period of presiding \u25a0 over the Lago Agrio Chevron case in October 2010, and he issued the Judgment four months later. In a declaration submitted to the district court in the present action before the start of trial, \u201cZambrano stated: \u2018I confirm that I am the only author of the judgment that I issued on February 14, 2011.... I did not receive support or assistance from Dr. Alberto Guerra or from any other person....\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 485 (quoting Zambrano March 28, 2013 declaration (emphasis in Donziger)).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The district court found it difficult to credit this claim, both logistically and substantively. To begin with, the court had substantial doubts that Zambrano had been able, in four months,'to review the more than 200,000 pages of documents in the record and write the 188-page, single-spaced Judgment without any help from any other person. The Judgment was \u201cof considerable complexity [and] purport[ed] to rely on innumerable pieces of evidence, many of them lengthy documents them-' selves.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 487. Indeed, Zambrano\u2019s categorical statement that he had received no help from anyone was subsequently altered twice. First, after Guerra testified at trial that Zambrano had in fact had the daughter of a friend type court orders, Zambrano stated that he had received typing assistance on the Lago Agrio Judgment from a Ms. Calva, an 18-year-old who was not an employee of the court and whom Zambrano personally paid $15 a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The court also found it difficult to credit Zambrano\u2019s \u201cadamant\u201d testimony that he had dictated the entire decision to Calva and \u201c \u2018never show[ed] Ms. Calva any document,\u2019 \u201d id. at 486 (quoting Zambrano trial testimony), from which she could type complicated strings of alphanumeric sequences with dashes, periods, semicolons, and odd parentheses, such as the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">\u201c3142 y 466 en Auca 1 en AU01-PIT1-SD2-SU2-R(220-240 cm)~sv y AU01-A1-SDl-SUl-R(60-100cm)--sv; 2450 y 876 en Cononaco 6 en CON6-A2S E 1 - - s v y CON6-PITl-SDl-DUl-R(l 60-260cm)--sv; 154.152,73.6325,-70.4021 en Shushufindi 18, en SSF18-A1-SU2-R(0.0m)~sv, SSF18-PIT2-SD1-SUl-R(1.5-2.0m)~sv; y SSF18-A1-SU1-R(0.0 m)-sv),\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 486 (quoting Lago Agrio Judgment). \u201cEven assuming that Zambrano actually prepared the Judgment, as he claims, he certainly would not have dictated these pre-existing documents to Ms. Calva rather than giving them to her with markings indicating exactly what he wanted her to copy.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 486-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Second, after initially \u201ctestifying at trial] that \u2018nobody helped [him] do the research [he] needed to do to write and author the judgment,\u2019 \u201d id. at 485-86 (quoting Zambrano trial testimony), Zambrano slightly modified that representation as well. \u201c[W]hen he later was asked how he had found [the] French, British, Australian, and American authorities that were cited in the Judgment,\u201d Zambrano said that Calva \u201c \u2018would look for a specific subject,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018she would print them out so that I would read them later.\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 486 (quoting Zambrano trial testimony). The court refused to credit this testimony, however, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjV\">there was no credible explanation of how Calva, as Zambrano claimed, found French, British, Australian, and American legal authorities on the Internet given that there is no evidence that she had any legal training or spoke French or English,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 486; and there was no explanation as to how Zambrano <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>himself would have been able to understand those decisions, given that he had \u201cno legal training in the common law,\u201d had \u201cvery little experience with civil matters in Ecuador,\u201d and \u201creads neither French nor English,\u201d id.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">More importantly, the district court found it difficult to reconcile Zambrano\u2019s claim that he had written the Judgment himself, and without any substantive assistance, with his responses to basic questions about the substance of the decision. Among other things, Zambrano could not recall \u201cthe identity of a substance that the Judgment described as the most powerful carcinogenic agent it considered,\u201d he., benzene, id. at 484. Nor could he recall the name of the \u201csubstance for the presence of which the Judgment awarded $5 billion.\u201d Id. That substance was TPH, a term that appeared in the Judgment more than 35 times. \u201cBut when Zambrano was asked at his deposition what TPH stands for\u201d (it stands for total petroleum hydrocarbons) \u201che testified that \u2018it pertains to hydrocarbons, but I don\u2019t recall exactly.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Zambrano trial testimony). In addition, the English word \u201cworkover\u201d appeared in the Judgment twice; but \u201cZambrano testified that he does not speak English, did not know what \u2018workover\u2019 means, and could not explain why the word was in the Judgment,\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 484 (footnotes omitted) (quoting Zambrano trial testimony). Zambrano also could not recall \u201cthe source of the most important statistical data\u201d used in the Judgment, or \u201cthe theory of causation on which the Judgment relied.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In light of Zambrano\u2019s \u201castonishing[ ] unfamiliar[ity] with important aspects of [the Judgment\u2019s] contents,\u201d along with the \u201cevasive[ness] and internal ] inconsistencies]\u201d in his trial testimony and the differences between his trial testimony and \u201chis deposition just days before,\u201d the district court found that \u201cZambrano did not write the Judgment issued under his name.\u201d Id. at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">3. The Lago Agrio Judgment Was Written by the LAPs</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Having found that Zambrano did not write the Lago Agrio Judgment, the district court found \u2014 based in part on comparisons of the Judgment against internal LAPs\u2019 documents, which were produced in discovery in the present action but were nowhere to be found in the Lago Agrio Chevron case record \u2014 that the Lago Agrio Judgment had been written by the team representing the LAPs.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">a. The Judgment Copied Documents That Were Not in the Court Record but Were LAPs\u2019 Internal Documents</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">The district court noted that the record in the Lago Agrio Litigation consisted of the documents duly filed with the clerk of court; that \u201c[c]onsideration of any other materials, including any materials provided to a judge or court official informally or ex parte, would have been improper under Ecuadorian law\u201d; and that Zambrano testified that \u201che considered only documents that were in the court record.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 492. Nonetheless, there were parts of the Lago Agrio Judgment that had no foundation in the court record.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">Those parts were present, however, in internal LAPs\u2019 documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-14\">[Portions of eight documents produced by defendants in discovery- \u2014 {LAPs\u2019] internal work product \u2014 appear in haec verba or in substance in the Judgment that Zambrano claims to have written himself. These documents appear nowhere in the Lago Agrio court record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adb\">Id. (footnote omitted) (emphases added); see id. at 483 (\u201coverwhelming and unrefut-ed evidence establishes] that portions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>at least eight of the LAP team\u2019s internal work product documents\u201d that \u201cnever were filed with the Lago Agrio court or made part of the official case record\u201d \u201cappear verbatim or in substance in the Judgment\u201d); id. at 651-81 (showing comparisons).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Parts of six of those eight LAPs\u2019 internal documents produced in discovery in the present action \u2014 a memorandum, an expert report, index summaries, a Fajardo email, and a LAPs\u2019 alegato draft \u2014 \u201cappear verbatim or in substance on 30 pages of the Judgment.\u201d Id. at 492. Expert witnesses, whose testimony the district court credited, made \u201cside-by-side comparisons\u201d of these unfiled LAPs\u2019 internal documents against passages in the Lago Agrio Judgment and found numerous strings of identical or virtually identical text that were not explainable either as set phrases or by chance. Id. at 493 (internal quotation marks omitted). They noted \u201c39 examples of plagiarized text from the[se six pieces of the] Ecuadorian plaintiffs\u2019 unfiled work product that appear[ ] in the [Lago Agrio] Judgment.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The district court noted that some of the copied text was \u201con important issues, including the question whether Chevron could be held liable for alleged pre-acquisition torts of Texaco.\u201d Id. It found that \u201c[t]here is no plausible explanation for their presence in the Judgment except that whoever wrote the Judgment copied parts of them.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">A seventh LAPs\u2019 -internal document, a 2009 memorandum written for the LAPs\u2019 team by one of its interns named Moodie, was also used in the Lago Agrio Judgment, which replicated certain of the memorandum\u2019s errors, inapposite doctrines, and inaccurate attributions. For example, the Lago Agrio Judgment\u2019s causation analysis relied on a common-law \u201c \u2018substantial factor\u2019 test\u201d that is used in California, a reliance that is \u25a0 a puzzlement since Ecuador is a civil-law country and since that test \u201cis outdated and generally applied only in asbestos cases.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 493-94. The \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test, however, was a subject of Mood-ie\u2019s memorandum, see id., and the Moodie memorandum and the Lago Agrio Judgment \u201ccontain identical strings\u201d of language, id. at 494. \u201cNothing in the Moodie Memo,\u201d however, \u201cappears anywhere in the Lago Agrio Record.\u201d Id. at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">In addition, both the Judgment and Moodie\u2019s memorandum discuss the concept that causation can be established by a process of inference from provable facts in combination, even if each item of proof individually does not show more than a possibility, a proposition that is well established throughout the common-law world and that is \u201cusually attributed ... to the American text, Wigmore on Evidence 3rd Edition, paragraph 2497.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 495 (internal quotation marks omitted). But, peculiarly, the Lago Agrio Judgment attributed that proposition to Australian law \u2014 as had Moodie\u2019s memorandum. See id. American and Australian expert witnesses also identified other errors that are \u201ccommon to both the Moodie Memo and the Judgment.\u201d Id. The district court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">[t]he fundamental point ... is not that the Judgment came to mistaken or odd conclusions about the law of the United States or Australia. It instead is that both the Moodie Memo and the Judgment made the same mistakes in characterizing them. Nothing in the Moodie Memo appears anywhere in the Lago Agrio Record. Thus, the likelihood that the Judgment independently would contain exactly the same errors in characterizations as appear in the Moodie Memo is almost zero. The Court finds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>that parts of the Moodie Memo were copied into and paraphrased in the Judgment. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Id. (footnote omitted) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The eighth LAPs\u2019 internal document used in the Lago Agrio Judgment was an internal database maintained by defendant Selva Viva Selviva CIA, LTDA (\u201cSelva Viva\u201d), an entity formed by Donziger and Yanza in 2004 as a funding vehicle for the Lago Agrio Litigation, see id. at 399. The record in the Lago Agrio court contained the laboratory test results of samples taken from the judicial inspection sites (the \u201cFiled Lab Results\u201d). The Lago Agrio Judgment purported to discuss these reported results; but there were several notable differences between the Filed Lab Results and the Judgment, differences traceable to the database maintained by Selva Viva, which was \u201ca series of spreadsheets that were produced to Chevron in discovery, but not filed with the Lago Agrio court,\u201d id. at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">One indication that the Judgment relied on Selva Viva materials is the form of its citations to sample results, each of which consists of a series of letters and numbers, with many such citations in the Judgment \u201cend[ing] with the suffix \u2018 \u2014 sv\u2019 or \u2018 \u2014 tx.\u2019 Not one of the Filed Lab Results contained an \u2018 \u2014 sv\u2019 or \u2018 \u2014 tx\u2019 suffix but the Selva Viva Database did.\u201d Id. at 496 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). In addition, the Judgment\u2019s formatting \u2014 including the use of dashes and underscoring and the placement of parentheses \u2014 in various naming conventions differed from that used in the Filed Lab Results, but matched the formatting used in the Selva Viva database. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Moreover, reliance by the authors of the Judgment on the Selva Viva materials resulted in a variety of substantive errors. For example, although the Filed Lab Results correctly identified one of Chevron\u2019s experts, Fernando Morales, as the submitter of a particular sample result, the Judgment misidentified the Chevron expert who submitted that sample result as John Connor. The Selva Viva materials likewise misidentified Fernando Morales as John Connor. See id. at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">More importantly, reliance on the Selva Viva materials led to serious errors in the Judgment\u2019s findings as to the presence or concentrations of injurious substances in the inspection-site samples. For example, where a test did not reveal the presence of the subject substance, the Filed Lab Results generally reported the result by using a less-than symbol (\u201c&lt;\u201d) followed by a number that indicated the minimum concentration of that substance that could be detected by the particular equipment and testing method being used. Thus, \u201c&lt;\u201d before a number meant that the number was the minimum detectable level and that the test revealed less than that level. See generally Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 497. The Judgment found that \u201c \u2018alarming levels of mercury have been found in the Sacha, Shushuf\u00edndi and Lago Agrio fields, where we found several samples reaching 7 mg/ kg.,\u2019 \u201d and it attributed those findings to samplings taken by two of \u201c \u2018the experts ... in the judicial inspection^] at\u2019 \u201d those three sites. Id. at 496-97 (quoting Lago Agrio Judgment (emphases ours)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGj\">In fact, however, the Filed Lab Results did not report that mercury levels reached 7 mg/kg in these samples. They reported levels of \u201c&lt;7\u201d \u2014 he., no detectable mercury- \u2014 -for every one of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 497 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">The source of the Judgment\u2019s error in finding elevated mercury levels was its use of the Selva Viva database, which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUS\">separated the \u201c&lt;\u201d sign from the following value by placing each in its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>column. The column containing the \u201c&lt;\u201d sign was labeled \u201cflag.\u201d The author or authors of the Judgment thus used the Selva Viva Database rather than the Filed Lab Results, ignored or did not understand the \u201cflag\u201d column, 'and wrongly reported each of these test results as showing a concentration of mercury of 7 mg/kg.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Id. (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Another error in the Judgment traceable to its use of the Selva Viva materials was its finding that the concentration of a certain injurious compound, allegedly found at some specific sites, was \u2018\u201c3142 mg/kg.,\u2019 \u201d he., \u201cmilligrams per kilogram.\u201d Id. (quoting Lago Agrio Judgment (emphases in Donziger)); see also Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 497 n.874 (\u201cA milligram is one-thousandth of a gram. A concentration of one milligram is one one-thousandth of a gram per 1,000 grams of sample.\u201d (emphases added)). The Selva Viva database reported at least some of its test results in milligrams per kilogram. See id. at 497-98. The Filed Lab Results for these samples, however, reported their findings in \u201cmicrograms per kilogram,\u201d he., in millionths of a gram per kilogram, id. at 497 (emphasis in original). Therefore, while the Judgment found that the substance\u2019s \u201c \u20183142 mg/kg.\u2019 \u201d concentration \u201c \u2018exceeded] any standard of reasonable tolerance,\u2019 \u201d see id. (quoting Lago Agrio Judgment (emphasis in Donziger)), its finding of 3,142 \u201cmilligrams\u201d per kilogram was 1,000 times the concentration reported in the Filed Lab Results. \u201cThus, the Judgment could not have obtained the results it reported from the Filed Lab Results. It had to have copied them from the Selva Viva Database.... \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The district court noted that in analyzing these aspects of the Lago Agrio Judgment, it was not reviewing the substantive merits of the Judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjT\">The point is that these particular characteristics of the Judgment are inconsistent with the evidence in the Lago Agrio record upon which the Judgment purportedly relied, but appear in the Selva Viva Database, which is not in that record. This goes directly to the question of the authorship of the Judgment. At least in these respects, the Judgment was copied from LAP material outside the record, and Zambrano\u2019s testimony was untrue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">Id. at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">b. The LAPs\u2019 Team Prepared the judgment, Beginning Work on It as Early as mid-2009</p>\n<p id=\"b135-18\">As described in Part I.B.ll. above, in the wake of the January 2009 public showing of \u201cCrude\u201d containing a scene in which members of the LAPs\u2019 team were conferring with one of Cabrera\u2019s scientists, a scene that Fajardo implored the filmmaker to delete because it could cause the LAPs to \u201close everything,\u201d Donziger and the LAPs\u2019 team were anxious not only to have the judgment be in their favor but also to have it not rely to any great extent on the Cabrera Report. They needed to control the content of the judgment. However, it is unlawful under Ecuadorian law for parties to submit proposed judgments to a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-19\">In mid-2009, Fajardo gave a LAPs\u2019 team intern named \u201cParker \u2018a research assignment for our legal alegato and the judgment, but without him knowing what he is doing.\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 500 (quoting Fajardo June 5, 2009 email to Donziger (emphases ours)). Fajardo\u2019s ensuing email to Donziger was more circumspect, as it referred to the LAPs\u2019 alegato, followed by \u201cand\u201d and an ellipsis. See Don-ziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 500 (citing Fajardo June 18, 2009 email to Donziger that at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>tached a recent court decision that Fajardo stated would \u201c \u2018serve us well for our alega-to and ... \u2019 \u201d (ellipsis in email) (emphasis ours)). The district court found these emails</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">suggestive. The distinction drawn between the alegato \u2014 he., the written closing argument in an Ecuadorian litigation \u2014 and the judgment in the email about Parker indicates that Fajardo\u2019s reference to \u201cthe judgment\u201d meant exactly what it said. Parker was to do research for preparation of a judgment, but was not to be told the purpose of the assignment. Moreover, defendants have advanced no reason why it was important to keep Parker in the dark, save for the logical inference that he really was working on a judgment that could not properly have been submitted to the Lago Agrio court. Likewise, the strategically placed ellipsis at the end of the quoted sentence from the June 18 email implies that Fajardo knew that Donziger would know from the June 5 email that the ellipsis referred to the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APO\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 500 (footnote omitted) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">By early to mid-2010, even as their newly hired scientists worked toward \u201ccleansing\u201d the Cabrera Report, id. at 500 n.893, 501, Donziger and the LAPs \u201cwere deeply concerned\u201d that the Lago Agrio court might rule against them because it \u201cdiscredited [the Cabrera Report] as the work of the LAPs\u2019 consultants, Stratus,\u201d or that that \u201ccourt, even assuming it ruled in their favor, might rely on the Cabrera Report if left to its own devices,\u201d which could \u201cdiscredit\u201d its decision, id. at 500.

One problem in attracting new investors \u2014 and in preserving the prospects of reward for the LAPs and their team \u2014 was a perceived ambiguity in Ecuador\u2019s Environmental Management Act (\u201cEMA\u201d), Article 43 of which could require the judge in an action such as the Lago Agrio Chevron case to order the defendant to pay the damages to the community directly affected and to order the defendant to pay the plaintiffs only ten percent of the value of damages. See id. at 528.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-25\">Writing the decision precisely as they wished and securing Zambrano\u2019s signature on it would have solved or, at least gone far toward solving, both the Cabrera Report and Article 43 problems. The disclaimer of reliance on the Cabrera Report offered the best hope for the first. Obtaining a judgment providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>that all of the damages would be payable to the ADF, as the Judgment ultimately did, would have eliminated the EMA Article 43 concern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Id. (emphasis in original). Plainly there was no lack of opportunity for the LAPs to have the judgment written as they wished. \u201cThe LAPs previously had availed themselves of Guerra\u2019s ghostwriting efforts when Zambrano was on the case for the first time.\u201d Id. (See Part I.D.4.a. below.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The district court also found that \u201c[t]he probability that the LAPs drafted the judgment draws strength\u201d from the way in which Donziger equivocated when asked the question in his deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">\u201cQ. Did the Lago Agrio plaintiff team at any time develop a proposed judgment for the Lago Agrio case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">A. I don\u2019t believe so. I don\u2019t, know. It is possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 501 (quoting Donziger deposition testimony). Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ada\">Donziger, almost in the same breath, testified that he (1) believed that the LAPs had not prepared a proposed judgment, (2) did not know whether they had prepared a proposed judgment, and (3) thought it possible that they h\u00e1d prepared a proposed judgment. But this deposition took place only five months after the Judgment was issued. Chevron already had suggested that the Judgment, like the Cabrera Report, had been ghostwritten by the LAPs, or at least that the judge received \u201csecret assistance\u201d from the plaintiffs\u2019 team in writing it. So Chevron\u2019s suggestion that the LAPs had ghostwritten the Judgment, the Court finds, was in Donziger\u2019s mind when this deposition was taken. Given his lead role in the litigation and the emails discussed above, it is most unlikely that he did not know whether the LAPs had prepared a proposed judgment. If they had not, the easy and truthful answer would have been that they had not done so. Period. Indeed, the fact that Donziger obfuscated \u2014 that he quickly changed his answer to this very simple question from \u201cI don\u2019t believe so\u201d to \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d to \u201c[i]t is possible\u201d \u2014 suggests that Donziger knew quite a bit more than he was willing to say and that he did not say what he knew because it would have been damaging.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-22\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 501 (footnote omitted) (quoting Donziger deposition testimony (emphases ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-23\">In all the circumstances, the district court found \u201cthat the LAPs wrote the Judgment in its entirety or in major part and that Zambrano made little or no contribution apart from his signature and perhaps some light editing designed to make it read more like other decisions he had signed in this and other cases.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-24\">4. The LAPs Bribed Zambrano To Sign the Judgment They Wrote</p>\n<p id=\"b137-26\">The district court found that the LAPs bribed Zambrano to allow them to write the Judgment in the Lago Agrio Chevron case (or \u201cChevron case\u201d) and that this bribe was facilitated by Guerra. Guerra so testified at trial. Although the district court did not credit all of Guerra\u2019s testimony as to the relationship between Zambra-no and the LAPs, see, e.g., Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 503 (noting \u201csubstantial credibility issues with respect to the testimony of Guerra, Zambrano, and Donziger\u201d); id. at 505 (\u201call three of ... these witnesses testified in ways that, if believed, would advance their own interests, economic and personal\u201d), it found ample circumstantial evidence to support its conclusion that \u201cGuerra told the truth regarding the bribe and the essential fact as to who wrote the Judgment,\u201d and \u201cthat the LAPs bribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Zambrano and wrote the Judgment in their favor,\u201d id. at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">a. The Relationships Among Guerra,</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Zambrano, and the LAPs</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Many of Zambrano\u2019s decisions in civil cases were written by someone other than Zambrano. \u201cZambrano admitted that he and Guerra had a close relationship that continued after Guerra was removed from the court and after Zambrano became a judge\u201d in mid-2008. Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 506 (footnote omitted). In an \u201carrangement [that] began in late 2008 or early 2009 ... before there was any immediate prospect of Zambrano being assigned the Chevron case,\u201d id. at 507, \u201cGuerra drafted court decisions in civil cases over which Zambrano presided,\u201d id. at 503. \u201cZambrano paid him for his ghostwriting services,\u201d id.; see also id. at 506 (noting that with respect to the period \u201cDecember 22, 2010 through November 28, 2011,\u201d the hard drive on Guerra\u2019s computer contained \u201cdrafts of 105 rulings issued by the Lago Agrio court in cases unrelated to the Chevron case.... At least 101 of the 105 draft rulings were issued by then judge Zambra-no or in cases assigned to him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">During Zambrano\u2019s first tenure as pre-sider over the Chevron ease, which began in October 2009, Guerra also ghostwrote several orders for Zambrano in the Chevron case. A forensic examination of the hard drive on Guerra\u2019s computer revealed \u201cnine drafts of orders that Zambrano issued in the Lago Agrio Chevron case between October 21, 2009 and February 17, 2010.\u201d Id. at 509. Guerra testified that during that first period of Zambrano\u2019s presiding over the Chevron case, he had struck the ghostwriting deal with Fajardo and Donziger, and for those decisions he was being paid by the LAPs. His agreement with the LAPs was evidenced by communications among Donziger, Fajardo, and other members of the LAPs\u2019 team beginning in mid-September 2009, which, using codes \u2014 as was their custom, see id. at 428, 510 n.960 \u2014 referred to Guerra as the \u201c \u2018puppeteer\u2019 \u201d and to Zambrano as the \u201c \u2018puppet.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 510 (quoting Fajardo September 15, 2009 email to Donziger, Prieto, Yanza, and others re \u201cPUPPETEER\u201d stating, inter alia, \u201c \u2018The puppeteer is pulling the string and the puppet is returning the package\u2019 \u201c \u2018it\u2019s pretty safe that there won\u2019t be anything to worry about\u2019 \u201d (emphasis ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The ghostwriting deal between Guerra and the LAPs\u2019 team was further confirmed by bank records and additional emails. See, e.g., Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 509-10 (describing \u201cGuerra\u2019s account statements and deposit slips confirm[ing] -that in each of October, November, and December 2009, and February 2010, $1,000 was deposited into Guerra\u2019s [bank] account,\u201d two of those four deposits being made by a person identified by Donziger as \u201can employee of Selva Viva at the time each deposit was made\u201d); id. at 510-11 &amp; nn.964-966 (noting a Fajardo October 27, 2009 email to Donziger and Yanza stating that \u201c \u2018[t]he puppeteer won\u2019t move his puppet unless the audience pays him something,\u2019 \u201d an October 29, 2009 withdrawal of $1,000 from a Selva Viva bank account, and a deposit of that amount on the same day into Guerra\u2019s bank account); id. at 511 (noting a November 26, 2009 withdrawal of $1,000 from a Selva Viva bank account, a November 27, 2009 deposit of $1,000 into Guerra\u2019s bank account, and a Yanza November 27, 2009 email to Donziger stating that \u201c \u2018the budget is higher in relation to the previous months, since we are paying the puppeteer\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">b. Zambrano\u2019s Agreement With the LAPs</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">By September 2010, Zambrano and Guerra knew that the Chevron case would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>reassigned to Zambrano. Guerra, who had maintained contact with the LAPs\u2019 team, sent Donziger a message that discussed another matter, but that \u201cclosed with the statement that he would \u2018support the matter of Pablo Fajardo so it will come out soon and well,\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 514 (quoting Guerra September 5, 2010 email to Donziger (emphasis ours)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">Guerra testified that the only business Guerra then had with Fajardo was the Lago Agrio [Chevron] case.... Thus, his message was an assurance to Don-ziger that he would continue to^ assist the LAPs with respect to the case so that it would \u201ccome out soon and well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 514 (quoting Guerra trial testimony). \u201cDonziger did not reply to Guerra directly, but Fajardo later told Guerra that Donziger had received the email and was looking into the matter.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In the meantime, at Zambrano\u2019s request, Guerra pursued the prospect of a deal with Chevron, viewed as the deepest pocket. He asked an intermediary to propose to Chevron\u2019s attorneys that Chevron write the final judgment in the case in exchange for payment to Zambrano and Guerra. The intermediary informed Guerra that the attorneys had declined. See id.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">Zambrano ... then suggested that Guerra approach the LAPs\u2019 representative with essentially the same proposition\u2014 \u201cthat they could obtain a verdict in their favor, in exchange for a payment of at least USD $500,000 to Mr. Zambrano; and for whatever amount [Guerra] could negotiate or agree to for [him]self.\u201d Guerra then took the offer to Fajardo, who allegedly was enthusiastic but said that he had to discuss it with Donziger. Days later, Guerra said, he received a call from Fajardo, who asked him to a meeting with himself, Donziger, and Yanza.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">Id. (footnotes omitted) (quoting Guerra trial testimony (emphases ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-17\">At the ensuing meeting, Guerra summarized the proposal and, in response to questions, Guerra assured Donziger that he could trust Zambrano to rule in the LAPs\u2019 favor if the payment were made. Although Donziger appeared interested in the deal, he ultimately replied that the LAPs did not then have, that sum of money. See Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 514. Some time later, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArP\">Zambrano informed Guerra that he had been in direct contact with Fajardo and that \u201cthe Plaintiffs\u2019 representatives had agreed to pay him USD $500,000 from whatever money they were to collect from the judgment, in exchange for allowing them to write the judgment in the Plaintiffs\u2019 favor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-19\">Id. at 515 (quoting Guerra trial testimony). Zambrano promised to share some of that money with Guerra. See Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 515; id. at 558 (noting \u201cclear and convincing evidence that Zambrano was corrupted by Donziger and the LAPs,\u201d as \u201cFajardo \u2014 with Donziger\u2019s approval \u2014 agreed to pay Zambrano $500,000 out of proceeds of the Judgment in exchange for Zambrano deciding the Lago Agrio case in the LAPs\u2019 favor and signing a decision provided by the LAPs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-20\">c. The LAPs-Written Judgment, Lightly Edited by Guerra</p>\n<p id=\"b139-22\">Guerra testified that about two weeks before the Judgment was issued in February 2011, he went to Zambrano\u2019s apartment where he met with Zambrano and Fajardo. \u201c \u2018Zambrano gave [Guerra] a draft of the judgment so that [Guerra] could revise it.\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 515 (quoting Guerra trial testimony). Zambrano \u201ctold Guerra that the LAPs\u2019 attorneys had written the judgment and delivered it -to him, and it was then Guer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ra\u2019s job to \u2018work on the document to fine-tune and polish it so it would have a more legal framework.\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 515 (quoting Guerra trial testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Guerra proceeded to work on the draft judgment in Zambrano\u2019s apartment for several hours over the course of two days.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQM\">Guerra\u2019s edits were minor, involving mainly spelling and punctuation. When he was through, he returned the document to Zambrano on the laptop. The document was \u201cnot too different from the one that the Plaintiffs lawyers had given to Mr. Zambrano.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 516 (footnotes omitted) (quoting Guerra trial testimony (emphasis ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The district court credited this testimony by Guerra as to the events in 2010-2011 and found that \u201cGuerra told the truth regarding the bribe and the essential fact\u201d that the LAPs wrote the Judgment in their favor. Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">E. The Ecuadorian Appellate Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">1. Appeals to an Appellate Panel</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">Both sides filed appeals from the $17,292 billion Lago Agrio Judgment, along with various motions, which were heard by an appellate panel consisting of three judges from the trial court (\u201cAppeal Division\u201d or \u201cDivision\u201d) selected by the provincial judicial counsel. Chevron, although it did not yet have Guerra\u2019s input (see Part I.D. above), argued, inter alia, that the Judgment had been fraudulently procured because the LAPs apparently had secretly assisted in the writing of the Judgment. Chevron had received some of the LAPs\u2019 internal files in the \u00a7 1782 proceedings in the United States, and it submitted an affidavit of an expert that identified overlaps between parts of the Judgment and the LAPs\u2019 internal Selva Viva database. Chevron also argued that the Judgment had likely been written by someone other than Zambrano, given that the record in the case was approximately 200,000 pages, and \u201conly weeks before\u201d the Judgment was filed Zambrano had stated that \u201che still had a quarter of the ... record left to review.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 536 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">The LAPs, in their appeal, argued that the damages award should have been higher. They also argued that Chevron had planted the Selva Viva content in the Judgment, and they urged the court to deal with Chevron\u2019s fraud charges in order to avoid any adverse inferences if the court, on that issue, were to remain silent. See id. at 535-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">In an Opinion dated January 3, 2012, the Appeal Division affirmed the Judgment. The Division \u201cacknowledged that the Judgment incorrectly had reported some of the data samples,\u201d but it \u201cconcluded that the errors were immaterial to the Judgment\u2019s damages award,\u201d and it \u201cdid not attempt to re-calculate the damages based on the correct figures,\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 537; rather, the panel \u201cconcluded simply that the judge had considered all of the evidence \u2014 not each piece individually \u2014 to arrive at the total damages award,\u201d id. at 537-38 (emphasis in original). (See Appeal Division Opinion at 12 (\u201cthe [trial] judge ... has not assessed each sample and its results separately, as if they described isolated facts.... \u201d).) (See also Parts II.A.2. and II.D.l. below.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">The Appeal Division noted that there had been some errors in the Judgment\u2019s findings as to quantities of pollutants but stated that they did not \u201caffect the opinion of the judgment.\u201d (Appeal Division Opinion at 11.) It concluded that, aside from the error in finding a high level of mercury, which the Appeal Division was disregard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ing, \u201cthe rest of the judgment of February 14th, 2011, in all its parts, is ratified, including the award of measures of moral reparation or their alternative.\u201d (Id. at 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The Appeal Division made no modifications to any of the damages calculations that resulted in the $8,646 billion award, including the $5.4 billion component for remediation of soil at the \u201c880 [waste] pits\u201d referred to in the Judgment. The district court found, based on the expert testimony and the low-resolution aerial photographs in the Lago Agrio record, that the source for the number 880 must have been the Cabrera Report (see Part I.D.l above). The Appeal Division neither made any findings with regard to this major component of the damages award nor stated that the Division did not rely on the Cabrera Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Nor did the Appeal Division address the \u201coverlap between the Judgment and the LAPs\u2019 unfiled work product\u201d or explain why information in the Judgment differed from the filed sampling data. Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 537. The Appeal Division stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">Mention is also made of fraud and corruption of plaintiffs, counsel and representatives, a matter to which this Division should not refer at all, except to let it be emphasized that the same accusations are pending resolution before authorities of the United States of America due to a complaint that has been filed by the very defendant here, Chevron, under what is known as the RICO act, and this Division has no competence to rule on the conduct of counsel, experts or other officials or administrators and auxiliaries of justice, if that were the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">(Appeal Division Opinion at 10 (emphases added).) Thus, the Appeal Division did not deal with Chevron\u2019s argument that \u201cthe overlap in general and ... the errors and other idiosyncracies common to the Judgment and the unfiled LAP documents\u201d were not simply factual errors but were \u201cevidence that the LAPs had written or secretly had a hand in writing the Judgment,\u201d which would have been improper under Ecuadorian law. Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">The LAPs asked the Appeal Division to clarify the extent to which it had ad-' dressed Chevron\u2019s claims of fraud. In response, the court issued an order on January 13, 2012 (\u201cAppeal Division Clarification Order\u201d or \u201cClarification Order\u201d) stating that \u201cit was not its responsibility to hear and resolve proceedings that correspond to another jurisdiction,\u201d id. at 538-39 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Clarification Order stated, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">This is a civil proceeding in which the Division does not find evidence of \u201cfraud\u201d by the plaintiffs or their representatives, such that, as has been said, it stays out of these accusations, preserving the parties\u2019 rights to present formal complaint to the Ecuadorian criminal authorities or to continue the course of the actions that have been filed in the United States of America.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">(Appeal Division Clarification Order at 4 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-17\">2. Appeal to the Ecuadorian' National Court of Justice</p>\n<p id=\"b141-19\">Chevron then appealed to the Ecuadorian National Court of Justice (or \u201cNational Court\u201d), arguing that the Judgment should be nullified for a variety of reasons, including, inter alia, the submission of reports fraudulently attributed to Calmbacher, the illegal activity regarding Cabrera, and the ghostwriting of the Judgment. See Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 539. The National Court, \u201ca court of cassation\u201d which \u201creviews only the legal arguments and does not re-examine the facts,\u201d id., affirmed the decision of the Appeal Division with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>spect to all aspects of the Initial Judgment except the punitive damages award. Noting that \u201cpunitive damages are not contemplated under Ecuadorian law\u201d (Opinion of Ecuadorian National Court of Justice at 222), the National Court reduced the Lago Agrio Judgment against Chevron to $8.646 billion (the Ecuadorian Judgment), see Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">As to Chevron\u2019s arguments that the Lago Agrio Judgment should be annulled, the National Court\u2019s opinion emphasized that \u201c[t]he cassation appeal is an extraordinary appeal granted to the losing party so that the Cassation Court may annul not every unfair judgment, but only those in which their own specific unfairness has been proved to have been founded on a wrongful interpretation of the law.\u201d (Opinion of Ecuadorian National Court of Justice at 97.) It deemed the allegations that the LAPs had fraudulently submitted expert reports purportedly by Calmbacher, which Calmbacher had neither written nor approved, to be beyond the scope of cassation review, stating that Chevron had failed to identify \u201c \u201cwhich legal rule ha[d] been supposedly infringed.\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 539 (quoting Opinion of Ecuadorian National Court of Justice at 97).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">As to Chevron\u2019s contention that the LAPs had ghostwritten the Cabrera Report, the National Court \u201caccepted the trial court\u2019s statement that it had not relied on the Cabrera Report\u201d and concluded that the Appeal Division had properly weighed the remaining evidence in reaching its decision. Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 539^40. The National Court itself, as a court of cassation, did not review the trial record.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The National Court also stated that the Appeal Division\u2019s Clarification Order was not inconsistent with the Division\u2019s original opinion disclaiming competence to rule on the conduct of counsel, or judicial experts or officials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">In determining in a sufficient and clear manner that there was no procedural fraud in these proceedings, in the opinion of the Appeals Court, does not mean that the order issued on January 3, 2012 is inconsistent with the judgment rendered on January 13, 2012; it is clear that, by preserving the rights and actions of the parties, the court acknowledges the lack o[f] jurisdiction to decide whether or not there has been procedural fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">(Opinion of Ecuadorian National Court of Justice at 120 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">F. The LAPs\u2019 Strategies To Enforce the Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">In 2010, Donziger had hired the law firm of Patton Boggs to lead the LAPs\u2019 enforcement effort for the favorable judgment he was expecting. Patton Boggs had outlined a strategy, dubbed \u201cInvictus,\u201d of getting \u201cattachment^] of Chevron\u2019s assets\u201d and \u201cattacking Chevron on multiple fronts \u2014 in the United States and abroad.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 475, 541 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Invictus strategy included \u201cidentifying] Chevron-related entities \u2014 such as subsidiaries and joint ventures \u2014 and targeting] them with enforcement actions also.\u201d Id. at 476-77 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">Once the Lago Agrio Judgment was entered and affirmed, the LAPs obtained orders in Ecuador \u201cattaching] Chevron\u2019s intellectual property rights in Ecuador, funds going into or leaving Ecuador to Chevron\u2019s bank accounts abroad, and [the] $96 million arbitration award issued against the Republic of Ecuador.\u201d Id. at 542. They also brought enforcement actions in Argentina, Brazil, and Canada. The district court found that the LAPs intend to seek enforcement \u201cin the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>States when they conclude that it is tactically advantageous to do so.\u201d Id. at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">G. The Final Judgment in the Present Action</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The district court concluded that Don-ziger and the LAPs\u2019 team of attorneys, investors, experts, and consultants constituted a RICO enterprise, and that Donziger had conducted the affairs of that enterprise in a pattern of racketeering activity. (See Part II.D. below.) Having found that Donziger \u201cand the Ecuadorian lawyers he led,\u201d in representing the LAPs, \u201ccorrupted the Lago Agrio case\u201d by, inter alia,</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u2022 \u201csubmitt[ing] fraudulent evidence,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\u2022 \u201ccoerc[ing] one judge\u201d to use a single, \u201csupposedly impartial, \u2018global expert\u2019 to make an overall damages assessment\u201d for the judge,</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">\u2022 \u201chand-piek[ing]\u201d and illegally \u201cpa[ying]\u201d an expert who would \u201c \u2018totally play ball\u2019 with the LAPs\u201d in making such a damages assessment for the judge,</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">\u2022 coercing that judge to appoint Don-ziger\u2019s \u201chand-picked\u201d expert ' as the court\u2019s \u201c \u2018global expert,\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">\u2022 \u201cpa[ying] a Colorado consulting firm secretly to write all or most of the global expert\u2019s report,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">\u2022 \u201cfalsely presenting] the report as the work of the court-appointed and supposedly impartial expert,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">\u2022 fraudulently having the Colorado firm write supposed criticisms by the LAPs of the expert\u2019s report that that firm had written for the LAPs, to cause it to appear that the expert was impartial and his report neutral, rather than, as in fact it was, written by agents of the LAPs,</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">\u2022 telling \u201chalf-truths or worse to U.S. courts in attempts to prevent exposure of that and other wrongdoing,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">\u2022 having \u201cthe LAP team wr[i]te the Lago Agrio court\u2019s Judgment themselves,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">\u2022 and \u201cpromising] $500,000 to the [then-presiding] Ecuadorian judge\u201d in exchange for his agreement \u201cto rule in the[ LAPs\u2019] favor and sign their judgment,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-18\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 384; see id. at 443-45, the district court concluded that \u201c[i]f ever there were a case warranting equitable relief with respect to a judgment procured by fraud, this is it,\u201d id. at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-19\">The court noted that \u201cfraud in its procurement is an ancient basis for enjoining enforcement of or granting other equitable relief with respect to a judgment where other requisites of the exercise of equitable power are present,\u201d id. at 557. It concluded that as a result of the fraudulent, coercive, and corrupt acts orchestrated by Donziger, Chevron was entitled to equitable relief \u2014 under RICO against Donziger (see Part II.D. below), and under New York common law against Donziger, Camacho, and Piaguaje (see Part II.E. below) \u2014 to prevent Donziger and the LAP Representatives from profiting from their frauds and corruption, see Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-20\">The district court rejected arguments by Donziger and the LAP Representatives that the effects of any fraud or corruption in the trial court had been eliminated by the appellate reviews of the Lago Agrio Judgment. The court stated, inter alia, that as the Ecuadorian appellate courts had declined to resolve Chevron\u2019s fraud and ghostwriting allegations, the appellate decisions did not break the causal chain between the Lago Agrio Judgment produced by Donziger\u2019s fraud, bribery, and other corrupt practices and the injury the Ecuadorian Judgment causes to Chevron. See id. at 606-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Defendants also contended \u201cthat the coercion of Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez was immaterial because,\u201d they argued, \u201cthe Cabrera Report played no role in the ultimate decision.\u201d Id. at 558. The court found their premise fallacious, having determined, inter alia, \u201cthat the Cabrera Report in fact was relied upon by the author or authors of the Judgment and that it played an important role in holding Chevron liable to the extent of more than $8 billion,\u201d most relevantly in the fact that the Cabrera Report was the source \u201cfor the count of 880 pits, which was an essential predicate to more than $5 billion of the damage award,\u201d id. at 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The district court also rejected arguments that, as a matter of comity, it could not award Chevron relief from the Lago Agrio Judgment. The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">Comity and respect for other nations are important. But comity does not command blind acquiescence in injustice, least of all acquiescence within the bounds of our own nation. Courts of equity long have granted relief against fraudulent judgments entered in other states and, though less frequently, other countries. Moreover, the United States has important interests here. The misconduct at issue was planned, supervised, financed and executed in important (but not all) respects by Americans in the United States in order to extract money from a U.S. victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">That said, considerations of comity and the avoidance of any misunderstanding have shaped the relief sought here. Chevron no longer seeks, and this Court does not grant, an injunction barring enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment anywhere in the world. What this Court does do is to prevent Donziger and the two LAP Representatives, who are subject to this Court\u2019s personal jurisdiction, from profiting in any way from the egregious fraud that occurred here. That is quite a different matter. Indeed, the LAP Representatives\u2019 lawyer recently conceded before the Second Circuit that the- defendants \u201cwould not have a problem\u201d with \u201cthe alternative relief that [Chevron] would be seeking, such as enjoining the person who paid the bribe from benefitting from it,\u201d assuming that the judge was bribed. Defendants thus have acknowledged the propriety of equitable relief to prevent individuals subject to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction from benefitting from misdeeds for which they are responsible. And while the Court does enjoin enforcement of the Judgment by these defendants in the United States, that limited injunction raises no issues of comity or international relations. It is the prerogative of American courts to determine whether foreign judgments may be enforced in this country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-23\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 384-85 (footnote omitted) (quoting transcript in Naranjo v. Chevron Corp., No. 13-772 (2d Cir. Sept. 26, 2013) (oral argument of mandamus petition seeking vacatur of district court\u2019s refusals to allow defendants to withdraw defenses of collateral estoppel (emphases ours))).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-24\">The court noted that as a court of equity it has the power to \u201ccommand persons properly before it to cease or perform acts,\u201d whether inside or \u201coutside its territorial jurisdiction,\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 556 (internal quotation marks omitted (emphasis ours)), including the power to \u201cenjoin those parties from enforcing, or afford other equitable relief with respect to, a judgment of another state or another nation,\u201d id. at 556-57. Such an equitable in personam remedy \u201cseek[s] to deprive\u201d the person enjoined \u201cof the benefit of the judgment by enjoining [its] en-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>foreement.... on the ground that the rights acquired cannot be retained in good conscience\u201d; but \u201c[t]he remedy in equity does not assail the court in which the judgment was rendered.... \u201d Id. at 556 n.1268 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In order to ensure that Donziger and the LAP Representatives \u201cnever benefit[ ] in any material way from the Judgment in the Lago Agrio case,\u201d id. at 641, the district court determined that three types of relief for Chevron were appropriate: a constructive trust, disgorgement, and an injunction. Accordingly, the final judgment, defining Donziger and the Donziger Firm as \u201cDonziger,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">imposes a constructive trust for the benefit of Chevron on all property, whether personal or real, tangible or intangible, vested or contingent, that Donziger has received, or hereafter may receive, directly or indirectly, or to which Donziger now has, or hereafter obtains, any right, title or interest, directly or indirectly, that is traceable to the [Ecuadorian] Judgment or the enforcement of the [Ecuadorian] Judgment anywhere in the world including, without limitation, all rights to any contingent fee under the Retainer Agreement and all stock in Amazonia. Donziger shall transfer \u00e1nd forthwith assign to Chevron all such property that he now has or hereafter may obtain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Judgment as to Donziger Defendants and Defendants Camacho and Piaguaje \u00b6 1 (\u201cDistrict Court Judgment\u201d); see id. \u00b6 7.2 (defining \u201cAmazonia\u201d to refer to \u201cAmazonia Recovery Limited\u201d); see also Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 528 n.1110 (\u201cAmazonia Recovery Limited\u201d is a company created by Donziger and the LAPs in 2012 to distribute proceeds from the Lago Agrio Judgment). The District Court Judgment imposes a similar constructive trust against the LAP Representatives. See District Court Judgment \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The District Court Judgment also enjoins Donziger and the LAP Representatives from, inter alia, \u201c[failing or prosecuting any action for recognition or enforcement of the [Ecuadorian] Judgment\u201d or \u201cseeking the seizure or attachment of assets based on the [Ecuadorian] Judgment ... in any court in the United States,\u201d id. \u00b6 4.1, and from \u201cmonetizing]\u201d the Lago Agrio Judgment by, for example, \u201cselling, assigning, [or] pledging ... any interest\u201d in it, id. \u00b6 5. It also provides, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alz\">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Judgment, nothing herein enjoins, restrains or otherwise prohibits Donziger, the LAP Representatives, or any of them, from (a) filing or prosecuting any action for recognition or enforcement of the Judgment or any New Judgment ... in courts outside the United States; or (b) litigating this action or any appeal of any order or judgment issued in this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">Id. \u00b6 6 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">The district court pointed out that its final judgment would merely \u201cprevent Donziger and the LAP Representatives from profiting . from the [Ecuadorian] Judgment or seeking to enforce it in this country,\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 639, i.e., the judgment \u201cprevents the three defendants who appeared at trial \u2014 over whom [the district court] has personal jurisdiction' \u2014 from profiting from their fraud,\u201d id. at 644 (emphases added). \u201cThe decision in the Lago Agrio case was obtained by corrupt means. The defendants here may not be allowed to benefit from that in any way. The order entered today will prevent them from doing so.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">On appeal, Donziger, his Firm, and/or the LAP Representatives contend princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>pally that the district court\u2019s judgment should be vacated and the case dismissed for lack of federal jurisdiction on the ground that Chevron lacks Article III standing; that Chevron, in light of positions taken in earlier litigation, is estopped from challenging any Ecuadorian judgment; that the equitable relief granted by the district court was foreclosed by our decision in Naranjo and, in any event, is unauthorized by' RICO or common law; and that the district court\u2019s judgment violates principles of international comity. The LAP Representatives also argue that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over any defendant other than Don-ziger and his Firm, and that any corrupt conduct by Donziger in Ecuador should not be attributed to the LAPs. For the reasons that follow, we are unpersuaded, and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">A. Challenges to Federal Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Donziger contends that this action should be dismissed for lack of federal jurisdiction on the ground that Chevron lacks Article III standing, arguing principally that the decisions of the Ecuadorian appellate courts eliminated any causal connection between Chevron\u2019s injuries and the LAPs\u2019 team\u2019s misconduct in the Lago Agrio trial-level proceedings, and that Chevron failed in the present action to demonstrate any concrete injuries that could be redressed by the district court. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that, whether viewed as challenges to standing or as contentions of mootness, these challenges to federal jurisdiction are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">1. Article III Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u201cThe concept of [Article III] standing\u201d is part of \u201cthe constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.\u201d Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 37, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976); see, e.g., Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, \u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2334, 2341, 189 L.Ed.2d 246 (2014); Davis v. Federal Election Commission, 554 U.S. 724, 732, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559-60, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498-99, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-12\">[T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact \u2014 an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized ... and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.... Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of \u2014 the injury has to be fairly ... traee[able] to the. challenged action of the defendant, and not ... th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.... Third, it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted). Any monetary loss suffered by the plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact element, see, e.g., Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. United States Food &amp; Drug Administration, 710 F.3d 71, 85 (2d Cir. 2013); and a liability, including a contingent liability, may be a cognizable legal injury, see, e.g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 430-31, 118 S.Ct. 2091, 141 L.Ed.2d 393 (1998); E.M. v. New York City Department of Education, 758 F.3d 442, 457 (2d Cir. 2014); Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253, 265-66 (2d Cir. 2006). And as indicated, the requisite \u201cinjury in fact\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>need not have been already \u201cactualized. A party facing prospective injury has standing to sue where the threatened injury is real, immediate, and direct.\u201d Davis, 554 U.S. at 734, 128 S.Ct. 2759. The requirement can be met by showing an actual injury or through an \u201callegation of future injury ... if the threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur.\u201d Susan B. Anthony List, 134 S.Ct. at 2341 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The traceability requirement for Article III standing means that \u201cthe plaintiff must demonstrate a causal nexus between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury.\u201d Rothstein v. UBS AG, 708 F.3d 82, 91 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). The fact that the defendant\u2019s conduct may be only an \u201cindirect! ]\u201d cause is \u201cnot necessarily fatal to standing,\u201d Simon, 426 U.S. at 44, 96 S.Ct. 1917; see, e.g., Warth, 422 U.S. at 505, 95 S.Ct. 2197. A defendant\u2019s conduct that injures.a plaintiff but does so only after intervening conduct by another person, may suffice for Article III standing. See Rothstein v. UBS AG, 708 F.3d at 92. The traceability requirement focuses on whether the asserted injury could have been a consequence of the actions of the defendant rather than being attributable to the \u201c \u2018independent\u2019 \u201d acts of some other person not before the court. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (quoting Simon, 426 U.S. at 41-42, 96 S.Ct. 1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The redressability requirement focuses on whether a plaintiff \u201cpersonally would benefit in a tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention,\u201d Warth, 422 U.S. at 508, 95 S.Ct. 2197, he., whether \u201cthe plaintiff has shown an injury to himself that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision,\u201d Simon, 426 U.S. at 38, 96 S.Ct. 1917; see, e.g., Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 260-62, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977); Warth, 422 U.S. at 498-99, 95 S.Ct. 2197. A plaintiff \u201csatisfies the redressability requirement when he shows that a favorable decision will relieve a discrete injury to himself. He need not show that a favorable decision will relieve his every injury.\u201d Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 n.15, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Although the case-or-controversy prerequisite to federal jurisdiction means that \u201c \u2018an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed,\u2019 \u201d Davis, 554 U.S. at 733, 128 S.Ct. 2759 (quoting Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 67, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997)), and, as discussed in Part II.A.2. below, a case becomes \u201cmoot,\u201d and beyond federal jurisdiction, if there ceases to be an actual controversy, see, e.g., Chafin v. Chafin, \u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1017, 1023, 185 L.Ed.2d 1 (2013), \u201cthe standing inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed,\u201d Davis, 554 U.S. at 734, 128 S.Ct. 2759 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Chevron clearly met the requirements for Article III standing when it commenced the present action. Donziger\u2019s principal challenge to Chevron\u2019s \u201cstanding\u201d \u2014 he., his argument that the decisions of the Ecuadorian appellate courts eliminated any causal connection between Chevron\u2019s injuries and defendants\u2019 misconduct in the Lago Agrio trial-level proceedings \u2014 is inapplicable because when Chevron commenced the present action on February 1, 2011, none of the supposedly curative decisions had yet been rendered. The decisions of the Ecuadorian appellate courts were issued in 2012 and 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Although the Lago Agrio Judgment itself was not entered until February 14, 2011, Chevron\u2019s February 1 complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d) adequately pleaded an imminent threat to its business and property by reason of the fraudulent and corrupt conduct of Donziger and other defendants. By the time Chevron commenced this action, it had, through the \u00a7 1782 proceedings (see Part I.B.ll. above), obtained copies of numerous internal communications among Donziger and other members of the LAPs\u2019 team, including the consultants at Stratus (who had written \u2014 and objected to and responded to their own objections to \u2014 the Cabrera Report), as well as hundreds of hours of .outtakes from the \u201cCrude\u201d documentary showing, inter alia, collaboration between Cabrera and the LAPs. Chevron\u2019s Complaint asserted RICO claims against Donziger, his Firm, Fajardo, Yanza, the main Stratus consultants, and others, and asserted common-law claims against all defendants, including claims of fraud and unjust enrichment. The Complaint included detailed allegations of most of the facts eventually found proven by the district court, discussed in Part I.B. above, as to, inter aha: the submission by the LAPs to the Lago Agrio trial court of fabricated inspection reports in the name of Calmbacher, who had neither written nor approved them; the coercion of one Ecuadorian judge to discontinue inspections of allegedly polluted sites and to appoint Cabrera as the court\u2019s global expert with respect to the overall damages assessment; the secret payments to Cabrera to have him claim impartiality and claim sole authorship of his report although it was written by the LAPs\u2019 consultants; and the repeated announcements of burgeoning estimates of damages the LAPs were irresponsibly predicting would be imposed on Chevron, starting at $6 billion without scientific foundation and rising to $27 billion or even $113.5 billion. (See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3, 92-99, 100-112, 113\u2014 151, 158, 163-175, 299.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Stating that on December 17, 2010, the Lago Agrio trial court had entered an order formally closing the evidence, thereby authorizing the court to enter judgment without further notice to the parties, and that the LAPs had filed their final alegato on January 17, 2011, the February 1 Complaint alleged that \u201ca judgment that finds Chevron liable and awards damages appears to be imminent....\u201d (Id. \u00b6 295.) The Complaint alleged that the defendants were \u201calready ... planning to seek immediate enforcement of the impending Ecuadorian judgment in U.S. and foreign courts, \u25a0 and to extort a payment from Chevron by using the Ecuadorian judgment to threaten seizure of Chevron\u2019s assets and those of its subsidiaries,\u201d quoting Patton Boggs\u2019s \u201c \u2018Invictas\u2019 \u201d strategy statements (a) that \u201c \u2018[i]f and when an enforceable judgment is entered in Ecuador; Plaintiffs\u2019 Team expects to be engaged quickly, if not immediately, on multiple enforcement fronts \u2014 in the United States and abroad\u2019 \u201d (id. \u00b6 296), and (b) that \u201c \u2018[consistent with their aggressive approach, Plaintiffs\u2019 Team will look for ways to proceed against Chevron on a prejudgment basis, largely as a means of attaining a favorable settlement at an early stage.

The Complaint also quoted Donziger\u2019s statement of his \u201cintention ... to \u2018take legal fees we can earn from this case and, do more cases like this in different places with, you know, the same team, if possible.\u2019 \u201d (Id. \u00b6 300.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">The Complaint alleged that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_A\">[t]he impending judgment of the Lago Agrio court, procured by the RICO Defendants\u2019 and their co-conspirators\u2019 fraud \u2014 in addition to related attachment and enforcement efforts and the specter of immediate liability, which according to the RICO Defendants and their co-conspirators, may be as high as $113.5 billion \u2014 threatens to disrupt Chevron\u2019s business operations, sully its reputation, and otherwise cause Chevron to suffer irreparable harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">(Id. \u00b6 299.) In addition to a request for treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees on the RICO claims, the Complaint requested, with respect to most of the asserted causes of action,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">a preliminary and permanent injunction that enjoins Defendants, their assignees, and anyone else acting in concert with them ... from commencing, prosecuting, or advancing in any way \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 any attempt to recognize or enforce any Lago Agrio judgment in any court, tribunal, or administrative agency in any jurisdiction, in the United States or abroad, including any attempt to attach or seize any Chevron or Chevron subsidiary\u2019s or co-venturer\u2019s assets, whether pre-judgment or otherwise, until this Court determines the merits and enters judgment on Chevron\u2019s claims against the Defendants in this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYb\">(Id. \u00b6\u00b6 343, 366, 373, 383; see id. \u00b6\u00b6 351, 359, 377, 397.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In sum, there can be no doubt that Chevron had standing to initiate the present action. Its initial Complaint alleged numerous corrupt and fraudulent acts on the part of Donziger and other defendants that were expressly designed to extract money from Chevron, either through the entry of a judgment against it by the Lago Agrio court or through a settlement. The Complaint plausibly alleged facts from which it could be inferred that a judgment imposing liability on Chevron would be traceable to the corrupt and fraudulent conduct of those defendants; it plausibly alleged facts from which it could be inferred that such a judgment was imminent. And plainly the injunctive relief requested would have protected Chevron against the enforcement of such a judgment. All of the elements of standing were met at the outset of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The district court properly denied appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss this action for lack of standing. It correctly viewed the issue raised \u2014 the purported cleansing of any taint from the Lago Agrio Judgment \u25a0 by the Appeal Division\u2019s affirmance in 2012 \u2014 as one of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">2.

Notwithstanding Donziger\u2019s repeated characterization of the Appeal Division\u2019s affirmance of the Lago Agrio Judgment as a \u201csubstitute judgment,\u201d the fact remains that the Division did not alter the Lago Agrio Judgment at all. The only change in the Judgment entered by Judge Zambrano was made by the Ecuadorian National Court, which vacated the punitive damages award; and the National Court made clear that its \u2018 role as a cassation court was to concern itself only with the law, not with the record. The fact that the extant $8.646 billion award of compensatory damages against Chevron affirmed by the Appeal Division is traceable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>decision of then-judge Zambrano, is plain from the opinion of the Appeal Division itself. In its 16-page opinion, less than one-third of which dealt with the merits of the LAPs\u2019 claims against Chevron, the Division, without stating any factual findings of its own, expressly approved Judge Zam-brano\u2019s approach and conclusions. It stated, inter alia, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">the .judge in his judgment has not assessed each sample and its results separately, as if they described isolated facts, but instead it is the collection of information coming from various sources that undoubtedly has created in the trial judge the conviction of the existence of damage, allowing him at the same time to have a minimal margin of error in applying the interpretation method of sound discretion to assess scientific evidence .... In the present ease, the trial court has complied with the provision [that evidence must be assessed as a whole], since, evaluating the evidence collectively, it refers to each item of evidence. Moreover, the method of interpretation \u2014 the interpersonal, psychic form or mechanism \u2014 is not subject to strict limits in any concrete, express legal rule that can be considered violated; it is indeed a mental form that leads to the assessment, where human elements such as experience, logical rules, and even some knowledge of ranks of human psychology play a role; this is how legal doctrine and its most distinguished exponents put it forth.... The rules of sound judgment are above all rules of proper human understanding.... The Division considers that the analysis of civil liability, clear in the lower judgment, is the appropriate one for the procedural situation under analysis, since this is a case of strict civil liability, because it is dealing with activities that, carried out as the defendant\u2019s business purpose, imply risk in and of themselves; or, as may be stated, merely engaging in the action entails great risk. The analysis of the relationship between damage and cause in the Ecuadorian Amazon is sound and derives from the examination of the items of evidence that exist in the record.... Then, the damages to the environment are legally proved and considering the causal relationship between the result of damage, and the action of the operations of the then Texpet, the Division does not find reasons to modify what was ordered in the lower court\u2019s judgment and states that it is appropriate to confirm the monetary amounts established as proportions of compensation and indemnization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-18\">(Appeal Division Opinion at 12-13 (internal quotation marks omitted (emphases added)).) It continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-19\">As the lower court explains, and this ruling affirms, sound judgment as a form of intelligence in judicial activity allows for reasonable conclusions by putting forth the facts that serve as background; nothing is arbitrary pursuant to this process of mental certainty. The appealed judgment, since it is an opinion that was served in the first instance, and the subsequent amplification, proposes a detailed appraisal of all the body of evidence and finds the existence of environmental damages legally proved. The Division considers the lower court\u2019s appraisal in this part to be coherent and of good legal-logical judgment, because it stems from the body of evidence presented in the trial to which the trial court referred precisely. As regards standards for monetary appraisal, it can be seen, and affirmed, that the trial judge has not picked economic opinions or parameters that appear from the trial \u2014 and it would not have been strange at all for him to do so \u2014 , <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>nor has he considered them as a means of proof for reaching a decision; the trial judge\u2019s judgment establishes amounts different from those established or stated by the parties in defense of their interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">(Id. at 13 (emphases added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The Appeal Division concluded that as t\u00f3 Chevron\u2019s appeal, any errors were harmless; it found merit</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">only in the part that refers to the presence of mercury in the concession area, since there was an error in the assessment of the evidence with respect to this element in the lower court, and therefore its significance is left aside in this ruling.

The Appeal Division\u2019s Opinion provides no basis for an inference that the Lago Agrio Judgment was not the result of those corrupt acts, given its description of Judge Zambrano as having reached his decision without \u201cassessing]\u201d discrete \u201cfacts,\u201d without following \u201cconcrete, express legal rule[s],\u201d and without \u201cconsidering]\u201d the \u201ceconomic opinions or parameters that appear from the trial.\u201d And given that the Appeal Division in its opinion (a) sets out no findings or damages assessments or calculations of its own, (b) approves Judge Zambrano\u2019s approach as \u201csound,\u201d \u201cappropriate,\u201d and presenting \u201cno[ ] ... reasons to modify what was ordered in the lower court\u2019s judgment,\u201d and (c) \u201cratifiefs]\u201d Judge Zambrano\u2019s award \u201cin all its parts,\u201d we conclude that Chevron\u2019s $8.646 billion judgment debt, as approved by the Appeal Division, is clearly traceable to the LAPs\u2019 legal team\u2019s corrupt conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">Donziger\u2019s contention that Chevron has not met the requirement that it show injury is meritless. The threat of injury to Chevron, sufficiently imminent when this action was commenced, soon ripened into actual injury. Less than two weeks after Chevron initiated the present action, then-judge Zambrano entered the $17.292 billion Lago Agrio Judgment, imposing on Chevron a judgment debt of $8.646 billion in compensatory damages plus $8.646 billion in punitive damages. The $8.646 billion debt for compensatory damages remains extant.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">Donziger\u2019s additional arguments that Chevron\u2019s case became moot when this Court ruled in Naranjo that the Recognition Act does not authorize an affirmative attack on a foreign judgment as to which there has yet been no attempted enforcement in New York (see Donziger brief on appeal at 84-93), or that the case became moot when Chevron withdrew its claim for money damages and pursued only equitable relief, which Donziger contends is not authorized by RICO (see id. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>116-19), are also untenable. An argument that claims mootness based on a challenge to \u201cthe legal availability of a certain kind of relief \u2014 confuses mootness with the merits.\u201d Chaf\u00edn, 133 S.Ct. at 1024; cf. Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 151 n.1, 130 S.Ct. 2743, 177 L.Ed.2d 461 (2010) (\u201cThe question whether [a plaintiff is] entitled to the relief that [it] seek[s] goes to the merits, not to standing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Nor is there merit in Donziger\u2019s contention that, in light of Chevron\u2019s withdrawal of its claim for money damages, its injury is not redressable. The injury to Chevron may not be fully compensable, but the equitable restrictions permissibly imposed by the district court (see Parts U.D., II.E., and II.H. below) provide some relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In sum, finding no merit in appellants\u2019 standing or mootness arguments, we reject the contention that the present action should have been dismissed for lack of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">B. The Judicial Estoppel Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">In 1999, after a group of Ecuadorian plaintiffs, who were substantially the same as the LAPs, had brought the Aguinda action against Texaco in the Southern District of New York, Texaco sought dismissal of the suit on the ground of forum non conveniens, arguing that the action belonged in Ecuador. In so moving, Texaco offered \u2018\u201cto satisfy any judgments in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, reserving its right to contest their validity only in the limited circumstances permitted by New York\u2019s Recognition of Foreign Country Money Judgments Act.\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 631 n.1753 (quoting Texaco memorandum submitted to the Aguinda district court); see Republic of Ecuador, 638 F.3d at 389 (citing the same language). Donziger and the LAP Representatives contend that in light of that representation, principles of judicial estoppel bar Chevron from contending that the competence or integrity of the Ecuadorian judiciary is institutionally flawed or from challenging any Ecuadorian judgment against it. Given the record in this case, we do not reach any contentions as to the Ecuadorian judiciary in general. Focusing squarely on the conduct of the LAPs\u2019 legal team in the Lago Agrio Litigation itself, we cannot agree that judicial estoppel is applicable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">[J]udicial estoppel[ ] \u201cgenerally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.\u201d Pegram v.

Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001) (emphasis added). Noting that \u201c[t]he circumstances under which judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked are probably not reducible to any general formulation of principle,\u201d the Supreme Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">several factors typically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case: First, a party\u2019s later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position.... Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party\u2019s earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled.... Absent success in a prior proceeding, a party\u2019s later inconsistent position introduces no risk of inconsistent court determinations, ... and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity.... A third consideration is whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped..:. [\u00bfjudicial estoppel forbids use of intentional self-contradiction ... as a means of obtaining unfair advantage....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750-51, 121 S.Ct. 1808 (internal quotation marks omitted (emphases ours)). The Supreme Court applied these factors to the case before it, see id. at 751-55, 121 S.Ct. 1808, without establishing them as \u201cinflexible prerequisites or [as] an exhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial es-toppel,\u201d id. at 751, 121 S.Ct. 1808.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Our Court \u201chas consistently limited the application of judicial estoppel to situations where a party both takes a position that is inconsistent with one taken in a prior proceeding, and has had that earlier position adopted by the tribunal to which it was advanced,\u201d applying it only in \u201csituations where the risk of inconsistent results with its impact on judicial integrity is certain.\u201d Uzdavines v. Weeks Marine, Inc., 418 F.3d 138, 148 (2d Cir. 2005) (\u201cUzdavines\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing cases). We do not apply judicial estoppel where \u201cthe statements at issue do not present an irreconcilable conflict.\u201d Rodal v. Anesthesia Group of Onondaga, P.C., 369 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">We have expressed some question as to whether the standard of review for a ruling on judicial estoppel should be de novo or abuse of discretion. See, e.g., Intellivision v. Microsoft Corp., 484 Fed.Appx. 616, 618 &amp; n.1 (2d Cir. 2012) (noting that seven of our Sister Circuits review for abuse of discretion); Uzdavines, 418 F.3d at 143 (applying de novo review in denying a petition for review); see also New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808 (describing \u201cjudicial estoppel [a]s an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In this case, however, the choice between the two standards is immaterial, for under either, the doctrine is inapplicable because Chevron\u2019s suit is not inconsistent with the prior Texaco representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The prior Texaco representation was at issue in Republic of Ecuador, 638 F.3d 384, in which the LAPs sought to stay a treaty-based arbitration commenced by Chevron. In the arbitration, Chevron alleged, inter alia, that the ROE \u201chad improperly interfered in the Lago Agrio litigation\u201d in breach of (a) its 1995 settlement agreement with Texaco that specified the remediation work to be done in the Concession area, and (b) its 1998 release of Texaco from all potential claims by the ROE and PetroEcuador after ROE inspectors had confirmed Texaco\u2019s satisfactory completion of that work. Republic of Ecuador, 638 F.3d at 388, 390; see Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 386-87. The LAPs argued that in light of Texaco\u2019s offer to satisfy Ecuadorian judgments, such an arbitration proceeding was barred by judicial estoppel. We rejected that contention because there was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">no conflict between Texaco\u2019s promises to the district court and Chevron\u2019s initiation of a contemporaneous challenge to Ecuador\u2019s conduct with respect to the Lago Agrio litigation. Texaco expressly conditioned its promises on a reservation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>of its rights under New York\u2019s Recognition of Foreign Country Money Judgments Act. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5304. Chevron has thus reserved its right to challenge any judgment issued in Lago Agrio on the grounds that the Ecuadorian judicial system \u201cdoes not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law,\u201d that the judgment itself \u201cwas obtained by fraud,\u201d or that \u201cthe proceeding in [Lago Agrio] was contrary to an agreement between the parties.\u201d Id. Nothing in that reservation of rights purports to restrict the kind of forum or type of proceeding in which Chevron can raise those defenses. Nor did Texaco promise to wait until after a judgment was issued to challenge the fairness of the Lago Agrio litigation. Having reserved the rights conferred by N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5304, Chevron remains free to enforce them whenever and wherever it chooses, limited only by the scope of the statute and the availability of a forum prepared to address its claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">Republic of Ecuador, 638 F.3d at 396-97 (footnote omitted) (emphases ours); see also id. at 397-98 (\u201cChevron can raise ... due process claims in [the] arbitration without contravening Texaco\u2019s prior positions in the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">Although in Republic of Ecuador we also referred to \u201cNew York\u2019s Recognition of Foreign Country Money Judgments Act ...

And we noted that Texaco\u2019s promise itself did not \u201crestrict the kind of forum or type of proceeding in which Chevron can raise those defenses,\u201d id. Thus, there is no inconsistency between the conditional representation by Texaco and the claims of Chevron in the present action that it has been injured by the entry of a judgment procured by means of the fraudulent and corrupt conduct of the LAPs.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-18\">Accordingly, we have no need here to reach any question as to the institutional adequacy of the Ecuadorian-judicial system. There is no error in the district court\u2019s finding that neither the condition placed on Texaco\u2019s forum non conveniens agreement nor this Court\u2019s comments in any of our prior opinions obligated Chevron not to challenge a judgment which \u201cthe LAPs wrote,\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 502, and which the sitting Ecuadorian judge \u201csigned ... as part of the quid pro quo for the promise of $500,000,\u201d id. at 534-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-19\">C.

The district court granted Chevron\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction on that basis, and it severed the Count 9 claim from Chevron\u2019s other claims in order to expedite trial as to the validity of the Ecuadorian judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In Naranjo \u2014 the appeal from the preliminary injunction \u2014 we vacated the injunction on the ground that the Recognition Act, while allowing certain defenses against an attempt to enforce a foreign judgment, did not authorize a judgment debtor to attack a foreign judgment affirmatively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">Whatever the merits of Chevron\u2019s complaints about the Ecuadorian courts, ... the procedural device it has chosen to present those claims is simply unavailable: The Recognition Act nowhere authorizes a court to declare a foreign judgment unenforceable on the preemptive suit of a putative judgment-debtor. The structure of the Act is clear. The sections on which Chevron relies provide exceptions from the circumstances in which a holder of a foreign judgment can obtain enforcement of that judgment in New York; they do not create an affirmative cause of action to declare foreign judgments void and enjoin their enforcement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-19\">Id. at 240 (emphases added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-20\">Nothing in the language, history, or purposes of the Act suggests that it creates causes of action by which disappointed litigants in foreign cases can ask a New York court to restrain efforts to enforce those foreign judgments against them, or to preempt the courts of other countries from making their own decisions about the enforceability of such judgments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-21\">Id. at 243 (emphasis added); see also id. at 242 (\u201cThere is thus no legal basis for the injunction that Chevron seeks, and, on these facts, there will be no such basis until judgment-creditors affirmatively seek to enforce their judgment in a court governed by New York or similar law.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-22\">Our Naranjo opinion also expressed concerns that if the Recognition Act were interpreted to authorize an injunction against enforcement of a foreign judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>anywhere in the world, it would implicate principles of international comity. See id. at 242-44. We concluded, however, that \u201cNew York undertook to act as a responsible participant in an international system of justice \u2014 not to set up its courts as a transnational arbiter to dictate to the entire world which judgments are entitled to respect and which countries\u2019 courts are to be treated as international pariahs.\u201d Id. at 242. Thus, we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agh\">[w]e need not address here whether and how international comity concerns would affect a hypothetical effort by a state to vest its courts with the authority to issue so radical an injunction. There is no such statutory authorization, for New York has authorized no such relief. To resolve the dispute before us, we need only address whether the statutory scheme announced by New York\u2019s Recognition Act allows the district court to declare the Ecuadorian judgment non-recognizable, or to enjoin plaintiffs from seeking to enforce that judgment. Because we find that it does not, the injunction collapses before we reach issues of international comity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Id. at 244 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">In light of our interpretation of the Recognition Act and of the fact that there had been no attempt to enforce the Lago Agrio Judgment in New York, there was \u201cnothing further to be addressed on remand with respect to the severed claim.\u201d Naranjo, 667 F.3d at 289 n.11. We thus remanded Count 9 to the district court with instructions to dismiss Chevron\u2019s claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under the Recognition Act. See id. at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Our conclusion that the declaratory judgment claim must be dismissed made it unnecessary for us to reach any of the \u201croughly a dozen [other] arguments\u201d made by Donziger and the LAPs with respect to that claim. Id. at 239. Chevron\u2019s other claims were not before us, and we did not address them, stating, \u201c[w]e decide only those issues that relate to the severed declaratory judgment claim and the district court\u2019s rulings thereon,\u201d id. at 238 n.8, and noting that there would \u201ccontinu[e to be] separate proceedings between these parties on other causes of action before the same district court judge,\u201d id. at 239 n.ll.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">In sum, the Naranjo decision held simply that \u201cthe Recognition Act does not authorize a court to declare a foreign judgment null and void for all purposes in all countries, or to issue injunctions preventing parties to foreign litigation from acting abroad to present issues to foreign courts.\u201d Id. at 245 (emphases added). Other arguments were \u201ceither rendered moot by [that] disposition ... or ... pertain[ed] to litigation that [wa]s not properly before us.\u201d Id. at 246. We \u201cexpressfed] no views on the merits of the parties\u2019 various charges and counter-charges regarding the Ecuadorian legal system and their adversaries\u2019 conduct of this litigation, which may be addressed as relevant in other litigation before the district court or elsewhere.\u201d Id. at 247 n.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">Accordingly, Naranjo did not foreclose consideration of the validity of Chevron\u2019s remaining claims under RICO and New York common law or of the appropriateness of relief other than a declaratory judgment under the Recognition Act or a global injunction against enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">D. The RICO-Based Rulings Against Don-ziger</p>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">Chevron asserted RICO claims against Donziger and others (not including the LAPs), alleging that, in orchestrating the frauds, extortions, and briberies leading to the entry of the $17.292 billion Lago Agrio Judgment, Donziger conducted the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of rack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>eteering activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), and conspired to do so, in violation of \u00a7 1962(d). Section 1964 of RICO (quoted more fully in subpart 2 of this Part II.D.) provides in part that the federal courts have \u201cjurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of section 1962 of this chapter by ... imposing reasonable restrictions on the future activities ... of any person,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(a) (emphases added), and that \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 ... may sue therefor ... and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee,\u201d id. \u00a7 1964(c). Although Chevron withdrew its request for damages, it sought equitable relief under RICO for its injuries resulting from Donziger\u2019s violations of \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c) and (d). The district court, noting that either damages or equitable relief under RICO \u201care available only to those persons injured by reason of the defendant\u2019s predicate acts\u201d and that the predicate acts must be \u201cboth the factual and the proximate cause of the injury,\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 601 (internal quotation marks omitted), found that Chevron had established all of the elements of its RICO claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The court found that there was a RICO \u201centerprise\u201d consisting of \u201cthe LAP team and its affiliates,\u201d which included</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">Donziger, ... the U.S. and Ecuadorian lawyers, including Kohn[ and] Patton Boggs ..., Yanza, the ADF, and Selva Viva, ... the investors who gave money to finance the operation, usually in exchange for shares of any recovery, ... the LAPs\u2019 public relations, media, and lobbying arms, [and] ... the LAPs\u2019 technical people, including Stratus, Belt-man, Maest, Russell, Calmbacher, ... [and] Quarles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 576. Although not finding that each member of the enterprise committed acts of racketeering activity, the court found that these persons or entities were \u201cassociated in fact for the common purpose of pursuing the recovery of money from Chevron via the Lago Agrio litigation, whether by settlement or by enforceable judgment, coupled with the exertion of pressure on Chevron to pay.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The district court found that Donziger had committed \u2014 and conspired with at least Fajardo and Yanza to commit \u2014 numerous indictable acts that fell within the RICO definition of racketeering activity in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1), see, e.g., Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 576-99, 601, including extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (affecting interstate or foreign commerce \u201cin any way or degree,\u201d by \u201cthe obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, on fear, or under color of official right\u201d or \u201cattempting]\u201d to do so); wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348 (communicating or foreseeably causing communication \u201cby means of wire ... in interstate or foreign commerce,\u201d of \u201cwritings,\u201d etc., in furtherance of a \u201cscheme or artifice to defraud, or [to] obtain[ ] money or property\u201d by way of \u201cfalse or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises\u201d); money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 (transmitting or transferring funds \u201cfrom a place in the United States to or through a place outside the United States ... with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity,\u201d .defined to include \u201cactivity constituting an offense listed in section 1961(1) of [18 U.S.C.]\u201d); obstruction of justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 (\u201ccorruptly ... endeavoring] to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice\u201d in \u201cany court of the United States\u201d); and violations of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952 (using \u201cany facility in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>interstate or foreign commerce\u201d in furtherance of, or with the intent to promote unlawful activity such as \u201cbribery ... in violation of the laws ... of the United States,\u201d including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which makes it unlawful for a United States citizen or national to, inter alia, \u201coffer, pay[], [or] promise to pay ... any money, or ... anything of value to ... any foreign official for purposes of ... influencing any act or decision of such foreign official,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78dd-2(a)). The district court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">[a]mong the predicate acts that Chevron has proved are (1) multiple extortionate acts including, among others, (a) the ghostwriting of the Judgment and the promise of $500,000 to Zambrano for signing it, and (b) the ghostwriting of the Cabrera Report upon which the author(s) of the Judgment relied for the pit count that underlies more than $5 billion of the damages award, as well as the false portrayal of Cabrera as a neutral, impartial and independent expert, and the payments and other inducements to Cabrera to ensure that he \u201cplayed ball,\u201d (2) multiple acts of wire fraud in furtherance of fraudulent schemes with respect to all of the foregoing, (3) money laundering to promote racketeering acts, including with respect to the ghostwriting of the. Cabrera Report by Stratus and payments to Cabrera, and (4) violations of the Travel Act to facilitate violations of the anti-bribery provision of the FCPA by payments to Cabrera.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-16\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 601 (emphases added). In addition, referring to the findings described in Part I.B.11. above, the court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-17\">Donziger and the LAPs\u2019 U.S. counsel submitted the deliberately misleading Fajardo Declaration first to the court in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-19\">Denver and then to many other courts throughout the country, including this one. The LAPs\u2019 American lawyers \u2014 including Donziger \u2014 were involved in drafting the declaration. They debated extensively the extent to which it would reveal the truth about the LAPs\u2019 \u201ccontacts\u201d with Cabrera. And they decided that Fajardo rather than Donziger should sign it for fear that Donziger, a U.S. resident and thus subject to compulsory process, would be deposed.FN1470 Finally, the declaration, as discussed earlier, was misleading at best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-25\">FN1470. PX 1316 (May 3, 2010 Email from [Patton Boggs partner] E. Westenberger to others) (\u201cThis is why we struggled with who would sign the declaration.

We figured that with [Fajardo], they likely would not slow down the process by deposing him.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-27\">Donziger\u2019s conduct with respect to the Fajardo Declaration was obstruction of justice, plain and simple. The declaration was drafted while the Stratus Section 1782 proceeding was pending, as Don-ziger was acutely aware. Its purpose \u2014 in Donziger\u2019s words \u2014 was to \u201cprevent Stratus\u2019 role relative to the Cabrera report from coming out.\u201d Donziger was involved in the communications as to what it would and would not say. He knew that it was false or misleading. His conduct was intended to \u201cimpede ... the due administration of justice,\u201d and it fell squarely within the federal obstruction of justice statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-36\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 594 &amp; n.1470 (other footnotes omitted) (quoting Donziger deposition testimony and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 (emphases ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The district court noted that \u201cNumerous emails were sent in furtherance of these schemes.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 590 n.1443. It found that many of the wires at issue were interstate; and a number were sent to or from the United States \u2014 for example, the emails from Stratus\u2019s Beltman to Donziger, Fajardo, and others, with respect to Stratus\u2019s ghostwriting of the Cabrera Report, see id. at 590 &amp; n.1443. The dozens of emails referred to in Part I of this' opinion are but a small percentage of those in the trial record; with regard to the preparation of the Cabrera Report alone, \u201cDonziger and Stratus personnel exchanged hundreds of emails,\u201d id. at 440 &amp; n.439. And moneys funding the LAPs\u2019 team\u2019s corrupt activities were wired, for example, from Gibraltar to New York to Ecuador. See id. at 591-92. The court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">the fact that certain of Donziger\u2019s wrongful efforts to force Chevron to pay took place in Ecuador is of no moment. While Donziger\u2019s activities in Ecuador were important, they in many respects were merely tools. Regardless of where the conduct creating the threat took place, the plan was hatched and run from the United States and its object was a multi-billion dollar payment from Chevron, a U.S. based company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Id. at 588.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">[T]he evidence at trial established that Donziger, a New York lawyer and resident, here formulated and conducted a scheme to victimize a U.S. company through a pattern of racketeering. That pattern included substantial conduct in the United States \u2014 e.g., the bulk of Donziger\u2019s overall supervision of the entire operation; much of Donziger\u2019s fund raising activity; the ghostwriting of the Cabrera Report, which occurred mainly in Boulder, Colorado, and was supervised by Donziger from New York; much of the pressure and lobbying campaign designed to injure Chevron\u2019s reputation and impact its bottom line and its stock price, a campaign micromanaged by Donziger that employed many U.S. public relations advisors and lobbyists; the making of Crude by a New York-based and recruited film maker; and the improper efforts to ward off discovery through U.S. courts of what really had taken place with Cabrera, Stratus, and the LAPs. Much of the funding came principally from Kohn in Philadelphia and Burford [Capital, a litigation finance firm], which operated at least partly in the United States. Absent the U.S. activity, there would have been no scheme. Even had there been one, it would have been doomed to failure, without that activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The district court found that these acts constituted a pattern of racketeering activity within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(5) (requiring at least two acts of racketeering activity occurring within 10 years of each other). Donziger\u2019s acts of wire fraud, bribery, obstruction of justice, and money laundering were committed as part of an at-least \u201cfive-year effort to extort and defraud Chevron\u201d into paying a huge sum of money; and it was likely that the \u201cdemonstrate^ criminal activity w[ould] continue into the future,\u201d especially \u201cin view of the defendants\u2019 failure thus far to achieve their goal.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">There is no challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support any of these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Donziger makes other challenges to the district court\u2019s granting of relief to Chevron under RICO. In addition to arguing that the District Court Judgment should be set aside on international comity grounds (which we reject for the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>set out in Part II.F. below), he contends that Chevron failed to establish a quantifiable, redressable injury, and that proximate causation was lacking by reason of the intervention of the Ecuadorian appellate decisions between the racketeering-activity-induced initial Lago Agrio Judgment and Chevron\u2019s $8.646 billion judgment debt; and he argues 'that RICO does not authorize the granting of equitable relief to private plaintiffs. We reject each contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">1. RICO Injury and Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">After Donziger promised Judge Zambrano $500,000 from the proceeds of a judgment in favor of the LAPs, Judge Zambrano entered the Lago Agrio Judgment, which had been written by the LAPs\u2019 team, against Chevron for $8.646 billion in damages (plus $8.646 billion in punitive damages, which was thereafter eliminated by the National Court because Ecuadorian law does not authorize the imposition of punitive damages). Thus, Chevron has an $8.646 billion judgment debt. The imposition of a wrongful debt constitutes an injury to one\u2019s business or property-</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">After the Ecuadorian Appeal Division affirmed that Judgment, attachments were placed on Chevron assets, including its intellectual property rights in Ecuador, which the district court found are worth between $15 and $30 million. Attachments were also placed on the funds in Chevron\u2019s Ecuadorian bank accounts, and on the approximately $96 million Chevron had been awarded in arbitration against the ROE. The LAPs also brought enforcement actions in Argentina, Brazil, and Canada. Donziger\u2019s contention that Chevron has suffered no injury from these attachments, on the ground that the assets have not yet been transferred, is frivolous. The nature of an attachment is to prevent the asset\u2019s owner from using or disposing of his property as he wishes. That incursion into the owner\u2019s property rights constitutes injury. There is no serious question that Chevron has suffered injury in its business or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">The district court also permissibly found that Chevron\u2019s legal fees \u2014 those already expended to uncover Donziger\u2019s wrongful conduct and those being spent and soon-to-be-spent to defend against enforcement proceedings \u2014 constituted further injury to Chevron. See Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 553, 638. \u201c[L]egal fees may constitute RICO damages when they are proximately caused by a RICO violation.\u201d Stochastic Decisions, Inc. v. DiDomenico, 995 F.2d 1158, 1167 (2d Cir.), cert denied, 510 U.S. 945, 114 S.Ct. 385, 126 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Donziger, under his retainer agreement with the LAPs, \u201cis entitled to be paid (a) 6.3 percent of all amounts collected in respect of the Lago Agrio litigation, plus (b) any arrearages in his monthly retainer, plus (c) reimbursement for expenses.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 602 (footnotes omitted). Thus, if the $8.646 billion Ecuadorian Judgment debt is collected, Donziger is to be paid $544,698,000, plus arrear-ages and expenses. The district court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">[a]ll of the property that Donziger now has and which he hereafter may receive as a result of the Judgment are and will be the products of the Judgment obtained in consequence of his predicate acts of racketeering. To the extent he has been enriched by property taken from Chevron, Chevron has lost that property as a proximate consequence of those predicate acts. Moreover, to the extent the Judgment is enforced in the future, Donziger will be enriched further at Chevron\u2019s expense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>to the extent of 6.3 percent of the property thus obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Id. (emphases added). The procurement of such moneys from a RICO plaintiff through acts of racketeering activity constitutes injury to the plaintiffs property.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Although Donziger also contends that any injury to Chevron from the Judgment cannot be redressed, the constructive trust that the District Court Judgment imposes on Donziger for the benefit of Chevron, requiring that he pay to Chevron all sums he has received or will receive that are traceable to the Lago Agrio Judgment, provides partial compensation. The fact that Chevron will not be compensated fully does not provide a basis for Donziger to retain proceeds from the Judgment that resulted from his corrupt conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">We find no greater merit in Donziger\u2019s contention that his racketeering activity was not the proximate cause of Chevron\u2019s injury on the theory that the Ecuadorian appellate decisions broke the causal chain. Although Donziger repeatedly refers to the decision of the Appeal Division as a \u201csubstitute judgment of the appellate court\u201d (Donziger brief on appeal at 68; see also id. at 2, 4, 38, 72, 73, 99), \u201csubstitute\u201d is a label unsupported by substance. The fact is that the Appeal Division, aside from acknowledging an error with respect to mercury levels (and finding it harmless), did not alter the Lago Agrio Judgment in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Nor is there any finding in the Appeal Division\u2019s Opinion to show that the Division\u2019s own examination of the record led it \u2014 independently\u2014to find Chevron liable for the sums awarded in the Lago Agrio Judgment. The Division noted that there were more than 220,000 pages of documents in the Lago Agrio Litigation record (see Appeal Division Opinion at 2); in reviewing Judge Zambrano\u2019s decision, the Division wrote a 16-page opinion \u2014 much of which was devoted to rejecting the arguments of Chevron that it was not subject to suit in Ecuador. Only some five pages of the opinion were devoted to the merits of the action, and only one of them refers to any specific part of the record (see id. at 11 (collecting 16 pages of the 220,000-page record)). Aside from acknowledging, on that page, some of the errors in the Judgment, which it found harmless, the Division stated no findings of its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Instead, most of that five-page section of the Appeal Division\u2019s opinion, much of which is quoted in Part II.A.2. above, extensively described the manner in which Judge Zambrano adjudicated the case (see Appeal Division Opinion at 10-13), and approved his approach and his decision as an exercise of \u201csound discretion\u201d and an application of \u201ccoherent and ... good legal-logical judgment\u201d in reaching \u201creasonable conclusions\u201d (id. at 12-13). Thus, \u201c[t]he Division consider[ed]\u201d that Judge Zambra-no\u2019s \u201canalysis.... [wa]s the appropriate one\u201d (id. at 12); the Division \u201cd[id] not find reasons to modify what was ordered in the lower court\u2019s judgment\u201d (id. at 12-13); the Division found it \u201cappropriate to confirm the monetary amounts established as proportions of compensation and in-demnization\u201d (id. at 13); and except for acknowledging (and finding harmless) Judge Zambrano\u2019s error with respect to mercury levels, the Division \u201cratified\u201d Judge Zam-brano\u2019s decision \u201cin all its parts\u201d (id. at 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">The district court concluded that the decision of the Appeal Division was \u201cnot truly the \u2018independent action[ ] of [a] third ... partfy],\u2019 \u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 601 (quoting Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.S. 1, 15, 130 S.Ct. 983, 175 L.Ed.2d 943 (2010)), and that it therefore did not break the chain of causation between the racketeering activity of the LAPs\u2019 team and Chevron\u2019s existing $8.646 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>billion judgment debt. We see no error in that conclusion, given the contents and focus of the Appeal Division\u2019s own opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">2. The Availability of Equitable Relief Under RICO</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Donziger contends that the District Court Judgment against him should be overturned on the ground that RICO does not authorize the granting of equitable relief to a private plaintiff. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has decided the question of whether RICO authorizes a court to award equitable relief to a private plaintiff. See, e.g., RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community, \u2014 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 2090, 2111 n.13, 195 L.Ed.2d 476 (2016); Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc., 537 U.S. 393, 411, 123 S.Ct. 1057, 154 L.Ed.2d 991 (2003) (\u201cNOW II\u201d); Trane Co. v. O\u2019Connor Securities, 718 F.2d 26, 28-29 (2d Cir. 1983) (expressing doubt as to the availability of such relief to RICO private plaintiffs). Of the two federal Courts of Appeals that have decided the issue, the Seventh Circuit has found such relief authorized, see National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 267 F.3d 687, 695 (7th Cir. 2001) (\u201cNOW I\u201d), reversed on other grounds, 537 U.S. 393, 123 S.Ct. 1057, 154 L.Ed.2d 991 (2003), and the Ninth Circuit has found it unauthorized, see Religious Technology Center v. Wollersheim, 796 F.2d 1076, 1088-89 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1103, 107 S.Ct. 1336, 94 L.Ed,2d 187 (1987). Other Circuits that have addressed the issue obi-ter have expressed divergent views. See, e.g., NOW I, 267 F.3d at 695 (collecting cases). We conclude that a federal court is authorized to grant equitable relief to a private plaintiff who has proven injury to its business or property by reason of a defendant\u2019s violation of \u00a7 1962, largely for the reasons stated by the Seventh Circuit opinion in NOW I.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">The three relevant subsections of RICO \u00a7 1964 provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">(a) The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of section 1962 of this chapter by issuing appropriate orders, including, but not limited to: ordering any person to divest himself of any interest, direct or indirect, in any enterprise; [or] imposing reasonable restrictions on the future activities ... of any person, ... making due provision for the rights of innocent persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aji\">(b) The Attorney General may institute proceedings under this section.

Accordingly, \u201cunless a statute expressly, \u2018or by a necessary and inescapable inference, restricts the court\u2019s jurisdiction in equity,\u2019 we will infer that \u2018all the inherent equitable powers of the District Court are available for the proper and complete exercise of that jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Sasso, 215 F.3d at 289 (quoting Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398, 66 S.Ct. 1086, 90 L.Ed. 1332 (1946)); cf. De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd. v. United States, 325 U.S. 212, 218-19, 65 S.Ct. 1130, 89 L.Ed. 1566 (1945) (reasoning that Sherman Act\u2019s grant of jurisdiction \u201cto prevent and restrain violations of th[at] act\u201d carried with it \u201cpower ... traditionally exercised by courts of equity\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">As we read \u00a7 1964, subsection (a) gives the federal courts jurisdiction to hear RICO claims and sets out general remedies, including injunctive relief; subsection (b) makes it clear that the court, on the application of the Attorney General, has authority to grant temporary injunctive relief even before there is a final adjudication; and subsection (c) provides a private right of action for any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of \u00a7 1962. We agree with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s view that subsection (a) is not simply a jurisdictional section but rather is a section that \u201cgrant[s] district courts authority to hear RICO claims and then ... spell[s] out a non-exclusive list of the remedies district courts are empowered to provide in such cases.\u201d NOW I, 267 F.3d at 697. Subsection (a) itself neither states that any category of persons may not obtain relief that is within the powers granted to the federal courts nor specifies the persons in whose favor the courts are authorized to exercise the powers there granted. In our view, this means that Congress did not intend to limit the court\u2019s subsection (a) authority by reference to the identity or nature of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The limitations as to who may obtain certain other types of relief are, as we interpret \u00a7 1964, spelled out in subsections (b) and (c). Thus, because subsection (b) states that \u201c[t]he Attorney General\u201d may seek restraining orders \u201c[pjending [a] final\u201d adjudication, we view such interim relief as available only to the United States, not to a private person.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In contrast, we interpret \u00a7 1964(c) as not authorizing awards of treble damages or attorneys\u2019 fees to the United States. Subsection (c) allows awards of that type of relief to a \u201cperson,\u201d a term defined as \u201cany individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(3). And while the United States is capable of owning property, the term \u201cperson\u201d in RICO is used in \u00a7 1964 to apply both to potential plaintiffs (subsection (c)) and to potential defendants (subsection (a)). As there is no indication that that word was meant to have differing meanings in the same section, and as there is no indication that Congress intended RICO to waive the United States\u2019s sovereign immunity \u2014 as would be required for the United States to be a defendant \u2014 we have concluded that the United States does not come within the RICO definition of \u201cperson.\u201d See United States v. Bonanno Organized Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra, 879 F.2d 20, 21-27 (2d Cir. 1989) (affirming dismissal of the government\u2019s action brought under \u00a7 1964(c)). Thus, subsection (c) excludes the federal government from those to whom a court may award treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">While subsections (b) and (c) limit the categories of plaintiffs to which the relief they respectively specify may be granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>we do not interpret those subsections as limiting the authorized relief to the types they mention, he., as excluding relief that the federal courts are authorized to grant under subsection (a). To read the subsections after subsection (a) as limiting the nature of the relief that may be granted to the persons identified in those subsequent subsections would mean that although the Attorney General can be granted an injunction \u201c[pjending\u201d the final adjudication of the case, she could not get any other relief such as a permanent injunction. The most sensible reading of subsection (b), in our view, is that the interim relief identified in that subsection is available only to the United States, which is relief in addition to that which it may be granted under subsection (a). By parity of reasoning, we read subsection (c) as meaning that only a \u201cperson\u201d may sue for money damages, but that that right is in addition to the relief that the court has power to grant under subsection (a). As the Seventh Circuit stated, the sentence in subsection (b) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai8\">\u201c[t]he Attorney General may institute proceedings under this section\u201d is ... the equivalent of the first clause in \u00a7 1964(c), which says \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court[ ]....\u201d Neither one addresses what remedy the plaintiff may seek.[] Given that the government\u2019s authority to seek injunctions comes from the combination of the grant of a right of action to the Attorney General in \u00a7 1964(b) and the grant of district court authority to enter injunctions in \u00a7 1964(a), we see no reason not to conclude, by parity of reasoning, that private parties can also seek injunctions under the combination of grants in \u00a7\u00a7 1964(a) and (c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">NOW I, 267 F.3d at 697 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1964(b) and (c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">As the NOW I decision noted, the interpretation of \u00a7 1964 as authorizing the grant of equitable relief to private plaintiffs is consistent with Congress\u2019s intent \u201cto \u2018encourag[e] civil litigation to supplement Government efforts to deter and penalize the ... prohibited practices. The object of civil RICO is thus not merely to compensate victims but to turn them into prosecutors, \u201cprivate attorneys general,\u201d dedicated to eliminating racketeering activity.\u2019 \u201d NOW I, 267 F.3d at 698 (quoting Rotella v. Wood, 528 U.S. 549, 557, 120 S.Ct. 1075, 145 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2000)); cf. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.

Section 1964(b) makes it clear that the statute is to be publicly enforced by the Attorney General and it specifies additional remedies, all in the nature of interim relief, that the government may seek. Section 1964(c) similarly adds to the scope of \u00a7 1964(a), but this time for private plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIk\">NOW I, 267 F.3d at 696 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">Given this interpretation, we reject Don-ziger\u2019s contention that' equitable relief is not available to Chevron under RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">Nor can we agree that such relief is unavailable because the amount that the Ecuadorian Judgment will actually cost Chevron is unsure. Statements that a RICO private plaintiff cannot recover without showing an injury that is \u201cquantifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>able,\u201d see McLaughlin v. American Tobacco Co., 522 F.3d 215, 227 (2d Cir. 2008), are relevant in eases in which the plaintiff seeks treble damages, for in order for the court to \u201ctreble\u201d an amount, the factfinder must first know the amount; but such statements generally focus on whether the cause of action has accrued. See, e.g., Bankers Trust Co. v. Rhoades, 859 F.2d 1096, 1106 (2d Cir. 1988) (finding \u00a7 1964(c) damages claim unripe because \u201cit is impossible to determine the amount of damages that would be necessary to make plaintiff whole\u201d \u201cuntil it suffers the injury\u201d (emphasis added)), cert denied, 490 U.S. 1007, 109 S.Ct. 1643, 104 L.Ed.2d 158 (1989). Similarly, the occurrence of the injury is the focus of statements that the private plaintiff in a RICO action must show injury that is \u201cclear and definite.\u201d E.g., First Nationwide Bank v. Gelt Funding Corp., 27 F.3d 763, 768 (2d Cir. 1994), cert denied, 513 U.S. 1079, 115 S.Ct. 728, 130 L.Ed.2d 632 (1995). But Chevron\u2019s injury is in part its liability on an $8,646 billion judgment obtained through a pattern of racketeering activity; that injury, affecting its net worth, is clear and definite. The inability to predict whether that entire amount will be collected from Chevron does not affect the amount of the liability imposed. And the difficulty in calculating the amount of money damages that would be needed to redress the entire loss is a common basis for the granting of equitable relief. See, e.g., Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc., 356 F.3d 393, 404 (2d Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In sum, we reject Donziger\u2019s contention that RICO does not authorize the granting of equitable relief to a private plaintiff that has proven injury to its business or property by reason of a defendant\u2019s violation of \u00a7 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">E. The Availability of Equitable Relief Under New York Common Law</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Chevron did not assert RICO claims against the LAPs, and the district court based its grant of equitable relief against the LAP Representatives \u2014 for procurement of the Judgment by means of fraud \u2014 on principles of common law. The court also based the relief it granted against Donziger on that common-law theory as well as on RICO. D\u00f3nziger and the LAP Representatives contend that the district court lacked authority to grant such relief under common law, arguing that New York\u2019s adoption of the Recognition Act supplanted the common-law cause of action for relief from a judgment procured by fraud, and that even if the common-law cause of action survives, Chevron should not have been granted equitable relief because adequate relief at law was available. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">While there is a strong interest in the finality of judgments, such that assertions of fraud that are intrinsic to the claim that led to entry of a judgment may be entertained only by direct appeal or by motion to vacate made to the court that rendered the judgment, see, e.g., N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5015, D. Siegel, Practice Commentaries; Crouse v. McVickar, 207 N.Y. 213, 100 N.E. 697 (1912); Vinokur v. Penny Lane Owners Corp., 269 A.D.2d 226, 703 N.Y.S.2d 35 (1st Dep\u2019t 2000), New York common law has long recognized that equitable relief may be granted to a person victimized by the procurement of a judgment through fraud that is extrinsic to the gravamen of the cause of action, see, e.g., Ward v. Town of Southfield, 102 N.Y. 287, 292-93, 6 N.E. 660, 661 (1886) (\u201cWard\u201d); Gray v.

They do not pretend to direct or control the foreign court, but without regard to the situation of the subject-matter of the dispute, they consider the equities between the parties and decree in personam according to those.equities and enforce obedience to their decrees by process in per-sonam....

Mora Hotel Corp. N.V., 100 N.Y.2d 215, 221, 762 N.Y.S.2d 5, 9, 792 N.E.2d 155 (2003). In requesting enactment of the bill that would become the Recognition Act by' incorporating the \u201cUniform Foreign Money-Judgments . Recognition Act,\u201d New York\u2019s Judicial Conference stated that the goal was to gain better reciprocity for New York\u2019s judgments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-19\">The basic purpose of this proposal is to procure for New York judgments in foreign countries much better reciprocal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>treatment at the hands of foreign courts than they now receive. The lack of recognition often accorded to New York judgments in foreign countries stems in large part from the fact that many foreign countries of civil law background do not accept decisional law as proof that New York treats foreign judgments liberally, but they rather require statutory proof of this fact. It is the opinion of experts in the field of international litigation that this codifying legislation would answer the requirements of the courts in many foreign countries and would therefore result in obtaining better treatment for New York citizens engaged in litigation abroad....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">The Uniform Act codifies, rather than reforms, existing United States decisional law respecting the recognition of foreign country judgments at a level below that presently accorded to them by New York courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">New York Judicial Conference Memorandum in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1970, ch. 981, at 2 (emphases in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Nothing in the legislative history of the Recognition Act stated that its enactment was intended to abrogate the above line of common-law cases recognizing the authority of courts of equity to grant in personam relief from a judgment procured by fraud. And indeed, since the enactment of the Recognition Act in 1970, that authority has continued to be exercised. See, e.g., Tamimi v. Tamimi, 38 A.D.2d 197, 328 N.Y.S.2d 477 (2d Dep\u2019t 1972) (reversing the posttrial dismissal of an action collaterally attacking a Thai divorce judgment allegedly procured by fraud). The Tamimi court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">[i]t is a rule well settled, that every judgment may be impeached for fraud, and this applies as well to judgments of our own State, as to those of other States or foreign judgments....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">In Marine Ins. Co. of Alexandria v. Hodgson (7 Cranch 332, 336, [11 U.S.] 332, 3 L.Ed. 362 [ (1831) ]) Chief Justice MARSHALL said: \u201cthat any fact which clearly proves it to be against conscience to execute a judgment, and of which the injured party could not have availed himself in a Court of law; or of which he might have availed himself at law, but was prevented by fraud or accident unmixed with any fault or negligence in himself or his agents, will justify an application to a Court of Chancery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">Id. at 200, 328 N.Y.S.2d at 480 (other internal quotation marks omitted (emphasis ours)). In the course of its opinion, the Tamimi court also cited such cases as Davis, Trebilcox, and Gray. We cannot conclude that New York common law ceased, in 1970, to allow New York courts to grant equitable in personam relief to a person victimized by a judgment procured by fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">Nor are we persuaded that the district court erred in concluding that equitable relief was appropriate because there was no adequate remedy at law. Although Don-ziger argued in the district court that any injury from satisfaction of a monetary judgment could be remedied by an award of money damages, the district court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-14\">[t]he LAP Representatives are indigenous people living in the Ecuadorian rainforest. Both they and Donziger repeatedly have cited their lack of resources as reasons to delay this action. Donziger\u2019s claim, in particular, is strikingly at odds with innumerable representations to this Court concerning his claimed lack of resources. In such circumstances, the theoretical availability of an action [by Chevron] for damages is and always was entirely immaterial. As Justice Scalia has written, while econom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ic injury usually \u201cis not considered irreparable, ... that is because money can usually be recovered from the person to whom it is paid. If the expenditures cannot be recouped, the resulting loss may be irreparable.\u201d That is this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 638 (footnotes omitted) (quoting Philip Morris USA Inc. v. Scott, \u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1, 4, 177 L.Ed.2d 1040 (2010) (other internal quotation marks omitted (emphases ours))).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Nor does Chevron\u2019s right to defend against enforcement actions provide a basis for finding that it has an adequate remedy at law, given that the Donziger and Invictas strategy is to inundate Chevron with such actions, forcing it to incur sizeable legal fees. Even if Chevron prevailed in every such action, its legal expenses would likely not be recoverable from the impecunious LAPs or Donziger. See id. at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">We conclude that the district court had authority under New York common law to grant equitable relief against Donziger and the LAP Representatives over whom the court had personal jurisdiction (see Part II.G. below).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">F. Considerations of International Comity</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">Donziger, the LAP Representatives, and several of the amici curiae contend that the District Court Judgment should be overturned on the ground that it violates principles of international comity. Indeed, Donziger argues that this is required by our opinion in Naranjo. For several reasons, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">First, the injunction at issue in Naranjo (\u201cNaranjo injunction\u201d) purported to enjoin Donziger and all of the LAPs, directly or indirectly, from taking any actions to enforce the Lago Agrio Judgment. In contrast, the injunction in the District Court Judgment is directed at only three persons \u2014 Donziger (including his Firm) and the two LAP Representatives over whom the district court has personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">Second, the geographic scope of the Naranjo injunction and scope of the injunction granted in the District Court Judgment are different. The Naranjo injunction was essentially global, prohibiting actions toward enforcement of the Judgment anywhere outside of Ecuador, see, e.g., Naranjo, 667 F.3d at 238 n.10. The geographic scope of the present District Court Judgment anti-enforcement injunction against the LAP Representatives is limited to the United States: Donziger and the LAP Representatives are enjoined from taking actions toward enforcement in courts of the United States; but \u201cnothing []in [the District Court Judgment] enjoins, restrains or otherwise prohibits Donziger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the LAP Representatives, or any of them, from ... filing or prosecuting any action for recognition or enforcement of the Judgment ... in courts outside the United States....\u201d District Court Judgment \u00b6 6 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The district court noted that \u201cthe Judgment has been enforceable in Ecuador, and elsewhere, at least since the intermediate appellate court ruled,\u201d and \u201c[ajssets already have been seized in Ecuador.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 637. The court noted that even if Chevron could pursue its claims of LAPs\u2019 team corruption in Ecuador\u2019s Constitutional Court (a route never suggested by the opinions of the Ecuadorian Appeal Division or National Court, which referred only to the actions in the United States (see Part II.F. below)), \u201c[g]iven the size of the Judgment and the comparative impecuniousness of the defendants, there is no assurance that Chevron could recoup property applied to the Judgment between now and any decision by the Constitutional Court even if it prevailed.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 637. The district court also noted that Don-ziger and the LAPs had, in addition, \u201ctaken extensive steps to ensure that any funds recovered are held offshore and beyond the reach either of U.S. or Ecuadorian courts.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Thus, the present injunction, unlike the Naranjo injunction, is not global; and no part of it purports to limit in any way the conduct of any of the LAPs \u2014 the actual judgment creditors \u2014 other than the two LAP Representatives. It does not invalidate the Lago Agrio Judgment; and it does not prohibit any of the judgment creditors \u2014 including the LAP Representatives \u2014 from taking action to enforce the Judgment outside of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">To the extent that Donziger and/or the LAP Representatives will receive or have received property from enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, the District Court Judgment imposes on them a constructive trust for the benefit of Chevron. It does so in order to \u201cprevent[] the three defendants who appeared at trial- \u2014 over whom [the district court] has personal jurisdiction \u2014 from profiting from their fraud.\u201d Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 644. But that is an aspect of this matter on which the Ecuadorian courts have essentially deferred to the courts of the United States:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The appeal from the global preliminary injunction was heard in Naranjo in September 2011, and the panel promptly issued an order that vacated the injunction in its entirety .and halted all proceedings on Chevron\u2019s declaratory judgment claim, stating that an opinion would follow. Thereafter, even before our Naranjo opinion was issued on January 26, 2012, the Appeal Division in Ecuador twice stated that it was beyond the Division\u2019s domain to entertain Chevron\u2019s fraud allegations. The Appeal Division in its initial Opinion on January 3, 2012, stated that the Chevron claim of \u201cfraud and corruption\u201d by the LAPs and their legal team was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">a matter to which this Division should not refer at all, except to let it be emphasized that the same accusations are pending resolution before authorities of the United States of America due to a complaint that has been filed by the very defendant here, Chevron, under what is known as the RICO act, and this Division has no competence to rule on the conduct of counsel, experts or other officials or administrators and auxiliaries of justice....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">(Appeal Division Opinion at 10 (emphases added).) And in its January 13, 2012 Clarification Order, the Division similarly stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">it stays out of these accusations, preserving the parties\u2019 rights ... to continue the course of the actions that have been filed in the United States of America.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">(Appeal Division Clarification Order at 4 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">When the Naranjo opinion was issued, it expressed concerns as to whether the declaratory and global injunctive relief Chevron had requested would cause \u201cfriction between sovereign legal systems or improperly encroach on the domain of a state or foreign court,\u201d 667 F.3d at 245 (internal quotation marks omitted). And perhaps it would have. But no such friction or encroachment should be seen in the limited, non-global equitable relief granted by the district court in its final judgment adjudicating Chevron\u2019s claims of fraud and corruption. When the Ecuadorian National Court issued its decision some 22 months after the Naranjo opinion \u2014 and after Chevron\u2019s claim for a declaratory judgment invalidating the Lago Agrio Judgment had been dismissed \u2014 the National Court endorsed the Ecuadorian Appeal Division\u2019s decisions that \u201cpreserv[ed]\u201d Chev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ron\u2019s right to seek relief in the United States courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap\">it is clear that, by preserving the rights and actions of the parties, the court acknowledges the lack o[f] jurisdiction to decide whether or not there has been procedural fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">(Opinion of Ecuadorian National Court of Justice at 120 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">In these circumstances, in which the district court has, on the claims of corruption, granted equitable in personam relief that does not invalidate the Ecuadorian judgment, and in which the Ecuadorian courts have expressly disclaimed jurisdiction to address the corruption claims and stated that the matter is preserved for adjudication in the United States courts, international comity is not an obstacle to the present District Court Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">G. Contentions of the LAP Representatives</p>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">The LAP Representatives have advanced arguments paralleling those made by Donziger, contending that the Ecuadorian appellate decisions cleansed the pro-LAPs judgment of any taint from wrongdoing by Donziger (see, e.g., LAP Representatives brief on appeal at 23, 25, 34, 49, 51-52, 65), that international comity demanded that those decisions be so treated (see, e.g., id. at 63-65), and that injunctive relief against them was foreclosed by this Court\u2019s decision in Naranjo (see, e.g., id. at 83-85). We reject those arguments for the reasons set out in Parts II.C.-II.F. above. In addition, the LAP Representatives seek reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment against them on the grounds that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over them and that they were not responsible for wrongdoing by Donziger. They also argue that the district court judgment should be vacated because of the absence of parties the LAP Representatives term \u201cindispensable\u201d (LAP Representatives\u2019 brief on appeal at 78-83), to wit, (1) the other LAPs (who are named as defendants but who have defaulted), (2) indigenous Ecuadorian non-LAPs such as the Waorani (who were not parties to the Lago Agrio Litigation and whose motion to intervene in the present action the LAP Representatives opposed), and (3) the Republic of Ecuador (against which no relief in the present action was either sought or granted). None of these contentions is persuasive. Only the arguments as to lack of personal jurisdiction and lack of responsibility for the acts of Donziger warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">1. Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b171-17\">The district court rejected the LAP Representatives\u2019 personal jurisdiction defenses on two grounds. First, following noncompliance by the LAP Representatives with discovery orders to produce documents related to their contention that personal jurisdiction was lacking, the court, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A), sanctioned them by striking the personal jurisdiction defenses. See Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 296 F.R.D. 168, 220-21 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). Second, catering to the possibility that that sanction could be overturned on appeal, the court stated that it would nonetheless receive evidence at trial on the personal jurisdiction issue and make findings on that issue, see id. at 221; following the trial, the court ruled that it would have jurisdiction over the LAP Representatives under New York\u2019s long-arm statute, N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1), see Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 617-28. The LAP Representatives contest both decisions. Finding no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s imposition of the sanction, we affirm the striking of the personal jurisdiction defenses, without the need to address the court\u2019s posttrial ruling. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>In the district court, Camacho and Piag-uaje had moved to dismiss the action against them for lack of personal jurisdiction, arguing that their retention of New York attorneys and their participation in litigations against Chevron in New York were insufficient to provide jurisdiction over them under the New York long-arm statutes. The district court determined that the motion involved arguments and facts that went beyond the allegations in Chevron\u2019s complaint and that discovery was needed in order to assess the defenses. The court denied the motion to dismiss, without prejudice to renewal following the completion of discovery. See generally Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 296 F.R.D. at 199-200.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">In June 2012, Chevron served a request on the LAP Representatives for the production of documents in the possession of their Ecuadorian lawyers and other associates, including documents relating to the LAP Representatives\u2019 personal jurisdiction defenses. The LAP Representatives objected, \u201clodging] boilerplate objections\u201d such as privilege and work product, but without providing the descriptions required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5)(A); they also \u201cpurported to invoke Ecuadorian law, on an \u2018and/or\u2019 basis, [but] they failed to identify any particular Ecuadorian law or decisions said to preclude disclosure.\u201d Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 296 F.R.D. at 187 nn.77, 79. The LAP Representatives did not object to the demand for \u201cresponsive documents in the physical possession of their Ecuadorian attorneys and allies on the ground that they lacked control over or practical ability to procure the. documents from them.\u201d Id. at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In August 2012, Chevron moved to compel production of the responsive documents. In response, the LAP Representatives made a specific argument, \u201cfor the first time,\u201d that Ecuadorian law prohibited their attorneys from releasing the documents, id.; they argued, on a group-privilege theory, that where an attorney represents a group of clients, he cannot provide to any individual client his or her own documents (or any documents belonging to the group) without the express permission of every member of the group. The LAP Representatives submitted a declaration from an Ecuadorian lawyer supporting their position; Chevron submitted a declaration from an Ecuadorian lawyer who opined that their argument was erroneous. The LAP Representatives did not produce any responsive documents in the possession, custody, or control of their Ecuadorian agents or attorneys. See id. at 187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Chevron\u2019s motion to compel remained pending until February 2013. In late January 2013, the LAP Representatives informed the district court that an Ecuadorian court had granted one of the LAPs who defaulted in the present case, Octavio Ismael C\u00f3rdova Huanca (\u201cCordova\u201d), an injunction against the LAPs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 production of documents. This was the first information the district court received that such an injunction action had been brought. Evidence subsequently submitted to the district court revealed that the Ecuadorian injunction action had been commenced in October 2012 at the request\u2014 made to Fajardo \u2014 of United States lawyers representing the LAP Representatives. In that action, Cordova was the plaintiff, Fajardo was a defendant, and Fajardo argued in support of Cordova\u2019s request for an injunction. See generally Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 296 F.R.D. at 187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">By order dated February 11, 2013, the district court granted Chevron\u2019s motion to compel the production of documents held by the LAP Representatives\u2019 Ecuadorian attorneys and agents. With respect to all responsive documents as to which there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>was no claim of work product or privilege, the court ordered production by March 6, 2013. The order also instructed defendants to inform the court by February 20 whether or not they would comply with the order. \u201cThe defendants responded that they would not.\u201d Id. at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Chevron thereafter moved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 for sanctions, including contempt and default judgments, see, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(vi) (a \u201cjust order[ ].... may include ... rendering a default judgment against the disobedient party\u201d). Following briefing and an eviden-tiary hearing, the district court \u201cdecline[d] to impose the harshest of these sanctions, notwithstanding defendants\u2019 obdurate and quite possibly contemptuous refusal to comply with their discovery obligations.\u201d Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 296 F.R.D. at 220. It concluded that the less severe sanction of striking the LAP Representatives\u2019 personal jurisdiction defenses was appropriate, as it was commensurate with their noncompliance and would restore Chevron to the position it would presumably have enjoyed had the discovery orders been obeyed and the relevant documents been produced. See id. at 220-21. The court\u2019s ruling, issued on October 10, 2013, stated that the personal jurisdiction defenses asserted by the LAP Representatives would be stricken unless they produced the required documents by October 24, 2013. They did not do so; their personal jurisdiction defenses were thus stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Rule 37(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows the court in which an action is pending to impose on a party who has failed to obey a discovery order a \u201cjust\u201d sanction, which may include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">(i)directing that the matters embraced in the order or other designated facts be taken as established for purposes of the action, as the prevailing party claims;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">(ii) prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from introducing designated matters in evidence; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">(iii) striking pleadings in whole or in part....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(iii). \u201cSevere sanctions\u201d may be \u201cjustified ... when the failure to comply with a court order is due to willfulness or bad faith, or is otherwise culpable.\u201d Daval Steel Products v. M/V Fakredine, 951 F.2d 1357, 1367 (2d Cir. 1991) (affirming the district court\u2019s granting of the plaintiffs claim and precluding a defendant from presenting evidence in opposition to it, in light of that defendant\u2019s \u201cwillful violation of the court\u2019s discovery order and prior obstruction of discovery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">In fashioning an appropriate Rule 37 sanction, the court may permissibly \u201cpresume from a party\u2019s willful failure to answer a discovery request relating to a particular issue that the facts of that issue are established against the noncompliant party.\u201d Southern New England Telephone Co. v. Global NAPs Inc., 624 F.3d 123, 147 (2d Cir. 2010). A defendant who has failed to obey a district court\u2019s order to produce information relating to his defense of lack of personal jurisdiction may properly be sanctioned by the striking of his personal jurisdiction defense. See Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 705, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">A district court\u2019s decision to impose a sanction, and the court\u2019s selection among permissible sanctions, are reviewed for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639, 642, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 49 L.Ed.2d 747 (1976). Such an abuse may consist of an error of law, a clearly erroneous finding of fact, or a decision that cannot be located within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>range of permissible decisions. See, e.g., SEC v. Razmilovic, 738 F.3d 14, 25 (2d Cir. 2013), cert. denied,-U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 1564, 188 L.Ed.2d 561 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The district court made detailed findings as to why the imposition of sanctions on the LAP Representatives in this case was appropriate, see Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 296 F.R.D. at 207-20, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">\u2022 \u201c[T]he LAP Representatives\u2019 U.S. counsel \u2014 while continuously telling this Court that they had asked Fajar-do for the LAPs\u2019 documents \u2014 at the same time secretly suggested to him that he initiate a lawsuit in Ecuador in an effort to foreclose that very possibility.\u201d Id. at 215.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">\u2022 In that secret lawsuit, Fajardo stated to the Ecuadorian court, \u201c \u2018 \u201cwe have discussed this matter and decided to turn over the information Chevron is demanding,\u201d \u2019 \u201d id. at 216 (quoting Cordova decision (quoting Fajardo representation) (first emphasis ours, second emphasis in Donziger)), while contemporaneously in the present case, the LAP Representatives\u2019 United States lawyer represented to the district court, \u201c \u2018I have asked [Ecuadorian counsel] in person for the documents, and the [Ecuadorian] lawyer has said, I can\u2019t give them to you,\u2019 \u201d Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 296 F.R.D. at 214 (quoting Oct. 18, 2012 hearing transcript (emphasis ours)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">\u2022 Although \u201c[t]he LAP Representatives opposed Chevron\u2019s motion on the ground that [an] alleged Ecuadorian \u2018group secrecy\u2019 law prevented Fajardo from turning over the LAPs\u2019 documents without the express permission of all his clients,\u201d Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 296 F.R.D. at 214, in fact \u201cFajardo h[eld] a broad power of attorney on behalf of all of the LAPs.... He thus was in a position to facilitate all of the U.S. discovery on behalf of all of them, not to mention himself, had he wished to do so. He likewise was in a position to have resisted the Cordova suit, both individually and on behalf of the other LAPs, had he so desired,\u201d id. at 215 n.284 (emphases added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-16\">\u2022 Although the LAP Representatives claimed they had no control over the documents, the Fajardo Retainer Agreement stated that \u201cThe Plaintiffs\u2019 files shall be and remain the property of the Plaintiffs\u201d; nonetheless, the LAP Representatives did not \u201cthreaten to sue or fire Fajardo for his refusal to provide them with the documents so they could comply with th[e District] Court\u2019s order.\u201d Id. at 217-18 &amp; n.297 (internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-17\">\u2022 The LAP Representatives \u201cdid not inform Chevron or the Court about the [Cordova] lawsuit until they were told Fajardo had received his desired result and the injunction had been granted.... Even assuming that Ecuadorian law did not require notice to or joinder of Chevron on an indispensable party or other basis, the LAPs\u2019 concealment of the action, especially given the ongoing litigation in this Court concerning the production of the Ecuadorian documents, was done in bad faith.\u201d Id. at 215-16 (emphases added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akt\">\u2022 The LAP Representatives\u2019 claim that they had no control over the documents and were enjoined from producing them was finally belied as a practical matter by the fact that shortly before the start of trial, their list of planned trial exhibits included previously unproduced documents from Ecuador that \u201cclearly were re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>sponsive to Chevron\u2019s document requests,\u201d and \u201clikely would fall within the definition of materials the production of which was barred by\u201d the Cor-dova order. Id. at 218-19 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In challenging the order striking their personal jurisdiction defenses, Camacho and Piaguaje argue principally (1) that they were improperly \u201cpunished ... for their Ecuadorian lawyers\u2019 failure to respond to Chevron\u2019s discovery demands\u201d (LAP Representatives\u2019 brief on appeal at 73); (2) that they \u201cwere not in a position to direct ... Ecuadorian counsel[ ] to comply with discovery demands of which they were ignorant, and the significance of which they could not understand\u201d (id. at 76-77); and (3) that the .information requested \u201cwas already fully discoverable from Mr. Donziger\u201d (id. at-77).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">These arguments are meritless. Addressing them in reverse order, we note that the supposed availability of documents from Donziger is squarely contradicted by the fact that Donziger himself also refused to comply with Chevron\u2019s discovery demands, see Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 296 F.R.D. at 188-89. The second argument\u2014 ignorance and lack of understanding \u2014 is untenable in light of the fact that Camacho and Piaguaje were represented in the present litigation by counsel; any lack of knowledge of the discovery demands served on their United States lawyers and any failure to understand the significance of those demands is the responsibility of the LAP Representatives and the attorneys they chose to represent them. And the argument that the LAP Representatives\u2019s failure to respond was a choice by the Ecuadorian lawyers, rather than the responsibility of the LAP Representatives themselves, is belied by the district court\u2019s findings that, inter alia, the LAP Representatives\u2019 own agents, their United States lawyers, while representing to the district court that they had asked the Ecuadorian attorneys to provide the documents, instead had in fact asked the Ecuadorian attorneys to get an injunction forbidding production. The LAP Representatives \u201cdid not attempt meaningfully to comply with Chevron\u2019s document requests or the Court\u2019s order compelling production,\u201d but \u201c[ijnstead ... sought a court order preventing the production,\u201d which \u201cin and of itself is evidence of bad faith. \u2018Evidence that parties or targets have actively sought a prohibition against disclosure ... may be regarded as evidence of bad faith and justification for sanctions in accordance with Subsection 2(b) [of \u00a7 442].\u2019 \u201d Id. at 217 &amp; n.292 (quoting Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law \u00a7 442 comment h (1987)); see id. \u00a7 442(2)(b) (court may impose sanctions for deliberate concealment).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The LAP Representatives have not argued, or presented any basis for inferring, that any of the district court\u2019s factual findings- is clearly erroneous. As we see no error of law, nor any other basis for concluding that the striking of the personal jurisdiction defenses was an abuse of discretion, we affirm that sanction substantially for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s decision, see 296 F.R.D. at 207-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">2. Responsibility of the LAPs for the Misconduct of Their Attorneys</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">The LAP Representatives contend that any misdeeds by Donziger did not provide a basis for the district court to grant relief against them, arguing that they were unaware of any misconduct, \u201chad absolutely no control over the[ir] so-called \u2018agents,\u2019 \u201d and are simply \u201cunsophisticated client-principals following the lawyers\u2019 lead\u201d (LAP Representatives brief on appeal at 50, 71-73; reply brief on appeal at 9). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>As an initial matter, there is no authority suggesting that a party ignorant of its attorney\u2019s fraudulent actions may enforce a fraudulently procured judgment. To hold otherwise would run afoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s warning that fraud \u201cis a wrong against the institutions set up to protect and safeguard the public, institutions in which fraud cannot complacently be tolerated consistently with the good order of society.\u201d Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 246, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944). Even innocent clients may not benefit from the fraud of their attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">As a general matter, a client-principal is \u201cbound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.\u201d Link v. Wabash RR. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 634, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962); see, e.g., Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Limited Partnership, 507 U.S. 380, 396-97, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993); United States v. Boyle, 469 U.S. 241, 251-52, 105 S.Ct. 687, 83 L.Ed.2d 622 (1985). This rule rests upon \u201cwell-settled principles of agency law,\u201d Maples v. Thomas, \u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 912, 922, 181 L.Ed.2d 807 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is well established that \u201c[a] principal is subject to liability to a third party harmed by an agent\u2019s conduct when the agent\u2019s conduct is\u201d either \u201cwithin the scope of the agent\u2019s actual authority or ratified by the principal.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.04 (2006) (emphasis added). A principal ratifies his or her agent\u2019s act either by \u201cmanifesting assent that the act shall affect the person\u2019s legal relations\u201d or through \u201cconduct that justifies a reasonable assumption that the person so consents.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4.01(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The district court found the LAP Representatives liable on the basis that they (along with the other LAPs) retained Don-ziger as their attorney and gave Fajardo power of attorney. See Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 477-78, 566 n,1304.-This finding is amply supported by the record, as the LAPs in November 2010 granted Fa-jardo a new power of attorney that expressly ratified all of his prior acts, direct or indirect, in pursuit of their litigation interests. With the LAPs being defined as the \u201cPrincipals,\u201d the document states, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">The Principals point out that this is an expansion of the scope of the power of attorney that has been granted to the same professional previously, for which reason the Principals ratify and approve each and every one of the actions undertaken by Attorney Pablo Fajardo Mendoza in [the Lago Agrio Litigation] as well as in any other legal actions in other courts of justice, whether national or foreign; all financial or administrative acts and acts which have been carried out directly or through other persons he legally authorizes for the defense of our interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">(PX 390 (Fajardo Special Power of Attorney), at 4-5 (emphases added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">Given the collaborative actions of Don-ziger and Fajardo described in Part I above to secure the Lago Agrio Judgment for the LAP Representatives and the other LAPs, there was no error in the district court\u2019s ruling that the LAP Representatives are responsible for injury to Chevron perpetrated by Donziger in his capacity as their attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">H. Appropriateness of the Equitable Relief Granted</p>\n<p id=\"b176-17\">Having concluded that the district court had authority to grant equitable relief to Chevron against Donziger and the LAP Representatives, he., the defendants over whom it had personal jurisdiction, and that the normal preconditions for such relief were present, we review the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>fashioned only for abuse of discretion. The inability of the court to grant Chevron complete relief is not a basis for a complaint about its granting of partial relief. \u201cThe essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case. Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished it.\u201d Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329, 64 S.Ct. 587, 88 L.Ed. 754 (1944). \u201cIn shaping equity decrees, the trial court is vested with broad discretionary power; appellate review is correspondingly narrow.\u201d Lemon v. Kurtzman, 411 U.S. 192, 200, 93 S.Ct. 1463, 36 L.Ed.2d 151 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Chevron asked the district court not only for specific relief, but also, \u201cAs to All Causes of Aetion[,] ... such other legal and equitable relief as the Court may deem Chevron is entitled to receive.\u201d (Amended Complaint, Prayer for Relief \u00b6 11.) The relief tailored by the district court, while prohibiting Donziger and the LAP Representatives from seeking enforcement of the Ecuadorian judgment in the United States, does not invalidate the Ecuadorian judgment and does not prohibit any of the LAPs from seeking enforcement of that judgment anywhere outside of the United States. What it does is prohibit Donziger and the LAP Representatives from profiting from the corrupt conduct that led to the entry of the Judgment against Chevron, by imposing on them a constructive trust for the benefit of Chevron. \u201c[AJssets acquired by fraud are subject to a constructive trust for the benefit of the defrauded party.\u201d SEC v. Credit Bancorp, Ltd., 290 F.3d 80, 88 (2d Cir. 2002). As the district court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">\u201c[a] constructive trust is the formula through which the conscience of equity finds expression. When property has been acquired in such circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial interest, equity converts him into a trustee.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Donziger, 974 F.Supp.2d at 639 (quoting Beatty v. Guggenheim Exploration Co., 225 N.Y. 380, 386, 122 N.E. 378, 380 (1919)).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Given all of the above considerations, including the Ecuadorian courts\u2019 statements deferring to the United States courts for adjudication of Chevron\u2019s allegations of corruption by the LAPs\u2019 legal team (see Part II.F. above), and the district court\u2019s unchallenged findings of fact as to the fraud, coercion, and bribery engaged in by the LAPs\u2019 team (see Parts I.B.-I.G. above), we see no abuse of discretion in the equitable in personam relief granted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">We have considered all of the arguments of Donziger and the LAP Representatives on this appeal and have found in them no basis for dismissal or reversal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
