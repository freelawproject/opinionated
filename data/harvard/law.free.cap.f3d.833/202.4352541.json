Excessive fragmentation of bargaining units was viewed to increase the potential for labor unrest, which could be particularly harmful to the public in the health care setting. The resulting rule, known as the Health Care Rule, established eight standardized bargaining units for acute-care hospitals. The list of standardized units includes, for instance, registered nurses, skilled maintenance employees, and guards. On a prospective basis, the Rule deems the eight enumerated units to be the only appropriate bargaining units in acute-care hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">This case concerns the application of the Health Care Rule on a retrospective basis \u2014 in particular, to preexisting bargaining units that did not conform to the eight standardized units set forth in the Rule. The Rule calls for the Board to address preexisting nonconforming units through case-by-case adjudication. But the Rule prescribes that, if there is a petition to represent an additional unit in a hospital with preexisting nonconforming units, the Board may find the additional unit appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>priate only if it comports, to the extent practicable, with one of the eight standardized units.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The Board understands that aspect of .the Rule to apply as follows: in any representation election that would create a new bargaining unit, the new unit must include all unrepresented employees who would be grouped together in one of the Rule\u2019s standardized units. So, for instance, if the new bargaining unit would include any unrepresented registered nurses, the new unit must include <em>all </em>unrepresented registered nurses, not just some of them. That approach tends to minimize the number of employees who would be left unrepresented, thereby limiting the potential for further proliferation of bargaining units in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The question in this case is whether the same understanding of the Rule governs in the case of an election to add unrepresented employees to a preexisting bargaining unit, as opposed to an election to create a new bargaining unit. In other words, when a union seeks to add unrepresented employees to a preexisting nonconforming unit, must the unit embrace all (and not just some) of the unrepresented employees who would fit within the same standardized unit in the Rule? The Board\u2019s answer is no. The Board reasons that the addition of employees to an already existing unit\u2014 unlike the creation of a new unit \u2014 necessarily keeps the number of bargaining units constant. It therefore does not implicate the core concern of the Rule, i.e., proliferation of additional bargaining units.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The petitioner in this case, an acute-care facility, argues that the Board\u2019s distinction between preexisting units and new units under the Rule is arbitrary and incompatible with the Board\u2019s own precedent. We disagree. We therefore uphold the Board\u2019s understanding that the Rule is inapplicable in the context of elections to add employees to a preexisting unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Although established in 1935, the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s first major foray into formal rulemaking did not come until its promulgation of the Health Care Rule more than five decades later, in 1989. <em>Am. Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. NLRB, </em>499 U.S. 606, 608, 111 S.Ct. 1539, 113 L.Ed.2d 675 (1991); <em>San Miguel Hosp. Corp. v. NLRB, </em>697 F.3d 1181, 1184 (D.C. Cir. 2012). As relevant here, the Rule addressed Congress\u2019s concerns about undue proliferation of bargaining units in health care facilities. <em>See Am. Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>499 U.S. at 615-17, 111 S.Ct. 1539; S. Rep. No. 93-766 (1974), <em>as reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3946, 3950; Collective-Bargaining Units in the Health Care Industry, 54 Fed. Reg. 16,-336-01, 16,345-46 (Apr. 21, 1989) (to be codified at 29 C.F.R. pt. 103). An excessive number of bargaining units increases the prospect of jurisdictional disputes and work stoppages, potentially impairing the provision of health care services to the public. <em>See </em>Collective-Bargaining Units in the Health Care Industry, 53 Fed. Reg. 33900-01, 33906 (Sept. 1, 1988); <em>Am. Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>499 U.S. at 615, 111 S.Ct. 1539.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">In response, the Health Care Rule established the following eight standardized bargaining units for acute-care hospitals: registered nurses, physicians, professionals other than registered nurses and physicians, technical employees, skilled maintenance employees, business office clerical employees, guards, and all other nonprofessional employees. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.30(a); <em>San Miguel Hosp. Corp., </em>697 F.3d at 1183. Under the Rule, the collective bargaining units in an acute-care hospital can consist of those eight \u2014 and only those eight\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>units. <em>Am. Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>499 U.S. at 608, 111 S.Ct. 1539.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The Rule, however, included an exception from that mandate for nonconforming units already in existence at the time of the Rule\u2019s promulgation. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.30(a). Preexisting nonconforming units were left for the Board to address on a case-by-case basis through adjudication. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 103.30(b). In undertaking those adjudications, the governing regulations cabin-the Board\u2019s discretion in one respect of relevance here: when \u201cthere are existing nonconforming units ... and a petition for additional units is filed ... the Board shall find appropriate only units which comport, insofar as practicable, with the appropriate unit\u201d from the eight standardized units. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 103.30(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In adjudications construing that language, the Board has explained that, \u201c[b]y its terms, Section 103.30(c) applies only to petitions for \u2018additional units,\u2019 that is, petitions to represent a new unit of previously unrepresented employees, which would be an addition to the existing units at a facility.\u201d <em>Kaiser Found. Hosps., </em>312 NLRB 933, 934 (1993); <em>accord Crittenton Hosp., </em>328 NLRB 879, 880 (1999). And when a union brings a petition to represent such a new unit of previously unrepresented employees (who are referred to as \u201cresidual employees\u201d), the Board has further determined that the additional unit must include <em>all </em>residual employees who would fit within the same standardized unit under the Rule. <em>See St. Mary\u2019s Duluth Clinic Health Sys., </em>332 NLRB 1419, 1420-22 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">As an example, the Board applied that understanding of Section 103.30(c) in a situation in which there was a preexisting nonconforming bargaining unit that included some of the facility\u2019s skilled maintenance employees (which, as noted, is one of the eight standardized categories of employees). The Board explained that, if a union sought to represent a new unit that would include unrepresented skilled maintenance workers, the union could not \u201crepresent yet another separate, residual unit that included only a <em>portion of </em>the remaining unrepresented skilled maintenance employees,\u201d but would be \u201crequired to include <em>all </em>unrepresented employees residual to the existing unit of skilled maintenance employees.\u201d <em>St. Vincent Charity Med. Ctr., </em>357 NLRB 854, 856 (2011) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The Board does not apply the same understanding, however, if a union seeks to add residual employees to an already existing unit rather than to create a new unit. The mechanism by which a union adds employees to an existing unit is known as an <em>Armour-Globe, </em>or self-determination, election. <em>See generally Armour &amp; Co., </em>40 NLRB 1333 (1942); <em>Globe Mach. &amp; Stamping Co., </em>3 NLRB 294 (1937). In its decision in <em>St. Vincent, </em>the Board exempted <em>Armour-Globe </em>elections from Section 103.30(c) in particular and from the Health Care Rule more generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The Board explained that an <em>\u201cArmour-Globe </em>self-determination election ... undeniably avoids any proliferation of units, much less undue proliferation, because it does not result in the creation of and election in a separate, additional unit.\u201d St. <em>Vincent, </em>357 NLRB at 855. Instead, \u201can <em>Armour-Globe </em>election permits employees sharing a community of interest with an already represented unit of employees to vote whether they wish to be added to the existing unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that sense, a self-determination election \u201cfurther[s] the petitioned-for employees\u2019 interest in obtaining representation while avoiding any undue proliferation of units,\u201d the principal concern of the Health Care Rule. <em>Id. </em>at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">Petitioner Rush University Medical Center is an acute-care teaching hospital located in Chicago, Illinois. The International <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 743 (the Union) has long represented a unit of employees in different nonprofessional job classes at Rush. The unit is a preexisting nonconforming unit under the Health Care Rule because it includes employees from two of the eight enumerated categories\u2014 \u201cother nonprofessional\u201d employees and \u201cskilled maintenance\u201d employees \u2014 but it does not include all of Rush\u2019s employees in either category.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">In 2014, the Union petitioned for a special election that would enable Rush\u2019s unrepresented Patient Care Technicians (PCTs) to vote to be included in the preexisting nonconforming unit. PCTs qualify as \u201cother nonprofessional\u201d employees for purposes of the standardized units set forth in the Health Care Rule. The proposed voting group for the <em>Armour-Globe </em>election consisted of the roughly 245 unrepresented PCTs. Rush opposed the proposed voting group on the ground that, it was underin-clusive. In Rush\u2019s view, the voting group, to comply with the Health Care Rule, needed to encompass all unrepresented nonprofessional employees (who numbered between 700 and 800), not just PCTs.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The Regional Director rejected Rush\u2019s arguments and found that the petitioned-for voting group was appropriate. The Board then denied Rush\u2019s request for review. The Board considered the case to be controlled by its prior decision in <em>St. Vincent, </em>which, as explained, held that <em>Armour-Globe </em>elections need not conform to the Health Care Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In the ensuing election, the residual PCTs voted to be included in the preexisting nonconforming unit. In order to test the certification, Rush refused to bargain. The Union filed a complaint with the Board, and the Board subsequently found that the refusal to bargain violated the National Labor Relations Act. <em>Rush Univ. Med. Ctr., </em>362 NLRB No. 23, at *2-3 (Feb. 27, 2015). Rush now petitions this court for review, and the Board cross-applies for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Rush contends that the Board\u2019s bargaining unit determination in this case relied on an impermissible interpretation of the Health Care Rule. In Rush\u2019s view, Section 103.30(c)\u2019s requirement to conform to the Rule \u201cinsofar as practicable\u201d should operate no differently in an <em>Armour-Globe </em>self-determination election than in an election that would add a new bargaining unit. In the former situation no less than the latter, Rush submits, a union must add all \u2014 not just some \u2014 residual employees who would be grouped within the same standardized unit under the Rule. According to Rush, the Board\u2019s contrary conclusion in <em>St. Vincent, </em>to which it adhered in this case, is arbitrary and inconsistent with the Board\u2019s prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">We reject Rush\u2019s challenge to the Board\u2019s interpretation and application of its own regulation. This Court will overturn the Board\u2019s determination of an appropriate collective bargaining unit only if \u201cit is arbitrary or not supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Country Ford Trucks, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>229 F.3d 1184, 1189 (D.C. Cir. 2000). We \u201caccord the Board an especially \u2018wide degree of discretion\u2019 \u201d on questions of representation. <em>Randell Warehouse of Ariz., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>252 F.3d 445, 447-48 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>NLRB v. A.J. Tower Co., </em>329 U.S. 324, 330, 67 S.Ct. 324, 91 L.Ed. 322 (1946)). When, as here, we review an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations, we do not \u201cdecide which among several competing interpretations best serves the regulatory purpose.\u201d <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, </em>512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994). Rather, we \u201cgive controlling weight to the Board\u2019s interpretation of its own rule unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tion itself.\u201d <em>Alldata Corp. v. NLRB, </em>245 F.3d 803, 807 (D.C. Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Here, the Board\u2019s interpretation of the Health Care Rule in <em>St. Vincent </em>is fully consistent \u201cwith the regulation itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The regulation\u2019s pertinent language says that, when \u201cthere are existing non-conforming units\u201d and \u201ca petition for additional units is filed,\u201d the \u201cBoard shall find appropriate only units which comport, insofar as practicable, with the appropriate unit\u201d from the eight standardized units defined by the Rule. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.30(c). That regulation, as the Board has explained, applies by its terms to \u201ca petition for <em>additional units.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). An <em>Armour-Globe </em>self-determination election, by its nature, does not involve the creation of any \u201cadditional units.\u201d Rather, it involves the inclusion of additional unrepresented employees in an already-existing unit. Consequently, the Board\u2019s exemption of <em>Armour-Globe </em>elections from Section 103.30(c) is entirely compatible with the regulation\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Nor is the Board\u2019s understanding arbitrarily at odds with the regulation\u2019s object. The Health Care Rule guards against undue proliferation of bargaining units in acute-care hospitals. An <em>Armour-Globe </em>self-determination election, by definition, involves no proliferation of bargaining units at any facility. <em>See St. Vincent, </em>357 NLRB at 855. Rather, the number of bargaining units remains constant. To be sure, the Board could elect to require that the bargaining unit in an <em>Armour-Globe </em>election, just like in a representation election to create a new unit, must encompass all residual employees who would fit within the same unit among the Rule\u2019s standardized units. But the Board did not act arbitrarily by drawing a distinction between the two types of elections. Instead, as the Board explained in <em>St. Vincent, </em>its interpretation \u201cfurthers] the petitioned-for employees\u2019 interest in obtaining representation\u201d through a self-determination election \u201cwhile avoiding any undue proliferation of units.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Rush\u2019s principal argument is not that the Board\u2019s interpretation in <em>St. Vincent </em>conflicts with the regulation\u2019s text or objectives. Rather, Rush devotes the bulk of its attention to contending that <em>St. Vincent </em>is arbitrary because it departs, without reasoned explanation, from the Board\u2019s prior decision in <em>St. John\u2019s Hospital, </em>307 NLRB 767 (1992). Rush\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">In <em>St. John\u2019s, </em>there were nonconforming units predating the Health Care Rule that included some of the hospital\u2019s skilled maintenance employees. An incumbent union petitioned for a representation election that would have added a new bargaining unit encompassing some (but not all) of the unrepresented skilled maintenance workers. The Board declined to allow the representation election. The Board explained that, in the context of a hospital with a preexisting nonconforming unit, a union desiring to add a new unit must include within the unit \u201call unrepresented employees residual to the existing unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 768. Moreover, because the case involved not a new union but instead an \u201cincumbent wishing to represent employees residual to those in its existing unit,\u201d the union was required to \u201cdo so by adding them to the existing unit\u201d rather than creating a new unit, \u201cusually by means of a self-determination election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board therefore remanded \u201cto the Regional Director for direction of a self-determination election.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Rush seizes on the Board\u2019s apparent understanding of the scope of the proposed bargaining unit for the self-determination election that was to be conducted on remand. The Board assumed that the union would represent <em>\u201call </em>the remaining skilled maintenance employees as part of its existing unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). As Rush <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>sees it, <em>St. John\u2019s </em>thereby established an inexorable command that, whenever a union conducts an <em>Armour-Globe </em>self-determination election to add unrepresented employees to a preexisting nonconforming unit, the union must seek to add \u201call\u201d \u2014 not just some \u2014 of the residual employees who fit within the standardized bargaining unit. <em>St. John\u2019s </em>need not be read in that fashion, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">To the contrary, the Board in <em>St. Vincent </em>gave a reasoned explanation of why it did not understand <em>St. John\u2019s </em>to have established a blanket requirement that a union, when seeking a self-determination election to add employees to a preexisting unit, must include all residual employees belonging to the same standardized unit. <em>St. John\u2019s </em>involved an effort to create \u201can additional, residual unit.\u201d <em>St. Vincent, </em>357 NLRB at 856. In <em>St. Vincent </em>(as in this case), by contract, the union sought to add employees \u201cto its existing unit in a self-determination election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, although the Board in <em>St. John\u2019s </em>remanded for the potential conduct of a self-determination election that would encompass \u201call remaining unrepresented skilled maintenance employees\u201d \u2014 not just some of those residual employees \u2014 the Board \u201cdid not specifically address whether\u201d it was correct to \u201cinclud[e] the skilled maintenance employees not originally sought by the\u201d union when it petitioned for an election to create a new unit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In other words, the Board explained in <em>St. Vincent, </em>the decision in <em>St. John\u2019s </em>had <em>assumed </em>that a self-determination election on remand would include all residual employees, but without deciding whether that assumed scope was correct, much less compelled. That assumption had arisen in <em>St. John\u2019s </em>because the Regional Director would have allowed a representation election to add a new unit, but only if the new unit included all residual employees. <em>See id. </em>And when the employer sought review by the Board of the Regional Director\u2019s allowance of an election to create a new unit, the employer did not dispute that, if the union were to seek to add employees to a preexisting unit rather than create a new unit, the self-determination election would \u2014 consistent with the Regional Director\u2019s contemplated election of a new unit \u2014 include all residual skilled maintenance workers. As the Board observed in <em>St. Vincent, </em>there was \u201cno indication [in <em>St. John\u2019s] </em>that any party requested that the Board reconsider the Regional Director\u2019s inclusion of all remaining unrepresented skilled maintenance employees if an election\u201d \u2014 either a self-determination election or an election to add a new unit \u2014 \u201cwere to be held.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">That assumption explains the Board\u2019s statement in <em>St. John\u2019s </em>that, \u201cin the circumstances presented here, because the [union] already represents a nonconforming unit of skilled maintenance employees, if the [union] seeks to represent any of the remaining unrepresented skilled maintenance employees, the [union] must represent all the remaining skilled maintenance employees as part of its existing unit.\u201d <em>St. John\u2019s, </em>307 NLRB at 768. The reference to \u201call the remaining skilled maintenance employees\u201d did not establish a requirement that <em>every </em>self-determination election necessarily encompass all residual employees. Rather, the reference merely captured the assumed scope of the bargaining unit in that case, which none of the parties had challenged before the Board. The primary point of the quoted statement was instead to establish that the union, as an incumbent union, would need to add \u201cthe remaining skilled maintenance employees as part of its existing unit\u201d rather than create a new unit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">In <em>St. Vincent, </em>the Board described its prior decision in <em>St. John\u2019s </em>in just those terms. <em>See St. Vincent, </em>357 NLRB at 856 &amp; n.12. As a result, the Board in <em>St. Vin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>cent </em>remained free to conclude \u2014 as it did \u2014 that an <em>Armour-Globe </em>self-determination election falls outside the Health Care Rule, and thus need not include all residual employees who would fit in the same standardized unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Indeed, any contrary conclusion in <em>St. Vincent </em>would have been highly difficult to square with the Board\u2019s intervening decisions after <em>St. John\u2019s. </em>In two decisions, the Board specifically construed Section 130.30(c) to apply <em>only </em>in circumstances involving creation of an additional, new unit. <em>See Crittenton, </em>328 NLRB at 880; <em>Kaiser, </em>312 NLRB at 934. In both decisions, accordingly, the Board declined to apply Section 130.30(c) because the Circumstances did not involve any new unit. <em>See Crittenton, </em>328 NLRB at 880; <em>Kaiser, </em>312 NLRB at 934. <em>St. Vincent </em>likewise involved no new unit. Against the backdrop of the decisions in <em>Crittenton </em>and <em>Kaiser, </em>the Board would have been hard-pressed to conclude in <em>St. Vincent </em>that, in an <em>Armour-Globe </em>election in which there necessarily is no new bargaining unit, Section 130.30(c) nonetheless somehow applies. The Board reasonably decided otherwise. In short, because <em>St. Vincent </em>reasonably found <em>Armour-Globe </em>elections to fall outside the scope of Section 103.30(c), and because this case involves an <em>Armour-Globe </em>election, we reject Rush\u2019s argument that the bargaining unit in this case imper-missibly conflicted with Section 103.30(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">This brings us, finally, to Rush\u2019s contention that, even if the bargaining unit need not have encompassed <em>all </em>residual nonprofessional employees, it at least needed to include employees in the job classification of Nurse Assistant II. Those employees, Rush urges, have highly similar job duties to the PCTs who cast votes in the self-determination election. The Nurse Assistant IIs thus should have been included in the voting group, Rush asserts. The Board rejected that argument, and we perceive no basis for overturning the Board\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">When considering petitions for <em>Armour-Globe </em>elections, the Board looks to the proposed voting group to \u201cdetermine the extent to which the employees to be included share a community of interest with unit employees, as well as whether the employees to be added constitute an identifiable, distinct segment so as to constitute an appropriate voting group.\u201d War<em>ner-Lambert Co., </em>298 NLRB 993, 995 (1990). In declining in this case to include Nurse Assistant IIs in the proposed voting group, the Board relied on <em>Rhode Island Hospital, </em>313 NLRB 343 (1993). There, the Board focused on certain characteristics of the employees in the challenged voting group when assessing the relevant community of interest. In particular, members had no requirement that they be enrolled in school to maintain employment; members received employment benefits; and members\u2019 pay rates were affected by performance evaluations. <em>Id. </em>at 365. Because the excluded employees did not have those characteristics, the Board found they did not share a community of interest with the voting group. <em>Id. </em>at 364-65. In this case, precisely the same three factors, distinguish Nurse Assistant IIs from PCTs.
