Briccetti, Judge, of theft of government property in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641, sentencing him principally to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, and ordering him to forfeit $400,000 and to pay $400,000 in restitution. On appeal, Lee contends principally that his conviction of a \u00a7 641 felony violated the Grand Jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution' because a violation of that section is a felony only if the value of the property stolen exceeded $1,000, and the indictment on which he was tried charged only a misdemeanor because it did not allege the value of the property stolen. He also challenges certain of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The government contends that Lee\u2019s conviction of a felony should stand, arguing principally that the indictment was adequate to charge a felony, and alternatively that if it was not, the error either was harmless or was cured by a mid-trial superseding indictment that alleged a value in excess of $1,000. We conclude that the value of the property stolen is an element of the \u00a7 641 felony offense and that, in order to charge Lee with the felony, the indictment on which he was tried should have alleged that the value of the property stolen exceeded $1,000. However, in the circumstances of this case, in which, inter alia, the defense was fully aware, well in advance of the trial, of the government\u2019s intent to prosecute the offense as a felony, and the evidence that hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of government property had been stolen was overwhelming, the violation of the\u2019 Grand Jury Clause was harmless. Finding no merit in Lee\u2019s other arguments, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Section 641 of Title 18 of the United States Code provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">Whoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly converts to his use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys or disposes of any record, voucher, money, or thing of value of the United States or of any department or agency thereof, or any property made or being made under contract for the United States or any department or agency thereof; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">Whoever receives, conceals, or retains the same with intent to convert it to his use or gain, knowing it to have been embezzled, stolen, purloined or converted\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; but if the value of such property in the aggregate, combining amounts from all the counts for which the defendant is convicted in a single-case, does not exceed the sum of $1,000, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-13\">The word \u201cvalue\u201d means face, par, or market value, or cost price, either wholesale or retail, whichever is greater.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 (2012) (emphases added). \u201c[A]n offense for which the \u2018maximum term of imprisonment authorized\u2019 is \u2018more than one year\u2019 \u201d is \u201ca \u2018felony.\u2019 \u201d Moncrieffe v. Holder, \u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1683, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)). Thus, if the value of the government property stolen exceeds $1,000, the violation of \u00a7 641 is a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-17\">A. The Present Prosecution and the Evidence at Trial as to Value</p>\n<p id=\"b86-18\">The present prosecution arose out of an investigation into thefts from a United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d or \u201cPostal Service\u201d) facility of truckloads of plastic pallets (\u201cpallets\u201d), flat structures owned-by the Postal Service that the USPS and its customers use to move large quantities of mail by forklift or pallet jack. Lee, during the pertinent period, was the senior tractor-trailer operator at the facility. The investigation \u2014 assisted by cooperating witness (\u201cCW\u201d) Steven Iannoccone, a participant in the thefts of the pallets \u2014 soon focused on Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>In October 2013, Lee was arrested and charged in a criminal complaint with having stolen pallets from the Postal Service from late 2011 to and including October 2013. (See October 22, 2013 Complaint \u00b6 1.) The complaint alleged that in 2012, \u201cLEE supplied the CW with approximately two trailers full of pallets each week, with each trailer containing between 400 and 500 pallets,\u201d that from January to May 2013 he supplied approximately 10 truckloads of pallets per month, and that the agreed payment to Lee was $1 per pallet. (Id. \u00b6 6.) In February 2014, Lee and fellow USPS employee Wilfredo Herrera were indicted, charged with one count of stealing pallets from the Postal Service in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 641 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">After Herrera pleaded guilty, the grand jury handed down superseding indictments against Lee alone in August 2014 (\u201cS2\u201d) and September 2014'(\u201cS3\u201d). The S3 Indictment charged a violation of \u00a7 641 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">1. From in or about late 2011, up to and including in or about October 2013, in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere, DESTIN LEE, the defendant, knowingly did embezzle, steal, purloin, and convert to his own use and the use of another, money and things of value of the United States and of a department and agency thereof, and did receive, conceal, and retain the same with intent to convert it to his own use and gain, knowing it to have been embezzled, stolen, purloined, and converted, and did aid and abet the same, to wit, LEE participated in a scheme to steal and did steal pallets belonging to the United States Postal Service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">(Title 18, United States Code, Sections 641 and 2.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">(S3 Indictment at 1.) It also contained a forfeiture allegation, which read in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">2. As a result of committing the offense alleged in Count One of this Indictment, DESTIN LEE, the defendant, shall forfeit to the United States ... all property, real and personal, that constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to the commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdZ\">(Id. at 1-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The government\u2019s evidence at trial included testimony by Lee\u2019s co-worker Herrera and Iannoccone, an independent trucker. Iannoccone testified that Lee was his principal contact at the Postal Service for thefts of pallets. Pallets were valuable because they could be resold to recyclers. When Iannoccone had buyers for pallets he called Lee, who would arrange for a Postal Service trailer containing pallets to be in a relatively secluded area of the USPS facility so they could be loaded into Iannoccone\u2019s truck with minimal' observation. If Lee was not available, Herrera would sometimes make the advance arrangements. Iannoccone, with Lee and/or Herrera, transferred the pallets from the USPS trailers to the trucks driven in by Iannoccone. Iannoccone gave Lee half of the money he received from the buyers. Herrera was paid a flat fee of $50 or $100 each time he assisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">Iannoccone testified that the thefts began in 2009 and that the pallets were sold to a succession of three buyers. His testimony indicated that the sales to the first buyer preceded the 2011-2013 period covered by the S3 Indictment, and it was imprecise as to the' timing of the sales to their second buyer. However, his testimony as a whole, taken in the light most favorable to the government, along with testimony by Herrera, made clear that the thefts for sales to the third buyer occurred within the indictment period. Iannoccone testified that he sold \u201cprobably anywhere from 30 to 40 box trucks\u201d of pallets to the third buyer (Trial Transcript (\u201cTr.\u201d) at 80); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Herrera testified that he first became involved in the scheme about two years before his arrest in October 2013, and that he helped Lee and Iannoccone steal pallets approximately 40 times (see id. -at 345-46, 312).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Iannoccone testified that they loaded each box truck with approximately 500 pallets. Thus, if as few as 30 truckloads were delivered to the third buyer, he and Lee stole some 15,000 pallets during the period covered by the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">A USPS equipment manager testified that from 2011 through 2013, the Postal Service paid an average of $15-$20 per plastic pallet. Thus, the evidence indicated that the stolen pallets had cost the government at least $225,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Lee testified that he was not involved in any thefts and knew nothing about them: \u201cLee flatly denied helping Iannoccone steal pallets. He never saw Iannoccone steal pallets but he did see him frequently with Herrera. ... He did not load any trailer with pallets to be brought to Ian-noccone.\u201d (Lee brief on appeal at 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">B. Submission of the Case to the Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The court had set a trial date of September 22, 2014, and a deadline of September 5 for the parties to submit various motions and their requests for jury instructions. On September 5, the government filed its requested instructions, which included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">Request No. 3: Elements of the Offense</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">In order for you to find the defendant guilty of the offense charged in the Indictment, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following four elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">Fourth, that the value of the property was greater than $1,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">Request No. 7: Fourth Element: Value of Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-13\">The fourth and final element the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the value of the property stolen or knowingly converted was greater than $1,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">(Government\u2019s Requests To Charge dated September 5, 2014, at 5, 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">The presentation of evidence at trial began on September 23, 2014, and was to be concluded on September 30 after a morning charge conference. On the evening of September 29, Lee filed an objection to the government\u2019s request to instruct the jury that to convict him it must find that the stolen pallets had a value of more than $1,000. He argued that the S3 Indictment did not charge the value element; that it thus charged him with only a misdemean- or, not a felony; and, accordingly, that the jury could not properly make a finding as to value or find him guilty of a felony. The issue was discussed during the morning charge conference on September 30, but the conference was adjourned without a resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">After trial resumed and the defense rested, the government informed the court that, following the morning charge conference, the grand jury had returned a further superseding indictment (the \u201cS4 Indictment\u201d). The language in the S4 Indictment, alleging theft of United States money and things of value, was identical to that in S3 except that it added that \u201cthe value of which money and things of value did exceed $1,000,\u201d and that Lee stole Postal Service pallets \u201cthat were worth thousands of dollars\u201d (S4 Indictment at 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-17\">Lee objected to the S4 Indictment as untimely. The government, while maintaining that the S3 Indictment adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>charged a felony offense, stated that the S4 Indictment was \u201coffered in the nature of an amendment to the S3 indictment\u201d (Tr.770); it took the position that as long as either indictment properly charged a felony, a verdict could be returned under that indictment. The government also represented that evidence of the value of the pallets had in fact been presented to the grand jury that returned the S3 Indictment (and indeed, each prior indictment). The district court arraigned Lee on the S4 Indictment (Lee pleaded not guilty); but it ruled that trial would continue under the S3 Indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">After the charge conference resumed, the court rejected Lee\u2019s contention that the S3 Indictment failed to charge a felony and overruled his objection to allowing the jury to make a finding on the value of the stolen pallets. The court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjO\">the language [of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641] defining the felony offense \u2014 in other words, the one for which the defendant can be sentenced to up to ten years in prison\u2014 does not say anything about the value of the property stolen. The value language comes later in the statute in what the government refers to as a misdemeanor carve-out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">The carve-out language is not technically an element of the offense. Second Circuit case law and common sense, of course, require[ ] the jury to find that a defendant does not fall within the carve-out in order to be sentenced to more than one year. In other words, in order for the defendant to be sentenced to and thereby convicted of a felony, the government certainly needs to prove and the jury needs to find that the defendant does not fall within the carve-out or, to put it another way, that the value of the property stolen in the aggregate, for all of the counts for which he\u2019s convicted in a single case, exceeds a thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-12\">But value as such is not an element of the crime itself as defined by Congress in 641. And that\u2019s all that matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al2\">(Tr.807-08 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">The district court proceeded to charge the jury under the S3 Indictment but included value as one of the four elements the jury was required to find before it could convict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-15\">Now, for to you find the defendant guilty of the offense charged in the indictment, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following four elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-16\">First, that the money or things of value described in the indictment\u2014 namely, pallets \u2014 belong to the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-17\">Second, that the defendant stole or knowingly converted that property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-18\">Third, that the defendant acted knowingly and willfully with the intent to deprive the government of the use and benefit of its property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-19\">Fourth, that the value of the property was greater than $1,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-20\">(Tr.907-08 (emphases added).) As to the fourth element, the district court instructed that \u201cvalue means face or market value or cost price, whichever is greater,\u201d and that the jury \u201cmay consider the aggregate or total value of the property referred to in the indictment.\u201d (Tr.909.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-21\">The jury found Lee guilty. His sentence, as indicated above, included a 30-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-22\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-23\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b89-24\">On appeal, Lee contends principally that because the S3 Indictment did not allege that the value of the stolen pallets exceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>ed $1,000, his conviction of the \u00a7 641 felony violated his right under the Grand Jury Clause. He also contends that the district court erred in excluding certain evidence that he sought to introduce at trial. As to his Grand Jury Clause contention, Lee argues, inter alia, that \u201cthe district court d[id] not have jurisdiction to' try, convict, or sentence [him] for\u201d a felony rather than the misdemeanor \u201ccharged in the indictment\u201d (Lee brief on appeal at 42-43 (internal quotation marks omitted)); that his conviction violates \u201c[t]he familiar rule of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) ... that \u2018any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019\u201d (Lee brief on appeal at 41 (emphasis ours)); that \u201c[t]he government\u2019s grafting onto the S3 Indictment of the value element was a constructive amendment of the indictment\u201d entitling him to an automatic reversal (id. at 43); and that his right to action by a grand jury would be lost if \u201cthe prosecution, or the court,\u201d were allowed \u201cto make a subsequent guess as to what was in the minds of the grand jury at the time they returned the indictment\u201d (id. at 41 (internal quotation marks omitted)). Lee also states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">[wjhere there is insufficient proof that a person has committed a greater offense, an appellate court may remand for re-sentencing on a lesser included offense. See United States v. Boissoneault, 926 F.2d 230, 235 (2d Cir. 1991). It follows that where a man has been convicted of a greater offense that was not charged in his indictment, the Court of Appeals may vacate that conviction and remand for resentencing on the crime that was in fact charged</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">(Lee brief on appeal at 45-46), and he argues that his felony conviction should be reversed and that \u201c[a] new trial of the misdemeanor should be ordered or, alternatively, [he] should be sentenced on the misdemeanor\u201d (id. at 57).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We agree only with Lee\u2019s contention that the indictment on which he was tried, in order to charge him at the felony level, should have included an allegation that the value of the government property stolen was in excess of $1,000. The holding of Apprendi is a factor in our conclusion, although that case involved a state statute, and, contrary to Lee\u2019s characterization of the case as dealing with what must be charged \u201cin an indictment\u201d (Lee brief on appeal at 41 (internal quotation marks omitted)), the Apprendi Court \u201cd[id] not address the indictment question separately\u201d because the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, applicable to the States, \u201chas not ... been construed to include the Fifth Amendment[\u2019s] ... Grand Jury[ Clause],\u201d 530 U.S. at 477 n.3, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (internal quotation marks omitted). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that in the circumstances of this case, the failure of the S3 Indictment to allege that the value of the stolen pallets exceeded $1,000 was error \u2014 but an error that was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">A. Value Exceeding $1,000 as an Element of a \u00a7 641 Felony</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Section 641, set forth in full in Part I above, provides in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">[w]hoever ... steals ... or knowingly converts to ... the use of another ... any ... thing of value of the United States or of any department or agency thereof ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; but if the value of such property in the aggregate ... does not exceed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>sum of $1,000, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">The word \u201cvalue\u201d means face, par, or market value, or cost price, either wholesale or retail, whichever is greater.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWc\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 (emphasis added). The prohibited conduct must be proven to have been intentional. See Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 263-73, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">There is no dispute that \u00a7 641 encompasses two offenses \u2014 a felony (punishable by, inter alia, imprisonment up to ten years) and a misdemeanor (punishable by, inter alia, imprisonment of no more than one year) \u2014 and that the dividing line between the two is the value of the stolen property. The threshold for conviction of a \u00a7 641 felony, for offenses committed on or after October 11, 1996, see Pub. L. No. 104-294, \u00a7 606(a), 110 Stat. 3488, 3511 (increasing threshold to $1,000 from $100), is value in excess of $1,000. Lee pursues the argument he made at trial, that value exceeding $1,000 is thus an element of the felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The government argues on appeal \u2014 contrary to its requested jury charge at trial (see Part I.B. above) \u2014 that the value of the stolen property is not an element of the felony, citing United States v. Outen, 286 F.3d 622 (2d Cir. 2002) (\u201cOuten\u201d), and United States v. Grillo, 160 F.3d 149 (2d Cir. 1998) (\u201cGrillo\u201d). In Outen, a case involving quantities of drugs and various provisions in Title 21, this Court stated that in applying Apprendi to two or more statutory provisions the proper default provision is the one that states a complete crime upon the fewest facts. See 286 F.3d at 638. The government contends that because \u00a7 641\u2019s \u201clanguage describing the felony violation contains no reference to value[, and] value is mentioned only in connection with eligibility for mitigation\u201d (Government brief on appeal at 27), \u201cthe default violation is a felony violation, and ... the possibility of misdemeanor exposure constitutes an exception based on mitigating facts\u201d (id. at 24). The apparent effect of this interpretation would be that if the government wished to prosecute a defendant for a misdemeanor violation of \u00a7 641 it would have to prove that the property stolen had a value of $1,000 or less, but that to prosecute him for a \u00a7 641 felony, it need not prove that the value of the property stolen exceeded $1,000. This counterintuitive construction is not supported by Outen or the text of \u00a7 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The conduct prohibited by \u00a7 641, to the extent relevant to this case, is set out in the first paragraph of this Part H.A., as quoted above. To establish such conduct, the government is required to prove four essential elements: (1) stealing or converting, (2) with intent to steal or convert, (3) a \u201cthing of value\u201d (4) that belongs to the government. The \u201cvalue\u201d of the \u201cthing\u201d taken \u2014 whether great or small \u2014 is an element of the offense. If the \u201cthing\u201d knowingly and intentionally taken from the government had no value, \u00a7 641 was not violated. Thus, the fact that a separate paragraph of \u00a7 641, setting out penalties for the prohibited conduct, specifies a ceiling value in its misdemeanor clause but does not expressly mention value in its felony clause does not mean that value is not an element of the felony. The \u201cvalue,\u201d in \u201cthing of value,\u201d is integral to the prohibition stated in the first paragraph of \u00a7 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">If the government at trial proves all four of the above elements \u2014 including that the \u201cthing\u201d stolen had some value \u2014 any value, even if small \u2014 it has proven a violation of \u00a7 641. Proof that the \u201cthing\u201d simply had some value, without proof that the value exceeded $1,000, would show a complete crime upon the fewest facts \u2014 a misde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>meanor. And if the value of the \u201cthing\u201d is shown at trial to have been in excess of $1,000, the government has proven a felony. See generally Morissette, 342 U.S. at 266-69, 72 S.Ct. 240 (discussing antecedents of \u00a7 641, and stating that \u201ceach\u201d of those collected offenses was \u201cat its least, a misdemeanor, and if the amount involved [was] one hundred or more dollars each [was] a felony\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Accordingly, we, along with most of our Sister Circuits, have held that property value in excess of \u00a7 641\u2019s felony threshold amount \u2014 which for offenses prior to October 11, 1996 was $100, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 (1994) \u2014 is an element of the felony: \u201cAs to the value of the goods stolen, \u2018[f]or the offense proscribed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 to amount to a felony, there must be both charge and proof that the value of the property stolen ... exceeds the sum of $100.\u2019 \u201d United States v.

Howard, 30 F.3d 871, 875 (7th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">This Court\u2019s decision in Grillo does not suggest that we should deviate from our holding in Robie. First, Robie was decided after Grillo. Second, Grillo involved not theft but fraud, prosecuted under a section which provides that a person who \u201cmakes ... a false statement ... in connection with the application for or receipt of ... [certain government] benefits] ... shall be guilty of perjury,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 (emphases added). Unlike theft crimes prohibited in \u00a7 641, the \u00a7 1920 perjury crime is complete upon the making of the false statement in connection with the application, regardless of whether the application is successful. Thus, while \u00a7 1920, like \u00a7 641, provides that if the amount of benefits fraudulently obtained does not exceed $1,000 the maximum imprisonment is \u201cnot more than 1 year,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920, we held, consistent with the prohibition against fraud in an application, that the actual receipt of benefits was not an essential part of the crime, see 160 F.3d at 150. Moreover, although we held that \u00a7 1920\u2019s reference to the level of benefits obtained was \u201cpart of the punishment portion of the statute,\u201d id., the prison term to which Gril-lo had been sentenced was three months, thus creating no issue to be addressed as to the propriety of a sentence at the felony level.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Our view that value in excess of the \u00a7 641 felony threshold amount is an element of a \u00a7 641 felony finds support in the holding of Apprendi, see 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (\u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d), and in the holdings and reasoning of other Supreme Court cases dealing with whether a fact that changes a felony to an aggravated felony was meant to be an element of the aggravated felony, see, e.g., Jones v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>States, 526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), or with whether a fact that changes a misdemeanor to a felony was meant to be an element of the felony, see, e.g., Carter v. United States, 530 U.S. 255, 120 S.Ct. 2159, 147 L.Ed.2d 203 (2000). In Jones, which explored the structure of the federal carjacking statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119, and other provisions, the Court noted that \u201c[m]uch turns on the determination that a fact is an element of an offense rather than a sentencing consideration, given that elements must be charged in the indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d 526 U.S. at 232, 119 S.Ct. 1215. The Jones Court stated that \u201c[i]t is at best questionable whether the specification of facts sufficient to increase a penalty range by two-thirds ... was meant to carry none of the process safeguards that elements of an offense bring with them for a defendant\u2019s benefit,\u201d id. at 233,119 S.Ct. 1215 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In Carter, the Court discussed 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b), which, like \u00a7 641, sets a value exceeding $1,000 as the threshold for conviction as a felony. Section 2113(b) does not use \u00a7 641\u2019s \u201cbut if\u2019 formulation but sets out two paragraphs prohibiting thefts of property from certain types of financial institutions, with the first paragraph authorizing, inter alia, imprisonment of up to 10 years for theft of property having a \u201cvalue exceeding $1,000,\u201d and the second limiting the imprisonment authorization to one year for theft of property having a \u201cvalue not exceeding $1,000.\u201d The Carter Court noted that the structure of \u00a7 2113(b), employing grammatically independent paragraphs, \u201cstrongly suggests that Congress intended the valuation requirement to be an element of each paragraph\u2019s offense, rather than a sentencing factor of some base \u00a7 2113(b) offense,\u201d 530 U.S. at 273, 120 S.Ct. 2159; but it stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">[e]ven aside from the statute\u2019s structure, the \u201csteeply higher penalties\u201d \u2014 an enhancement from a 1-year to a 10-year maximum penalty on proof of valuation exceeding $1,000 \u2014 leads us to conclude that the valuation requirement is an element of the first paragraph of subsection (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Id. (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">On the basis of the same reasoning, we conclude that our ruling in Robie remains sound, and that valuation in excess of $1,000, which in \u00a7 641 changes a misdemeanor into a felony and increases the maximum authorized penalty ten-fold, is an element of the \u00a7 641 felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">B. The Grand Jury Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">The Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment generally protects a person from prosecution in a federal court \u201cfor a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. Thus, with respect to federal felonies, a defendant has a \u201csubstantial right to be tried only on charges presented in an indictment returned by a grand jury.\u201d Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 217, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960). \u201cElements of a crime must be charged in an indictment,\u201d United States v. O\u2019Brien, 560 U.S. 218, 224, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010); the \u201cindictment,\u201d to be \u201csufficient,\u201d should \u201cset forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offence intended to be punished,\u201d Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis ours); and \u201cafter an indictment has been returned its charges may not be broadened through amendment except by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>grand jury itself,\u201d Stirone, 361 U.S. at 215-16, 80 S.Ct. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In the present ease, therefore, for Lee to be tried on a \u00a7 641 felony charge, the S3 Indictment should have alleged that the value of the stolen pallets exceeded $1,000. It did not contain such an allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">C. Harmless-Error Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">That violation of the Grand Jury Clause does not automatically entitle Lee to relief on appeal, however, for \u201cdefects in an indictment do not deprive a court of its power to adjudicate a case,\u201d but rather go \u201cto the merits of the case,\u201d United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630-31, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (internal quo tation marks omitted); and as to the merits, \u201cnot all constitutional violations amount to reversible error,\u201d Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U.S. 249, 256, 108 S.Ct. 1792, 100 L.Ed.2d 284 (1988). Indeed, the Supreme Court has stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">\u201c \u2018most constitutional errors can be harmless.\u2019 \u201d Neder v.

Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 306, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991)). \u201c \u2018[I]f the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other [constitutional] errors that may have occurred are subject to harmless-error analysis.\u2019\u201d 527 U.S. at 8, 119 S.Ct. 1827 (quoting Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 579, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986)).

Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991); or the trial court\u2019s failure, in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>jury trial, to instruct the jury to make a finding with respect to one element of the crime, see Neder, 527 U.S. at 11, 119 S.Ct. 1827; or a Fifth Amendment due process violation by giving an instruction that shifted to the defendant the burden of proof with respect to malice, see Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 579-80, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986). Nor has the Court found structural error in cases involving a violation of the Grand Jury Clause. That Clause, which governs federal prosecutions, has not even been held applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 477 n.3, 120 S.Ct. 2348; Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625, 633, 92 S.Ct. 1221, 31 L.Ed.2d 536 (1972); Hurtado v.

United States, 369 U.S. 749, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962), the Court noted that \u201c[t]he constitutional provision that a trial may be held in a serious federal criminal ease only if a grand jury has first intervened reflects centuries of antecedent development of common law,\u201d and that \u201c[f]or many years the federal courts were guided in their judgments concerning the construction and sufficiency of grand jury indictments by the common law alone.\u201d 369 U.S. at 761, 82 S.Ct. 1038. In 1872, however, Congress enacted a harmless-error statute, the \u201csubstance [of which] is preserved in the more generalized provision of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which states that \u2018[a]ny error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\u2019\u201d Russell, 369 U.S. at 762, 82 S.Ct. 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The Russell Court stated that \u201c[o]f like relevance\u201d to the Grand Jury Clause \u201cis the guaranty of the Sixth Amendment that \u2018In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation,\u201d 369 U.S. at 761, 82 S.Ct. 1038, and that the \u201cprimary office\u201d of an indictment is \u201cto inform the defendant of the nature of the accusation against him,\u201d id. at 767, 82 S.Ct. 1038, he., the \u201ccore of criminality,\u201d id. at 764, 82 S.Ct. 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">While \u201cthe Fifth Amendment grand jury right serves a vital function in providing for a body of citizens that acts as a check on prosecutorial power,\u201d \u201cthat is surely no less true of the Sixth Amendment right to a petit jury.\u201d Cotton, 535 U.S. at 634, 122 S.Ct. 1781. And given that the Supreme Court, as discussed above, has held an error resulting in the lack of a finding of an offense element by the petit jury to be non-structural and subject to harmless-error analysis, see, e.g., Neder, 527 U.S. at 11, 119 S.Ct. 1827, we infer that the role of the grand jury as an independent check on prosecutors and courts likewise does not provide a basis for considering the grand jury\u2019s failure to allege an element that changes a misdemeanor to a felony to be a structural error that is impervious to harmless-error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">The Supreme Court has \u201cidentified two constitutional requirements for an indictment: \u2018first, [that it] contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge against which he must defend, and, second, [that it] enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense,\u2019\u201d United States v.

Recognizing that the Court thus describes the need to set out the elements and to give fair notice of the charge as a single requirement, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>elude that an indictment\u2019s failure to allege an element that increases the authorized punishment from the misdemeanor level to the felony level may be a harmless error if the concerns as to fair notice and double-jeopardy protection are otherwise satisfied. Cf. United States v. Confredo, 528 F.3d 143, 156 (2d Cir. 2008) (concluding that the indictment\u2019s failure to allege that the defendant committed the relevant offenses while released on bail, a factor that increased his authorized punishment, was subject to harmless-error analysis), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1144, 129 S.Ct. 1654, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Lee contends, however, that any consideration of the fact that the value of the stolen pallets exceeded $1,000 constituted a constructive amendment of the S3 Indictment and that he is automatically entitled to reversal and to be sentenced as if convicted of the misdemeanor.

In the present case, given our conclusion that there was a violation of the Grand Jury Clause, we view it appropriate to frame the question as whether the error was harmless. Prejudicial error and harmless error are opposite sides of the same issue: whether the error did or did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. The difference is that if relief is to be granted only if the error was prejudicial, the burden of proof is on the defendant; if the question is whether the error was harmless, the burden is on the prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Plano, 507 U.S. 725, 734-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); cf. United States v. Groysman, 766 F.3d 147, 155 (2d Cir. 2014) (burden of establishing plain error is on the defendant; burden of establishing harmless error is on the government); United States v. Thomas, 274 F.3d 655, 668 (2d Cir. 2001) (en banc) (same). And when the prosecution has the burden of proving that a constitutional error was harmless, it must establish harmlessness \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); see, e.g., Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 295, 111 S.Ct. 1246; Satterwhite, 486 U.S. at 258, 108 S.Ct. 1792.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">In the present case, we are convinced that the lack of a specification in the S3 Indictment that the value of the stolen pallets exceeded $1,000 was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. First, the S3 Indictment gave Lee specific notice of the nature of the offense and the core of criminal conduct to be proven at trial. It alleged that he had \u201cparticipated in,\u201d and \u201caid[ed] and abet[ted],\u201d the theft of \u201cthings of value\u201d to the government. It specified the nature of the \u201cthings of value,\u201d he., pallets; specified the government agency or department that owned the pallets, he., the Postal Service; and specified the period during which the thefts occurred, he., the approximately two-year period ending in October 2013. It plainly gave Lee fan-notice of the conduct with which he was charged. And if he were finally convicted or acquitted, it was ample to afford him protection against double jeopardy if he were to be subjected to prosecution, again for theft of USPS pallets from late 2011 into October 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Second, it is clear that the evidence at Lee\u2019s trial did not prove conduct different from the conduct alleged in the S3 Indictment. The complex of facts was precisely the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Third, despite the absence of an allegation in the S3 Indictment that the value of the pallets stolen by Lee over that two-year period exceeded $1,000, it is clear that Lee had notice throughout that the government intended to prove that valuation. As described in Part I.A. above, the very first charging document against Lee, the criminal complaint, alleged that during just one of the calendar years in question he had supplied the cooperating witness with two trailers of pallets a week, that a trailer held 400-500 pallets, and that Lee\u2019s fee was $1 per pallet. At that price, and at 800 pallets a week for a year, Lee\u2019s share from the sale of the stolen pallets, for just a fraction of the period covered by the indictment, was more than $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In addition, on September 5, more than two weeks prior to trial, the government filed its requests-to-charge, asking that the jury be instructed to determine whether the more-than-$l,000 valuation element was met. Lee voiced no objection until the evening of September 29, after the government had rested its case. At the charging conference the next morning, the district court noted that Lee had long been</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">on notice that this was a felony charge. Not by virtue of the indictment, but by virtue of the way in which the case was prosecuted, the discovery, the complaint,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">... whatever [plea] discussions have been made, and plus the evidence at trial itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">(Tr.696.) Lee\u2019s counsel candidly admitted to the district court that he had \u201calways believed the government was seeking to prosecute [Lee] for a felony.\u201d (Id.) Clearly, there was no lack of actual notice that the government sought to punish Lee\u2019s conduct as a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Further, Lee\u2019s contention that the violation of the Grand Jury Clause should entitle him to a remand for the district court to resentence him only for a misdemeanor suffers multiple flaws. To begin with, his citation of Boissoneault, 926 F.2d 230, for that proposition is far off the mark. We ordered such relief in Boissoneault because the trial evidence was insufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of the felony. There is no such insufficiency here. Iannoccone and Herrera testified at trial that, during the period covered by the S3 Indictment, they collaborated with Lee in the theft of as many as 40 truckloads of pallets (see Tr. 80 (Iannoccone: 30-40); id. at 310-12, 386 (Herrera: 40)); and Iannoc-eone testified that a truck would hold 500 pallets. Thus, there was proof that Lee participated in stealing 15,000-20,000 pallets. The USPS equipment manager testified that the Postal Service had paid an average price of $15-20 per pallet; thus the value of the stolen pallets was shown to be at least $225,000, and as much as $400,000. Plainly, the evidence overwhelmingly supported a finding that Lee was responsible for stealing USPS pallets worth more than $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">Nor, given the sufficiency of the evidence as to that value, is there any double-jeopardy basis for requiring that Lee be resentenced for only a misdemean- or. A defendant who seeks relief on appeal on a basis other than insufficiency of the evidence is subject to retrial, and the government is free to seek a new (and improved) indictment. See, ag., Dunn, 442 U.S. at 113 n.14, 99 S.Ct. 2190; see generally Lockhart v. Nelson, 488 U.S. 33, 38, 109 S.Ct. 285, 102 L.Ed.2d 265 (1988); Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.S. 545, 557-58, 99 S.Ct. 2993, 61 L.Ed.2d 739 (1979); North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 720-21, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">And finally, there is no need to guess whether a grand jury would be inclined to allege that Lee had stolen pallets worth more than $1,000. Although in Stirone \u2014 in which the government had been allowed to introduce evidence at trial that the defendant obstructed prospective interstate commerce in steel from a mill yet to be constructed, while the indictment charged him only with obstructing commerce in sand and supplies for mixing concrete \u2014 the Court noted that \u201cneither this nor any other court can know that the grand jury would have been willing to charge that Stirone\u2019s conduct would interfere with interstate exportation of steel from a mill later to be built\u201d with that concrete, 361 U.S. at 217, 80 S.Ct. 270, there is no semblance of any uncertainty in this case. Within 24 hours of Lee\u2019s making known his objection to having the \u00a7 641 felony-threshold value question submitted to the jury, the grand jury handed down S4, which alleged that Lee had stolen Postal Service pallets \u201cthat were worth thousands of dollars\u201d (S4 Indictment at 1). Although the S4 Indictment was not used at trial, it leaves no doubt about the grand jury\u2019s view as to the value of the stolen pallets.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In all the circumstances \u2014 including the S3 Indictment\u2019s specifications as to Lee\u2019s core criminal conduct, the overwhelming trial evidence of Lee\u2019s conduct matching those specifications, Lee\u2019s admitted knowledge that the government sought to have him sentenced as a felon, the (unused) S4 Indictment expressly alleging that the value of the stolen pallets exceeded $1,000, the fact that if the present conviction were overturned, Lee would be subject to retrial on the felony charge, and the trial evidence that he participated in the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of Postal Service pallets \u2014 we conclude that the failure of the S3 Indictment to allege that the value of the stolen pallets exceeded $1,000 did not affect Lee\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">D. Lee\u2019s Evidentiary Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Lee also challenges rulings by the trial court that excluded certain evidence he sought to introduce. We review such rulings \u201cunder an abuse-of-diseretion standard,\u201d Boyce v. Soundview Technology Group, Inc., 464 F.3d 376, 385 (2d Cir. 2006), and \u201can evidentiary ruling will ordinarily not be disturbed unless it was \u2018manifestly erroneous,\u2019 \u201d New Haven Radio, Inc. v. Meister (In re Martin-Trigona), 760 F.2d 1334, 1344 (2d Cir. 1985) (quoting Salem v. United States Lines Co., 370 U.S. 31, 35, 82 S.Ct. 1119, 8 L.Ed.2d 313 (1962)). Further, even an evidentiary ruling that is erroneous will warrant a new trial only \u201cif it also affects a party\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., 189 F.3d 218, 224 (2d Cir. 1999); see Fed. R. Evid. 103(a) (\u201cA party may claim error in a ruling to admit or exclude evidence only if the error affects a substantial right of the party....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">We see no merit in Lee\u2019s evidentiary contentions, which do not require extended discussion. First, Lee attempted to impeach a witness by questioning him about an unrelated case in which the witness\u2019s testimony had been found \u2014 on appeal \u2014 to lack credibility. We see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 403 to disallow that attempt on the ground that the probative value of such a credibility finding in a different case was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and confusion to the jury in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">Second, Lee sought to introduce prior written statements by two other witnesses, including Herrera, that did not match their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>trial testimony. Although the trial court excluded the writings, Lee was allowed to cross-examine each witness extensively as to differences between his or her writings and his or her testimony. We cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s rulings were an abuse of discretion or that Lee\u2019s substantial rights were affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We have considered all of Lee\u2019s arguments on this appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal. The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
