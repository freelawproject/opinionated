The presentence report (PSR) increased Olivares\u2019s offense level to 20 after application of an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(B), noting that three aliens had positively identified Oli-vares as the person who brandished a weapon in order to threaten them. The district court overruled Olivares\u2019s objection to the enhancement and sentenced him within the advisory guidelines range to 66 months of imprisonment and a two-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Olivares now contends that the district court erred by applying the \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(B) enhancement. We review for clear error his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the district court\u2019s factual findings. <em>See United States v. Reyna-Esparza, </em>777 F.3d 291, 293-94 (5th Cir. 2015). While the Government has the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the facts which are necessary to support the enhancement, <em>id. </em>at 294, \u201c[a]s a general rule, information in the pre-sentence report is presumed reliable and may be adopted by the district court without further inquiry if the defendant fails to demonstrate by competent rebuttal evidence that the information is materially untrue, inaccurate, or unreliable,\u201d <em>United States v. Carbajal, </em>290 F.3d 277, 287 (5th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Oli-vares thus has the burden to present competent evidence showing that the facts in the PSR are materially untrue or inaccurate. <em>United States v. Cervantes, </em>706 F.3d 603, 620-21 (5th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">Olivares has not made the requisite showing. He first contends that the photographic lineup from which the aliens identified him was unconstitutionally suggestive because his photograph was the only one in which the subject had tattoos and facial hair. Because Olivares did not provide the photographic lineup in connection with his argument, there is no evidence in the record to support his allegation. \u201cMere objections do not suffice as competent rebuttal evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 455 (5th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">Olivares also contends that the aliens incorrectly identified an innocent person (codefendant Priscilla Gutierrez) from a different photographic lineup and that the firearm the aliens claimed to have seen was never found. These statements do not comprise competent rebuttal evidence. The charges against Gutierrez were dismissed, but there is no indication in the record that the dismissal occurred because the aliens misidentified Gutierrez or because she was actually innocent; rather, the record indicates that the photographic lineup which included Gutierrez was created only after law enforcement had already found her to be connected to the stash house. The PSR also provided a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>explanation for why the firearm was never found: the stash house where the aliens were housed was never searched, because the aliens escaped and were found by law enforcement at a different location. We have upheld the application of the \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(B) enhancement where a firearm was not recovered from the defendant at the time of arrest. <em>See United States v. Cabrera, </em>600 Fed.Appx. 279, 279-80 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2412, 193 L.Ed.2d 180 (2015).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Olivares has not demonstrated by competent rebuttal evidence that the facts in the PSR supporting application of the \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(B) enhancement were materially untrue or inaccurate. <em>See Cervantes, </em>706 F.3d at 620-21. Accordingly, he has not shown that the district court clearly erred in applying the enhancement. <em>See Reyna-Esparza, </em>777 F.3d at 293-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-17\">.
