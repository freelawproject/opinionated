The order denied Torres\u2019s Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(d) motion for relief from the District Court\u2019s prior order denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. In <em>Kellogg v. Strack, </em>269 F.3d 100 (2d Cir. 2001), this Court held that a COA is required to appeal a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment when the underlying order denied 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas relief. Because the principles animating <em>Kellogg </em>apply with equal force in the Rule 60(d) context, we now hold that a COA is required to appeal a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(d) motion when the underlying order denied \u00a7 2255 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-22\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b190-23\">In November of 2013, Torres filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his federal conviction for conspiracy to commit murder. The District Court denied the motion, and Torres then moved under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(d) to set aside the denial on the grounds that the Government had committed fraud on the court. The district court denied Torres\u2019s Rule 60(d) motion and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>nied a COA. Torres appealed, and he moves in this Court for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">A petitioner\u2019s right to appeal an order denying a \u00a7 2255 motion is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c), which provides that \u201c[ujnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certif\u00edcate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from ... (B) the final order in a proceeding under section 2255.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). The question presented by Torres\u2019s COA motion is whether a district court\u2019s denial of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(d) motion for relief from an order denying a \u00a7 2255 motion is governed by this provision, thereby requiring that a COA be issued before the appeal may go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">We addressed a nearly identical question in <em>Kellogg. </em>In <em>Kellogg, </em>we explained that, because an order denying a Rule 60(b) motion is a \u201cfinal order,\u201d the plain text of \u00a7 2253(c)(1) makes the COA requirement applicable to an order denying a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas proceeding under \u00a7 2254. 269 F.3d at 102-03. The same principle applies here: because an order denying a Rule 60(d) motion is a final order, \u00a7 2253(e)(l)\u2019s COA requirement applies to an order denying a Rule 60(d) motion in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Our conclusion comports with the practice of the other Circuits that have addressed the issue. <em>See Gregory v. Denham, </em>623 Fed.Appx. 932, 933 (10th Cir. 2015) (denying a COA to appeal the denial of a Rule 60(d) motion in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding); <em>United States v. Russell, </em>432 Fed.Appx. 276, 276-77 (4th Cir. 2011) (same); <em>Thompkins v. Berghuis, </em>509 Fed.Appx. 517, 519 (6th Cir. 2013) (noting that the Court had previously granted a COA to appeal the denial of a joint Rule 60(b) and Rule 60(d) motion in a \u00a7 2254 habeas proceeding).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, it would be inconsistent to apply the COA requirement in the Rule 60(b) context, but not the rule 60(d) context. Rule 60(b) and Rule 60(d) serve a similar purpose: to allow district courts, in appropriate circumstances, to grant relief from a judgment or final order. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 60 (titled \u201cRelief from a Judgment or Order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">We thus expressly hold that a petitioner must obtain a COA to appeal the denial of a Rule 60(d) motion in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. We now address the merits of Torres\u2019s COA motion. In order to obtain a COA, Torres must show that \u201c(1) jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court abused its discretion in denying his Rule 60[ (d) ] motion, and (2) jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the underlying [\u00a7 2255 motion],\u201d in light of the grounds alleged to support the 60(d) motion, \u201cstates a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d- <em>Kellogg, </em>269 F.3d at 104. We have reviewed the record and conclude that Torres has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that Torres\u2019s motion for a COA is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\">. Although <em>Thompkins </em>was decided in the \u00a7 2254 habeas context, its reasoning applies with equal force in the \u00a7 2255 context. <em>See Jackson v. Albany Appeal Bureau Unit, </em>442 F.3d 51, 54 n.2 (2d Cir. 2006) (\"Since \u00a7 2254 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are generally seen as <em>in pari materia, </em>the reasoning of cases in the context of \u00a7 2254 petitions applies equally to \u00a7 2255 petitions.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
