R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) and (6) for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s February 2009 summary judgment decision, which denied plaintiffs a preliminary and permanent injunction, granted defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims challenging the constitutionality of certain contribution restrictions within New York City\u2019s campaign finance laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In their February 27, 2008 amended complaint, plaintiffs \u2014 a group of New York City voters, aspiring candidates, lobbyists, and affiliated individuals and entities\u2014 claimed, as relevant here, that the laws\u2019 restrictions on contributions unduly burdened their protected political speech in violation of the First Amendment and denied them equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction against defendants \u2014 members of New York City\u2019s Campaign Finance Board and other City representatives (collectively \u201cthe City\u201d). In its February 2009 summary judgment decision the district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief and dismissed their claims challenging the constitutionality of the contribution restrictions. <em>Ognibene v. Parkes (Ognibene I), </em>599 F.Supp.2d 434 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). This Court affirmed that decision. <em>Ognibene v. Parkes (Ognibene II), </em>671 F.3d 174 (2d Cir. 2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 28, 183 L.Ed.2d 676 (2012). Several years later, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>McCutcheon v. FEC, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1434, 188 L.Ed.2d 468 (2014). Plaintiffs contend that <em>McCwtcheon </em>has altered in their favor the jurisprudence governing campaign finance. Using <em>McCwtcheon </em>as their sword, plaintiffs now seek to reattack the district court\u2019s February 2009 order that denied them injunctive relief and that upheld as constitutional the challenged provisions of the City\u2019s laws. For the following reasons we affirm the district court\u2019s decision,to deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">Subject of this challenge are three provisions of New York City\u2019s Administrative Code commonly known as the \u201cpay to play\u201d rules. These provisions (1) lower the generally applicable base campaign contribution limits for people engaged in business dealings with the City, <em>see </em>N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 3-703(l-a), 3-719(2)(b) (the \u201cdoing business contribution limits\u201d); (2) deny matching funds, which are otherwise generally available, for any contribution made by people engaged in business dealings with the City and certain people associated with lobbyists, <em>see </em>N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 3-702(3), 3-703(l-a) (the \u201cnon-matching funds provision\u201d); and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>extend the existing prohibition on corporate contributions to partnerships, LLCs, and LLPs, see N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 3-703(1)(l), 3-719(2)(b) (the \u201centity contribution ban\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In the course of deciding <em>Ognibene I, </em>the district court consolidated plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction with the merits of their claim for permanent injunctive relief. Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s then-existing framework for analyzing challenges to restrictions on political campaign contributions, the district court upheld all three \u201cpay to play\u201d rules, finding them to be \u201cclosely drawn\u201d to achieve a sufficiently important governmental interest, namely, addressing reasonable concerns about actual or apparent corruption with respect to campaign contributions. <em>See Ognibene I, </em>599 F.Supp.2d at 444-61. On appeal, the three judges of this Court each wrote separately to clarify their views on the law applicable to various issues that do not bear on our holding today. Ultimately, they affirmed the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Ognibene II, </em>671 F.3d at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In April 2014, the Supreme Court decided <em>McCutcheon v. FEC. </em>In October 2014, plaintiffs moved under Rule 60(b)(5) and (6)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for relief from the February 2009 judgment in light of <em>McCutcheon. </em>Plaintiffs contend in their motion that <em>McCutcheon </em>established, <em>inter alia, </em>a more rigorous standard of review with respect to the government\u2019s burden of proof and what constitutes a permissible governmental interest, a standard under which the \u201cpay to play\u201d rules do not pass muster. Plaintiffs argued that because these unconstitutional provisions had continued to chill their protected political speech, they were entitled to relief under Rule 60(b). By order dated June 9, 2015 the district court denied the motion, finding that <em>McCutcheon </em>did not clearly compel a result different from that reached by this Court in <em>Ognibene II </em>and that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the extraordinary circumstances necessary to justify relief under the applicable Rule 60(b) provisions. Plaintiffs timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on appeal rely entirely on Rule 60(b)(5). This subsection provides, as relevant here, that a court \u201cmay relieve a party ... from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d where \u201capplying [the judgment] prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d Although not addressed by the parties or the district court, we solicited and received supplemental briefing from the parties on the following threshold issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-12\">Whether the third clause of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) \u2014 covering circumstances in which \u201capplying [a final judgment] prospectively is no longer equitable\u201d \u2014 is properly invoked to \u201crelieve a party ... from a final judgment\u201d where no injunction or other order with direct prospective force has been entered, <em>see Comfort v. Lynn Sch. Comm., </em>560 F.3d 22, 27-28 (1st Cir. 2009), and as to which the mandate has issued and certiorari review has been denied or the time for seeking such review has expired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Supp. Br. Order (April 28, 2016). In their supplemental letter brief plaintiffs answer the question in the affirmative and assert there are two prospective effects of the district court\u2019s February 2009 order that entitle them to relief from it: (1) it \u201cestablishes an affirmative, judicial sanction for the chill of Plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights,\u201d Appellants\u2019 Supp. Ltr. Br. at 5, and (2) its <em>res judicata </em>effect prevents plaintiffs from vindicating their rights in a new action. For the following reasons we conclude that neither of these purported effects, considered alone or in combination, satisfies the threshold requirement under the third clause of Rule 60(b)(5) that the judgment sought to be reconsidered apply prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u201cRule 60(b) strikes a balance between serving the ends of justice and preserving the finality of judgments.\u201d <em>Nemaizer v. Baker, </em>793 F.2d 58, 61 (2d Cir. 1986) (citing <em>House v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>688 F.2d 7, 9 (2d Cir. 1982)). Although \u201cit should be broadly construed to do substantial justice, ... final judgments should not be lightly reopened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">To that end, the third clause of subsection (5) aims to ensure equitable results, but it covers only final judgments that \u201capply[ ] ... prospectively.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). Neither the Rule nor the accompanying Advisory Committee Notes define what constitutes a prospective application. Of course, \u201c[v]irtually every court order causes at least some reverberations into the future, and has, in that literal sense, some prospective effect.\u201d <em>Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, </em>841 F.2d 1133, 1138 (D.C. Cir. 1988). \u201cThat a court\u2019s action has continuing consequences, however, does not necessarily mean that it [\u2018applies] ... prospectively\u2019] for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(5).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such a broad interpretation of this provision would render the word \u201cprospectively\u201d superfluous and eviscerate the principle of finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The history of Rule 60(b)(5) supports a more reasonable construction. The third clause of subsection (5), added by amendment in 1948, codified a power that courts had long been exercising: to modify their decrees or injunctions in light of changed circumstances. <em>See Twelve John Does, </em>841 F.2d at 1139 (analyzing the seminal Supreme Court cases <em>United States v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>286 U.S. 106, 52 S.Ct. 460, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932)\u2014in which the Court considered modifying a consent decree that imposed restrictions on meat-packing businesses named in a Sherman Anti-Trust Law action in light of significant changes to the nature of the meat-packing industry-and <em>Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., </em>59 U.S. (18 How.) 421, 15 L.Ed. 435 (1856) \u2014 in which the Court dissolved its prior injunction ordering that a particular bridge be removed as an unconstitutional obstruction to commerce after Congress subsequently declared the bridge to be a lawful structure). To be sure, the \u201cprospective application\u201d clause is not strictly limited to injunctions or even equitable remedies. <em>See, e.g., In re Racing Seros., Inc., </em>571 F.3d 729, 733-34 (8th Cir. 2009) (applying the provision to a bankruptcy court subordination order). Indeed, \u201c[a]ny such restriction would be inconsistent with the merger of law and equity.\u201d 11 Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Civ. \u00a7 2863 (3d ed. 2016). But because the third clause of Rule 60(b)(5) is rooted in the \u201ctraditional power of a court of equity to modify its decree in light of changed circumstances,\u201d <em>Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins, </em>540 U.S. 431, 441, 124 S.Ct. 899, 157 L.Ed.2d 855 (2004), a final judgment or order has \u201cprospective application\u201d for purposes of Rule 60(b)(5) only where it is \u201c \u2018executory\u2019 or involves \u2018the supervision of changing conduct or conditions,\u2019 \u201d <em>DeWeerth v. Baldinger, </em>38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>F.3d 1266, 1275 (2d Cir. 1994) (quoting <em>Twelve John Does, </em>841 F.2d at 1139).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">While we have made clear that orders or judgments that provide for ongoing injunc-tive relief fall squarely within these limits, <em>see id. </em>we have not yet had the occasion to review the denial of a Rule 60(b)(5) motion in which, as here, the movants seek reconsideration of an order <em>dismissing </em>then-request for injunctive relief. Our precedent nevertheless provides some guidance. In <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Sarkisian, </em>794 F.2d 754 (2d Cir. 1986), we noted in dicta that \u201cit is doubtful that the preclusive nature of a dismissal with prejudice is a prospective effect under the rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757 n.4. In <em>DeWeerth, </em>we explained further that a judgment is not prospective under Rule 60(b)(5) where its only prospective effect is to preclude relitigation of the issues decided. <em>DeWeerth, </em>38 F.3d at 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Numerous other circuits have considered issues substantially similar to the one before us today, and all have held that a judgment or order of dismissal or a judgment or order denying a plaintiff injunc-tive relief, as was entered in February 2009 in this case, does not apply prospectively within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(5). <em>See Comfort v. Lynn Sch. Comm., </em>560 F.3d 22, 27-28 (1st Cir. 2009) (holding' district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint challenging constitutionality of law did not have prospective application under Rule 60(b)(5)); <em>Fantasyland Video, Inc. v. Cty. of San Diego, </em>505 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding summary judgment order upholding constitutionality of law against plaintiffs\u2019 challenge did not have prospective application under Rule 60(b)(5)); <em>Coltec Indus., Inc. v. Hobgood, </em>280 F.3d 262, 271-73 (3d Cir. 2002) (holding judgment dismissing with prejudice plaintiffs constitutional claims not prospective under Rule 60(b)(5) notwithstanding any <em>res judicata </em>effect); <em>Picco v. Global Marine Drilling Co., </em>900 F.2d 846, 851 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding final judgment of dismissal not prospective under Rule 60(b)(5) where res <em>judicata </em>is only prospective effect); <em>Gibbs v. Maxwell House, A Div. of Gen. Foods Corp., </em>738 F.2d 1153, 1156 (11th Cir. 1984) (holding judgment dismissing action for failure to prosecute was \u201cfinal and permanent\u201d and thus not prospective under Rule 60(b)(5)); see <em>also Dowell by Dowell v. Bd. of Educ., </em>8 F.3d 1501, 1509 (10th Cir. 1993) (judgment dissolving school-desegregation decree did not have prospective effect required by Rule 60(b)(5)); <em>Schwartz v. United States, </em>976 F.2d 213, 218 (4th Cir. 1992) (holding judgment memorializing settlement agreement not prospective under Rule 60(b)(5) where all duties under agreement had been performed).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that <em>McCutcheon </em>uprooted the legal foundation of <em>Ognibene I </em>and <em>II </em>sucb that those decisions are wrong and the \u201cpay to play\u201d rules are unconstitutional, plaintiffs are barred from using Rule 60(b)(5) as a vehicle for seeking relief from the February 2009 order because that order does not have prospective application. Plaintiffs argue that the February 2009 order does apply prospectively in that it sanctions and enables a continuing unconstitutional chill of plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights. This argument misses the mark, however, because any chill plaintiffs continue to experience results from the \u201cpay to play\u201d rules themselves, not the order rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to those rules. The February 2009 order was immediately final and required nothing of the parties or the district court going forward; it did not apply prospectively. <em>See DeWeerth, </em>38 F.3d at 1275; <em>Twelve John Does, </em>841 F.2d at 1139 (\u201cThat plaintiff remains bound by the [judgment of] dismissal is not a \u2018prospective effect\u2019 within the meaning of rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>60(b)(5) any more than if plaintiff were continuing to feel the effects of a money judgment against him.\u201d (quoting <em>Gibbs, </em>738 F.2d at 1156)).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Plaintiffs contend that the <em>res judicata </em>effect of the February 2009 order renders it prospective under Rule 60(b)(5). But <em>res judicata </em>is precisely the type of effect that we rejected in <em>DeWeerth </em>as insufficient to meet the rule\u2019s prospective application requirement, 38 F.3d at 1276, and that our sister circuits have also uniformly determined not to be cognizable under Rule 60(b)(5) as the basis for determining that a judgment applies prospectively, <em>see, e.g., Comfort, </em>560 F.3d at 28; <em>Coltec Indus., Inc., </em>280 F.3d at 272; <em>Picco, </em>900 F.2d at 851; <em>Gibbs, </em>738 F.2d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We need not go further. That a judgment or order sought to be modified has prospective force is an indispensable condition for obtaining relief from that judgment or order under the third set of circumstances listed in Rule 60(b)(5). <em>See Comfort, </em>560 F.3d at 28. The fact that the district court\u2019s prior dismissal was not ex-ecutory and did not leave open future adjudication of any issues regarding the rights of the parties now at issue here and before the district court is fatal to plaintiffs\u2019 claim under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\"> Finally, plaintiffs state in passing, alternatively, that they are entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(6), which provides that a court may relieve a party from a final judgment for \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). That argument fails. Rule 60(b)(6) applies only \u201cwhen the asserted grounds for relief are not recognized in clauses (l)-(5) of the Rule\u201d and \u201cthere are extraordinary circumstances justifying relief.\u201d <em>Nemaizer, </em>793 F.2d at 63. \u201c[A]s a general matter, a mere change in decisional law does not constitute an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(6),\u201d <em>Marre-ro Pichardo v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 46, 56 (2d Cir. 2004), and \u201cthe interest in finality outweighs\u201d the losing party\u2019s concern \u201cthat justice was not done,\u201d <em>In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, </em>741 F.3d 353, 357 (2d Cir. 2013). Plaintiffs do not assert a basis for relief under subsection (6) that is separate from the basis asserted under subsection (5), nor do they set forth \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d justifying relief apart from asserting the same injuries they have alleged in their complaint \u2014 that the \u201cpay to play\u201d rules deprive them of their expressive and associational rights and are thus unconstitutional. That failure is fatal to their claim under Rule 60(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">For the foregoing reasons the district court\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\">. Plaintiffs also challenged other provisions of New York City\u2019s campaign finance laws. The district court addressed these remaining claims in various orders subsequent to its February 2009 summary judgment decision. This appeal, however, concerns only those provisions of the campaign finance laws upheld in the district court's February 2009 summary judgment order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">.
