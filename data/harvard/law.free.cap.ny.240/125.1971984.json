(<em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>214 N. Y. 332; <em>Bailley </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>14 Hun, 86; <em>Finnern </em>v. <em>Hinz, </em>38 Hun, 465; <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Ganson, </em>5 Wend. 558; <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>4 Cow. 493; <em>Elwood </em>v. <em>Diefendorf, 5 </em>Barb. 398; <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Green, </em>51 Hun, 6; <em>Bruyn </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>52 Hun, 17; <em>Matter of Warrin, </em>56 App. Div. 414.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-9\"><em>Samuel M. Gold </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aro\">The court correctly charged the jury that the executrix, Barbara Rosenberg, could issue the note in suit in settlement of an existing claim against the estate and that it was binding upon the estate without the authority or ratification of the other two executors. <em>(Murray </em>v. <em>Blatchford, </em>1 Wend. 583; <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>98 N.

He received from his mother, one of the executors, a promissory note payable on demand for the amount of this claim, signed \u201c Estate of Charles Rosenberg per Barbara Rosenberg, Executrix.\u201d The court charged the jury that this note, if made for a sufficient consideration, was binding on the estate though the other executors had neither co-operated in making it nor ratified it thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The law is settled to the contrary <em>(Union Bank of Brooklyn </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>214 N. Y. 332, 343, 344; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>14 Hun, 86; <em>Hammon </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>4 Cow. 493, 494, 495).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">These authorities are not opposed to <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Lambert </em>(98 N. Y. 300). There money was delivered to one of two executors after the death of the testator upon a trust orally declared. Authority to accept the deposit carried with it authority to fix the terms of the acceptance (cf. <em>Hammon </em>v. <em>Huntley, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The conclusion thus reached makes it unnecessary to consider other rulings, some of which are cut off from our power of review by the unanimous affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The judgment of the Appellate Division and that of the Trial Term should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Hiscock, Ch.
