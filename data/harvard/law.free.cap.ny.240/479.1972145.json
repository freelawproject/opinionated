Sarasoi-in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">The party of the first part is the defendant in this action. The party of the second part is the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">Analyzing the agreement we find that the defendant paid to the plaintiff the sum of $3,000 for which he received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>one-quarter interest in the play called \u201c Anathema,\u201d and in the profits to be earned upon its production. This is not all. He also received one-quarter of the receipts for stock and repertoire rights, and a one-quarter interest in. the scenery used in the production and in the new costumes and fixtures. By the agreement these property rights were transferred and assigned to him. What were the defendant\u2019s privileges and obligations? He was to have one-quarter share in all profits to accrue in the production of the play upon the English speaking stage <em>\u201c </em>and he shall also bear any losses that may occur in the production of said play upon the English speaking stage, in' the same share or part and to the extent of twenty-five (25%) per cent, or one-quarter of any anti all of said losses.\u201d In other words, for $3,000 he got one-quarter interest in the play called \u201c Anathema \u201d together with scenery and costumes and was to share to the extent of twenty-five (25%) per cent in the profits or losses of the production upon the English speaking stage. A concession was made however; the parties added this clause; \u201c * * * it being expressly agreed between the parties hereto that in the event that the run of the said play upon the English speaking stage is not longer than four weeks, or that the run of said play is limited to four weeks, and if the gross receipts for said play during said fourth week does not amount to Nine thousand ($9,000) dollars, then and in either of said events, the party of the second part (the plaintiff) must return to the party of the first part, (defendant) the sum of Five hundred ($500) dollars of said Three thousand ($3,000) dollars, paid in as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Notice should be taken here of the omission to state anything in this clause regarding a loss. The clause does not refer to a loss or to a profit. In the event that the play did not run for longer than four weeks or was limited to four weeks and the gross receipts in the fourth week did not amount to more than $9,000, then the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>was to get back $500. He would be entitled to a reduction of $500 in the purchase price even if there had been a <em>profit </em>in a three weeks\u2019 run.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The courts below have construed this clause to mean that if there were a loss in the production of the.play for less than four weeks, no matter how great the loss was, the defendant would lose $2,500 of the amount he had put in and no more. But he put in $3,000. Would the plaintiff' be obliged to pay him back $500 besides standing all the loss? If this is what the parties had in mind, why did they say that the defendant was to share one-quarter of the losses? If one-quarter of the loss was to be limited to $2,500 of the amount he put in, it would have been very easy and simple to have so expressed it. What, we may ask, becomes of the defendant\u2019s one-quarter interest in the play rights and stage property? We read this agreement as one of a theatrical venture wherein the defendant bought a twenty-five (25%) per cent interest not only in the profits, but in the property, and was to be hable for 25 per cent of the losses. If the play only ran four weeks or less he was to be allowed $500 out of his purchase price. This would be added to his profits, if there were any, and taken out of his share .of the losses, should the venture be unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">By this interpretation we give effect to every clause in the agreement according to the terms and words used by the parties. It is a formal agreement apparently drawn up with some care. The courts are asked to construe it. The parties differ as to its construction. The plaintiff has paid a loss alleged to be over $13,000. Naturally the defendant wants to pay as little of this as possible.. He construes this agreement one way, the plaintiff another. When such differences have arisen, and the events have occurred which require the courts to determine between such parties the share of loss which each must pay, it is wise as well as reasonable to follow closely the words and phrases used by the parties in making the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>before the event happened and to give to those words and phrases their natural meaning limiting them to the conditions expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">For these reasons the judgments below must be reversed, with, costs in all courts and the motion for judgment on the pleadings denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b529-6\">McLaughlin, J. (dissenting):</author>\n<p id=\"AeO\">Its a trite saying that parties make contracts and the court discharges its full duty by construing the same according to their intentions. <em>(Gillet </em>v. <em>Bank of America, </em>160 N. Y. 549.) This saying is especially applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The plaintiff and the defendant about to enter into a theatrical venture executed a written contract, a copy of which is set forth in the prevailing opinion by which the respondent Amster sought to limit in case of the failure of the venture his loss. The intent to do so is so clearly expressed that it is difficult to see how there can be the slightest doubt about it. After .providing that the respondent was to contribute, which he did towards the venture, $3,000, it was expressly stated that his loss if such occurred was limited to $2,500 and in event of such loss $500 of the $3,000 was to be returned to him. If language means anything this is precisely what the parties intended. This is the provision in the contract, viz., \u201c it being expressly agreed between the parties hereto that in the event that the run of said play upon the English speaking stage is not longer than four weeks, or that the run of said play is limited to four weeks, and if the gross receipts for said play during said fourth week does not' amount to Nine thousand ($9,000.00) dollars, then and in either of said events, the party of the second part \u201d (the plaintiff), \u201c must return to the- party of the first part,\u201d (the respondent), \u201c the sum of Five hundred ($500.00) dollars of \u2022 said Three thousand ($3,000.00) dollars, paid in as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The run of the said play upon the English speaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>stage did not continue for four weeks. The gross receipts for said play during said fourth week did not amount to nine thousand ($9,000) dollars. The play only ran three weeks. Therefore, according to the express provisions of the contract quoted, the respondent\u2019s loss incurred by the venture was limited to twenty-five hundred ($2,500) dollars, and it cannot by a forced and unwarranted construction make the respondent liable for twenty-five per cent of the loss. If it can be done then the court makes a contract which the parties themselves did not intend to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">I am of the opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Hiscock, Ch. J., Cardozo, Pound, Andrews and Lehman, JJ., concur with Crane, J.; McLaughlin, J., reads dissenting memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Judgments reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
