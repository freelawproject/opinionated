If any credit was issued by the defendant in favor of the plaintiffs, that credit was created as a result of the first three letters which passed between the parties, namely, defendant\u2019s letter of May 5, 1920, plaintiffs\u2019 letter of June 10, 1920, and defendant\u2019s letter of June 11, 1920, and was, therefore, a credit expiring October 1, 1920, in accordance with the limitation contained in defendant\u2019s letter of June eleventh. <em>(Schenectady </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>101 N.

SPARKS,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-13\">\n<em>\u201c Assistant Cashier.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">On June 11th the National Park Bank notified Lamborn &amp; Company that the shipping period according to the instructions received from Brodsky Gross &amp; Company was August and September <em>from Java.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">Here we have a full and complete letter of credit confirmed and irrevocable issued by the defendant to the plaintiffs in accordance with instructions from Brodsky Gross &amp; Company or their Chicago agents carrying out the terms of the contract of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The sugar arrived in December of 1920 and was placed on board cars at Philadelphia. A draft for $79,623.24 was drawn on the defendant and presented at its New York banking house with all the required documents. Payment was refused. The reason given was that the letter of credit had expired. There was no claim made that a letter of credit had not been issued. It is conceded and always has been that the plaintiffs complied fully with all shipping instructions and that they presented all the documents required by the letter of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">This action is brought to recover on the letter of credit the amount of the draft. The defenses are inconsistent. <em>First, </em>the defendant denies that there was any letter of credit; <em>secondly, </em>it claims that if there were a letter of credit, it expired on October 1, 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The case was fully tried out before the court without a jury and judgment delivered for the plaintiffs which has been affirmed by the Appellate Division, one of the justices dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">We may dismiss the first contention of the defendant that there was no letter of credit by the brief statement that all of its correspondence regarding this transaction admitted that there was a letter of credit, its sole claim-being until the matter came to court that the draft was not presented in time. It is said that the letter of May fifth contained no promise to pay. Letters of credit do not usually contain a direct promise to pay. Such a promise is implied or inferred from the statement that credit has been established and is irrevocable. A confirmed irrevocable letter of credit, an irrevocable letter, or a confirmed credit is a contract to pay upon compliance with its terms and needs no formal acknowledgment or acceptance other than is therein stated. Banks may \u2014 \u25a0 they usually do \u2014 communicate to the drawer the instructions received from the correspondent estabhshing the credit, <em>(Gelpcke v. Quentell, </em>74 N. Y. 599; Krakauer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>v. <em>Chapman, </em>16 App. Div. 115; affd., 162 N. Y. 623; <em>Doelger </em>v. <em>Battery Park National Bank, </em>201 App. Div. 515; <em>Border Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>American Nat. Bank, </em>282 Fed. Rep. 73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><em>Moss </em>v. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>(246 Mass. 139) contains no statement or ruling to the contrary, as intimated by the courts below. The letter of credit in that case had been rejected. Chief Justice Rugg is particular to point out that no particular form is prescribed for a letter of credit. <em>\u201c </em>Their nature and use,\u201d says he, \u201c ought to be kept as free as possible from narrowing statements of limitations and from judicial dicta not necessary to a particular decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">As to the second ground of defense, that the letter of credit had expired on October- 1st, we must consider other letters passing between the parties after May the fifth. In considering these letters we must carry in mind the terms and conditions of this alleged letter of credit of May 5th as amended or modified by the letter of June 11th. It advised Lamborn &amp; Company that the defendant had received instructions to open a confirmed credit for $79,685.76, payable against sight drafts and shipping documents, showing that the sugars were placed f. o. b. cars Philadelphia, shipments to be made during August and September, 1920, from Java. The credit was to be opened with the Bankers Trust Company, but that bank had instructed the National Park Bank to open it directly with Lamborn <em>&amp; </em>Company. The letter closed by asking, <em>\u201c </em>Kindly advise us in this connection.\u201d I. have said that this constituted a complete letter of credit. No time was mentioned within which the sight drafts were to be presented. In the absence of a fixed time the law will read into the instrument a provision that they were to be presented within a reasonable time. (See above cases.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">On June tenth, the plaintiffs wrote the defendant the following letter: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201c Lamborn &amp; Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">\u201c Import <em>&amp; </em>Export</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u201c Department 132 Front Street</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\u201c New York</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZMW\">\u201c <em>June </em>10, 1920.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201c National Park Bank of New York,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">\u201c # 214 Broadway,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">\u201c New York City:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">\u201cGentlemen.\u2014 We refer to your Letter of Credit #13840, issued .upon instructions from Greenebaum <em>&amp; </em>Sons Bank &amp; Trust Company, Chicago, for the account of Brodsky Gross, Chicago, 111., for $79,685.76.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">\u201c You state that you advised the Bankers Trust Company, but that they returned your advices, stating that Credit should be opened directly with us.

We also beg to call your attention to the fact that shipment should be August and /or September from Java.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">\u201cWe regret that this matter has not been called to your attention at an earlier date, but would appreciate your cooperation in arranging details, so that they may be satisfactory to all concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD9L\"><em>\u201c </em>Yours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-15\">\u201c LAMBORN &amp; COMPANY,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-16\">\u201c (Signed) G.

It refers to the letter of credit No. 13840 as one which has been issued upon instructions for the account of Brodsky Gross, Chicago, Illinois. It answers the last and only inquiry in the letter of May 5th by saying that the credit opened with Lamborn &amp; Co. directly instead of with the Bankers Trust Company is correct. It then contains the request that the letter of credit set the expiration date as of December 31, 1920. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>words, instead of leaving the drafts to be presented within a reasonable time, the plaintiffs ask that a definite time be stated.- October first is not mentioned or referred to in either the letter of May fifth or that of June tenth.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">On the following day the National Park Bank answers:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The National Park Bank \u201c of New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\"><em>\" June </em>11, 1920.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">\u201c Messrs.

This also applies to the shipping period which in the instructions received by us specified August and September from Java.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-14\"><em>\u201c </em>Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-15\">\u201c (Signed) H. L. SPARKS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-16\">\n<em>\u201c Assistant Cashier.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-17\">Notice should be taken that this letter refers to <em>\u201c </em>our confirmed credit #13840,\u201d and that the instructions regarding the shipping period \u201c specified August and September from Java.\u201d In reply to the request of the plaintiffs the defendant writes that it has no authority to extend validity of this credit from October 1st to December 31st. The defendant does not say that its instructions were to limit the time of payment to October 1st, and it has never in its brief or by the evidence claimed that its instructions were to this effect. The contract between Brodsky Gross &amp; Company and the plaintiffs contained no such limitation \u2014 in fact no limitation at all. The letter of credit of May 5th contained no limitation. The sight drafts were to be presented within a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>time. Lamborn &amp; Company asked that a definite time might be fixed and I read this answer of the National Park Bank under June 11th as meaning that the defendant bank had no power or authority to make that definite which had been left indefinite. The letter of credit had been given the number 13840.. Throughout the correspondence this number is referred to as the letter of credit. The first mention of it is in the letter of May 5th, wherein it is termed <em>\u201c </em>Our credit #13840.\u201d This is the only letter of credit in eyidence in this case having this number. It contains no reference to October 1st. It reads in the eyes of the law as though it contained the provision payable against <em>\u201c </em>delivery of sight drafts <em>within a reasonable time.\u201d </em>If those words had been actually written into this letter of credit No. 13840 we would not consider that the letter of June 11th modified or struck them out. The plaintiffs by the letter of June 10th requested that the time limit be made definite. This letter of the defendant of June 11th simply refused the request as not within its instructions. It did not attempt to modify the letter of May 5th in this particular or to say that anything had been omitted. The answer was that the letter must stand as it was as the bank could not modify it; the instructions which had been followed could not be departed from. And thus the matter was left.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The plaintiffs never acquiesced in any modification and did not consider that the date of payment had been limited to October 1st. How could any reasonable business man dealing in sugars to be shipped from Java during August and September accept a letter of credit which would expire the day after the last- day of shipment from Java? The claim of the defendant would nullify the letter altogether. It is unreasonable. By a stipulation-of the parties it was agreed that in the ordinary course of shipping it takes seventy-five days to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>goods from Java to Philadelphia. Goods shipped the first day of August, the earliest possible date for shipment under the sales contract and the letter of credit, could not possibly reach Philadelphia until fifteen days after the expiration of the letter of credit, if the defendant\u2019s contention be correct. The shipping documents and bills of lading showing that the sugar had been placed f. o. b. cars at Philadelphia under no circumstances could possibly be presented to the bank on October 1st. No interpretation should be given tq this, letter of credit of the defendant or its correspondence which would make the whole thing meaningless and an absurdity. The defendant intended to give the plaintiffs something of value. Its letter of May 5th followed by that of June 11th cannot be considered as mere empty formalities. The bank should be held to the fair import of its engagement. These letters must receive a reasonable construction, having regard to the intent of the parties and the circumstances. <em>(Krakauer </em>v. <em>Chapman, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><em>\u201c </em>In the construction of written contracts it is the duty of the court, as near as may be, to place itself in the situation of the parties, and from a consideration of the surrounding circumstances, the occasion and apparent object of the .parties, to determine the meaning and intent of the language employed.\u201d <em>(Gillet </em>v. <em>Bank of America, </em>160 N. Y. 549, 555.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Beyond doubt, the defendant considered that it was bound to do something; that it was held to the plaintiffs by some valid and enforcible obligation. After the drop in the price of sugar it wrote on August 25th as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201c The National Park Bank \u201c of New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9b\"><em>\u201c August </em>25, 1920.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\"><em>\" </em>Messrs.
