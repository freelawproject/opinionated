Hickson, Respondent, v Anna Wallace, Appellant.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"Af0\">[\u2014 NYS2d \u2014]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"A57\">\u2014Order, Family Court, Bronx County (Alma Cordova, J.), entered on or about September 3, 1998, denying respondent\u2019s objections to a Final Order of Support of the same court (James Weigert, H.E.), entered on or about June 30, 1998, which, after a hearing, ordered respondent to pay child support in the amount of $233 biweekly, with arrears of $4,660 to be paid in $50 biweekly installments, unanimously modified, on the law, to remand the matter for a proper determination of the basic child support obligation and the amount of petitioner\u2019s arrears and to provide that petitioner\u2019s arrears be offset against respondent\u2019s arrears, and otherwise affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Since respondent was represented by counsel, who accepted service of petitioner\u2019s second petition in court and in respondent\u2019s presence without stating any objection on the record of that day, respondent\u2019s objection to lack of personal jurisdiction was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">It was improper for the Hearing Examiner not to have fixed a basic child support obligation in the first instance <em>(see, Bast v Rossoff, </em>91 NY2d 723). Therefore, the matter should be remanded for a proper fact finding and determination of the basic figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We decline to disturb the Hearing Examiner\u2019s determinations made on the basis of his observation of the parties\u2019 testimonial and documentary evidence <em>(see, e.g., Matter of Klein v Klein, </em>251 AD2d 733, 735). We find, however, that petitioner\u2019s arrears should be offset against respondent\u2019s arrears of $4,660, particularly where the parties agreed to such an offset and where the Hearing Examiner had suspended petitioner\u2019s payments in apparent anticipation of such an offset. We have considered respondent\u2019s remaining arguments and find them unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Reargument granted, and upon reargument, the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>and order of this Court entered on November 18, 1999 (266 AD2d 81) recalled and vacated and a new decision and order substituted therefor; motion otherwise denied.
