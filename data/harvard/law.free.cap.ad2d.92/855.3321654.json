Order reversed insofar as appealed from, without costs or disbursements, and the provision fining the appellants is stricken. Special Term found the authority to fine the defendants\u2019 attorney in the \u201cinherent powers doctrine\u201d. However, under the circumstances of this case that doctrine does not authorize the imposition of a sanction payable to the court rather than the moving party (see <em>Barouh Eaton Allen Corp. v International Business Machs. Corp., </em>76 AD2d 873; <em>Coppolino v K Co., </em>63 AD2d 957). Titone, J. P., Lazer, Brown and Boyers, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
