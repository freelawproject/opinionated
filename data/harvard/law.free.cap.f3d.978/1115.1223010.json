FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-15\">On December 27, 1988 plaintiffs/appellants filed a complaint against defendants/appellees alleging violations of sections 12(1) and 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cthe 1933 Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. section 77Z(1),(2), and section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cthe 1934 Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), as well as various violations of California state law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 8, 1989 the district court dismissed the complaint with leave to amend and, in particular, dismissed the causes of action alleging federal securities law violations for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. It based its ruling on <em>Matek v. Murat, </em>862 F.2d 720 (9th Cir.1988), in which we adopted only the first part of the three-part test set out by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 897, 102 S.Ct. 396, 70 L.Ed.2d 212 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-18\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint, filed on April 28, 1989, with a few exceptions, contained the same allegations as the original complaint. On October 13, 1989, again basing its decision on <em>Matek, </em>the district court entered an order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) in favor of Security Pacific, Gomez, and Graves, Allen dismissing with prejudice the federal securities causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-19\">On October 25,1989, plaintiffs moved for reconsideration arguing that our en banc decision in <em>Hocking v. Dubois, </em>885 F.2d 1449 (9th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1078, 110 S.Ct. 1805, 108 L.Ed.2d 936 (1990), effectively overruled the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Matek, </em>that <em>Hocking </em>now was the controlling applicable law in this Circuit, and under <em>Hocking </em>that plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>first amended complaint stated a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">At a December 1, 1989 hearing, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration and ruled that, even under the three-factor <em>Williamson </em>test that plaintiffs claimed was adopted in <em>Hocking, </em>their first amended complaint failed to plead facts supporting a finding that their partnership interests in Kentucky Thoroughbred Associates (\u201cKTA\u201d) were \u201csecurities\u201d as defined in the 1933 and 1934 Acts. On January 26, 1990 the district court entered an Order denying the motion for reconsideration. On the same date, the district court entered a final order dismissing with prejudice the First Amended Complaint as to Harnett and Losey &amp; Thompson. Appellants filed their notice of appeal on February 6, 1990. Lastly, on September 9, 1992, the district court entered a final judgment of dismissal in favor of Hagopian and the Affiliates. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">The district court had jurisdiction over these federal securities law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. We have jurisdiction over this appeal, which was timely filed as to the district court\u2019s January 26, 1990, order of dismissal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Although the initial appeal was premature as to Hagopian and the Associates, following the district court\u2019s September 6,1992, order of dismissal we have jurisdiction pursuant to section 1331, as \u201csubsequent events can validate a prematurely filed appeal.\u201d <em>Ethridge v. Hooker House Restaurant, </em>861 F.2d 1389, 1402 (9th Cir.1988) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-11\">A district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is a ruling on a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Kruso v. International Tel. &amp; Tel, </em>872 F.2d 1416, 1421 (9th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>496 U.S. 937, 110 S.Ct. 3217, 110 L.Ed.2d 664 (1990); <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Continental Nat\u2019l Am. Ins. Cos., </em>861 F.2d 1184, 1185 (9th Cir.1988). Our review is limited to the contents of the complaint, <em>Love v. United States, </em>915 F.2d 1242, 1245 (9th Cir.1989); however, material that properly is submitted as part of the complaint also may be considered. <em>Hal Roach Studios v. Richard Feiner &amp; Co., </em>896 F.2d 1542, 1555 n. 19 (9th Cir.1989) (citation omitted). We must presume all factual allegations of the complaint are true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Usher v. City of Los Angeles, </em>828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir.1987); <em>see Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1686, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-12\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-13\">In order to make out a claim under federal securities laws, as a threshold matter, investors must demonstrate that promoters\u2019 alleged misrepresentations or omissions were made in connection with the purchase or sale of a \u201csecurity.\u201d Section 2 of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(1)(1981), and section 3 of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(10)(1981), define the term \u201csecurity\u201d similarly and include within their definitions any \u201cinvestment contract.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-14\">Because \u201cgeneral partnership interests\u201d are not explicitly enumerated as \u201csecurities\u201d in these definitions, the question remains whether, nonetheless, they are included within that definition because they are \u201cinvestment contracts.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>SEC v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number><em>W.J. Howey Co., </em>328 U.S. 293, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946), the Supreme Court set out the three-part definition of an investment contract: \u201c[A]n investment contract for the purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person [1] invests his money in [2] a common enterprise and is led to [3] expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.\u201d <em>Howey, </em>328 U.S. at 298-99, 66 S.Ct. at 1102-03.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">In determining that the KTA partnership interests were not securities the district court relied on our holding in <em>Matek. </em>Appellants argue, as they did in their motion for reconsideration, that our subsequent en banc opinion in <em>Hocking </em>implicitly overruled <em>Matek, </em>and that the district court erred in evaluating whether appellants\u2019 general partnership interests were investment contracts under <em>Matek </em>rather than <em>Hocking.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-6\">We recently settled this question in <em>Koch v. Hankins, </em>928 F.2d 1471 (9th Cir.1991), in which we held that the <em>en banc </em>opinion in <em>Hocking </em>indeed replaces <em>Matek </em>as controlling in the Circuit. <em>Id. </em>at 1476-78. We therefore look to <em>Hocking </em>when evaluating appellants\u2019 complaint under the third part of the <em>Howey </em>definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-14\">In <em>Hocking </em>we adopted the three-prong test set out by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 404.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The heart of this inquiry is whether, although on the face of the partnership agreement the investor <em>theoretically </em>retains substantial control over the investment and an ability to protect the investment from the managing partner or hired manager, the investor nonetheless can demonstrate such dependence on the promoter or on a third party that the investor was <em>in fact </em>unable to exercise meaningful partnership powers. <em>Id. </em>at 424.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-15\">Under the first prong of the <em>Williamson </em>test our inquiry is limited to an examination of the legal powers afforded the investor by the partnership agreement and other formal documents that comprised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>the partnership agreement or arrangement. <em>Koch, </em>928 F.2d at 1478. The Partnership Agreement and the Employment Agreement between the KTA and Hagopian, which made Hagopian Administrative Coordinator of the partnership, are the primary documents that set out the legal responsibility and authority of the general partners to control KTA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">These documents afford appellants significant legal power and control over partnership matters.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A substantial number of partnership acts may be taken only after a majority vote of the partners to wit: all decisions respecting partnership business; the transfer, sale, or encumbrance of partnership interests; compensation of a partner for work on behalf of the partnership; and the empowerment and direction of one or more partners or an agent to negotiate and conclude sales of property. Furthermore, any amendment of the articles of partnership requires approval of sixty percent of the partners, while seventy-five percent of the partnership has the power to close the partnership once it has retained a certain amount of capital. Finally, partners retained reasonable access to the partnership books maintained at KTA\u2019s principal office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">Partners also retain substantial authority under the terms of Hagopian\u2019s employment contract. The contract itself limits Hagopi-an\u2019s functions to clerical and ministerial tasks, and his authority to enter into contracts or to make promises on behalf of the partnership is circumscribed by requiring KTA\u2019s express, written authority. Perhaps most importantly, the partnership retains the power to dismiss Hagopian at any time during his five-year contract for any or no reason.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1212-9\">Finally, the powers and duties of the general partners under the KTA partnership arrangement are in large part analogous to, or at least in substance coextensive with, those in the partnership arrangements at issue in <em>Koch, Hocking, </em>and <em>Ma-tek. </em>As a legal matter, they afford the investors responsibility and control over the partnership\u2019s horsebreeding and horse-racing operations. Thus, because the documents do not leave appellants with \u201cso little power as to place [them] in a position analogous to a limited partner,\u201d <em>Hocking, </em>885 F.2d at 1461, the first factor in <em>Williamson </em>weighs against our finding that appellants expected profits produced, in large measure, by the essential efforts of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-10\">Under the second part of <em>Williamson, </em>we inquire whether the partner is so inexperienced and unknowledgeable in business affairs as to be incapable of intelligently exercising his or her partnership powers. <em>Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 424. Appellants contend that they are dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>on Hagopian because they are inexperienced in horsebreeding and thoroughbred racing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">Appellants have misconstrued and improperly narrowed the relevant inquiry under this part of <em>Williamson. </em>The proper inquiry is whether the partners are inexperienced or unknowledgeable \u201cin business affairs\u201d generally, not whether they are experienced and sophisticated in the particular industry or area in which the partnership engages and they have invested. <em>Koch, </em>928 F.2d at 1479; <em>Deutsch Energy, </em>813 F.2d at 1570; <em>Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">Neither appellants' brief on appeal nor their first amended complaint contains allegations or facts showing that they lack general business experience or are unknow-ledgeable about business generally. In fact, the only evidence in the record regarding investors\u2019 general business experience and sophistication \u2014 the Subscription Agreement completed by each appellant as a condition to their investment in KTA \u2014 indicates that they considered themselves experienced in general business matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-7\">Appellants\u2019 second contention in support of their showing under part two, is that their partnership investments were \u201cpassive investments in horsebreeding operations located a considerable distance from their residences.\u201d Appellants obviously lifted this language directly from our opinion and discussion in <em>Hocking </em>of the second <em>Williamson </em>factor. <em>Hocking, </em>885 F.2d at 1461.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-8\">Although we are obliged to presume that all factual allegations in appellants\u2019 complaint are true, <em>Usher, </em>828 F.2d at 561, we do not \u201chave to accept every allegation in the complaint as true in considering its sufficiency; rather, ... [we] will examine whether conclusory allegations follow from the description of facts as alleged by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Brian Clewer, Inc. v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>674 F.Supp. 782, 785 (C.D.Cal.1986) (citing Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 1357 at 595-97); <em>accord Swanson v. Bixler, </em>750 F.2d 810, 813 (10th Cir.1984) (\u201cAll well-pleaded facts, as distinguished from conclusory allegations, must be taken as true.\u201d); <em>Benson v. Arizona State Bd. of Dental Examiners, </em>673 F.2d 272, 275-76 (9th Cir.1982) (court need not accept conclusory legal assertions); <em>McKinney v. DeBord, </em>507 F.2d 501, 503 (9th Cir.1974) (\u201cin construing a complaint most favorably for the plaintiff, a court need not give a plaintiff the benefit of every conceivable doubt; rather, a court is required only to draw every reasonable or warranted factual inference in the plaintiff\u2019s favor\u201d); <em>cf. Maisano v. United States, </em>908 F.2d 408, 410 (9th Cir.1990) (conclusory allegations insufficient to state claim for relief under I.R.C. \u00a7 7431); <em>Sherman v. Yakahi, </em>549 F.2d 1287, 1290 (9th Cir.1977) (\u201cConclusory allegations, unsupported by facts, [will be] rejected as insufficient to state a claim under the Civil Rights Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-11\">The above-noted statement in <em>Hocking </em>is the <em>conclusion </em>that we drew on the basis of facts pled by the investor in that case. In <em>Hocking, </em>we concluded that Hocking was a \u201cpassive\u201d investor because the facts pled in <em>his </em>complaint and evidence <em>he </em>presented in conjunction with a motion for summary judgment raised an issue regarding his status as an unsophisticated and inexperienced investor. Appellants in this case have pled no such facts and thus, have not made out a case under <em>Williamson </em>part two. Appellants cannot reasonably expect this court to hold that they have demonstrated the existence of a question of fact by merely mimicking our conclusion based upon the facts in another case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>Finally, under <em>Williamson </em>part three we examine whether the partners were \u201cso dependent on some unique entrepreneurial or management ability of the promoter or manager that ... [they] cannot replace the manager of the enterprise or otherwise exercise meaningful partnership ... powers.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 424. Appellants must show that they were dependent on some \u201cnon-replaceable expertise\u201d on the part of the promoter or manager; that \u201cthere is no reasonable replacement for the investments\u2019 manager.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423. Under this standard, appellants also have failed to raise an issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">Appellants argue that, because of the way the KTA partnership was managed, \u201cit was virtually impossible even for any one of the general partner [sic] to manage its interests separately or to replace the [sic] Hagopian as the Partnership manager.\u201d In fashioning this argument, they analogize between the circumstances of this case and those in <em>Hocking, </em>885 F.2d 1449.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">Our review of <em>Hocking </em>and <em>Koch v. Hankins, </em>928 F.2d 1471 (9th Cir.1991), a case in which under <em>Williamson </em>part three we found the investment arrangement analogous to that in <em>Hocking, </em>confirms that appellants\u2019 analogy fails for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">First, the mechanism available to KTA general partners for changing the management of the partnership is distinguishable from those in <em>Hocking </em>and <em>Koch. </em>The KTA partnership arrangement provides that, pursuant to his employment contract, Hagopian may be fired from his position as Administrative Coordinator at any time \u201cwith or without cause,\u201d upon thirty days notice. Moreover, in the event of his termination, that contract requires Hagopian to assist the general partners in finding an adequate replacement for him. Finally, the KTA Articles of Partnership provide that all decisions regarding partnership matters are to be made by a majority of the partners unless a greater percentage otherwise was required. Thus, compared with the stiffer seventy-five percent vote required for the owners to change management of the pooling arrangement in <em>Hocking </em>and the complete absence of any formal mechanism for making such a change in <em>Koch, </em>the KTA general partners have the power to fire and replace Hagopian with a simple majority vote. <em>Koch, </em>928 F.2d at 1480-81; <em>Hocking, </em>885 F.2d at 1453.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">Second, and more importantly, appellants fail to discern the fundamental structural difference between the investment arrangements in <em>Hocking </em>and <em>Koch </em>and that of the KTA partnership. Appellants argue that they are dependent on Hagopian\u2019s unique management ability because it is neither economically feasible for each general partner to hire an individual advisor to raise a single horse nor is it possible for the general partners, who lack the requisite expertise or equipment to raise the horses, to do so on their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-10\">This argument is grounded in the faulty assumption that firing Hagopian will result in the KTA general partners owning or renting the individual horses once under Hagopian\u2019s management. In <em>Hocking </em>and <em>Koch </em>when investors withdrew from the larger scheme or the current management arrangement changed, individual investors were left with an investment \u2014 a single condominium unit in a hotel-like resort or a general partnership in a small jojoba farm \u2014 which, absent the larger management scheme of the pooling arrangement or plantation, was incapable of producing the profit investors expected originally. <em>Koch, </em>928 F.2d at 1480; <em>Hocking, </em>885 F.2d at 1461.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-11\">The KTA general partnership, in contrast, is not a pooling arrangement for the management of horses owned by the individual investor general partners; the partnership itself owns or rents the horses. Thus, unlike in <em>Hocking </em>and <em>Koch, </em>change of KTA management \u2014 firing Hagopian as administrative coordinator \u2014 would not result, as appellants\u2019 argument necessarily requires, in the general partners each having responsibility for breeding a single horse. Rather, KTA would remain the owner or renter of the horses and the gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>eral partners would have the option of appointing a new administrative coordinator by a majority vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">Given these fundamental differences, appellants\u2019 reliance on the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Hocking </em>is illogical and misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">The question nonetheless remains whether appellants otherwise have pled facts to support our finding that there is no other reasonable replacement for Hagopian.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">Appellants argue that Hagopian is not replaceable because the general partners <em>themselves </em>do not have the necessary expertise or equipment to raise horses. Appellants\u2019 inquiry, however, is too narrow. Under this part of <em>Williamson, </em>investors must show that \u201cthere is <em>no </em>reasonable replacement\u201d for the manager. <em>Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 423. A showing that the general partners do not possess the skills or abilities required to fill the manager\u2019s shoes simply is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">In the first amended complaint appellants also make a number of broad statements indicating that, in investing in KTA, they were relying on Hagopian\u2019s and the Affiliates\u2019 expertise. While these statements perhaps establish that Hagopian possessed the required skill and knowledge to manage KTA and that the general partners themselves were not skilled to replace him, appellants nowhere assert that Hagopian is <em>uniquely </em>capable of managing KTA and that they are incapable, within reasonable limits, of finding <em>any </em>replacement for him. Vague statements like these are insufficient to raise a question regarding appellants\u2019 dependence on Hagopian\u2019s unique or irreplaceable expertise. <em>See Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-9\">Finally, appellants cite the facts that Ha-gopian prearranged leases of mares and stallion seasons by the general partnership (i.e. the Mare Lease Agreements) before they invested, that he was the sole manager of the partnership and made all of the decisions concerning raising the horses only consulting the general partners after the fact, and that they were denied access to information regarding the partnership as indications that they have met the third-part of the <em>Williamson </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-10\">These allegations, however, merely show that appellants chose to be passive and did not actively utilize the legal powers afforded them by the partnership arrangement and, again, that Hagopian was an able manager. Appellants\u2019 failure to participate in the partnership\u2019s decisions and to obtain information regarding its operations may prove that they sat on their rights as general partners but it does not support the conclusion that Hagopian is uniquely qualified to manage KTA within the meaning of <em>Williamson\u2019s </em>third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-11\">Because appellants have failed to plead allegations sufficient to establish that their general partnership interests in KTA are \u201csecurities\u201d entitled to protection under the 1933 and 1934 Acts, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1209-16\">. On May 8, 1990, pursuant to a stipulation under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b) entered into by appellants and appellee Security Pacific Bank, we entered an order dismissing Security Pacific from this appeal. On August 31, 1990 we entered an order dismissing the appeal against appellee Gery Gomez. On September 21, 1990 appellants Thomas Holden and Phillip Goodenough and appellees Thomas R. Harnett, Losey &amp; Thompson; and Graves, Allen, Cornelius &amp; Celestre (\"Graves, Allen\u201d) stipulated to a dismissal of the appeal with prejudice and we ordered dismissal of the appeal as between those parties.

We thus adopted a more \"realistic\" approach that examines whether \u201cthe efforts made by those other than the investor are undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure of success or the enterprise.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-9\">The Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits have since adopted our interpretation of <em>Howey's </em>third part. <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Elkins Co., </em>730 F.2d 99, 103 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 831, 105 S.Ct. 118, 83 L.Ed.2d 61 (1984); <em>Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 418; <em>Odom v.

The Supreme Court has noted, but not expressed its view on the <em>Turner </em>interpretation. <em>Forman, </em>421 U.S. at 852 n. 16, 95 S.Ct. at 2060 n. 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1211-11\">. In <em>Williamson </em>the court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1211-12\">A general partnership or joint venture interest can be designated a security if the investor can establish, for example, that (1) an agreement among the parties leaves so little power in the hands of the partner or venturer that the arrangement in fact distributes power as would a limited partnership; or (2) the partner or venturer is so inexperienced and un-knowledgeable in business affairs that he is incapable of intelligently exercising his partnership or venture powers; or (3) the partner or venturer is so dependent on some unique entrepreneurial or management ability of the promoter or manager that he cannot replace the manager of the enterprise or otherwise exercise meaningful partnership or venture powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1211-17\">645 F.2d at 424. These three factors are not exclusive and under different facts or legal arrangements other factors could also give rise to such a dependence on the promoter or manager. <em>Id. </em>at 424 n. 15; <em>Hocking, </em>885 F.2d at 1460.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1211-18\"><em>. </em>The focus under <em>Williamson </em>is on the investor\u2019s expectations <em>at the time of the original investment, </em>and \"is not directed at what actually transpires after the investment was made, i.e., whether the investor later decides to be passive or to delegate all powers and duties to a promoter or managing partner.\u201d <em>Koch, </em>928 F.2d at 1477; <em>Matek, </em>862 F.2d at 729; <em>Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 424 n. 14 (\u201cone would have to show that the reliance on the manager which forms the basis of the partner\u2019s expectations was an understanding in the original transaction, and not some subsequent decision to delegate partnership duties.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1212-6\">. We reject appellants\u2019 argument that the Mare Lease Agreements also are part of the partnership \"arrangement\" for the purpose of <em>Williamson </em>prong one. These agreements neither establish how the legal powers and duties in this partnership are divided nor do they alter the powers to control the partnership business that are afforded the general partners under the Articles of Partnership and Hagopian\u2019s employment contract. The fact that Hagopian entered into lease agreements prior to appellants\u2019 investments does not alter the partners\u2019 legal powers to affect the partnership\u2019s decisions under the partnership agreement. As such, and as admitted by appellants in their first amended complaint, the partners have the power to select investments and, thus, presumably could effect a change in the leases by a majority vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-7\">Ultimately, appellants' allegations regarding the Mare Lease .Agreements relate to the merit of their claim that Hagopian misrepresented and failed to disclose certain facts and therefore is premature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1212-11\">. In their first amended complaint appellants openly acknowledge this fact stating that \u201cthe partnership agreement ostensibly gave the Partners rights in the management of the Partnership, including the right to vote on Partnership business, select investments, retain a new administrative partner and to borrow funds____\u201d First Amended Complaint jf 39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1212-14\">. The fact that appellees previously promoted limited partnership horsebreeding and horserac-ing programs \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the KTA general partnership is irrelevant to this inquiry. Under <em>Williamson </em>prong one our concern and focus is on the terms of the general partnership arrangement in which <em>appellants invested </em>and on whether that arrangement afforded the partners legal control over the instant partnership, not on other partnerships formed or managed by the managers or promoters on prior occasions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1213-9\">. Even more fundamentally, recognition that investors\u2019 naked allegation that they were \u201cpassive\" as adequate to make out a case under <em>Williamson </em>prong two, risks shifting our inquiry under <em>Williamson </em>from its intended focus on the investors\u2019 expectations at the time of the investment, to their \u201cde facto post-investment conduct.\" <em>Koch, </em>928 F.2d at 1477 n. 9; <em>Matek, 862 </em>F.2d at 729 (acknowledging promoters\u2019 concerns that \u201can interest marketed as a general partnership might thus be transformed into a security simply because its holder is not diligent or knowledgeable in exercising his rights under the agreement\u201d); <em>Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 424 n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>14; <em>see C.M.
