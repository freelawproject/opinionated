They seek declaratory and injunctive relief and compensatory damages for violation of their First Amendment rights under the United States and Oregon Constitutions. The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343. We have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">On February 8, 1990, the school teachers in McMinnville, Oregon commenced a lawful strike. In response to the strike, the school district hired replacement teachers. Chandler and Depweg were students at McMinnville High School and their fathers were among the striking teachers. On February 9, 1990, Chandler and Depweg attended school wearing various buttons and stickers on their clothing. Two of the buttons displayed the slogans \u201cI\u2019m not listening scab\u201d and \u201cDo scabs bleed?\u201d Chandler and Depweg distributed similar buttons to some of their classmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">During a break in the morning classes, a temporary administrator saw Depweg aiming his camera in a hallway as if to take a photograph. The administrator asserted that Depweg had no right to take his photograph without permission and instructed Depweg to accompany him to the vice principal\u2019s office. Chandler witnessed the request and followed Depweg into the office, where they were met by vice principal Whitehead. Whitehead, upon noticing the buttons, asked both students to remove them because they were disruptive. Dep-weg told Whitehead that his morning classes had not been disrupted. A replacement teacher in one of Depweg\u2019s classes confirmed that there had been no disruption. Nonetheless, Whitehead ordered that the buttons be removed. Chandler and Depweg, in the belief that the buttons were protected as a lawful exercise of free speech, refused to comply. They also refused to be separated. Whitehead then suspended them for the remainder of the school day for willful disobedience.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Depweg and Chandler returned to school on February 13, 1990, the next regularly scheduled school day, with different buttons and stickers on their clothing. They each wore a button that read \u201cScabs\u201d with a line drawn through it (i.e., \u201cno Scabs\u201d), and a sticker that read \u201cScab we will never forget.\u201d In addition, they displayed buttons with the slogans \u201cStudents united for fair settlement,\u201d and \u201cWe want our real teachers back.\u201d Approximately 1:45 p.m., assistant vice principal Hyder asked Chandler to remove those buttons and stickers containing the word \u201cscab\u201d because they were disruptive. Chandler, anticipating further disciplinary action, complied with the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">Chandler and Depweg filed this action in district court, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the school officials\u2019 reasons for requesting the removal of the buttons were false and pretextual, and therefore violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of expression. They state that the buttons caused no classroom disruption. They further allege that many of their classmates wore the same buttons, but that none were asked to remove them. Chandler and Depweg charge that the school singled them out for punishment, in violation of their First Amendment rights to freedom of association, because they led the student protest against the school district\u2019s decision to hire replacement teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">The school district moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court granted the motion, stating that the slogans on the buttons were \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cinherently disruptive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">We review the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure de novo. <em>Arcade Water Dist. v. United States, </em>940 F.2d 1265, 1267 (9th Cir. 1991). \u201cOur review is based on the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tents of the complaint, the allegations of which we accept as true and construe in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hoesterey v. Cathedral City, </em>945 F.2d 317, 318 (9th Cir.1991) (Hoesterey), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 112 S.Ct. 1941, 118 L.Ed.2d 546 (1992). A court should not grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim unless \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">We start on agreed ground: students in public schools do not \u201cshed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\u201d <em>Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community School Dist., </em>393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 736, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969) <em>(Tinker). </em>\u201cThey cannot be punished merely for expressing their personal views on the school premises ... unless school authorities have reason to believe that such expression will \u2018substantially interfere with the work of the school or impinge upon the rights of other students.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, </em>484 U.S. 260, 266, 108 S.Ct. 562, 567, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988) <em>(Hazelwood), quoting Tinker, </em>393 U.S. at 509, 512-13, 89 S.Ct. at 738, 739-40. The schoolroom prepares children for citizenship, and the proper exercise of the First Amendment is a hallmark of citizenship in our country. Nevertheless, this educational experience has its limitations. The First Amendment rights of public school students \u201care not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.\u201d <em>Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, </em>478 U.S. 675, 682, 106 S.Ct. 3159, 3163-64, 92 L.Ed.2d 549 (1986) (Fraser). Student preparation for adult experiences does not necessarily ensure adult experiences on the school campus. For example, schools need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with the school\u2019s \u201cbasic educational mission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685, 106 S.Ct. at 3165; <em>Hazelwood, </em>484 U.S. at 266, 108 S.Ct. at 567. Despite the fact that the suppression <em>of </em>speech has obvious First Amendment implications, courts are not necessarily in the best position to decide whether speech restrictions are appropriate. \u201cThe determination of what manner of speech in the classroom or in school assembly is inappropriate properly rests with the school board,\u201d and not with the federal courts. <em>See Fraser, </em>478 U.S. at 683, 685, 106 S.Ct. at 3164, 3165; <em>Hazelwood, </em>484 U.S. at 267, 108 S.Ct. at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Chandler and Depweg argue that the district court applied an incorrect standard when it dismissed the complaint as a matter of law. They contend that this case is governed by <em>Tinker. </em>In <em>Tinker, </em>junior high school students were suspended for wearing black armbands in protest of the Vietnam war. The Court held that display of the armbands was a \u201csilent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance\u201d and that there was \u201cno evidence whatever of [] interference, actual or nascent, with the schools\u2019 work or of collision with the rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone.\u201d <em>Tinker, </em>393 U.S. at 508, 89 S.Ct. at 737. The Court explained that \u201cwhere there is no finding and no showing that engaging in the forbidden conduct would materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school, the prohibition cannot be sustained.\u201d' <em>Id. </em>at 509, 89 S.Ct. at 738 (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">In this case, the district court dismissed the action although there was no allegation of disruption or interference with the rights of other students, relying primarily on <em>Fraser. Fraser </em>involved a speech given by a student at a high school assembly. The speech contained sexual innuendo and metaphor. <em>Fraser, </em>478 U.S. at 683, 106 S.Ct. at 3164. The Court held that the school district</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">acted entirely within its permissible authority in imposing sanctions upon Fraser in response to his offensively lewd and indecent speech. Unlike the sanctions imposed on the students ... in <em>Tinker, </em>the penalties imposed in this case were unrelated to any political viewpoint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The- First Amendment does not prevent the school officials from determining that to permit a vulgar and lewd speech such as [Fraser\u2019s] would undermine the school\u2019s basic educational mission____ Accordingly, it was perfectly appropriate for the school to disassociate itself to make the point to the pupils that vulgar speech and lewd conduct is wholly inconsistent with the \u201cfundamental values\u201d of public school education.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 685-86, 106 S.Ct. at 3165-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The district court also relied upon <em>Fraser </em>\u2019s distinction of <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971). In <em>Cohen, </em>the Court held that a man could not be criminally prosecuted for wearing a jacket bearing an obscene statement disapproving the draft. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 91 S.Ct. at 1788. The Court pointed out that students have \u201cthe classroom right to wear Tinker\u2019s armband, but not Cohen\u2019s jacket.\u201d <em>Fraser, </em>478 U.S. at 682, 106 S.Ct. at 3164 (internal quotations and citation omitted). The district court ruled that the buttons in this case were akin to Cohen's jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Chandler and Depweg argue that <em>Fraser </em>is distinguishable from this case on three grounds. First, they contend that the buttons constituted a \u201csilent, passive expression of opinion\u201d \u201cakin to \u2018pure speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tinker, </em>393 U.S. at 508, 89 S.Ct. at 737. They contrast the silent expression of the buttons with the sexually implicit speech in <em>Fraser. </em>Next, the students focus on the fact that the speech in <em>Fraser </em>was made at a school assembly, a sanctioned school event, whereas their display of the buttons was a passive expression of personal opinion. They cite language in <em>Hazelwood </em>that distinguishes between suppression of \u201ca student\u2019s personal expression that happens to occur on the school premises,\u201d and \u201ceducators\u2019 authority over school-sponsored [activities] that students, parents, and members of the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school.\u201d <em>Hazelwood, </em>484 U.S. at 271, 108 S.Ct. at 570. Finally, Chandler and Depweg argue that because their buttons expressed a political viewpoint they are therefore accorded greater protection. They point out that the Court in <em>Fraser </em>distinguished between the lewd speech in <em>Fraser </em>and the political speech in <em>Tinker, </em>thereby implying that restrictions on political speech should be governed by the more exacting <em>Tinker </em>test. <em>Fraser, </em>478 U.S. at 685, 106 S.Ct. at 3165.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">We turn to <em>Hazelwood </em>for guidance in interpreting the meaning and scope of the earlier <em>Tinker </em>and <em>Fraser </em>cases. <em>Hazel-wood </em>involved a dispute over the deletion of two pages of an issue of a school newspaper. The principal deleted the pages because they contained an article addressing students\u2019 experiences with pregnancy, and another article describing the impact of divorce on students at the school. The newspaper was written and edited by students in a journalism class as part of the school\u2019s curriculum. <em>Hazelwood, </em>484 U.S. at 262-64, 108 S.Ct. at 565-66. The Court declined to apply <em>Tinker, </em>holding instead that \u201cthe standard articulated in <em>Tinker </em>for determining when a school may punish student expression need not also be the standard for determining when a school may refuse to lend its name and resources to the dissemination of student expression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272-73, 108 S.Ct. at 571. The Court then validated discretionary editorial control by school officials over the school-sponsored newspaper \u201cso long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 108 S.Ct. at 571; see <em>also Planned Parenthood of Southern Nevada v. Clark County School Disk, </em>941 F.2d 817, 828 (9th Cir. 1991) (en banc) (\u201cfirst amendment affords educators \u2018greater control\u2019 in deciding when the school will affirmatively \u2018promote\u2019 or \u2018lend its name and resources\u2019 to particular speech\u201d), <em>citing Hazelwood, </em>484 U.S. at 271-72, 108 S.Ct. at 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Although <em>Hazelwood </em>is not directly on point, it is instructive because it interpreted <em>Tinker </em>and <em>Fraser </em>together. The Court pointed out that there is a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXO\">difference between the First Amendment analysis applied in <em>Tinker </em>and that applied in Fraser____ The decision in <em>Fraser </em>rested on the \u201cvulgar,\u201d \u201clewd,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u201cplainly offensive\u201d character of a speech delivered at an official school assembly rather than on any propensity of the speech to \u201cmaterially disrup[t] classwork. or involv[e] substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"abt-dedup-1\"><em>Hazelwood, </em>484 U.S. at 271 n. 4, 108 S.Ct. at 570 n. 4, <em>quoting Tinker, </em>393 U.S. at 513, 89 S.Ct. at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We have discerned three distinct areas of student speech from the Supreme Court\u2019s school precedents: (1) vulgar, lewd, obscene, and plainly offensive speech, (2) school-sponsored speech, and (3) speech that falls into neither of these categories. We conclude, as discussed below, that the standard for reviewing the suppression of vulgar, lewd, obscene, and plainly offensive speech is governed by <em>Fraser, </em>478 U.S. at 683-85, 106 S.Ct. at 3164-65, school-sponsored speech by <em>Hazelwood, </em>484 U.S. at 273, 108 S.Ct. at 571, and all other speech by <em>Tinker, </em>393 U.S. at 513-14, 89 S.Ct. at 740-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We first address the question of whether school officials may suppress vulgar, lewd, obscene, and plainly offensive speech, even when it is expressed outside the context of an official school program or event. <em>Hazelwood </em>focused on two factors that distinguish <em>Fraser </em>from <em>Tinker: </em>(1) the speech was \u201c \u2018vulgar,\u2019 \u2018lewd,\u2019 and \u2018plainly offensive,\u2019 \u201d and (2) it was given at an official school assembly. <em>Hazelwood, </em>484 U.S. at 271 n. 4, 108 S.Ct. at 570 n. 4. Whereas both of these factors were present in <em>Fraser, </em>we believe the deferential <em>Fraser </em>standard applies when the first factor alone is present. \u201cSurely it is a highly appropriate function of a public school education to prohibit the use of vulgar and offensive terms in public discourse \u2014 \u201d <em>Fraser, </em>478 U.S. at 683, 106 S.Ct. at 3164. \u201cA school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its \u2018basic educational mission,\u2019 even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school.\u201d <em>Hazelwood, </em>484 U.S. at 266, 108 S.Ct. at 567, <em>quoting Fraser, </em>478 U.S. at 685, 106 S.Ct. at 3165. Therefore, school officials may suppress speech that is vulgar, lewd, obscene, or plainly offensive without a showing that such speech occurred during a school-sponsored event or threatened to \u201csubstantially interfere with [the school\u2019s] work.\u201d <em>Tinker, </em>393 U.S. at 509, 89 S.Ct. at 738. Such language, by definition, may well \u201cimpingef ] upon the rights of other students,\u201d id., and therefore its suppression is \"reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\u201d <em>Hazelwood, </em>484 U.S. at 272-73, 108 S.Ct. at 570-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We turn next to the second category involving speech or speech-related activities that \u201cstudents, parents, and members of the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school.\u201d In such cases, school officials are entitled to \u201cgreater control\u201d over student expression. <em>Id. </em>at 271, 108 S.Ct. at 570. A school has the discretion to \u201cdisassociate itself\u201d from an entire range of speech, including \u201cspeech that is, for example, ungrammatical, poorly written, inadequately researched, biased or prejudiced, vulgar or profane, or unsuitable for immature audiences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). According to <em>Hazelwood, </em>federal courts are to defer to a school\u2019s decision to suppress or punish vulgar, lewd, or plainly offensive speech, and to \u201cdisassociate itself\u201d from speech that a reasonable person would view as bearing the imprimatur of the school, when the decision is \u201creasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 273, 108 S.Ct. at 570, 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The third category involves speech that is neither vulgar, lewd', obscene, or plainly offensive, nor bears the imprimatur of the school. To suppress speech in this category, school officials must justify their decision by showing \u201cfacts which might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities.\u201d <em>Tinker, </em>393 U.S. at 514, 89 S.Ct. at 740. However, the \u201cFirst Amendment does not require school officials to wait until disruption actually occurs____ In fact, they have a duty to prevent the occurrence of disturbances.\u201d <em>Karp v. Becken, </em>477 F.2d 171, 175 (9th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">We now turn to the facts alleged in this case. No effort was made by the school officials to suppress the buttons containing the statements \u201cStudents united for fair settlement\u201d or \u201cWe want our real teachers back.\u201d Rather, the suppression only involved statements containing the word \u201cscab.\u201d The word \u201cscab,\u201d in the context most applicable to this case, is defined as \u201ca worker who accepts employment or replaces a union worker during a strike.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 2022 (unabridged ed.) (1986). Although a dictionary definition may not be determinative in all cases, it is helpful here. \u201cTo be sure, the word is most often used as an insult or epithet.\u201d <em>Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers v. Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 283, 94 S.Ct. 2770, 2780-81, 41 L.Ed.2d 745 (1974). However, the word is also \u201ccommon parlance in labor disputes and has specifically been held to be entitled to the protection of \u00a7 7 of the NLRA.\u201d <em>Id., citing Linn v. Union Plant Guard Workers, </em>383 U.S. 53, 60-61, 86 S.Ct. 657, 661-62, 15 L.Ed.2d 582 (1966). Given the requirement to construe the complaint in a light most favorable to Chandler and Depweg, we are satisfied that these buttons cannot be considered per se vulgar, lewd, obscene, or plainly offensive within the meaning of <em>Fraser. </em>At this stage in the litigation, the school officials have made no showing that the word \u201cscab\u201d reasonably could be so considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">This brings us to the second category of school speech. There is nothing in the complaint alleging that Chandler and Depweg\u2019s buttons reasonably could have been viewed as bearing the imprimatur of the school. The buttons expressed the personal opinion of the students wearing them, and they were displayed in a manner commonly used to convey silently an idea, message, or political opinion to the community. <em>See Burnside v. Byars, </em>363 F.2d 744, 747 (5th Cir.1966) (Burnside). In addition, they expressed a position on a local political issue that was diametrically opposed to the school district\u2019s decision to hire replacement teachers. Therefore, the complaint does not show that a reasonable person could have viewed the buttons as bearing the imprimatur of the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">We turn, therefore, to the third category of school speech and its standard: whether the \u201cscab\u201d buttons were properly suppressed because the school officials reasonably forecasted that they would substantially disrupt, or materially interfere with, school activities. <em>Tinker, </em>393 U.S. at 514, 89 S.Ct. at 740. The district court held that the \u201cscab\u201d buttons were inherently disruptive, but nothing in the complaint or the analysis of the district court substantiates this conclusion. We conclude that the district court erred in holding, without more, that the \u201cscab\u201d buttons were inherently disruptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">We express no opinion on the question whether, on remand, the school district may be able to meet the reasonable forecast test. We deal with a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of a complaint, which may be granted only if Chandler and Depweg could prove no facts to support their claim. That is not the case here because we hold that the \u201cscab\u201d buttons were not inherently disruptive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although some of the slogans employed by Chandler and Depweg could be interpreted as insulting, disrespectful or even threatening, we must consider the facts in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>students in reviewing the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. <em>Hoesterey, </em>945 F.2d at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In a case such as this one, where arguably political speech is directed against the very individuals who seek to suppress that speech, school officials do not have limitless discretion. \u201cCourts have a First Amendment responsibility to insure that robust rhetoric ... is not suppressed by prudish failures to distinguish the vigorous from the vulgar.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Board of Educ., Granville Cent. School Dist., </em>607 F.2d 1043, 1057 (2d Cir.1979) (Newman, J. concurring), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1081, 100 S.Ct. 1034, 62 L,Ed.2d 765 (1980). Subsequent proof may show that the word \u201cscab\u201d can reasonably be viewed as insulting, and may show that the slogans were directed at the replacement teachers. Such evidence would bear upon the issue of whether the buttons might reasonably have led school officials to forecast substantial disruption to school activities. Mere use of the word \u201cscab,\u201d however, does not establish as a matter of law that the buttons could be suppressed absent the showing set forth above. Perhaps, after trial or summary judgment, the record might support the school officials\u2019 actions. On the basis of the naked complaint, however, this support is absent. The passive expression of a viewpoint in the form of a button worn on one's clothing \u201cis certainly not in the class of those activities which inherently distract students and break down the regimentation of the classroom.\u201d <em>Burnside, </em>363 F.2d at 748. The district court erred in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The school district offers a second rationale, based on Oregon law, in support of the dismissal of the complaint. The school district orally raised this issue before the district court. However, the district court did not pass upon this question, and neither will we. <em>See Greater Los Angeles Council on Deafness v. Zolin, </em>812 F.2d 1103, 1107 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The school district also contends that Chandler and Depweg should have challenged the constitutionality of the Oregon statute as an overbroad exercise of legislative authority, citing <em>Board of Airport Comm\u2019rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., </em>482 U.S. 569, 107 S.Ct. 2568, 96 L.Ed.2d 500 (1987). That case, however, does not require a litigant to challenge facially a statute in order to argue that it was unconstitutionally applied in a particular case. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">Chandler and Depweg contend that the complaint also states a claim for violation of their First Amendment rights to freedom of assembly and association. The district court never addressed this claim, apparently deciding that it did not survive dismissal of the freedom of speech claim. They contend that the school officials suspended them in order to preclude them from associating with other students and disseminating their views on the strike. The district court should consider this claim on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">Chandler and Depweg argue that the district court should have asserted pendent jurisdiction over their claim for violation of their civil rights protected by the Oregon Constitution. Assumption of pendent jurisdiction is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Cook, Perkiss &amp; Liehe, Inc. v. Northern Cal. Collection Serv., </em>911 F.2d 242, 247 (9th Cir.1990). The district court should consider assertion of pendent jurisdiction over Chandler and Depweg\u2019s state constitutional claims after further evaluating their federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\">. The concurrence suggests that we lend credence to the notion that there exists a class of \u201cinherently disruptive\u201d words. On the contrary, we merely respond to the district court\u2019s holding that the \"scab\u201d buttons were inherently disruptive. The district court stated in its order dismissing Chandler and Depweg's second amended complaint that: \"Plaintiffs\u2019 buttons were inherently disruptive.\u201d Order dated Nov. 9, 1990, at 3-4. Chandler and Depweg are appealing from the dismissal of their second amended complaint; the order dismissing that complaint thus forms the basis of this appeal. As such, we address it, and we conclude that the district court erred in holding that the \u201cscab\u201d buttons were inherently disruptive. We cannot simply ignore the district court\u2019s holding. To do so would be to ignore the district court\u2019s rationale for ruling the way it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Thus, contrary to the concurrence's stated fear, we are not suggesting that \u201cthere exists a subclass of words that are inherently disruptive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b623-15\">GOODWIN, Circuit Judge, concurring:</author>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">While I concur in the result, I am unable to join the majority\u2019s opinion. I write separately to express my belief that the majority discusses matters unnecessary to decide the case. The majority opinion erodes important First Amendment protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">There is no dispute that the district court erred in granting defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>motion. Chandler and Depweg have stated a claim for which relief may be granted. To reach this decision, however, we did not have to reach out and create a comprehensive three-part categorical scheme for deciding all student speech cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Unfortunately, the majority oversimplifies the case law and too readily disregards important factual distinctions. I am most troubled by the majority\u2019s conclusion that the deferential <em>Fraser </em>standard applies to all \u201cvulgar, lewd, obscene, and plainly offensive speech,\u201d even if such expression occurs outside the context of an official school program or event.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The majority may have lost sight of the facts in <em>Fraser. </em>There, the Court held that a student delivering a vulgar, lewd and plainly offensive speech <em>at an official school assembly </em>could be punished by school authorities without violating his First Amendment rights. <em>See Fraser, </em>478 U.S. at 683, 106 S.Ct. at 3164. Yet here, the majority concludes that the fact that the speech in <em>Fraser </em>was delivered at a school-sponsored event was not central to the Court\u2019s holding, and that school administrators have wide discretion in suppressing speech that they generally consider</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">\u201cvulgar, lewd, obscene, and plainly offensive,\u201d regardless of the context. I am not prepared to join in this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">The <em>Fraser </em>Court was influenced, in part, by the captive nature of the audience. <em>Id. </em>at 677, 106 S.Ct. at 3161 (student attendance at the assembly was mandatory); <em>see also </em>L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 12-10, at 852 n. 14 (2d ed. 1988) (noting that the Court \u201cemployed'a modified version of the captive audience theory\u201d in <em>Fraser). </em>In addition, the school\u2019s interest in inculcating proper speech manners is surely higher in the context of a public speech in front of a crowded assembly than in the context of a private hallway conversation. Justice Brennan noted that Fraser\u2019s speech \u201cmay well have been protected had he given it in school but under different circumstances, where the school\u2019s legitimate interests in teaching and maintaining civil public discourse were less weighty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 106 S.Ct. at 3167 (Brennan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Because the majority in this case concedes that the speech at issue is not within the parameters of either <em>Fraser </em>or <em>Hazel-wood </em>but is instead governed by <em>Tinker,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>was entirely unnecessary to address the issue; the majority's dicta amounts to nothing more than a preview, or worse, an advisory opinion. Therefore, I do not join in that part of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The majority also gives credence to a mischievous notion that there exists a subclass of words that are \u201cinherently disruptive.\u201d Rather than merely disagreeing with the district court\u2019s finding that the scab buttons were \u201cinherently disruptive,\u201d as the majority does, I would rather have this Court clarify that there is no authoritative doctrinal support for the existence of such a category. I believe it is unwise to invite would-be censors to imagine that there may exist a category of \u201cinherently disruptive\u201d words. The invention of such a category would invite future courts and litigants to circumvent the <em>Tinker </em>analysis. Moreover, I doubt that it would be either workable or desirable for judges to construct a list of words that one cannot say in school.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">On remand, the district court should not read the majority opinion as an invitation to disregard clear Supreme Court precedent. Rather, the court should apply the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Tinker </em>analysis, which provides that students cannot be punished for merely expressing their views on campus unless school authorities could reasonably forecast that such expression will cause \u201csubstantial disruption of or material interference with school activities.\u201d 393 U.S. at 514, 89 S.Ct. at 740.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\">. If lower courts need categorical guidance in determining how to approach student speech cases, they should look to the one implicitly provided by Justice White in <em>Hazelwood </em>rather than the one established by the majority here.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Justice White distinguished between (I) \u201ca student\u2019s personal expression that happens to occur on the school premises,\u201d and (2) \"educators\u2019 authority over school-sponsored [activities] that students, parents, and members of the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school.\u201d 484 U.S. at 270-71, 108 S.Ct. at 569-70. In the first category, the more rigorous judicial scrutiny of <em>Tinker </em>is applied. Generally, school authorities must show that they could reasonably forecast that the student\u2019s expression would cause substantial disruption or would materially interfere with school activities in order to punish such expression without interfering with the student\u2019s First Amendment rights. In the second category, judicial scrutiny of the actions of school authorities is far more deferential since the school must be able to set \u201dhigh[er] standards for the student speech that is disseminated under its auspices.\" <em>Hazelwood, </em>484 U.S. at 271-72, 108 S.Ct. at 570. For cases falling within this second category, school authorities may limit student speech \"so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 108 S.Ct. at 571.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-12\">. Actually, the majority only concedes that <em>Fraser </em>does not apply \u201d[a]t this stage in the litigation,\u201d suggesting that further development of the record may reveal that the term \"scab,\u201d as used here, was either \"vulgar,\u201d \"lewd,\" \"obscene,\u201d or \"plainly offensive\" within the meaning of <em>Fraser. </em>I cannot conceive how these facts could ever be equated with those in <em>Fraser.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">First, this case clearly involves political speech, and Chief Justice Burger expressly relied on the \"marked distinction between the political \u2018message\u2019 of the armbands in Tinker and the sexual content of Fraser's speech\u201d in fashioning the Court\u2019s more deferential approach in <em>Fraser. </em>478 U.S. at 680, 106 S.Ct. at 3162-63. Second, I object to the majority\u2019s implicit suggestion that speech need only be either \"vulgar,\u201d \"lewd,\u201d \"obscene,\u201d <em>or </em>\"plainly offensive\" in order to trigger their more deferential analysis. <em>See </em>Opinion at 530. Again the majority misreads <em>Fraser. </em>We must be careful not to stray from the facts of that case, lest we entirely circumvent the Court's clearly established <em>Tinker </em>analysis. Certainly the majority does not suggest that student political discourse which some school administrator might consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\"plainly offensive\u201d is entitled to only minimal First Amendment protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
