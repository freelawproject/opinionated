We find that the district court correctly decided all issues with the exception of the award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Accordingly, we affirm on all issues except the award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In 1980, OTR entered into an arrangement with TG &amp; Y whereby TG &amp; Y would acquire store sites, arrange construction of stores, and then sell the stores to OTR for the cost of acquiring and building the facilities. OTR would then lease the stores back to TG &amp; Y. Each lease provided that the tenant was responsible for paying all property expenses and stated that the lease generally would not terminate regardless of the condition of the premises. TG &amp; Y could assign the lease without notice to OTR. One of the stores covered by this arrangement was located in Greenwood, South Carolina. TG &amp; Y arranged for Nal-ley Construction Company (\u201cNalley\u201d) and its sister company, Easley Lumber Company (\u201cEasley\u201d), to build the store. After OTR leased this store to TG &amp; Y, Nalley enlarged the shopping center and added stores adjoining the eastern wall (\u201ceast wall\u201d or \u201cparty wall\u201d) of OTR\u2019s store. Nalley and OTR entered a Party Wall Agreement in 1982 which defined each party\u2019s ownership rights and future obligations concerning the east wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In 1986 TG &amp; Y closed the Greenwood store and assigned all rights and obligations under the lease to Brendle\u2019s. In addition to the lease, assignment, Brendle\u2019s and TG &amp; Y entered into a Consideration Agreement under which Brendle\u2019s agreed to make yearly payments to TG &amp; Y above the rent payments due to OTR.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Although no one had previously observed any problems with the east wall, in December 1988 employees of Brendle\u2019s noticed that pieces of cinder block were falling from the top of the wall. Brendle\u2019s immediately notified OTR verbally and in writing. An engineer retained by Brendle\u2019s found evidence of joist bearing failure and crumbling cinder blocks along the top of the wall at points where the roof joists were supported. Then on December 23, 1988, Brendle\u2019s notified OTR that unless OTR repaired the wall, it would vacate the store on January 10, 1989. Nalley began repair work on January 10, 1989, which it completed on January 16, 1989. However, Brendle\u2019s had vacated the premises on January 10, 1989. Brendle\u2019s stopped making rental payments after January 1989 and had stopped making the supplementary payments to TG &amp; Y under the Consideration Agreement in 1988;</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">On January 31, 1989, Brendle\u2019s sued OTR and TG &amp; Y to recover damages allegedly incurred due to the structurally defective wall. TG &amp; Y and OTR counterclaimed against Brendle\u2019s and filed third party complaints against Nalley and Eas-ley. In addition, OTR cross claimed against TG &amp; Y.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brendle\u2019s then brought third party claims against Nalley and Eas-ley. OTR, TG &amp; Y, Nalley, and Easley all moved for summary judgment on the claims Brendle\u2019s asserted against them. The district court granted the motions and then held a jury trial to determine the amounts Brendle's owed to OTR and TG <em>&amp; </em>Y under the lease and Consideration Agreement. The court directed verdicts for both defendants, awarding OTR $272,497.13 and TG &amp; Y $106,530.00. Pursuant to post-trial motions filed by OTR and TG <em>&amp; </em>Y, the district court awarded OTR and TG &amp; Y prejudgment interest and costs and awarded OTR attorneys\u2019 fees. Following its unsuccessful motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, Brendle\u2019s timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">A. <em>OTR\u2019s Lease Obligations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">In the district court, Brendle\u2019s alleged that OTR breached the lease by failing to repair the east wall. On appeal, Brendle\u2019s asserts that the district court erroneously found, that Brendle\u2019s was responsible for repairing the east wall. The central finding made by the district court, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>was that OTR was under no express or implied obligation to repair the wall. Whether Brendle\u2019s had a duty to repair the wall is irrelevant to the issue of OTR\u2019s lease obligations. If OTR had no contractual duty to repair the wall, then Brendle\u2019s has no claim, against OTR for breach of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">As TG &amp; Y\u2019s assignee under the lease between OTR and TG &amp; Y, Brendle\u2019s acquired only those rights and obligations afforded to TG &amp; Y under the lease. <em>See W.M. Kirkland, Inc. v. Providence Washington Ins. Co., </em>264 S.C. 573, 216 S.E.2d 518, 521 (1975) (assignee has no higher rights than assignor and subrogee has no higher rights than subrogor). There are no express provisions in the lease obligating the lessor to repair the property. The only provisions concerning repairs address the lessee\u2019s obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Absent an express agreement, a landlord in South Carolina has no obligation to maintain commercial leased property in good repair because South Carolina law does not recognize an implied warranty of fitness or habitability in a commercial lease. <em>Edwards, Inc. v. Arlen Realty &amp; Dev. Cory., </em>466 F.Supp. 505, 509 (D.S.C. 1978). As the district court noted, the original lessee, TG &amp; Y, actually handled the construction of the store and then conveyed it to OTR with a warranty that the building was built \u201cin a good workmanlike manner and such improvements meet all existing applicable codes and ordinances.\u201d Thus, no warranties from the landlord concerning the fitness of the building could be implied in this situation because the landlord would be guaranteeing the building\u2019s fitness to the party responsible for constructing the building or that party\u2019s assignee. Because OTR neither expressly nor implicitly agreed to maintain and repair the Greenwood store, it owed no such duty to Brendle's, and the district court properly granted OTR\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">B. <em>Effect of the Party Wall Agreement on the Lease</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Brendle's complaint alleged that the Party Wall Agreement contained express warranties for the benefit of the building occupant and that OTR and Nalley breached those warranties due to the structural defects in the east wall. It also claimed that the Party Wall Agreement amended the lease, releasing the tenant or the tenant\u2019s assignee from any obligations to maintain or repair the wall. Finally, Brendle\u2019s argued that by executing the Party Wall Agreement, OTR was retaining control over the east wall and was obligated to maintain and repair it. The district court rejected all these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">On appeal, Brendle\u2019s claims that there is an issue of fact precluding summary judgment because neither TG &amp; Y nor Brendle\u2019s was a party to the Party Wall Agreement. Therefore, Brendle\u2019s argues, the Agreement is in \u201cderogation\u201d of the lease between OTR and TG &amp; Y and may have released the tenant from responsibility for maintaining the east wall. The fact that TG &amp; Y and Brendle\u2019s did not sign the Party Wall Agreement does not mean that the Agreement was in \u201cderogation\u201d of the lease. \u201cDerogation\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he partial repeal or abolishing of a law, as by a subsequent act which limits its scope or impairs its utility and force.\u201d Blacks Law Dictionary 444 (6th ed. 1990). The Party Wall Agreement did not partially repeal or abolish the lease. Under paragraph two of the lease, the landlord gave the tenant exclusive control over the Greenwood store. When Nalley expanded the shopping center and converted the east wall into a party wall, TG &amp; Y not only did not object, but actually drafted the Party Wall Agreement for OTR and Nalley. Thus, TG &amp; Y waived its right to exclusive possession of the east wall. Because Brendle\u2019s received only those rights to which TG &amp; Y was entitled when the lease was assigned, Brendle\u2019s never had the right to exclusive possession of the east wall. However, the fact that Brendle\u2019s did not have exclusive possession of the wall did not affect its obligation to maintain the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Through the Party Wall Agreement, OTR and Nalley, the wall\u2019s owners, divided between themselves the responsibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>maintaining and repairing the wall. The Agreement did not reduce the lessee\u2019s obligations to OTR. Prior to the Party Wall Agreement, OTR could look to its lessee for maintenance of the east wall. After the Party Wall Agreement was executed, OTR still could look to its lessee for repair and maintenance, but also could require Nalley to contribute to repair and maintenance. Nalley\u2019s promise to OTR did not reduce Brendle\u2019s obligation because Bren-dle's was not a party to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">C. <em>Constructive Eviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Brendle\u2019s contends that OTR\u2019s failure to repair the east wall resulted in Brendle\u2019s constructive eviction from the Greenwood store. Two elements are necessary to establish a cause of action for constructive eviction: (1) the tenant must be deprived of possession by the landlord\u2019s intentional act or omission or that act or omission must interfere substantially with the tenant\u2019s use or enjoyment of the leased property; and (2) the tenant must abandon the premises as a result of the landlord\u2019s act or omission. <em>Pleasantburg Warehouse Co. v. Global Distrib., Inc., </em>287 S.C. 422, 339 S.E.2d 135, 136 (Ct.App.1985) (citing <em>Thomas v. Hancock, </em>271 S.C. 273, 246 S.E.2d 604 (1978)). As discussed above, OTR owed no duty to Brendle\u2019s to repair the east wall. Therefore there was no act or omission by OTR which deprived Brendle\u2019s of possession of the Greenwood store or substantially interfered with Brendle\u2019s use or enjoyment of the store. Brendle\u2019s abandonment of the premises was not caused by any act or omission by OTR. Because Brendle\u2019s failed to establish the necessary elements for a constructive eviction, the district court properly granted OTR summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">D. <em>Alleged Breach of Assignment Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Paragraph four of the Assignment Agreement between TG &amp; Y and Brendle\u2019s provides that TG &amp; Y \u201chas performed all of [its] obligations\u201d under the lease between OTR and TG &amp; Y and would continue to perform those duties until the lease was assigned to Brendle\u2019s. Brendle\u2019s claims that it is entitled to indemnity from TG &amp; Y for the wall repair payments it owes to OTR because the structural defects in the east wall existed before TG &amp; Y assigned the lease to Brendle\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Under paragraph nine of the lease, the tenant was obligated to repair or rebuild the leased building \u201c[i]f during the Lease term the demised premises shall be damaged or destroyed by fire, or by any other cause whatsoever.\u201d Even if the problems with the east wall were attributable to defective construction or design, the actual wall damage did not occur until December 1988. TG &amp; Y had assigned the lease to Brendle\u2019s in 1986. Thus, the wall became damaged within the lease term after TG &amp; Y had assigned all of its rights and responsibilities under the lease to Brendle\u2019s, and TG &amp; Y had no obligation to indemnify Brendle\u2019s for any repair costs Brendle\u2019s owed to OTR.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">E. <em>Brendle\u2019s Breach of Consideration Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">Under the Consideration Agreement between Brendle\u2019s and TG &amp; Y, Brendle\u2019s agreed to make yearly payments to TG &amp; Y (above the rental payments owed to OTR) until 2022. Brendle\u2019s was obligated to continue these payments unless the \u201cLease terminate[d] for any reason other than as a result of Brendle\u2019s default.\u201d After 1988, Brendle\u2019s stopped making the annual payments to TG &amp; Y. Because it concluded that the failure of the east wall did not relieve Brendle\u2019s of its obligations under the lease, the district court held that Bren-dle\u2019s was in default of payments owed to TG &amp; Y under the Consideration Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">Claiming that there is an issue of fact concerning whether the lease was terminated for a reason other than Brendle\u2019s default, Brendle\u2019s contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment. \u25a0 This argument is without merit. Paragraph five of the lease states that the tenant has no \u201cright to terminate this lease or be entitled to the abatement of any rent or any reduction thereof, nor shall the obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>gations hereunder of Tenant be otherwise affected, by reason of any damage to or destruction of all or any part of the demised premises from whatever cause.\u201d Thus, Brendle\u2019s was not excused from its lease obligations due to the failure of the east wall. Because Brendle\u2019s was not released from its lease commitments, it was obligated to continue payments to TG &amp; Y under the Consideration Agreement. There was no issue of fact concerning whether Brendle\u2019s breached the Consideration Agreement, and summary judgment in favor of TG &amp; Y was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">F. <em>Claims Against Nalley and Easley</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8P\">1. Indemnification</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The district court held that Brendle\u2019s was liable to OTR and TG &amp; Y for damages for breach of contract. Brendle\u2019s argues that Nalley and Easley should indemnify it for these damages on the ground that as parties to the Party Wall Agreement, they were responsible for the east wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In South Carolina, \u201ca right of indemnity exists ... where one person is exposed to liability by the wrongful act of another in which he did not join.\u201d <em>Stuck v. Pioneer Logging Mach., Inc., </em>279 S.C. 22, 301 S.E.2d 552, 553 (1983). Brendle\u2019s was exposed to liability because it breached its obligations to OTR and TG &amp; Y. Whether Nalley and Easley ultimately were responsible for the east wall failure is irrelevant. Brendle's contracts with TG &amp; Y and derivative obligations to OTR required Brendle\u2019s to perform its duties even if damage occurred to the leased building. The abandonment by Brendle\u2019s of its contractual obligations constituted wrongdoing for which Nalley and Easley were not responsible, and the district court properly denied indemnification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">2. Negligence Claims Against Nalley and Easley</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Brendle\u2019s also appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Nalley and Easley on the issue of negligence. Brendle\u2019s claims that Nalley and Easley negligently constructed the party wall and that Brendle\u2019s sustained economic losses such as moving expenses and lost profits when it vacated the Greenwood store due to the defective wall. To establish a cause of action for negligence, a plaintiff must show three elements: (1) a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) and injury proximately caused by the breach. <em>Bullard v. Ehrhardt, </em>283 S.C. 557, 324 S.E.2d 61, 62 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">South Carolina recognizes that contractors have a duty not to injure parties lawfully on the premises, including tenants leasing store space. <em>See Addy v. Bolton, </em>257 S.C. 28, 183 S.E.2d 708, 709 (1971) (tenant recovered from contractor for damage to merchandise); <em>Edward\u2019s of Byrnes Downs v. Charleston Sheet Metal Co., </em>253 S.C. 537, 172 S.E.2d 120, 122-23 (1970) (tenant of one building entitled to recover from contractor of adjacent site for damage to merchandise). However, South Carolina has awarded damages to commercial tenants in such cases only for tangible losses such as property damage. <em>Addy, </em>183 S.E.2d at 709; <em>Edward\u2019s, </em>172 S.E.2d at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">In <em>2000 Watermark Ass\u2019n v. Celotex Corp., </em>784 F.2d 1183, 1187 (4th Cir.1986), this Court held that under South Carolina law, a negligence action cannot be maintained for economic losses. New home buyers are excluded from this rule and may recover economic losses from negligent builders. <em>Kennedy v. Columbia </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>299 S.C. 335, 384 S.E.2d 730, 737 (1989). However, South Carolina courts have not carved out other exceptions to the economic loss rule. <em>But cf. Kershaw County Bd. of Educ. v. United States Gypsum Co., 302 </em>S.C. 390, 396 S.E.2d 369, 371 (1990) (economic loss rule does not preclude tort recovery if damage is not solely economic). We conclude that South Carolina law does not permit a commercial tenant to recover in tort from a builder for purely economic losses. Moreover, we note that any recovery for economic loss would be particularly inappropriate in this case as Nalley was prepared to perform prompt repairs in order to avoid any economic loss to Brendle\u2019s. The district court did not err by granting Nalley and Easley summary judgment on Bren-dle\u2019s negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">G. <em>OTR\u2019s Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">1. Damages Awarded to OTR</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The district court directed a verdict in favor of OTR for rent, exterminator bills, maintenance and repair costs, and insurance. Brendle's asserts that a directed verdict was improper because whether Bren-dle\u2019s was responsible for such expenses under the lease is a question of fact for the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">A federal court exercising diversity jurisdiction applies federal law to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to submit a question to a jury. <em>Owens v. Bourns, Inc., </em>766 F.2d 145, 149 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1038, 106 S.Ct. 608, 88 L.Ed.2d 586 (1985). A directed verdict is appropriate where a district court, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of that party, nevertheless finds no evidence supporting that party. <em>Garraghty v. Jordan, </em>830 F.2d 1295, 1302 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">When Brendle\u2019s accepted assignment of the lease from TG &amp; Y, it assumed all of TG &amp; Y\u2019s obligations under the lease. The lease required the tenant to return the Greenwood store to the lessor in the same condition it was delivered to the tenant. Because Brendle\u2019s assumed TG &amp; Y\u2019s responsibilities, it was obligated to return the store to OTR in the same condition as when OTR delivered it to TG &amp; Y. The lease did not require the tenant to repair ordinary wear and tear, but provided no other exceptions from maintaining the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">OTR presented expert witnesses who testified as to the condition of the building. Brendle\u2019s did not present expert evidence concerning the condition of the building (with the exception of the east wall). Instead, Brendle\u2019s relied on the Greenwood store manager\u2019s observations that he did not see any problems with the store. In light of the overwhelming expert evidence introduced by OTR in contrast to the non-expert observations of Brendle\u2019s\u2019 store manager, the district court did not err by directing a verdict in OTR\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">2. Costs Not Awarded to OTR</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">OTR challenges the district court\u2019s exclusion from the damage award of OTR\u2019s repair costs for the east wall. If the Greenwood store was damaged during the lease period, Brendle\u2019s was obligated by the lease to repair or rebuild it \u201con the same plans or designs as existed immediately before such damage or destruction occurred.\u201d The east wall failed due to design defects. The repairs made by OTR were made to correct those defects and were not made on the same plans as the original wall. Accordingly, Brendle\u2019s was not obligated to reimburse OTR for those expenses or for the architectural and engineering costs associated with the repair of the east wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">OTR also claims that it was \u00e9ntitled to recover costs associated with an appraisal of the property, a marketing study of the Greenwood area, and travel to inspect the premises. The witness through whom OTR attempted to introduce these expenses admitted that they were incurred primarily in preparation for the trial of this case. Given this testimony, the district court properly rejected OTR\u2019s attempt to recover these costs as damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">H. <em>Mitigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">Under the lease, OTR was obligated to \u201cuse its best efforts to let or relet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the demised premises at a reasonable rental value.\u201d Brendle\u2019s contends that the district court erred in directing a verdict for OTR for damages because there was a factual question concerning OTR\u2019s efforts to sell or relet the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In South Carolina, the burden of showing failure to mitigate falls on the party asserting the claim. <em>Alala v. Peachtree Plantations, Inc., </em>292 S.C. 160, 355 S.E.2d 286, 290 (1987). OTR hired a realtor to sell or lease the store. The evidence adduced by Brendle\u2019s that OTR listed the property at a price higher than its appraisal value fails to establish lack of mitigation. OTR\u2019s duty was to try to relet the building \u2014 not to sell it. Furthermore, although OTR did not expedite repairs of the building, Brendle\u2019s failed to present evidence showing that this inaction discouraged any prospective tenants or that extensive advertising would have resulted in a new tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">I. <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The district court awarded OTR attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred in defending the lawsuit filed by Brendle\u2019s. Absent a contract or statute providing otherwise, attorneys\u2019 fees generally are not recoverable in South Carolina. <em>Hegler v. Gulf Ins. Co., </em>270 S.C. 548, 243 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1978). The court based the award in this case on section (b) of paragraph ten of the lease which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">Tenant ... agrees to assume legal liability for, indemnify and hold free and harmless Landlord, ... from any and all loss, damages, liability, cost or expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys\u2019 fees, reasonable investigative and discovery costs and court costs) and all other sums which Landlord ... may reasonably pay or become obligated to pay on account of any, all, and every demand, claim, assertion of liability or action arising or alleged to have arisen out of any act or omission of Tenant ... made by any person, group or organization, whether employed by either of the parties hereto or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In <em>Tony Guiffre Distrib. Co. v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., </em>740 F.2d 295, 298 (4th Cir.1984), this Court held that a similar indemnification clause allowed the award of attorneys\u2019 fees only in suits brought by third parties against the indemnitee. The language of paragraph ten indicates that the parties did not envision it to cover lawsuits between them: the indemnity provision reaches suits brought against OTR by third parties arising out of acts of Brendle\u2019s, not suits brought by Brendle\u2019s. Because the lease does not provide for attorneys\u2019 fees in the instant lawsuit, the district court erred in awarding OTR attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants. It also was correct in awarding rent, maintenance, and repair costs to OTR, but excluding from damages the repair costs for the structurally defective east wall. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders on these issues. However, we reverse the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to OTR because the lease did not provide for attorneys\u2019 fees for lawsuits between the lessor and lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-17\">. OTR is an Ohio General Partnership acting on behalf of the Board of Trustees of the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio.'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">. OTR, TG &amp; Y, and Brendle\u2019s also asserted third party complaints against Joseph W. Hiller, the architect who prepared the plans for the Greenwood store. The district court granted summary judgment for Hiller and on appeal all parties stipulated to Hiller\u2019s dismissal from the action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\">. Brendle\u2019s cites two recent South Carolina Court of Appeals decisions in support of its argument that it is entitled to indemnification from Nalley and Easley. In both <em>Town of Winnsboro v. Wiedeman-Singleton, Inc., </em>303 S.C. 52, 398 S.E.2d 500 (Ct.App.1990), and <em>Griffin v. Van Norman, </em>302 S.C. 520, 397 S.E.2d 378 (Ct.App.1990), the indemnitor had a contractual relationship with the indemnitee which entitled the indemnitee to compensation. No such contractual relationship exists between Brendle\u2019s and either Nalley or Easley. Without a contractual relationship, indemnification is awarded in South Carolina only if a special relationship exists between the indemnitor and indemnitee, such as master and servant. <em>Town of Winns-boro, </em>398 S.E.2d at 503. Brendle\u2019s has no special relationship with Nalley and Easley which would justify granting indemnification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
