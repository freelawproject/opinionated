NELSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b347-22\">This is a labor relations case that involves the validity of a representation election. The union won the election by a single vote, and the main issue before us is whether the National Labor Relations Board acted improperly in counting a questionably marked ballot. \u2022 We conclude that it did not, and we shall grant the Board\u2019s application for enforcement of an order requiring the employer to bargain with the union. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b347-24\">The United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO, filed a petition with the Board seeking certification as the collective bargaining representative of certain employees of the Duriron Company at a manufac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>taring plant in Cookeville, Tennessee. On July 21, 1989, the Board conducted a secret-ballot election in the lunchroom of the plant. The polls were open from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. The election was supervised by Thomas O\u2019Connor, an agent of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Both Duriron and the union had two election observers. One observer from each side- remained in the voting area, while the other two went out to inform employees that the polls were open.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">A few minutes before the second voting session began, Board Agent O\u2019Connor left the polling area. The observers remained there with the ballot box.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">During the second session several employees who wore union shirts and hats congregated outside the voting area to solicit employees who were about to vote. On two occasions Board Agent O\u2019Connor had brief conversations with employees wearing union shirts and hats in the presence of other employees waiting in line to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">After the election was over, but before the full count was known, Mr. O\u2019Connor declared one ballot void. \u25a0 Without this ballot, it turned out, the election was tied at 85 votes for representation by the union and 85 votes against'.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The ballot in question, like all others used in the election, read \u201cOFFICIAL SECRET BALLOT\u201d and instructed voters to mark an \u201cX\u201d in the square of their choice. This particular ballot had a mark, wholly contained within the box \u25a0 designated for votes in favor of union representation, that can be interpreted either as an \u201cX,\u201d a \u201cC\u201d with a line through it, a \u201c4,\u201d a check mark with a line drawn through it to convert it into an \u201cX,\u201d or an \u201cX\u201d made with a flourish. A copy of the ballot is set forth as an appendix to this opinion. Board Agent O\u2019Connor apparently thought the somewhat unusual mark might serve to identify the voter who cast the ballot, which would be grounds for rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The union challenged the agent\u2019s rejection of the ballot. Duriron also filed objections, asserting, among other things, that union supporters had engaged in electioneering at or near the polls; that the Board agent had left the unsealed ballot box unattended for a few minutes; and that the agent had openly fraternized with union supporters.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">After conducting an investigation, the Board\u2019s Regional Director recommended that the contested ballot be counted as a valid \u201cYes\u201d vote; that certain of Duriron\u2019s objections be overruled; and that other objections be examined at a hearing. A hearing officer subsequently recommended that Duriron\u2019s objections be overruled in their entirety, and the Board accepted the recommendation and certified the union as the exclusive representative of the employees in the bargaining unit. If the contested ballot had not been counted, of course, the union would not have been certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">Duriron refused to bargain with the union, and the Regional Director issued a complaint charging the company with having violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(5) and 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(5) and 158(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, The Board issued a decision and order granting summary judgment against the company, and an application for enforcement of the Board\u2019s order was filed in this court on December 10, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">The Board strives to maintain \u201claboratory conditions\u201d during representation elections. See <em>General Shoe Corp., </em>77 N.L.R.B. 124, 127 (1948), <em>enforced, </em>192 F.2d 504 (6th Cir.1951), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 U.S. 904, 72 S.Ct. 635, 96 L.Ed. 1323 (1952). \u201cLaboratory conditions\u201d are not always achieved in practice, and elections are not automatically voided whenever they fall short, of perfection. The Board has broad discretion to determine whether the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>stances of an election have allowed the employees to exercise free choice in deciding whether to be represented by a union. See <em>Amal. Serv. &amp; Allied Indus. Joint Bd. v. NLRB, </em>815 F.2d 225, 227 (2d Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The task of analyzing the somewhat unusual mark on the contested ballot in this case leads us into a thicket of prior decisions addressing stray or unusual marks, <em>NLRB v. A. G. Parrott Co.</em>, 630 F.2d 212 (4th Cir.1980), smiling faces, <em>Sioux Products, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>703 F.2d 1010 (7th Cir.1983), extraneous words, <em>Mycalex Division of Spaulding Fibre Co. v. NLRB, </em>481 F.2d 1044 (2d Cir.1973), and erased marks, <em>Abtex Beverage Corp., </em>237 N.L.R.B. 1271 (1978). Although the prior decisions do not seem entirely consistent, they are in general agreement on certain fundamental principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">A ballot should normally be counted if there is a clear expression of preference, regardless of an irregularity in the voter\u2019s mark. See <em>NLRB v. Connecticut Foundry Co., </em>688 F.2d 871, 875 (2d Cir.1982) (citing <em>NLRB v. Wrape Forest Indus., Inc., </em>596 F.2d 817 (8th Cir.1979) (en banc)). A ballot has thus been counted when it was blank on its face but had the word \u201cno\u201d written on the back, <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Tobacco Processors, Inc., </em>456 F.2d 248 (4th Cir.1972), when the words \u201cDo I ever\u201d were scrawled across the bottom, <em>NLRB v. Martz Chevrolet, Inc., </em>505 F.2d 968 (7th Cir.1974), and when the letter \u201cC\u201d was written on the ballot, <em>NLRB v. A.G. Parrott Co., </em>630 F.2d 212 (4th Cir.1980). The voter\u2019s intent must ordinarily be given effect if it is reasonably discernible. See <em>Wackenhut Corp. v. NLRB, </em>666 F.2d 464, 467 (11th Cir.1982) (citing <em>NLRB v. Titche-Goettinger Co., </em>433 F.2d 1045 (5th Cir. 1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"A7d\">There is an important exception to this general rule. A ballot that is unambiguous as far as the voter\u2019s preference is concerned will still be rejected if the mark identifies the voter. The Board does not' want employees to be able to take credit with management or with the union for having voted one way or the other in a contested election. The Board has thus voided ballots marked with a capital \u201cH\u201d, <em>NLRB v. National Truck Rental Co., </em>239 F.2d 422, 426 (D.C.Cir.1956), <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U.S. 1016, 77 S.Ct. 561, 1 L.Ed.2d 547 (1957), or with a number, <em>Norris-Thermador Corp., </em>118 N.L.R.B. 1341 (1957). In general, however, the Board has invalidated only ballots with markings that could <em>reasonably </em>be expected to identify the voter. See <em>Sioux Products, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>703 F.2d 1010, 1017 (7th Cir.1983). Not \u201cevery <em>possibly </em>identifying mark serves to disqualify a voter.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Union of Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers v. NLRB, </em>418 F.2d 1191, 1202 (D.C.Cir.1969) (emphasis supplied). And the First Circuit has noted in this connection that one glance may be worth a thousand words. See <em>NLRB v. Newly Weds Foods, Inc., </em>758 F.2d 4, 12 (1st Cir.1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">The mark made on the ballot at issue here was totally contained within the \u201cyes\u201d box, and the- Board concluded that the mark manifested the voter\u2019s intent to vote for the union. Duriron does not seriously challenge this determination, but argues that because the mark <em>might </em>be a \u201c4\u201d and because there is an employee with that time clock number, the secrecy of the ballot was compromised even if there was no prearranged code.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The argument is ingenious but unpersuasive. The Board\u2019s policy is to disqualify ballots where the voter apparently <em>wanted </em>to be identified with his vote. See <em>I.U.E. (Liberty Coach Co.) v. NLRB, </em>418 F.2d 1191, 1202 (D.C.Cir.1969). There is no evidence that the employee whose clock number was \u201c4\u201d marked this particular ballot and wanted to be identified with his vote. The possibility that the union could identify the voter from such a ballot seems more, remote, moreover, than the possibility that the handwriting of the employee who wrote \u201cDo I ever\u201d on a ballot could be used to identify him. See <em>Martz Chevrolet, </em>where the \u201cDo I ever\u201d ballot was held to be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Between 3 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. on the day of the election as many as 12 union supporters, some wearing shirts with pro-union legends, gathered in the hallways within 20 feet of' the doors leading to the cafeteria where polling was taking place. Some of the union supporters went into the employees\u2019 work areas to discuss union benefits and higher wages. Between 3:30 p.m. and 4 p.m. some employees gathered within 15 feet of the cafeteria doors. Although these employees could be heard within the cafeteria, their words could not be understood by people in the voting area.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In <em>Claussen Baking Co., </em>134 N.L.R.B. 111 (1961), the Board ordered a new election where an employee, standing with two management officials some 15 feet from the polls, engaged in systematic electioneering and urged newly hired employees to vote against the union. In <em>Milchem, Inc., </em>170 N.L.R.B. 362, 362 (1968), the Board prohibited \u201cprolonged conversations between representatives of any party to the election and voters waiting to cast ballots.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The Board has long distinguished between electioneering by parties at a polling place and non-party electioneering at or near the polls. In the latter case, \u201cthe Board makes a judgment, based on all facts and circumstances, whether the electioneering substantially impaired the exercise of free choice so as to require the holding of a new election.\u201d <em>Certainteed Cory. v. NLRB, </em>714 F.2d 1042, 1063 (11th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Glacier Packing Co., </em>210 N.L.R.B. 571, 573 n. 5 (1974) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">In the instant case the electioneering was not carried on by union- employees but by Duriron employees.. No prolonged conversations occurred. Coercion was not as readily apparent as in <em>Claussen </em>because the employees were not flanked by management personnel. The line of voters never extended beyond the cafeteria doors, so the electioneering in this c\u00e1se cannot be said to have been directed at employees waiting in line. <em>NLRB v. Carroll Contracting and Ready-Mix, Inc., </em>636 F.2d 111 (5th Cir.1981), is inapposite here for that reason. See also <em>Boston Insulated Wire &amp; Cable Sys., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>703 F.2d 876, 881-82 (5th Cir.1983) (electioneering by union agents did not interfere with employees\u2019 free choice where it occurred away from the polling place and was not directed at employees waiting in line to vote). The Board\u2019s finding that the presence of some pro-union employees in the hallway outside the voting area did not interfere with employees\u2019 free choice is not one that we are free to reject on the record before us.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Pointing to the Board agent\u2019s brief conversations with the employees and to his having left the ballot box area for a short time, Duriron argues that the Board failed to maintain- the required integrity and neutrality of the election process. Again we are not.persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">During the afternoon voting session employee Bob West, who was wearing union insignia, reported to vote. After West announced his name, the agent asked him if Gwen West were his wife. Later during the balloting the agent spoke to Terral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>West, another employee wearing union insignia. The agent asked if he were Gwen West\u2019s son and told him that he had taken an affidavit from Gwen West in another case. Gwen West was not a Duriron employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The Board concedes that the conversations were contrary to Board policy. In assessing a challenge to the integrity of the election process in circumstances such as those presented here, however, the Board determines whether, on the facts of the case, \u201cthe manner in which the election was conducted raises a reasonable doubt as to the fairness and validity of the election.\u201d <em>Polymers, Inc., </em>174 N.L.R.B. 282, 282-83, <em>enforced, </em>414 F.2d 999 (2d Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 1010, 90 S.Ct. 570, 24 L.Ed.2d 502 (1970). Here the agent did not indicate his views about the union or discuss Duriron or the election. We cannot say that the Board was wrong in its determination that the agent\u2019s conversations failed to compromise the integrity of the election.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Although the agent left the vicinity of the election box for a short time, the box was under the scrutiny of observers while the agent was away. The Board found that the seal on the ballot box had not been broken and that no employees entered the polling area during the agent\u2019s absence. On these facts, again, we cannot say that the Board should have found that the integrity of the election was vitiated. See <em>NLRB v. Oesterlen Servs. for Youth, Inc., </em>649 F.2d 399, 400 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1031, 102 S.Ct. 567, 70. L.Ed.2d 474 (1981). Cf. <em>Austill Waxed Paper Co., </em>169 N.L.R.B. 1109 (1968) (election set aside when Board agent left <em>unsealed </em>ballot box unattended for two to five minutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Viewing the record as a whole, and considering the totality of .the circumstances, we are not persuaded that the Board was required to find that the election was fatal: ly tainted. The Board\u2019s application for en-foi-cement of the order requiring Duriron to bargain with the union is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\">. Because representation proceedings are not directly reviewable by the courts, see <em>Am. Fed\u2019n of Labor v. NLRB, </em>308 U.S. 401, 60 S.Ct. 300, 84 L.Ed. 347 (1940), an employer that wants a judicial determination of the fairness of an election must refuse to bargain with the victorious union. The validity of the election can then be challenged in the ensuing unfair labor practice proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">. Agreeing with the decisions last cited, we decline to follow the expansive decision in <em>Laconia Malleable Iron Co., </em>95 N.L.R.B. 161 (1951), where the Board held that markings that <em>might </em>have been deliberately made, and <em>might </em>have served to reveal the identity of the voter, will void a ballot. Almost any stray mark could identify a voter who had agreed that such a mark would serve as a code, but a nervous twitch or an unintentional error in penmanship should not by itself void a ballot or change the results of an election. If a voter had wanted to identify himself to the union in the case at bar, he could have made a mark much more subtle than the one before us. The <em>Laconia </em>rule will not catch the clever cheater, and will disenfranchise too many innocent voters. <em>Cf. NLRB v. Nat'l Truck Rental Co., </em>239 F.2d 422, 426 (D.C.Cir.1956) (ballot valid where marking looked like \"B\" or \"J\" and appeared to be accidentally made), <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U.S. 1016, 77 S.Ct. 561, 1 L.Ed.2d 547 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\">. The fact that the Board agent did not intervene to stop the electioneering does not warrant denying enforcement of the Board\u2019s order. Although it might have been prudent for the agent to intervene, the fact that the agent failed to do so is not dispositive. See <em>Amal. Serv. &amp; Allied Indus. Joint Bd. v. NLRB, </em>815 F.2d 225, 231 (2d Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\">. The level of fraternization in this case does not rise to that in <em>Athbro Precision Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>166 N.L.R.B. 966 (1967), <em>enforced, </em>423 F.2d 573 (1st Cir.1970), where the Board agent in charge of the election drank a beer with one of the union\u2019s representatives during a break in the polling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
