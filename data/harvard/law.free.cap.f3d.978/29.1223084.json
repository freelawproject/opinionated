In agreement with the district court in this case and in accord with other circuits, we hold that the IRS may make this choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-29\">Samuel V. Sotir and Norman P. Johnson were officers, directors and shareholders of R &amp; M Industries, Inc. (\u201cR &amp; M\u201d), a Massachusetts corporation. The corporation incurred two forms of tax liability at issue here. First, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3102, 3402, the corporation withheld from its employees\u2019 wages both social security (\u201cFICA\u201d) taxes and federal income taxes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Employers are required to hold these withheld funds \u201cin trust for the United States,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7501(a), and thus the taxes are sometimes referred to as \u201ctrust-fund\u201d taxes. <em>See United States v. Energy Resources Co., Inc., </em>495 U.S. 545, 546-547, 110 S.Ct. 2139, 2140-2141, 109 L.Ed.2d 580 (1990). Second, FICA being a tax imposed separately on both the employer and the employee, R &amp; M was liable for its own share of FICA taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The corporation withheld FICA and federal income taxes from the wages of its employees during the four quarters of 1986 and the first two quarters of 1987. However, with the exception of two small payments made in the second and third quarters of 1986, the corporation failed to remit to the IRS the withheld amounts as required by law. Consequently, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672(a), authorities assessed penalties against Sotir and Johnson equal to $146,559.83, the unpaid balance of the withheld trust-fund taxes. When employers fail to pay trust-fund taxes, then under section 6672(a) \u201cthe government can collect an equivalent sum directly from the officers or employees of the employer who are responsible for their collection and payment.\u201d <em>In re Energy Resources Co., </em>871 F.2d 223, 225 (1st Cir.1989), <em>aff'd sub nom. United States v. Energy Resources Co., Inc., </em>495 U.S. 545, 110 S.Ct. 2139, 109 L.Ed.2d 580 (1990). Sotir and Johnson both concede that they are such responsible persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">After the assessments were made against Sotir and Johnson, R &amp; M sent payments to the IRS totaling $57,587.61 drawn on the corporate account. The corporation did not designate whether these payments should be applied to its trust-fund tax liability or to the corporation\u2019s liability for its own share of the FICA taxes. \u201cIRS policy has long permitted a taxpayer who <em>\u2018voluntarily </em>\u2019 submits a payment to the IRS to designate the tax liability <em>(i. e., </em>\u2018trust fund\u2019 or non-trust fund tax debts) to which the payment will apply.\u201d <em>In re Energy Resources Co., </em>871 F.2d at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Upon receiving the undesignated payments, the IRS allocated $41,492.26 to the trust-fund tax portion of the corporation\u2019s liabilities and allocated the remaining $16,095.35 to the non-trust-fund tax liability. Sotir and Johnson claimed in the district court that the IRS erred as a matter of law in failing to apply all of the payments to the corporation\u2019s trust-fund tax liability, which would have reduced their own personal liability resulting from assessments made under section 6672(a). The district court rejected their position and so do we. Their position is inconsistent with the governing general rule, and we are unpersuaded by their attempt to avoid that rule by interposing a recent Supreme Court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">When a taxpayer makes a voluntary payment without indicating the liability to which the payment is to be applied, ordinarily the IRS may apply the payment to whichever liability of the taxpayer it chooses. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>961 F.2d 867, 878 (9th Cir.1992); <em>Wood v. United States, </em>808 F.2d 411, 416 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Muntwyler v. United States, </em>703 F.2d 1030, 1032 (7th Cir.1983). <em>See also </em>Rev. Rul. 79-284, 1979-2 C.B. 83. This rule has been approved in several circuits, no contrary authority is cited to us, and we follow that rule here. The rule applied in tax cases accords with the broader convention that when a debtor has more than one debt owing to a creditor, \u201cthe debtor or party paying the money may, if he chooses to do so, direct its appropriation; if he fail, the right devolves upon the creditor.\u201d <em>National Bank of the Commonwealth v. Mechanics\u2019 National Bank, </em>94 U.S. 437, 439, 24 L.Ed. 176 (1876).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">In this case, when the IRS received the tax payments from R &amp; M without any direction as to their application, the IRS applied a portion ($16,095.35) to R &amp; M\u2019s own tax liability for FICA taxes. To this extent, its action was consistent with its ordinary policy of first allocating undesig-nated payments to cover non-trust-fund liabilities. <em>See </em>IRS policy statement P-5-60, May 5, 1984, <em>reprinted in </em>1 Internal Revenue Manual (CCH), at 1305-14. \u201cObvious-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>]y it is normally to the IRS\u2019s best interest to apply payments to that part of the corporate debt that is not secured by the trust obligation of its \u2018responsible\u2019 officers. The IRS policies designed to maximize the public fisc by collecting all taxes due are entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>New Terminal Ste-vedoring, Inc. v. M/V Belnor, </em>728 F.Supp. 82, 65 (D.Mass.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Sotir and Johnson, of course, do not object to the IRS\u2019s allocation of over two-thirds of the R &amp; M payment to its trust-fund tax liability, an apparent deviation from the IRS\u2019s ordinary policy that is unexplained in the record but favored their interests. Rather they contend that it was error for the IRS to apply any portion\u2014 here, $16,095.35 \u2014 of the payments to the corporation\u2019s own tax liability while its trust-fund tax liability remained unpaid. On this appeal, Sotir and Johnson argue that the general rule giving the IRS discretion to allocate undesignated payments has been altered, at least where trust-fund taxes are involved, by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begier v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>496 U.S. 53, 110 S.Ct. 2258, 110 L.Ed.2d 46 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The argument, although' inventive, is without force. In <em>Begier, </em>a taxpayer made certain payments of trust-fund taxes to the IRS \u2014 including both excise taxes collected from customers and income and FICA taxes withheld from employees \u2014 within 90 days before filing a bankruptcy petition. <em>Id. </em>at 56, 110 S.Ct. at 2261. The bankruptcy trustee thereafter filed an action against the IRS to \u201cavoid\u201d (that is, to recover for the estate) those payments to the IRS as a \u201cpreference\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b). <em>Id. </em>That section provides in relevant part that a transfer of its property by a debtor to pay a prior debt, where the transfer occurs within 90 days before the debtor files a bankruptcy petition, is recoverable by the trustee in bankruptcy. The reason is to prevent a preference to the creditor as against other claimants to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Begier </em>that, under the Bankruptcy Code, the payments could not be avoided because they were not made from property of the taxpayer, but rather from funds held in trust for the government pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7501. <em>Id. </em>at 67, 110 S.Ct. at 2267. The Court declared that even though the funds had not been segregated by the taxpayer, a \u201ctrust\u201d had arisen \u201cwithin the meaning of \u00a7 7501\u201d at the moment that the excise taxes were collected from customers and FICA and income taxes withheld from employees\u2019 wages. <em>Id. </em>at 61-62, 110 S.Ct. at 2264-65. This alone did not resolve the case because the payments themselves could not be traced back under common law tracing principles to any particular funds of the taxpayer; but, relying primarily on Bankruptcy Code legislative history, the Supreme Court decided that \u201cthe debt- or\u2019s act of voluntarily paying its trust-fund tax obligation ... is alone sufficient to establish the required nexus between the \u2018amount\u2019 held in trust and the funds paid\u201d to the IRS. <em>Id. </em>at 66-67,110 S.Ct. at 2266-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Sotir and Johnson argue that in this case, as in <em>Begier, </em>the payments to the IRS by the corporation were derived from funds held in trust and thus the IRS, without any direction from the corporation, should have applied the payments to cover the trust-fund tax liabilities. Unfortunately for this argument, the point of departure in <em>Begier </em>was the taxpayer\u2019s designation, by agreement with the IRS, that all of the payments in that case would be allocated to \u201cspecific trust-fund tax obligations\u201d of the taxpayer. <em>Id. </em>at 56, 110 S.Ct. at 2261. In substance, <em>Begier </em>gave effect to this designation, made at the time of payment, in order to classify the funds used in payment as trust-fund taxes, thereby shielding the payments from avoidance as preferences. In the present case, by contrast, R &amp; M made no designation when it made its payment to the IRS. Indeed, it is the failure to do so that has landed Sotir and Johnson in their present predicament.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Begier </em>related solely to the impact of a taxpayer designation upon the status of payments under the preference provision of the Bankruptcy Code, a provision in no way involved in the present case. <em>Begier </em>did not, either by reasoning or result, address the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>tion of how the IRS should allocate payments made by a taxpayer who fails to make a designation. It is almost unnecessary to add that nowhere in <em>Begier </em>did the Supreme Court suggest any intent to overturn the line of decisions allowing the IRS, absent some direction from the taxpayer, to apply payments to whichever of the taxpayer\u2019s liabilities it wishes. That line of decisions disposes of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
