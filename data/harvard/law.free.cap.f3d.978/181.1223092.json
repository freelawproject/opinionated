JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b273-25\">Appellant Smith pled guilty to one count of aiding and abetting the distribution of crack cocaine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. He was sentenced to an eigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>teen-month term of imprisonment to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release. Having served his initial sentence, he now appeals from the revocation of his supervised release term. We hold that the trial court did not err in finding that Smith was in possession of a controlled substance, in violation of the conditions of his supervised release, and was therefore required to serve in prison not less than one-third of the supervised release term. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">As one of the conditions of his supervised release, Smith was to refrain from the use of any controlled substances and was to submit himself for periodic urine drug tests as directed by his probation officer. Shortly after beginning his period of supervised release, Smith submitted urine samples for analysis on January 3 and January 10,1992, both of which yielded positive results for the presence of cocaine metabolite. At the revocation hearing, the government\u2019s factual summary included a statement that Smith had admitted to his probation officer the use and possession of cocaine on two occasions. First, Smith had placed some cocaine in a beer which he than drank; second, on another occasion, he and a friend smoked crack cocaine. These events were corroborated by the above-mentioned positive urinalysis tests. In acknowledging to the trial court his violation of the supervised relief terms, however, Smith stated only that he <em>used </em>the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">On appeal, Smith contends that as a matter of law, the \u201cuse\u201d of controlled substances during supervised release is not equivalent to their \u201cpossession.\u201d He argues that if he had only used crack cocaine, the district court retained sentencing discretion on revocation of supervised release, while finding of possession triggers a mandatory minimum sentence of no less than one-third of the term of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Even if it were possible to differentiate use from possession of a controlled substance, Smith did not do so on the facts of this case. Whether he possessed a controlled substance in violation of the conditions of his supervised release was a factual question committed to the trial court. The district court, in finding that Smith possessed crack cocaine, did not rely solely on the two positive urinalyses, as Smith contends. Rather, appellant Smith admitted that he used cocaine on two occasions since his release. He admitted possession when he told the probation officer that someone gave cocaine to him and he placed it in his beer. He further admitted that, on a different occasion, he smoked crack with another individual. Smith did not allege or prove that the cocaine was administered against his will or by trick. The district court\u2019s finding of possession is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Our conclusion that admission of use of a contraband substance, as well as positive urinalysis test results, may constitute circumstantial evidence of possession of a controlled substance for purposes of section 3583(g) follows that of other circuit courts. <em>United States v. Blackston, </em>940 F.2d 877, 891 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 611, 116 L.Ed.2d 634 (1991) (extended discussion of \u00a7 3583(g)); <em>United States v. Dillard, </em>910 F.2d 461, 464 n. 3 (7th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Baclaan, </em>948 F.2d 628, 630 (9th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Ramos-Santiago, </em>925 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 129, 116 L.Ed.2d 96 (1991); <em>United States v. Alli, </em>929 F.2d 995, 996 (4th Cir.1991); <em>see, United States v. Kindred, </em>918 F.2d 485, 487 n. 3 (5th Cir.1990) (\u201cKnowing use of drugs is akin to possession.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
