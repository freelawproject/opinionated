Because the ICC has presented a reasoned explanation for its change in policy, we decline to substitute our judgment for the Commission\u2019s. We therefore affirm the Commission\u2019s modifications in valuating the railroads\u2019 investment bases.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Pursuant to Congress\u2019s direction that it develop standards to determine adequate railroad revenue levels and assist carriers in attaining them, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10704(a)(2) (1988), the ICC determines which railroads are attaining an adequate level of revenues on an annual basis. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10704(a)(3), (4). Revenues are deemed adequate when a railroad earns a rate of return on its investment at least equal to the current cost of capital, <em>i.e., </em>the market cost of debt and equity, otherwise understood as the \u201cminimum necessary to attract and maintain capital in the railroad ... industry.\u201d <em>Standards For Railroad Revenue Adequacy, </em>364 I.C.C. 803, 809-10 (1981), <em>aff'd, Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie R.R. Co. v. ICC, </em>691 F.2d 1104 (3d Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Western Coal Traffic League v. United States, </em>462 U.S. 1110, 103 S.Ct. 2463, 77 L.Ed.2d 1340 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">To calculate revenue adequacy, the Commission divides a carrier\u2019s net railway operating income by its net investment base to determine its return on investments for that year. It then compares the railroad\u2019s return on investment with the industry\u2019s cost of capital for that year. When the cost of capital exceeds the return on investment, the carrier is deemed revenue inadequate. The more a railroad\u2019s net investment base shrinks relative to its net operating income, the greater the likelihood that a railroad will be found to be revenue adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">Notwithstanding the pejorative connotations inherent in the term, a determination of \u201crevenue inadequacy\u201d is generally advantageous to a carrier. Such a finding permits a railroad to raise its rates without regulatory scrutiny by as much as 4% above the rate of inflation each year. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10707a(d)(l), (3), (e). In addition, revenue adequacy is a factor in ICC assessment of the reasonableness of any railroad rates the agency reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">In calculating revenue adequacy for 1988, the ICC identified five proposed computational adjustments to its revenue adequacy standards. Only one of these is at issue here: the proposal to evaluate railroad assets acquired from other railroads based on their \u201cacquisition cost\u201d (cost to the acquirer) rather than on their \u201coriginal\u201d or \u201cpredecessor\u201d cost (book value to the seller). The latter represents the costs to the railroads when assets are first dedicated to public seryice by the seller and allows the seller\u2019s book value to be carried over to its successor, while the former is defined as the fair market value of an asset as established by its purchase price when acquired and as shown on the seller's railroad books, less depreciation. <em>1988 Determination, </em>6 I.C.C.2d at 164 &amp; n. 3. Under acquisition costing, the purchasing carrier will report its own higher value when it acquires another\u2019s property for a price in excess of the seller\u2019s book value; converse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>ly, when the purchaser pays less than the seller\u2019s book value, the purchaser\u2019s net investment base will reflect its lower value. <em>Id. </em>at 935 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Because economic conditions in the railroad industry affect the value of railroad assets, a net investment base calculated by acquisition costs will often be smaller than one calculated using original cost. The ICC issued tentative 1988 revenue adequacy determinations for potentially affected carriers pending a final decision on whether to adopt the proposed revisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">One carrier, some shipper groups, and the AAR filed comments on the proposed computational adjustments, and the ICC subsequently resolved several of the disputed issues. Having recomputed revenue adequacy for 1988, the Commission ultimately found two of the fifteen railroads with operating revenues of $50 million or more to be revenue adequate. <em>Revenue Adequacy </em>\u2014 1988 <em>Determination, </em>6 I.C.C.2d 933, 55 Fed.Reg. 32318 (Aug. 8, 1990) (C.L. 88-10) <em>(\u201c1988 Determination\u201d). </em>Despite the introduction of the new valuation methodology, the two carriers affected by the use of acquisition cost rather than original cost were deemed revenue inadequate in 1988. <em>Id. </em>at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">The following year, the ICC found two carriers to be revenue adequate. <em>Railroad Revenue Adequacy </em>\u2014 1989 <em>Determination, </em>7 I.C.C.2d 158, 55 Fed.Reg. 48177 (Nov. 19, 1990) (C.L. 89-1) <em>(\u201c1989 Determination \"). </em>In granting AAR\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the ICC agreed to review the investment base valuation issue, but ultimately refused to amend its methodology. <em>1989 Determination, </em>7 I.C.C.2d 580, 585 (1991) (C.L. 89-8). AAR petitioned this Court for review of the 1988 and 1989 determinations, both of which utilized the acquisition cost valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">We note at the outset that our role in reviewing agency regulations or modifications thereof is a limited one. This Court is not to inquire as to whether the agency\u2019s decision is wise as a policy matter; indeed, we are forbidden \u201cfrom substituting [our] judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, </em>541 F.2d 1, 34 (D.C.Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied sub nom. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. EPA, </em>426 U.S. 941, 96 S.Ct. 2662, 49 L.Ed.2d 394 (1976). Rather, we must affirm unless the regulations are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1966); <em>United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corp., </em>406 U.S. 742, 749, 92 S.Ct. 1941, 1947, 32 L.Ed.2d 453 (1972). We presume the agency\u2019s action is valid. <em>ICC v. Jersey City, </em>322 U.S. 503, 512, 64 S.Ct. 1129, 1133, 88 L.Ed. 1420 (1944); <em>Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, </em>541 F.2d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">This \u201chighly deferential\u201d standard would not permit us to substitute our judgment for that of the agency. We may vacate the ICC\u2019s decisions if the agency \u201chas relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before an agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2867, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). Indeed, because Congress has specifically delegated the responsibility to develop revenue adequacy standards to the ICC, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10704(a)(2), the Commission here is operating \u201cat the zenith of its powers.\u201d <em>Central and Southern Motor Freight Tariff Ass\u2019n v. United States, 777 </em>F.2d 722, 729 (D.C.Cir.1985) (citing <em>Batterton v. Francis, </em>432 U.S. 416, 425-26, 97 S.Ct. 2399, 2405-06, 53 L.Ed.2d 448 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">When, as in the present matter, the Commission revises or even reverses previous rules rather than promulgating new ones, deference nonetheless remains in order, so long as the Commission presents a reasoned analysis supporting its action. <em>Center For Science v. Department of Treasury, </em>797 F.2d 995, 999 (D.C.Cir.1986) (citing <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm, </em>463 U.S. at 42, 103 S.Ct. at 2866). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>We find that the ICC did indeed make a rational choice between conflicting policy-alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">At the heart of the AAR\u2019s challenge to the ICC\u2019s valuation modifications as arbitrary and capricious is the claim that acquisition costing is inconsistent with the Interstate Commerce Act\u2019s mandate that revenue levels be established adequate to permit railroads to earn \u201ca reasonable and economic profit or return (or both) on capital employed in the business.\u201d 49 U.S.C; \u00a7 10704(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">First, the AAR contends that acquisition cost valuation will both deny railroads capital return sufficient to meet public demand for rail service and prevent carriers from recovering adequate depreciation charges. Without an \u201cobjective starting point\u201d such as original cost for valuation, the AAR contends, a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d may emerge. Under this scenario, regulation would restrain earnings which would be reflected in carriers\u2019 market prices \u2014 the basis for acquisition costing \u2014 and become the means of establishing an ever-lower investment base for regulatory purposes, thereby creating a \u201cone-way downward ratchet.\u201d AAR Comments \u00e1t 17-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">The AAR further argues that the Supreme Court has rejected the use of current market value as a basis for determining the amount a regulated firm should be allowed to earn because of price spiralling. <em>See FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 601, 64 S.Ct. 281, 287, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944) (holding that \u201crates cannot be made to depend on \u2018fair value\u2019 when the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings under whatever rates may be anticipated\u201d); <em>Bluefield Waterworks and Improvement Co. v. Public Serv. Cornm\u2019n, </em>262 U.S. 679, 691, 43 S.Ct. 675, 678, 67 L.Ed. 1176 (1923) (citing <em>Minnesota Rate Cases, </em>230 U.S. 352, 434, 33 S.Ct. 729, 754, 57 L.Ed. 1511 (1913) (holding that \u201cThe making of a just return ... involves the recognition of [property\u2019s] fair value if it be more than its cost\u201d)); <em>Niagara Falls Power Co. v. FPC, </em>137 F.2d 787, 794 (2d Cir.) (noting that the \u201conly factor which determines [a power plant\u2019s] price is the \u2018prospective revenues\u2019 which it will produce\u201d in affirming the Federal Power Commission\u2019s use of original cost in determining corporation\u2019s net investment for capitalization purposes), <em>cert. denied, </em>320 U.S. 792, 64 S.Ct. 206, 88 L.Ed. 477 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">Nonetheless, because the Commission has articulated a rational basis for rejecting this argument, we must affirm that rejection. The Commission rationally distinguishes the instant case from the line of public utility rates cases cited as precedent by the AAR.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Railroads are not a \u201cheavily regulated utility\u201d and therefore \u201cmost rail rates are not subject to maximum rate regulation,\u201d <em>1988 Determination, </em>6 I.C.C.2d at 941, which would constantly drive earnings down. The AAR contends, nonetheless, that even if maximum price regulation is not all controlling \u2014 as it is with respect to a public utility \u2014 certain potentially very profitable routes are so limited. Therefore, even some regulatory limitation on maximum pricing \u201ctaints\u201d the Commission policy with circularity. Congress in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11166 has required the ICC to \u201cpre-scrib[e] expense and revenue accounting and reporting requirements consistent with generally accepted accounting principles\u201d and to \u201cpromulgate such rules pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>accounting principles established by the Railroad Accounting Principles Board\u201d (\u201cRAPB\u201d). <em>Id. </em>In the rule before us, the ICC did exactly that, relying on the expert views expressed by the RAPB consistent with generally accepted accounting principles as support for its valuation methodology. <em>See 2 RAPB Report </em>45-48; <em>1988 Determination, </em>6 I.C.C.2d at 938-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">In short, the Commission has made a reasonable predictive judgment as to how railroad investors will respond to its use of acquisition costing and has concluded that a downward price spiral would not occur. Such a prediction is entitled to this Court\u2019s deference. <em>FCC v. National Citizens Comm\u2019n for Broadcasting, </em>436 U.S. 775, 814, 98 S.Ct. 2096, 2121-22, 56 L.Ed.2d 697 (1978); <em>Southern Pacific Transp. Co. v. ICC, </em>736 F.2d 708, 720-21 (D.C.Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 1208, 105 S.Ct. 1171, 84 L.Ed.2d 322 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"AnK\">Indeed, deference is particularly appropriate where, as here, an agency has sought to make reasonable accommodations to address petitioner\u2019s concerns. The Commission has expressed a willingness to make exceptions to acquisition costing, in accordance with the recommendations of the RAPB, if it can be shown in particular cases that government regulation primarily held down a railroad\u2019s selling price. <em>1988 Determination, </em>6 I.C.C.2d at 941. Costing decisions, by the ICC\u2019s own pledge, \u201cwill be driven by what is the most accurate and reasonable valuation in each particular case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">In a distinct but related argument, the AAR charges that by relying on the acquisition costs of potentially undervalued assets as the basis for allowed depreciation, the ICC \u201celiminates the linkage between underlying asset values and allowed depreciation charges,\u201d and thereby denies railroads the opportunity to earn the revenue sufficient to replace essential assets and make other \u201cprudent capital outlays.\u201d' 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10704(a)(2)(A). Use of acquisition cost, according to the AAR, will undermine the integrity of the railroads\u2019 depreciation system. The AAR argues that \u201c[t]he investment base should never be reduced without allowing the railroad some opportunity to recover its capital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">We find this argument unavailing because the ICC reasonably concluded that acquisition value is \u201cthe more current and probative evidence of value arrived at in arms length negotiations.\u201d <em>1988 Determination, </em>6 I.C.C.2d at 940-41/ The Commission rejected as a \u201cfaulty premise\u201d the assumption, inherent in the AAR\u2019s preference for predecessor costs, that \u201cthe railroads\u2019 consumable assets were adequately depreciated over the years and that the resultant net book value fairly depicts the age and physical condition of the road property and equipment while factoring in any obsolescence as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This judgment was well within the ICC\u2019s purview. Indeed, the ICC identifies a significant inconsistency in the AAR\u2019s position, which would allow railroads to \u201cexpense special charges while continuing to value the asset base using old values <em>(i.e. </em>predecessor costs) that have since been written-down as a result of an acquisition or reorganization.\u201d <em>1988 Determination, </em>6 I.C.C.2d at 941. Noting that the railroad has changed owners and emerged from sale as \u201ca different entity with different capital requirements than its predecessor,\u201d <em>id. </em>at n. 11, the ICC convincingly argues that it properly focused on the capital ventured by the new owners, rather than on the prior owner\u2019s investment. Furthermore, the ICC credibly suggests that the AAR\u2019s solicitude for new owners unable to fully recover their capital investments is misplaced when the purchasers pay more than book value for sellers\u2019 assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">AAR next argues that acquisition costing produces inconsistent results, because two competing carriers with equivalent assets may be valued differently for regulatory purposes depending upon when one railroad\u2019s assets happen to be acquired. The Commission did not respond specifically to the argument posed as a hypothetical by AAR\u2019s expert, in which an acquired rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>road with a revalued investment base achieves a new, higher rate of return and thus incurs a competitive disadvantage visa-vis an unacquired carrier, despite the similarity of their assets and revenues. However, when dealing with particular and not hypothetical financially troubled railroads, the ICC did consider the potential for disparate rates of returns based on different asset valuations, and concluded that acquisition costing did not distort the presentation of earnings in the cases of particular financially troubled railroads. <em>1989 Determination, </em>7 I.C.C.2d at 585 (Illinois Central); <em>1988 Determination, </em>6 I.C.C.2d at 941 n. 11 (Boston and Maine). We defer to those determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Although we have not discussed all the arguments raised by petitioner, we have considered each of them and found them to be without merit. The ICC\u2019s determination that acquisition cost valuation both represents an accurate valuation methodology and is consistent with the capital attraction goal of the revenue adequacy proviso of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10704(a)(2), was neither arbitrary nor capricious. Accordingly, the ICC orders under review are hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-9\">. Ex Parte No. 483, <em>Railroad Revenue Adequacy </em>\u2014 1988 <em>Determination, </em>6 I.C.C.2d 163; 6 I.C.C.2d 933 (orders served November 17, 1989 and August 7, 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b831-14\">.

This distinction allows us to dispense with the AAR\u2019s final argument \u2014 that acquisition cost valuation conflicts with decisions of this Court \u2014 in short order. This Court has recognized that the agencies governing public utilities are entitled to deference with respect to choices of regulatory techniques and has allowed the agencies great leeway in, their selection of valuation methods for rate base purposes. <em>See, e.g., Southwestern Bell Corp. v. FCC, </em>896 F.2d 1378, 1381 (D.C.Cir.1990) (affirming as within <em>agency </em>discretion an FCC rule permitting telephone utilities to utilize the lesser of market price or book value to evaluate assets purchased from affiliates). We do not find the Commission\u2019s reasoning in the instant case inconsistent with that jurisprudence. Indeed, the AAR itself has argued in an earlier case that the rate principles of the public utility industry should not be applied to railroad revenue adequacy determinations. <em>See </em>AAR Reply Comments, <em>Standards for Railroad Revenue Adequacy, </em>3 I.C.C.2d 261 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
