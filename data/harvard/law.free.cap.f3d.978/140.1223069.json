Martin Marietta then sought a declaratory judgment that it owed INTELSAT nothing under the agreement between the parties, and INTELSAT counterclaimed for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, gross negligence, and breach of contract. Martin Marietta moved to dismiss INTELSAT's counterclaims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and the district court granted the motion as to all of INTELSAT\u2019s claims. Finding that INTELSAT has stated two claims upon which relief may be granted, breach of contract and gross negligence, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">Martin Marietta and INTELSAT reached an agreement under which Martin Marietta would launch two satellites for INTELSAT. The relevant provisions of the parties\u2019 contract follow. In Article 2, Martin Marietta contracted to \u201cmake its Best Efforts to furnish Launch Services for the purpose of delivering INTELSAT\u2019s payload into orbit.\u201d In Article 1.2, the parties defined \u201cBest Efforts\u201d as \u201c[djiligently working in a good and workman-like manner as a reasonable, prudent manufacturer of launch vehicles and provider of Launch Services.\u201d Article 6 was entitled \u201cBest Efforts Replacement Launch.\u201d Article 6.1 stated, \u201cINTELSAT may request a Replacement Launch in the event that following any Launch under this Contract, the Titan III Mission or the Payload Mission has not been accomplished for any reason.\u201d In Article 6.7, the parties stated that a replacement launch \u201cshall be the sole and exclusive remed[y] of the Buyer from Martin Marietta in the event the Titan III mission fails for any reason.\u201d Article 17 was entitled \u201cAllocation of Certain Risks.\u201d In Article 17.1, the parties agreed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqu\">The following risks, arising out of or incident to the Launch Services to be provided by Martin Marietta and its subcontractors at every tier under this Contract are allocated between INTELSAT and Martin Marietta as set forth in this ARTICLE 17, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">Article 17.5.1 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-17\">Martin Marietta and INTELSAT agree that, with respect to injury to or death of persons involved in, or damage to property used in connection with, Launch Services to be furnished under this Contract, neither Party will make any claim against the other ..., and each Party shall bear its own risk of loss with respect to injury to or death of its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>employees or damage to its own property howsoever caused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Article 17.6, entitled \u201cLimitation of Liability,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">Martin Marietta\u2019s liability to INTELSAT ... whether or not arising under contract, or in negligence, strict liability, or under any other theory of tort or liability, shall not include any loss of use or loss of profit or revenue or any other indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages. In no event shall Martin Marietta\u2019s liability to INTELSAT for any claim arising out of a particular Launch Services exceed the price for that Titan III Launch Services to be paid by INTELSAT ..., provided however that nothing in this paragraph shall affect any right of INTELSAT to a Replacement Launch ... under Article 6----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Finally, Article 21 specified that the contract was to be governed by Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The first launch was unsuccessful. The satellite failed to separate from the launch vehicle when it was supposed to, due to Martin Marietta\u2019s wiring mistake. Eventually, INTELSAT separated the satellite from the launch vehicle, but the process of doing so (which involved separating the satellite from its booster rocket) made it impossible for the satellite to attain its proper orbit. The satellite is the one that the National Aeronatics and Space Administration (funded by INTELSAT) recently rescued. The second launch the parties contracted for, which involved another satellite, was successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">After INTELSAT threatened to sue over the first launch, Martin Marietta filed a declaratory judgment action in the District of Maryland, seeking a declaration that it owed INTELSAT nothing under their contract. INTELSAT counterclaimed for breach of contract, negligence, gross negligence, and negligent misrepresentation. INTELSAT sought $400 million in damages for the lost value of the launch services, the lost use of the satellite, lost profit, damage to the satellite, and the cost of rescuing the satellite. Martin Marietta then made a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the counterclaims. The district court granted the motion to dismiss the tort claims in April 1991, in an opinion published in edited form in May 1991, <em>Martin Marietta Corp. v. INTELSAT, </em>763 F.Supp. 1327 (D.Md. 1991), and granted the motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim in November 1991, in an unpublished opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">As to INTELSAT\u2019s negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims, the district court held that INTELSAT had not shown a tort duty of due care distinct from the duties the contract between the parties created. As for gross negligence, the district court held that the Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 established a federal policy that overrode Maryland\u2019s common law rule that parties ordinarily cannot waive liability for gross negligence. Later, in ruling on the breach of contract claim, the district court held that the parties\u2019 contract clearly and unambiguously barred a breach of contract action. Citing Article 6.7 of the contract, the court reasoned that INTELSAT\u2019s sole remedy for a \u201cmission failure\u201d was a replacement launch and that the satellite\u2019s failure to separate from the rocket at the proper time constituted a \u201cmission failure.\u201d The court also quoted Article 17.6 (the Limitation of Liability section) and stated that \u201c[h]ere, again, the contract unambiguously bars any contract claim beyond that permitted in Article 6.\u201d J.A. at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">We first consider the breach of contract claim, bearing in mind that \u201ca complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). In considering a motion to dismiss, the claims must be construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and its allegations taken as true. <em>Jenkins v. McKeithen, </em>395 U.S. 411, 421-22, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 1848-49, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 (1969). Most importantly, dismissals for failure to state a claim are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>Revene v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>Charles County Comm\u2019rs, </em>882 F.2d 870, 872 (4th Cir.1989). INTELSAT\u2019s theory is that Martin Marietta breached its obligation to use its \u201cbest efforts,\u201d a duty established in Article 2 of the contract and defined in Article 1. The district court found that the contract clearly and unambiguously barred that claim. As the district court noted, the construction of ambiguous contract provisions is a factual determination that precludes dismissal on a motion for failure to state a claim. <em>Wol-man v. Tose, </em>467 F.2d 29, 34 (4th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">After our required <em>de novo </em>review, we find that the contract is not free from ambiguity and that the district court erred in granting Martin Marietta\u2019s motion to dismiss. First, the district court stated that failure of the satellite to separate from the rocket was a \u201cmission failure\u201d under the contract, limiting INTELSAT\u2019s remedy to a replacement launch. In support for that proposition, the court cited Article 1.19 of the contract and the \u201cInterface Control Document,\u201d a separate agreement addressing \u201cthe design and operations of each company\u2019s flight and ground equipment.\u201d J.A. at 329. However, Article 1.19, a definitional section, does not define \u201cmission failure.\u201d Instead, it defines the term \u201cTitle III Mission\u201d as \u201c[t]he mission assigned to the Titan III as specified in [the] Interface Control Document.\u201d We have searched the Interface Control Document, 80 pages of tables, graphs, and technical information, in vain for any sign that the parties intended it to shed light on what would constitute a mission failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">While, as a matter of common sense, it seems reasonable to label what happened as a \u201cmission failure,\u201d INTELSAT argues that its claim is not for mission failure, but for failure of separation of the Titan III payload and booster. With the parties\u2019 contract and Interface Control Document silent on this point, the district court erred in accepting Martin Marietta\u2019s construction of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Second, the district court found that the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d provision in Article 17 unambiguously barred any contract claim other than the replacement launch remedy in Article 6. INTELSAT claims that the contract is ambiguous because Article 6.7 states that a replacement launch is INTELSAT\u2019s \u201csole and exclusive\u201d remedy, while the Article 17 \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d provision put a damages cap on claims \u201carising under contract, or in negligence, strict liability, or under any other theory of tort or liability.\u201d INTELSAT argues that an Article 6 replacement launch could not be an exclusive remedy when Article 17 recognized the possibility of other claims, especially when Article 17 stated that it would govern the allocation of risks between the parties \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of this Contract.\u201d At the very least, INTELSAT contends, the two articles together create an ambiguity precluding dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Martin Marietta argues that the statement in the Article 17 \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d provision that it did not affect INTELSAT\u2019s right to an Article 6 replacement launch shows that the two provisions are independent, and that the exclusive remedy language in Article 6 controls. On the other hand, INTELSAT argues based on the same provisions that a replacement launch and a breach of contract claim are not mutually exclusive, and that Article 17 controls. We disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the interplay of the two provisions is unambiguous. Martin Marietta certainly could have included clearer language, if it intended at the time of contracting to limit INTELSAT\u2019s remedy in the way it now argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Alternatively, Martin Marietta offers an explanation of this apparent ambiguity. Martin Marietta argues that the Article 6 replacement launch remedy is the exclusive remedy when there have been post-launch damages, because Article 6 only applies \u201cfollowing any launch.\u201d <em>See </em>Art. 6.1. Under Martin Marietta\u2019s construction, the Article 17 \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d provision applies to pre-launch damages such as \u201cefficient breach\u201d (a refusal by Martin Marietta to go forward). However, while Martin Marietta\u2019s interpretation plausibly harmonizes the two articles, the contract is far from crystal clear and never refers to \u201cpre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>launch\u201d or \u201cpost-launch\u201d damages or otherwise mandates Martin Marietta\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In light of these ambiguities, it does not appear beyond doubt that INTELSAT can prove no set of facts constituting breach of Martin Marietta\u2019s contractual duty to use its \u201cbest efforts,\u201d and we must therefore reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of INTELSAT\u2019s breach of contract claim. <em>See Conley, </em>355 U.S. at 45-46, 78 S.Ct. at 101-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">As to INTELSAT\u2019s negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims, we agree with the district court\u2019s analysis of Maryland law and reasons for dismissal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACy\">Equally sophisticated parties who have the opportunity to allocate risks to third party insurance or among one another should be held to only those duties specified by the agreed upon contractual terms and not to general tort duties imposed by state law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">... Consistent with the Court\u2019s discussion of whether tort duties are applicable in contractual relationships, Maryland law holds that a claim for negligent misrepresentation is improper when, as here, the only relationship between the parties is contractual, both parties are equally sophisticated, and the contract does not create an express duty of due care in making representations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">The case before the Court does not present circumstances in which the law creates a tort duty of due care independent from the parties\u2019 contractual relationship. Such tort duties of care with respect to representations are imposed by courts to protect a peculiarly vulnerable party. In particular, such duties are imposed in the context of a patient\u2019s or client\u2019s dealings with a professional in whom one places a great degree of personal trust and confidence \u2014 such as a physician, an attorney, an architect or a public accountant. No such relationship of special trust exists here. Nor is INTELSAT an unsophisticated consumer, unfamiliar with the subject matter of the contract, who relied on the representations of someone holding himself or herself out as possessing special expertise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af5\">763 F.Supp. at 1332-33 (citations omitted). We therefore affirm the dismissal of INTELSAT\u2019s negligence claim on the basis of the district court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">INTELSAT\u2019s negligent misrepresentation argument raises two points worth further discussion. First, INTELSAT relies on <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n v. Washington Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 386 A.2d 1216 (1978). There, in upholding a noncontestability clause in a lease, the court held that \u201cunless clearly prohibited by statute, contractual limitations on judicial remedies will be enforced, absent a positive showing of fraud, misrepresentation, overreaching, or other unconscionable conduct on the part of the party seeking enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231. INTELSAT argues that the <em>Arena </em>court intended \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d to include negligent misrepresentations, but we must disagree, because negligent misrepresentations do not rise to the level of \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201coverreaching,\u201d or \u201cunconscionable conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">Second, INTELSAT argues that the Article 6 \u201cReplacement Launch\u201d provision should not apply because INTELSAT only approved the fated launch, which triggered Article 6, in reliance on Martin Marietta\u2019s post-contract misrepresentations. INTELSAT reasons that an exclusion of remedy provision is invalid when one party\u2019s misrepresentations induced the other to take an action that caused the provision to take effect. However, Maryland law will enforce exclusion of remedy provisions unless one party\u2019s misrepresentations have induced the other party to <em>enter </em>into the contract in the first place. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">The two Maryland cases INTELSAT cites do not support its theory that post-contract misrepresentations may also invalidate contractual limitations on remedies. First, because <em>Weisman v. Connors, </em>312 Md. 428, 540 A.2d 783, 792 (1988), only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>involved pre-contractual misrepresentations, <em>we </em>do not believe that case fairly supports INTELSAT\u2019s theory. Next, INTELSAT quotes from a footnote in <em>Martens Chevrolet, Inc. v. Seney, </em>292 Md. 328, 439 A.2d 534, 539 n. 7 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">Appellees have also argued that even if negligent misrepresentation is a viable tort action in this State, it can never be applied to statements made in connection with consummation of an arm\u2019s length transaction, as was involved in the present case. We find nothing in <em>Virginia Dare </em>or its progeny to support such a sweeping assertion and we reject it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The statement in <em>Martens Chevrolet </em>only refers to the \u201cconsummation\u201d of an arm\u2019s length transaction. Here, INTELSAT is relying on negligent misrepresentations made after the parties signed a contract. The same footnote in <em>Martens Chevrolet </em>also quoted a New York Court of Appeals statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">A party to a contract cannot, by misrepresentation of material fact, induce the other party to the contract to enter into it to his damage, and then protect himself from the legal effect of such misrepresentation by inserting in the contract a clause to the effect that he is not to be held liable for the misrepresentation which induced the other party to enter into the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-8\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. State, </em>241 N.Y. 563, 150 N.E. 556 (1925)). That court also referred to \u201centering] into\u201d a contract, while INTELSAT\u2019s theory rests on statements made after the parties reached their contract. Therefore, the cases INTELSAT relies on are inapposite, and we have not found any authority that is more helpful. Because INTELSAT\u2019s negligent misrepresentation arguments are without support, and in view of Maryland law on tort duties arising out of contractual relationships, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Finally, we consider INTELSAT\u2019s gross negligence claim. Initially, Martin Marietta questions whether Maryland law invalidates contractual waivers of liability in cases of gross negligence where the parties are of equal bargaining power. INTELSAT relies on two decisions by the Maryland Court of Special Appeals: <em>State Highway Admin. v. Greiner Eng\u2019g Sciences, </em>83 Md.App. 621, 577 A.2d 363 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.), cer<em>t. denied, </em>321 Md. 163, 582 A.2d 499 (1990); and <em>Boucher v. Riner, </em>68 Md.App. 539, 514 A.2d 485 (Md.Ct. Spec.App.1986). In <em>Greiner, </em>the court held that an unambiguous no-damage-for-delay clause was enforceable. Then the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-12\">This is not to say that unambiguous no-damage-for-delay clauses will be enforced in every case. The better reasoned approach does not enforce the exculpatory clause where there is \u201cintentional wrongdoing or gross negligence,\u201d \u201cfraud or misrepresentation,\u201d on the part of the agency asserting the clause. No such wrongdoings were alleged in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-13\"><em>Greiner, </em>577 A.2d at 372 (citations omitted). The earlier case, <em>Boucher, </em>involved a customer who sued the inaptly named \u201cParachutes Are Fun, Inc.\u201d after he parachuted into power lines. Boucher argued that the exculpatory agreement he signed did not shield Parachutes Are Fun from liability for gross negligence. The court agreed, holding that \u201c[a] waiver of a right to sue, such as the one executed between Boucher and Parachutes, is ineffective to shift the risk of a party\u2019s own willful, wanton, reckless, or gross conduct.\u201d <em>Boucher, </em>514 A.2d at 488. <em>Boucher </em>is a further indication that, under Maryland law, a party to a contract cannot waive liability for gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">Martin Marietta tries to distinguish <em>Boucher </em>in two ways. First, Martin Marietta argues that <em>Boucher </em>involved parties of unequal bargaining power. Boucher signed a standard preprinted form containing an exculpatory clause, while Martin Marietta and INTELSAT negotiated a complex agreement. In response, we note that the language in <em>Boucher </em>is broad and not limited to parties of unequal bargaining power, and that the facts and the court\u2019s language in <em>Greiner </em>also undercut Martin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Marietta\u2019s argument. Second, Martin Marietta argues that <em>Boucher </em>established a very high standard for gross negligence (wanton or reckless disregard) that the plaintiff failed to satisfy on facts more egregious than the facts in this case. However, there is no doubt that INTELSAT sufficiently alleged gross negligence so as to survive a 12(b)(6) motion. <em>See </em>Transcript of Oral Argument at 99, J.A. at 524. Whether INTELSAT convinces a jury that Martin Marietta was grossly negligent, or even survives summary judgment, is another question.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Although recognizing <em>Boucher </em>to be the law of Maryland, the district court held that Congressional intent, as reflected in the 1988 Amendments to the Commercial Space Launch Act (\u201cCSLA\u201d), 49 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 2601-2623, required the court to interpret the parties\u2019 contract to preclude claims of gross negligence. 763 F.Supp. at 1333-34. We find absolutely no support for the court\u2019s conclusion that the CSLA 1988 Amendments overrode <em>Boucher, </em>because the parties\u2019 contract was signed in 1987, more than one year before Congress passed the Amendments. Even if the CSLA Amendments could apply retroactively, neither the language of the Amendments nor their legislative history reflects a Congressional intent to protect parties from liability for their own gross negligence. Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in dismissing INTELSAT\u2019s gross negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">As we have upheld the dismissal of INTELSAT\u2019s negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims, but overturned the dismissal of INTELSAT\u2019s breach of contract and gross negligence claims, the judgment of the district court is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
